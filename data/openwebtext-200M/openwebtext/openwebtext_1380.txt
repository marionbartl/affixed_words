Hey everybody !!
in this post we will talk about the Linux installation but before we start let ’s see how does Linux deal with the hard disk .
Partitioning Scheme :-
First : the name of your hard disk is determined by the technology it uses and the way you connect it to your computer like that :-
ATA disk starts with ( hd )
SATA or the SCSI disks starts with ( sd ) .
But Fedora started to use ( sd ) for all HDDs starting from Fedora core 7 and UBUNTU also does that .
the next character is dedicated depending on your hard disk status so let ’s assume that you had an ATA HDD , the scheme will be like that :-
hda primary master
hdb primary slave
hdc secondary master
hdd secondary slave
now let ’s see how does the partitions names look like ?
The data about your partitions is stored in the first sector of your hard disk which called the MBR ( Master Boot Record ) in 64 bytes only which is only enough to fully describe just 4 partitions .
These partitions are called primary partitions and it takes number from 1 to 4 .
so lets assume that you have a primary master ATA disk then the partitions will look like that :-
hda1 the first primary partition
hda2 the second primary partition
hda3 the third primary partition
hda4 the fourth primary partition
if you need more partitions then you need to make an ( Extended partition ) which is a primary partition that is capable of holding other sub-partitions called ( Logical partitions ) .
Note : Theoretically you can make unlimited amount of logical partitions in the extended partition but Linux limits that number to 59 in the IDE disks and 11 in SCSI disks .
Logical partitions takes numbers starts from 5 . this means that ( hda5 ) is the first logical partition in your disk whatever the number of your primary partitions is and the second logical partition will be ( hd a6 ) etc .
In the graph we can see that :-
hda1 and hda2 are the first two primary partitions .
hda3 is also a primary partition but it is an extended partition which only holds two logical partitions ( hda5 and hda6 ) .
hda5 is the first logical partition in the disk so takes number 5 .
hda6 is the second logical partition in the disk so it takes number 6 .
hda4 is the fourth primary partition so it has no relations with the logical ones and it takes number 4 .
The root file system :-
Now let ’s see what is the requirements to install Linux .
At least you need one partition to install Linux and this partition will be called the root file system which holds your data or link to it .
So the root file system will be mounted as “ / “ ( slash ) , and all other partitions will be mounted under it like that
now “ dev ” will be called “ / dev ” and “ home ” will be “ / home ” etc . and we will speak about the functionality of these main directories later .
You also can make any main directory of those a separate file system ( partition ) and it will be mounted under the root file system “ / ” and it will look like any other directory .
That ’s may be useful in some cases which also will be discussed later .
the file system that should be created on that partition should be ( ext2 or ext3 ) file system but ext3 is more efficient .
SWAP area :-
You can start your installation with the root file system only , but if your RAM is small ( 256 M or less ) so you need to make a place to be considered as virtual memory .
This area must be a separate partition – unlike Windows – this partition use ’s the “ swap ” file system and it ’s size should be twice as much as your RAM size for the best performance .
Installation :-
Now we can start the installation and as we said before we will work on the three major distributions .
So we ca n’t be very verbose .
So let ’s speak about the most important and sensitive part of the installation which is Partitioning .
And the rest of the installation is simple and easy to understand if you read the tips carefully .
I recommend that you should have a backup of your important data because there are two kinds of people , people who make backups and people who never delete a file .
So , always have backups .
Lets Start Partitioning :
Partitioning ( with Debian based ) :-
let ’s start with the partitioning step on a Debian - Based distribution which is Ubuntu .
Ubuntu installation is so simple .
It consists of only 7 steps .
Now let ’s see how does the partitioning step looks like in Ubuntu installation .
Ubuntu offers you some choices to ease the partitioning step for you .
This steps are :-
use entire disk : will erase all partitions in your hard disk and create the default layout .
Use largest continues free space : will use the unpartitioned space only to create the default layout and it wo n’t touch any existed partition .
Manual ( for experts ) : let you decide what to do .
Sometimes there is an additional option ( Guided resize ) which enables you to resize a partition and use the generated space to create the default layout , but this option is slower and it may become very slow depending on the partition size .
Let ’s pick the ( manual ) option and decide what to do .
As we see , there are some buttons that enables you to edit you partitions .
Your partitions will be listed in front of you using the schema that we have just spoke about .
You can delete a partition and use the free space that will be available by selecting the partition and press ( delete partition ) .
Then you can create a new partition by selecting the free space then click ( new partition ) .
As you see in the previous picture there is field to write the desired space in Megabytes ( it ’s recommended if you use only one partition to make it 5 Gigabytes or more ) .
The next field is “ use as ” , which represent the file system you want to make on this partition .
Let ’s choose “ EXT3 journaling file system ” .
The last field is the “ mount point ” , this will dedicate what will the partition be used for .
So we first need to make a root file system which will use the mount point “ / ” .
you can also make the “ / home ” or “ / var ” etc , a separate file system .
Look at this picture and see the options we used to make a root file system uses the “ / ” as amount point and using EXT3 file system .
Now the next step is to make a “ swap ” area to be used as virtual memory .
So , we will do the same but using the file system ( use as ) “ swap area ” , and there will be no mount point for the swap area , and remember that the swap area ’s size should be twice as much as your RAM size for the best performance .
See the picture here .
Now we will see our two partitions listed which are the root file system “ / ” and the swap area , now we can proceed with the installation by clicking “ forward ” .
The partitioning step is the most sensitive step in any Linux installation , in the Ubuntu installation you can just read the instructions and you will find everything easy .
Partitioning ( with Red hat based ) :-
the red hat based distribution that we will use is Fedora .
Fedora installation could be done in several ways from : CD / DVD , Local Hard Drive , NFS ( Network File Share ) server , Samba ( Windows Share ) server , FTP server , HTTP server .
We will talk about the CD / DVD installation .
And also we will focus on the partitioning step because it ’s the most sensitive step in the installation and we will let you experience the other steps alone :D , you have to read the instructions carefully and go on .
You will answer some dialogs till you reach the partitioning step .
The partitioner that Fedora uses is called Disk Druid and it ’s really powerful and simple , and it has 5 options for partitioning which are :-
Remove all partitions and create default layout : this will delete all partitions and create the default layout .
Remove Linux partitions and create default layout : this will delete only the Linux partitions ( if you have a previous Linux installation ) and wo n’t touch any other operating system ’s partitions then will create the default layout on the generated free space .
Resize existing partition and create custom layout .
Use free space and create custom layout : use only free space to create custom layout and wo n’t touch any existing partition .
Create custom layout : let you decide what to do .
Let ’s choose create custom layout .
You will see a simple interface includes buttons to create , delete or edit a partition .
We will do the same as we did in Ubuntu .
We will make a root file system that will use Ext3 file system and will use the “ / ” mount point .
Then we will create a swap file system to be used as virtual memory , it will be twice as much as you RAM size , it will use swap file system and it does n’t have a mount point .
Notice that in “ fedora core 9 ” you will see the option “ Encrypt ” which makes all the data written on this partition encrypted , this is useful for security but it ’s not necessary .
Also notice that this partitioner also have option called “ fill to maximum allowable space ” which uses all the free continues free space for this partition .
Now I will leave you with some images of the fedora partitioner “ Disk Druid ”
Package selecting ( in Fedora ) :-
the next important step in Fedora installation is package selecting .
It has two options .
Customize later : start the installation with the default packages and customize packages after installation .
Customize now : enables you to choose desired packages to be installed now .
Let ’s choose customize now option .
Now you can choose the packages desired on your system .
You can find the summary for each package selected in the white box in the center of the window .
Now we should be able to perform a Linux installation on our machine , we covered the Red Hat based distros and Debian based distros in this post and we are sorry for not covering Slackware distros now but we will try to cover it later .
Thanks for reading and keep freaks till the next post .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) - Desperate Haitians turned rubble - strewn streets and parks into makeshift hospitals and refugee camps on Thursday in the absence of any noticeable response from authorities in Haiti after Tuesday ’s earthquake .
With the 7.0 magnitude earthquake collapsing the presidential palace , a string of ministries and the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country , Haiti faces a dangerous vacuum in security and government .
The Caribbean nation of 9 million people , the poorest in the western hemisphere , has a turbulent history of conflict , social turmoil , dictatorship , fragile institutions and devastating natural catastrophes .
Many in the capital Port - au - Prince picked away at shattered buildings with bare hands , sticks and hammers hoping to find loved - ones alive .
Thousands of homeless people began to set up their own camps anywhere they could , the biggest right opposite the collapsed presidential palace .
“ Look at us .
Who is helping us ?
Right now , nobody , ” said Jean Malesta , a 19 - year - old student who was the only survivor when her apartment building collapsed from the powerful quake that has killed thousands , possibly tens of thousands .
She and a dozen others lay under a tent they had set up in the park opposite President Rene Preval ’s palace .
His weak and under - resourced government appears totally unequipped to handle the crisis , its officials in disarray and nowhere to be seen .
‘ WE ARE ON OUR OWN ’
“ So far , they have brought us nothing .
We need water , food , shelter , everything , but we are on our own , ” Malesta added , to cries of agreement from women sitting and lying around her .
A major international aid effort has not yet kicked in , although plenty of small groups , many from the United States , have scrambled quickly , moving personnel into Haiti by plane and overland from neighboring Dominican Republic .

“ The problem is that unlike traditional disaster situations we have few local partners to work with , because most of them have had their buildings destroyed and are looking for their own dead and missing , ” said Margaret Aguirre , a senior official with International Medical Corps .
Haitians are doing their best to survive chaotic conditions in the absence of any clear leadership , said Latin America expert Dan Erikson of the Washington - based Inter - American Dialogue think tank .
“ The sad truth is that no one is in charge of Haiti today .
This vacuum , coupled with the robust response from the Obama administration , has inevitably created a situation where the U.S. will be the de facto decision - maker in Haiti . ”
Even President Rene Preval lost his home .
“ My palace collapsed .
... I ca n’t live in the palace , I ca n’t live in my own house , ” he told CNN on Wednesday .
The 9,000 - strong U.N. peacekeeping force , which might have been able to step into the void , has been left counting its own dead after its headquarters were destroyed in the quake .
The United Nations said 36 of its personnel in Haiti had been killed and many more were still missing .
Peacekeepers occasionally patrolled the city in buses and trucks and have mobilized some heavy earth - moving equipment but the blue - helmet soldiers have largely stayed off the streets .
Underlying the growing sense of chaos and abandonment around the half - destroyed coastal capital Port - au - Prince , some looting began -- a phenomenon Haitians have seen many times before in past political crises .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
At one crushed supermarket , young men calmly carried off bags of food and electronics without a policemen in sight .
Pickup trucks stacked high with bodies could be seen making their way through traffic - clogged streets on Thursday morning , on their way to drop off the dead at the morgue attached to Hospital General , the city ’s main health facility .
But Guy LaRoche , the hospital ’s director , said it was already filled to overflowing with more than 1,500 rapidly decomposing bodies .
Many had been left lying out in the sun .
LaRoche said he had had no contact with any government officials to see what to do with them .
LOOMING HEALTH THREAT
“ I ’m awaiting the decision of the government .
What else can I do ? ” he said .
“ The health threat , from disease , could be another catastrophe .
We need nurses , medical teams , more of everything . ”
Around the city , many Haitians put rags and masks over their faces as the stench from rotting bodies began to rise .
Crushed cars and vans stuck out of collapsed buildings , while children ’s toys , shoes and papers were scattered on streets .
In poor areas , there was little sign of any coordinated rescue activities .
“ I think 50 percent of the city is destroyed , ” said Vladimir Rousseau , a 32 - year - old diesel engineer , in the hard - hit Carrefour district .
Reuters witnesses saw some city blocks completely leveled , though in other areas the damage was more patchy .
In the upscale , hilltop Petionville sector , a Chilean contingent of U.N. peacekeepers -- many of whom arrived only last week and looked stunned at events -- were helping excavate rubble at the landmark Hotel Montana , which collapsed .
They said they had pulled out 14 people alive already , foreign customers and local workers alike , and thought there were dozens more underneath the stones .
“ There is no one in our country capable of sorting this out .
Everyone is looking after their own families .
Only the world can come to our rescue , ” said shop owner Edner Baptiste .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , pledging U.S. help for Haiti ’s crippled government , said : “ The authorities that existed before the earthquake are not able to fully function . ”
If passed , something called the Digital Economy Bill over in the U.K. could do the unthinkable in this , the digital age : Ban open wifi spots .
Advertisement
The ban comes as part of a bill that seeks to limit copyright infringement , or something .
In summary , schools , small businesses and even libraries would have to effectively become their own ISP and manage the wifi hotspot — or face hefty fines .
Even if a shop password - protected their wifi and posted the PW publicly ( as they probably should be doing anyway ) , this " management " would also entail detailed record keeping , as the bill requires that hotspot providers log users who 've been on their network .
Sounds fun !
I 'd love for any UK - based small business owners to weigh in on this debate , and the bill .
Is it really as annoying as the ZDNet article makes it sound ?
Are daily , detailed user records really too much a burden for the corner coffee shop to bear ?
Light those torches and brandish your pitchforks in the comments !

Everything from simple tools to complete factories is available for export from the US and Europe to the developing world .
At first site , such " recycling " of equipment sounds laudable , but a European research team argues in a forthcoming issue of the International Journal of Global Environmental Issues that such exports are slowing the adoption of more environmentally friendly and non-polluting technology across the globe .
Luisito Bertinelli and Benteng Zou of the University of Luxembourg working with Eric Strobl of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris have compared old and new technologies and the pollution they cause in the developing world .
The trade in old tools and equipment has to some extent been responsible for growth over the last few years in the developing world .
Indeed , a lack of capital has meant that many less developed countries could gain access to technology that would otherwise be unavailable .
The team points out that older technologies are usually more labour intensive because they are less automated and often require more maintenance .
More worryingly though , the team 's findings suggest that the import of older technologies not only prolongs the period until pollution levels can be decreased but also raises the baseline level of pollution .
This point is not lost in the current climate debate where the issue of rising carbon emissions in the developing world is a moot point .
" We set forth to model how the decision to adopt older and dirtier technologies affects the relationship between economic development and pollution , " the team says .
They have done so using an economic system known as a vintage capital structure , which looks at the various resources and the pollution levels .
Unlike other models , their approach considers the decision of when to replace obsolete with newer technologies and how this may affect pollution .
" If one assumes that older technologies are more environmentally unfriendly , then the decision of when to scrap these and what type of technology ( i.e. , used or new ) to adopt [ in their place ] is likely to be an important determinant of the extent of pollution generation , " the team says .
The team argues that the results have important policy implications .
Recourse to older technologies may serve short - term economic goals in developing countries but will have longer term consequences , including higher rates of pollution and delays in reaching a sustainable growth phase .
" Pressures put on developing countries in order to reduce their barriers to imports of used goods should thus be balanced against the costs of supplementary pollution that the use of older technology will induce , " the team concludes .

Not all gamers spend hours a day in front of the TV .
The majority of gamers only play every so often and does not own an extensive collection of games .
These type of players usually prefer games that can be played for short periods at a time and generally avoid games that require them to become a master of the controls .
Marvel : Ultimate Alliance 2 is a prime example of that type .
● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
Shooter Fans : Halo 3 : ODST and Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2
Though Halo 3 : ODST is a first - person shooter ( which are generally found to be a hard genre to master for newcomers , ) it also includes many different difficulty levels .
Though the story of the game ties in with the rest of the Halo series , players who are unfamiliar with the other installments in the series will find little difficulty understanding what is going on .
Halo 3 : ODST also contains a second game disc that includes the full multiplayer experience of Halo 3 , which is one of the most popular games available online .
If you have a friend or family member you wish to turn into a gaming fanatic , Halo 3 : ODST might be the best place to start .
● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 puts you in the body of several different soldiers across the globe as they try to stop Makarov ’s terrorist agency .

While this Holiday has great games in store across the board , the Xbox 360 has managed to carve out of the most envied back catalogs of this or any previous generation of video game consoles .
These older releases are a haven for all shoppers , their reduced price making bargains inevitable , and many games having escaped the attention they deserved under the flood of amazing software the 360 has seen these past four years .
Within all of these prior releases lay prismatic beacons of gameplay excellence , games that need to be in the disc tray of every single system at least once in this generation .
Stocking Stuffers ( Great Games For $ 20 Or Less ) :
Mass Effect , Viva Piñata , Lips , Shadow Complex , Castle Crashers , The Orange Box
● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
Games that Xbox 360 fans should have :
Fable 2 , Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion : Game of the Year Edition , Gears of War 2 , Castle Crashers , Fallout 3 : Game of the Year Edition , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , Grand Theft Auto IV
● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
Other services that Xbox 360 fans should have :
The Xbox Dashboard is leading the console charge in providing additional , alternative services to expand the at - home gaming experience .
With social networks Facebook and Twitter making their way to the system , and music video streaming Last . fm making HD tunes and customizable radio stations just a few clicks away , it ’s hard to settle on just one service that all gamers should take time to check out .
In the end , it was the most lauded service that got Elder - Geek ’s vote .

New grading system for county teachers : Critics say tool , known as AIM , is cumbersome , not useful
Dec 27 , 2009 ( The Baltimore Sun - McClatchy - Tribune Information Services via COMTEX ) --
Baltimore County school administrators have ordered all teachers to begin using a grading system next month that will require them to judge whether each of their students has mastered more than 100 specific skills .
The decision , which was made by top administrators last week and communicated to teachers by their principals last Thursday and Friday , is opposed by the teachers union and dozens of teachers who say it is cumbersome and time - consuming and will not be a useful tool .
The system , known as Articulated Instruction Module or AIM , was designed by a longtime school system employee and had been implemented sporadically in the past several months , although it was supposed to be mandatory throughout the county .
Barbara Dezmon , assistant to the superintendent for equity and assurance and AIM 's inventor , said top administrators decided to require each teacher to comply with using the system by the end of the second marking period in late January .
" We finally [ can ] tell students and parents what they know and what they do n't know , " Dezmon said .
Students will continue to receive their report cards every quarter , but the AIM report will provide precise information on what skills each student either has not learned , is in the process of learning or has learned .
Teachers must give students an A ( needs Acceleration , or remedial help ) , I ( needs further Instruction ) or M ( has Mastered ) for each category .
Dezmon said she created the tool after she saw that some minority students were not receiving the same education in southwestern area schools as they were in the northern part of the county .
AIM has been supported by Superintendent Joe Hairston , and although he was out sick the day the decision was made last week , he was aware and supportive of it , according to Charles Herndon , a spokesman .
" I do n't see how I could possibly have time to do this unless I took the day off , " said Ruth Rodowsky , a teacher at Middleborough Elementary School .
She said most teachers in her school work 12 - hour days and are always willing to do anything they believe will increase achievement .
But , she said , AIM " serves no purpose . "
Another teacher said she believes it would take up many hours of her valuable planning time to complete the checklists for each student .
" Our students will begin to suffer because their teachers will be so burned out and barely able to keep up with all of the recordkeeping , " said Carrie Wheeler , a Fullerton Elementary School teacher who said she has supported most of the county 's new initiatives .
The teachers union president , Cheryl Bost , said Hairston has not been responsive to the union 's request to meet to discuss streamlining AIM to reduce the workload .
Use of AIM was originally supposed to be voluntary , but the district made it mandatory beginning this fall , according to Dezmon .
AIM is available to be viewed on the Baltimore County Public Schools Web site .
It shows that elementary school teachers , who often have classes of up to 25 students , will have to judge each of their students on whether they have mastered more than a hundred skills in as many subjects as they teach .
In high schools , where some teachers can have more than 100 students , the task will be no less complicated , teachers say .
Over the course of a year , many teachers would have to make as many as 10,000 marks indicating whether a child had learned a task .
For instance , a third - grade teacher would have to determine whether a child has dozens of skills , including the ability to " apply phonics skills to decode words with hard and soft consonants and 2 - letter initial consonant blends . "
And in middle school math , one of the skills listed says , " analyze and describe non-linear functions using the vocabulary of appearance . "
Some art and music teachers and librarians who only see students once a week may have difficulty gauging whether 350 or 400 students have learned specific skills , Bost said .
Bost argues that while AIM is designed to help parents understand what their children know , many of the items are unintelligible to anyone who does not know educational jargon .
Dezmon acknowledges that some of the items are in jargon , but says teachers and administrators should explain them so that parents understand .
She said the value in the program is that school administrators can look at the thousands of pieces of data and find out where the teaching is not effective so they can correct problems .
Herndon said he believes that the teachers who have complained are in the minority .
" We feel our teachers are up to the task .
We think very highly of the teachers ; we think they are capable , " he said .
Brian Scriven , principal of Woodlawn High School , said despite the " rumblings " through the county , he believes the program is a good one .
" The key is that it is an awesome tool in terms of parents and students knowing where they are , " he said .

Marine Corps Concerned About ' Jesus Guns , ' Will Meet With Trijicon Marines will meet with maker of gun sights inscribed with secret Bible code .
Jan. 19 , 2010  -- Following an ABC
News report that thousands of gun sights used by the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan are inscribed with secret Bible references , a spokesperson for the Marine Corps said the Corps is ' concerned ' and will discuss the matter with the weapons manufacturer .
" We are aware of the issue and are concerned with how this may be perceived , " Capt .
Geraldine Carey , a spokesperson for the Marine Corps , said in a statement to ABC News .
" We will meet with the vendor to discuss future sight procurements . "
Carey said that when the initial deal was made in 2005 it was the only product that met the Corps needs .
However , a spokesperson for CentCom , the U.S. military 's overall command in Iraq and Afghanistan , said he did not understand why the issue was any different from U.S. money with religious inscriptions on it .
" The perfect parallel that I see , " said Maj .
John Redfield , spokesperson for CentCom , told ABC News , " is between the statement that 's on the back of our dollar bills , which is ' In God We Trust , ' and we have n't moved away from that . "
Said Redfield , " Unless the equipment that 's being used that has these inscriptions proved to be less than effective for soldiers , sailors , airmen , Marines and military folks using it , I would n't see why we would stop using that . "
A spokesperson for the Army told ABC News that the Army was looking into the procurement " to see if anything is amiss here .
We are still checking . "
As ABC News reported Monday , the sights are used by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the training of Iraqi and Afghan soldiers .
The maker of the sights , Trijicon , has a $ 660 million multi-year contract to provide up to 800,000 sights to the Marine Corps , and additional contracts to provide sights to the U.S. Army .
U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious " Crusade " in its war against al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents .
' This Does Not Constitute Proselytizing '
One of the citations on the gun sights , 2COR4:6 , is an apparent reference to Second Corinthians 4:6 of the New Testament , which reads : " For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . "
Other references include citations from the books of Revelation , Matthew and John dealing with Jesus as " the light of the world . "
John 8:12 , referred to on the gun sights as JN8:12 , reads , " Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
Trijicon confirmed to ABCNews.com that it adds the biblical codes to the sights sold to the U.S. military .
Tom Munson , director of sales and marketing for Trijicon , which is based in Wixom , Michigan , said the inscriptions " have always been there " and said there was nothing wrong or illegal with adding them .
Munson said the issue was being raised by a group that is " not Christian . "
The company has said the practice began under its founder , Glyn Bindon , a devout Christian from South Africa who was killed in a 2003 plane crash .
On Monday , spokespeople for the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps both told ABC News their services were unaware of the biblical markings .
On Tuesday , Redfield of CentCom told ABC News that the inscriptions did not violate the directive against proselytizing .
" This does not constitute proselytizing because this equipment is not issued beyond the U.S. Defense Department personnel .
It 's not something we 're giving away to the local folks . "
But ABC
News was able to find repeated references to the Biblical citations in on - line discussions of the gun sights .
In August 2009 , a poster named " Latex Ducky " tells other posters on a forum for firearm enthusiasts called " The Firing Line " about the inscriptions .
" Here 's something interesting :
There should be a reference to a Bible verse on the base of the scope . "
Back in 2006 , on a self - described " Armageddon Forum , " a number of users discuss the Bible references .
" Seems there 's a different verse on each model , " writes Mr45 auto .
" They chose some whoppers too ! "
After the Blotter 's report Monday morning , the TPM Muckraker news Web site listed numerous references to the Trijicon Bible codes on - line dating back several years , including a January 2006 thread on a gaming forum that said " DoD contractor puts bible verses on it's ( sic ) products . "
In May of 2006 , a poster on Militaryphotos .
net began a comment thread by asking , " Has anyone ever noticed the Bible verse on their ACOG sight ? "
Another user responds , " Yeah I read about that recently , but I did n't know there were than many different verses on all the different optics . "
A video on YouTube that discusses the Bible verses had close to 20,000 views .
" One of the really cool things that I like about this sight , " says the maker of the video , is the Bible verse .
" It says JN8:12 .
What that is is John 8:12 . "
" I love it .
I love it .
Yes , Trijicon , those guys are Christians .
On all of their different sights they have verses on there . "
" For those of you who are n't Christians , well , you know , get over it . "
In another video , the same YouTube user notes the reference to Second Corinthians on a Trijicon scope .
' They Should Fix Them All '
" It 's wrong , it violates the Constitution , it violates a number of federal laws , " said Michael " Mikey " Weinstein of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , an advocacy group that seeks to preserve the separation of church and state in the military .
Weinstein , an attorney and former Air Force officer , said many members of his group who currently serve in the military have complained about the markings on the sights .
He also claims they 've told him that commanders have referred to weapons with the sights as " spiritually transformed firearm [s ] of Jesus Christ . "
Weinstein said coded biblical inscriptions play into the hands of those who call the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan " a Crusade . "
Retired Army Major General William Nash , now an ABC News consultant , said he had " no problem " with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to U.S. troops .
" But I do have a problem , " said Nash , " with military equipment being labeled in a way where it seems like it 's our god against their god . "
Nash , who commanded the first brigade of the third armored division during Desert Storm in Iraq , said the Pentagon should make Trijicon remove the Bible codes from their sights .
Said Nash , " They should fix them all , they should do a modification on those sights and take off those inscriptions .
And if they fail to do that they should be penalized . "

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Richard Shelby , R- Tuscaloosa , is blocking Senate action on executive branch nominations , a spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said this afternoon in an e-mail .
In response to a question from the Press - Register , Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle confirmed that Shelby has placed a " blanket hold " on most pending nominations .
By placing a hold , a single senator can stop the Senate from voting on a particular nomination , often as a way of gaining leverage on an unrelated issue .
It is not clear when Shelby placed the hold or how many nominees are affected .
While individual holds are not unusual , Gary Jacobson , a congressional expert at the University of California at San Diego , said he knew of no previous use of a blanket hold .
Shelby spokesman Jonathan Graffeo did not immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking confirmation of the senator 's action or his reason for doing so .
Holds can be overcome , but it takes 60 votes in the 100 - member Senate .
While tradition - bound senators are typically reluctant to take that step , they did so Thursday in voting to confirm nominees to the Labor Department and the General Services Administration .
( For a complete report , see Friday 's Press - Register . )

The recently crowned world 's tallest man , Sultan Kosen , meets the man who currently holds the title of the world 's smallest man —
He Pingping .
The Turkish farm laborer , Kosen , with height 246.5 cm ( 8 ft 1 in ) took over the title from Bao Xishun back in September , beating his Chinese rival by an incredible 10 cm .
The two — Kosen and Pingping — met at a ceremony in Istanbul on Thursday , January 14 , to mark the launch of the Guinness World Records live Roadshow .
The tallest man in the world , welcoming the shortest man in the world to his country , said that " I was having hard times to notice him . "
The 21 - year - old 73.66 - centimeter ( 2 ft 5 in ) tall , who hails from China , said that he was happy to meet with Kosen .
He Pingping is facing a potential challenge to his title , as his fellow countryman Wu Kang is applying to Guinness World Records , saying is under 68.58 cm ( 2 ft 3 in ) .
However ,
Wu is also considering hormone therapy which could increase his stature .

Specific methods were developed to ensure high reliability and high disk I /O bandwidth .
The same ideas can be applied to other fields such as video streaming or data base access .
The whole computation is an extensive test for a computer including its CPU , RAM , disk storage and cooling system .
A single bit error during the computation gives a bad result .
A bad cooling results in a hardware failure .
My computation used a single Core i7 Quad Core CPU at 2.93 GHz giving a peak processing power of 46.9 Gflops .
So the supercomputer is about 2000 times faster than my computer .
However , my computation lasted 116 days , which is 96 times slower than the supercomputer for about the same number of digits .
So my computation is roughly 20 times more efficient .
It can be explained by the following facts :
The Pi computation is I / O bound , so it needs very high communication speed between the nodes on a parallel supercomputer .
So the full power of the supercomputer cannot really be used .
The algorithm I used ( Chudnovsky series evaluated using the binary splitting algorithm ) is asymptotically slower than the Arithmetic - Geometric Mean algorithm used by Daisuke Takahashi , but it makes a more efficient use of the various CPU caches , so in practice it can be faster .
Moreover , some mathematical tricks were used to speed up the binary splitting .

Tuesday afternoon , Dr. Louise Ivers , an infectious disease specialist at Harvard Medical School , was at a meeting of the World Food Program in a United Nations building in Port - au - Prince when the earthquake hit .
She escaped to the building ’s driveway unharmed .
Within minutes of her arrival 350 injured Haitians gathered in her driveway , looking for medical help .
Ivers was the only doctor .
“ It was overwhelming , ” she says .
“ Several people bled to death while I tried to treat them .
One girl ’s skin was ripped off her hand and forearm , and you could see all the muscles and tendons .
Then a father handed me a baby who was minutes away from dying , and I had to say ‘ I ’m sorry , there ’s nothing I can do . ’ ”
Ivers , the country director for Haiti for Partners in Health and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard , got to work .
She and Kim Cullen , her research assistant , set out to find materials they could turn into medical supplies .
“ We ripped license plates off cars to use as splints .
We took shirts off of people to use as tourniquets , ” Ivers says .
Early the next morning , Ivers heard about a makeshift clinic with about fifty patients in a tent on the United Nations compound next to the
Port - au - Prince airport .
She gathered together about 100 of the injured people she ’d been treating , and set out for the clinic .
“ I thought this was going to be an actual clinic with doctors , ” she says .
“ But when I got there , I asked who was in charge , and someone said ‘ Toi’ – you , you ’re in charge .
I said , ‘ Really ? ’ ”
Again , she was the only doctor .
About fifty more patients arrived that night , bringing the total to about 200 .
A few physicians came and went for short periods , but she was basically on her own .
“ It was overwhelming , the amount of trauma and injuries .
I ’ve worked in Haiti for seven years and I ’ve never seen such suffering , ” Ivers says .
“ To be a human being and see such suffering is bad enough , but to be a doctor and have no tools , no pain medication , is a horrible , horrible feeling . ”
Finally , Wednesday at 5 pm , help arrived in the form of Dr. Enrique Ginzburg and Dr. Daniel Pust , trauma surgeons from the University of Miami .
“ For the first time , I thought to myself , ‘ maybe these people have a chance , ’ ” she says .
At 2 am Thursday , Ivers rested .
She ’d gone 48 hours without sleeping , eating , or even sitting down .
How did she handle being the only doc ?
“ I do n’t know , ” she says .
“ I think automatic mode kicks in . ”

Celebrated science fiction author Jack Vance has written over 60 novels during his career , accumulated numerous prestigious awards for his work , and in 1997 was named a Grand Master by the SFWA .
However it ’s good to know that such acclaim has n’t affected his good nature , as can be seen in this reply to a piece of fan - mail in 1999 ; specifically point number five .
Indeed ,
Vance kept to his word and in 2004 when his new novel – Lurulu – was eventually released , a delighted Hans van der Veeke found his name inside :
An omnibus conveyed the four men along a scenic boulevard to the central plaza : an immaculate area , paved with slabs of polished granite .
At the center , fountains played around the base of a heroic statue celebrating the legendary locator Hans van der Veeke who had first set foot upon the world Archimbal .
He was depicted wearing a black frock coat and a flat black hat .
His pose was portentous , with one great arm raised on high , saluting generations of the future .

I rely more on my voice synthesizer box .
2. I use Holland occasionally , when mentioning Old Earth , because I ’m familiar with it .
3 . I had to give up the mystery genre because the books were not making any money ; Science Fiction did better .
4 . My health is improved , but I ’m not currently planning any visits to Holland .
Thanks for your offer to show me around the north .
5 . I will include your name in my present work .
Sincerely , Jack Vance

Recently by Gary North : The Federal Reserve Paid the Federal Government $ 46 Billion in 2009 .
The FED Seeks Control , Not Profits .
Two Bank of England economists have written one of the most perceptive and forthright papers in the history of central banking : “ Banking on the State . ”
Compared with any of the dozens of deadly dull , equation - filled , narrowly focused , recommendation - avoiding , career - enhancing , résumé - padding , utterly useless academic exercises published in the dozen regional Federal Reserve bank journals every month , this paper stands out like a diamond in an immense dung hill .
The authors offer a simple thesis : the modern nation - state has become the lender of last resort to the banks rather than the banks serving as the lenders of last resort to the state .
The title reveals the thesis .
The common phrase , “ you can bank on it , ” describes the new reality .
The big banks have banked on the intervention of the nation - state to protect them from economic forces that would threaten their solvency and therefore their survival .
This constitutes a great reversal .
For the past two centuries , the tables have progressively turned .
The state has instead become the last - resort financier of the banks .
As with the state , banks ’ needs have typically been greatest at times of financial crisis .
And like the state , last - resort financing has not always been repaid in full and on time .
The Great Depression marked a regime - shift in state support to the banking system .
The credit crisis of the past two years may well mark another ( p. 1 ) .
This initial reversal took place during the Napoleonic wars two centuries ago .
They mention no cause .
GOLDEN SHACKLES
There was a cause : the abolition of the domestic gold standard by Great Britain .
British Treasury notes replaced gold as the basis of the reserves of the Bank of England .
The domestic gold coin standard was restored in 1821 .
The next great shift took place in the Great Depression .
It has accelerated ever since .
What took place in the Great Depression ?
The authors do not ask .
England went off the gold standard in 1931 .
The United States went off the domestic gold standard in 1933 .
From that point on , only the United Stares agreed to exchange gold for dollars at a fixed price : $ 20 / oz for the remainder of 1933 , and $ 35 / oz beginning in 1934 .
It made this agreement only with foreign governments and central banks .
It was an agreement within a cartel .
The paper says that the banking system became far more leveraged in the 1970’s .
Again , it mentions no cause .
There was one : the unilateral decision of Richard Nixon to cease honoring the American government ’s promise to redeem gold at $ 35 per ounce as of Sunday , August 15 , 1971 .
He simultaneously floated the dollar : no more fixed exchange rates ( government - imposed price controls on currencies ) .
That two - fold broken contract — an agreement among an international cartel of central banks — released modern central banking from the last remaining contractual restraints on the expansion of central bank reserves .
The results were predictable .
A tiny band of pro-gold economists and newsletter forecasters were the only ones who predicted these results .
Governments ran huge deficits , central banks expanded their holdings of government debt , monetary inflation became widespread , and the boom - bust business cycle , explained by Ludwig von Mises as early as 1912 , led to ever - greater banking crises around the world .
Keynesian economists in the mid-1960 ’s hailed the end of major recessions .
Major recessions in the United States in 1970 — 71 , 1975 , 1980 , and 1981 — 2 were accompanied by price inflation , high unemployment , and financial losses .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 995 on February 9 , 1966 .
It had risen above 1,000 for the first time earlier in the day .
It bottomed at 777 on Friday , August 13 , 1982 , eleven years to the weekend after Nixon ’s announcement .
In the meantime , the purchasing power of the dollar had fallen by over two - thirds .
But I digress .
The authors do not identify national central banks as the sources of the expansion of domestic bank reserves .
Such an admission would have constituted biting the hand that fed them .
The paper was first delivered at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago .
Everyone in the audience was well aware of the relationship between central bank reserves , the legal reserve ratio , and commercial bank liquidity .
The authors did not have to state the obvious .
Of course , this is not obvious to the general public .
That , too , has long been part of the cartel ’s working arrangement with the national governments that have established the cartel , nation by nation .
HOW BAD IS IT ?
The authors point out that government intervention to support the banks in 2008 — 9 in the UK , Euro zone , and USA was $ 14 trillion .
This was the equivalent of a quarter of global GDP .
This was the largest intervention in history .
In some cases , the cost of insuring against default is higher for some G - 7 nations than for McDonalds or Campbell Soup .
In the Middle Ages , as in the early modern period , the greatest risk to the banks was the default of the sovereign king who had borrowed the money for affairs of state .
“ Today , perhaps the biggest risk to the sovereign comes from the banks .
Causality has reversed ” ( p. 2 ) .
For over a century , every time the large banks have experienced a crisis , the state has extended a safety net .
This safety net is never withdrawn .
It only gets more bent out of shape , “ like over - stretched elastic ” ( p. 2 ) .
With each extension of protection , the bankers assure the public that this is the last time .
It never is .
The paper explains why .
Today , there are reform proposals .
The authors do not say that these cannot work .
It is clear from their paper that reform has not worked before .
Indeed , with each extension of protection and regulation , the bankers find ways to work around the law and make the system pay .
The authors have a phrase for this : “ gaming the state . ”
In the UK , from 1880 — 1970 , bank balance sheets ( loans ) remained fairly stable : about 50 % of GDP .
In the early 1970 ’s , this changed .
By 2000 , the ratio of balance sheets to annual GDP was 5 - to - 1 ( p. 3 ) .
This was an increase in the ratio by a factor of ten : 50 % to 500 % .
Something fundamental had changed .
From 1900 to 2000 , capital ratios in the USA and UK fell by a factor of five .
This means that the banks ’ capital supported five times the loan amount .
Liquidity ratios — instantly marketable assets on hand — also declined by a factor of five .
This happened in half a century ( p. 3 ) .
The banks started getting more bang for their bucks .
But one year ’s profitable bang can become next year ’s explosion of losses .
Leverage is a door that swings both ways .
Bank investors started cleaning up after 1970 .
As banks moved up the risk spectrum , the return required by shareholders has predictably increased .
Between 1920 and 1970 , the return on UK banks ’ equity averaged below 10 % per annum , with low volatility of around 2 % per year .
This was roughly in line with risks and returns in the non-financial economy .
The 1970s signalled a sea-change .
Since then returns on UK banks ’ equity have averaged over 20 % .
Immediately prior to the crisis , returns were close to 30 % .
The natural bedfellow to higher return is higher risk .
And so it was , with the volatility of UK banks ’ returns having trebled over the past forty years ( pp. 3—4 ) .
I think of the punch line of a children ’s poem .
“ When she was good , she was very , very good , but when she was bad , she was horrid . ”
In 2008 , the banks ’ returns became horrid .
In response , the Bank of England since 2007 has increased the base money supply by a factor of four .
The last time this happened was in 1825 , during a major crisis .
Then there were asset swaps .
They were gracious enough not to describe these as toxic assets .
There were also guarantees of liabilities .
They did not mention the Treasury ’s guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds .
Together , the swaps and the guarantees in the UK , Euro region , and the USA ranged between 10 % and 40 % of GDP ( p. 5 ) .
Here is the problem .
“ This is a repeated game .
State support stokes future risk - taking incentives , as owners of banks adapt their strategies to maximize expected profits .
So it was in the run-up to the present crisis ” ( p. 8 ) .
There are five areas where this is accomplished :
1. Higher leverage ( lower capital ratios ) 2 .

Because bankers know the government will bail them out , they increase their risks .
When times are good , they get rich .
When the market moves against them , they get bailed out .
This is what economists call an asymmetric relationship .
Beginning in the nineteenth century , economists and critics of the schemes of bank protection by the state named this phenomenon : moral hazard .
The phrase became common .
This is just about the only example of economists ’ showing any concern about morality in economic analysis .
The authors offer a far better description : doom loop .
THE DOOM LOOP
There are two general gaming strategies that produce high profits for banks .
The authors name them : ( 1 ) doom loop ; ( 2 ) St. Petersburg paradox .
These five strategies are the latest incarnation of efforts by the banking system to boost shareholder returns and , whether by accident or design , game the state .
For the authorities , it poses a dilemma .
Ex-ante [ beforehand — G.N. ] , they may well say “ never again . ”
But the ex-post [ hangover — G.N. ] costs of crisis mean such a statement lacks credibility .
Knowing this , the rational response by market participants is to double their bets .
This adds to the cost of future crises .
And the larger these costs , the lower the credibility of “ never again ” announcements .
This is a doom loop .
The “ St Petersburg paradox ” explains how a gambling strategy which starts small but then doubles - up in the event of a loss can yield positive ( indeed , potentially infinite ) expected returns .
Provided , that is , the gambler has the resources to double - up in the face of a losing streak .
The St Petersburg lottery has many similarities with the game played between the state and the banks over the past century or so .
The banks have repeatedly doubled - up .
And the state has underwritten any losing streak .
Clearer practical examples of a policy time - consistency problem are unlikely to exist ( p. 11 ) .
The authors suggest several possible reforms , none of which is likely .
One is to introduce leverage limits on banks .
This is easy , they say .
Is it ?
They say that leverage limits operate in Canada and the USA .
But what good have they done ?
“ We have sleepwalked into a world in which leverage of 20 or 30 times capital is the rule rather than the exception ” ( p. 12 ) .
Here is the problem , which they do not mention : the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
The financial system was bailed out in 2008 and 2009 by means of gigantic increases in the monetary bases .
This expansion awaits only a decrease in excess reserves to double the money supply in the USA .
In the UK , it will quadruple .
Governments are on the hook for huge liabilities .
These are tied to the most leveraged market of all : residential real estate .
In the USA and the UK , these markets will fall if the support is removed .
Bernanke says the FED will end the purchases of Fannie / Freddie bonds on April 1 , 2010 .
Then what ?
The authors refer to the Basel accords : rules limiting the loan / capital ratio .
These have proven unenforced and unenforceable .
They are nothing but suggestions .
These suggestions are never taken seriously when the crisis hits .
Basel is dead .
Every central banker knows this .
The governments could revoke limited liability protection for banks , they say .
Allow creditors to collect from all bank investors .
Yeah , right — remove the # 1 protection of entrepreneurs from the banks that have run the West ’s economies for a century .
This is just silly .
Who would buy bank stocks on that basis ?
The banks would have debt / capital ratios close to infinity within days .
“ Sell ! ”
Get rid of “ too big to fail . ”
How ?
We need a “ well - articulated framework for the banking system . ”
We also need manna from heaven .
We are 300 years into central banking .
No such framework exists .
We are now in the transition phase : either to depression and monetary deflation ( no government intervention , no FDIC , no FED bailouts ) or mass inflation by the FED to head off the former .
They believe in a third way : the middle way .
Right !
We will muddle through in terms of the nationalized mortgage market , trillion - dollar annual Federal deficits , unemployment at 10 % or higher , and the bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare , both of which are in negative pay - out mode .
The authors conclude with a summary of the shift in the state / banks relationship .
Over the course of the past 800 years , the terms of trade between the state and the banks have first swung decisively one way and then the other .
For the majority of this period , the state was reliant on the deep pockets of the banks to finance periodic fiscal crises .
But for at least the past century the pendulum has swung back , with the state often needing to dig deep to keep crisis - prone banks afloat .
We are now deep into the doom loop that was created when the world adopted central banking early in the twentieth century , mimicking the Bank of England .
Step by step , war by war , crisis by crisis , all governments threw off the shackles of free market interest rates and the gold standard .
The commercial bankers , to quote the legendary George Washington Plunkett of Tammany Hall , seen their opportunities and took ’em .
Now what ?
The authors spin pipe dreams of effective reform .
Events of the past two years have tested even the deep pockets of many states .
In so doing , they have added momentum to the century - long pendulum swing .
Reversing direction will not be easy .
It is likely to require a financial sector reform effort every bit as radical as followed the Great Depression .
It is an open question whether reform efforts to date , while slowing the swing , can bring about that change of direction .
It may be an open question for these two economists .
It is not open for anyone who understands American politics and Austrian economics .
There will be no reform that undercuts the ability of big banks to game the state .
The system was designed by their predecessors so that the state could be gamed .
CONCLUSION
Bernanke is trapped .
He and his central banking peers have pushed the world deeper into the doom loop .
There is nothing on the horizon or in the pipeline that suggests that the system is going to be reformed in any way that will change the system while allowing the world to escape the effects of massive expansion of central bank balance sheets .
The problem has never been the balance sheets of commercial banks .
The problem has been the balance sheets of central banks , which supply the banking system with reserves .
Much as I hate Goldman Sachs — the bank we love to hate — the problem did not originate with Goldman Sachs .
It originated with the Federal Reserve System .
There is only one way out of the doom loop .
End the FED .

This is an amazing story .
Tsutomu Yamaguchi died on Monday at the age of 93 .
He was the only official survivor or both Japanese atomic blasts during WWII .
Mr. Yamaguchi , as a 29 - year - old engineer for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , was on a business trip in Hiroshima when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on the morning of Aug. 6 , 1945 .
He was getting off a streetcar when the “ Little Boy ” device detonated above Hiroshima .
Mr. Yamaguchi said he was less than 2 miles away from ground zero .
His eardrums were ruptured and his upper torso was burned by the blast , which destroyed most of the city ’s buildings and killed 80,000 people .
...“ suddenly the same white light filled the room , ” he said in an interview last March with The Independent newspaper .
“ I could have died on either of those days , ” Mr. Yamaguchi said in an August interview with the Mainichi Daily News .
“ Everything that follows is a bonus . ”
... Mr. Yamaguchi recovered from his wounds , went to work for the American occupation forces , became a teacher and eventually returned to work at Mitsubishi Heavy .
He was in good health for most of his life ...
In his later years , Mr. Yamaguchi began to speak out about the scourge of atomic weapons .
He rarely gave interviews , but he wrote a memoir and was part of a 2006 documentary film about the double - bombing victims .
He called for the abolition of nuclear weapons at a showing of the film at the United Nations that year .
According to his account , he took the Last Train From Hiroshima to his hometown of Nagasaki the next day to get to his family despite being badly burned , even resorting to using a " raft " of floating dead , bloated bodies to cross a bridgeless river to get to the train .
Heavily bandaged , he returned to work on August 9th and was explaining what had happened to his fellow workers and instructed them how to survive by diving under desks , when his boss berated him for exaggerating , claiming that no such bomb exists , when ... He and about 30 fellow workers , who heeded his warnings and instructions , survived the second blast which killed another 70,000 in Nagasaki .
Luckily , their office was in a section of the building that was blocked by a steel reinforced staircase which cut through the shockwave like the prow of a ship cuts through the ocean waves .
When they emerged from their hiding places , the rest of the building along with 300 other workers had disappeared .
“ I ’m gay .
I ’m short and half Hispanic those things are n’t going to change . ”
Those are the words Ryan Kendall uttered in a federal court in San Francisco on Wednesday as the trial over whether or not to overturn Proposition 8 that stripped gays and lesbians of their right to marry in California , got into its second week .
Kendall took the stand to recount his harsh treatment in an “ ex - gay ministry . ”
His deeply religious parents forced him into so - called “ reparative therapy ” after finding a note that Kendall had written to himself confessing his sexual orientation at the age of 13 .
Kendall said his parents “ flipped out , ( they were ) very upset , yelling .
I do n’t remember a lot of what they said , but it was pretty scary the level of their reaction .
I remember my mother telling me I was going to burn in hell . ”
From there , Kendall was shipped off to a Christian therapist for treatment to become a heterosexual .
When that therapy did n’t work , Kendall was turned over to Joseph Nicolosi with NARTH , the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality .
While at NARTH , Kendall said his family rejected him :
I went to NARTH from 14 - 16 .
My entire life changed .
Before NARTH , parents put notes in my lunch , made my lunch .
After , they abused me emotionally .
Mother told me she hated me , that I was disgusting , repulsive .
She wished she ’d had an abortion rather than having a gay son .
She said she wished I ’d had Down ’s syndrome or been born retarded .
Kendall could n’t take the abuse – or the therapy – and at age 16 , became a ward of the state .
I was a sixteen - year - old kid .
I had just lost everything .
I walked in and out of jobs and schools .
I was extremely suicidal .
Turned to drugs to escape .
Things did not get better ( he ’s very choked up ) .
Period lasted 4 or 5 years .
Struggle for survival ; not able to support myself .
When my healthcare ran out , I went to emergency rooms .
The good news , if there is any in this sordid story , is that Kendall has landed on his feet .
At 26 , he now has a stable job and has reconciled his spirituality and sexuality on his own .
He ’s no bleeding heart liberal , though , but a member of the Log Cabin Republicans .
The defense objected to Kendall being able to tell his story on relevance grounds , but the judge disagreed , saying they had opened the door to the “ subjects of sexuality as a conscious choice and people ’s ability to successfully change their sexual orientation in their opening testimony .
‘ It seems to me that you ’ve raised the very issue to which the witness is going to testify , ’ ( U.S. District Judge Vaughn )
Walker said , adding that Kendall ’s first - hand account would be ‘ very helpful . ' ”
Kendall ’s story — not an aberration — shed much - needed light on the dangers of “ ex - gay ” therapy .
The abuses of of the “ therapy ” led the American Psychological Association to conclude that “ there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation . ”
For all the years that NARTH and other “ ex - gay ministries ” have been around , they have but a handful of “ success ” stories to share with the world .
( Usually , those “ success ” stories go on to be paid , professional ex-gays , giving speeches and trading on their “ cure . ” )
Their “ therapy ” is based on outdated or repudiated studies , and often consists of enforcing strict gender roles by teaching men to be more masculine and women to be more feminine .
NARTH , in particular , continues to use the discredited views that parents can turn their kids gay .
Dr. Nicolosi , for example , often tells audiences that people are gay because they have a rift with a same - sex parent or a have domineering opposite sex parent .
It has been decades since any serious scientific body subscribed to these views and there is no contemporary research to uphold these anachronistic theories .
Yet , NARTH ’s co-founder Dr. Joseph Nicolosi repeats the empty mantra , “ We advise fathers , if you do n’t hug your sons , some other man will . ”
In fact , the scientific consensus against “ curing ” homosexuality has led most “ ex - gay ” outfits around the country to back off of the offer to turn a homosexual into a heterosexual .
Instead , they now simply promise those who have “ unwanted same - sex sexual attraction ” a chance to repress or “ overcome ” those urges – but not to “ cure ” them of their orientation .
What the proceedings are making startlingly clear , however , is how being branded “ sick ” and “ sinful ” by religious leaders has led directly to the discrimination against gay and lesbian people , including being denied the right to marry .
One exchange , presented by videotaped deposition testimony between plaintiff ’s attorney Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Dr. Paul Nathanson , a professor at McGill University in Montreal , is particularly telling :
Boutrous :
What is proportion of those who voted yes on Prop. 8 were motivated by religious reasons ?
Nathanson : About half .
B : Would you agree over the past fifty years , religion and society have been hostile to homosexuals ?
And has it led to discrimination ?
And violence against homosexuals ?
N : Yes to all .
B : Do you believe that the teaching of certain religions that homosexuality is a sin and abomination leads to gay bashing ?
N : Yes .
B : Do you believe that the primary cause of gay bashing is religion ?
N : In a direct sense yes .
Religious hostility to homosexual behavior has roots other than religion .
B : Was religion used to justify hostility and prejudice against blacks ?
N : Yes .
B : Was this prejudice used to “ protect families ” ?
N : Yes .
B : Were the same arguments used against women ( family protection ) ?
N : Yes .
The danger of using religious arguments to deny rights to a certain set of people is on full display in the trial .
Anti-gay religious advocates argue that they want to “ protect the family ” by denying marriage equality .
However , it is plain that religious opposition to homosexuality tears at the fabric of the very family the religious right says they want to preserve .
Kendall , and many like him , have been psychically scarred by the “ therapy ” forced on them , their self - identity vilified , their self - esteem demolished , their family destroyed , all in the name of God .
Kendall was finally honest with himself .
He gained his life and lost his family .
Others are not as brave .
Some will acquiesce to society ’s wishes and play along – pretending to be cured .
During ( defense attorney )
Flynn ’s redirect , he asked Kendall if he had met any “ successful ” conversion therapy patients during his time at NARTH .
“ During one of our group therapy sessions , Nicolosi trotted out his perfect patient , a guy named Kelly , ” Kendall said .
“ But after Nicolosi left , Kelly told me that he was going out to a gay bar that night . ”
The gallery erupted in laughter .
It would be funny , if it were n’t so terribly sad .
Save Sweden 's Wovles From Death
by : Tonya Butts
recipient : The Swedish Enviromental Protection Agency
The Swedish Enviromental Protection Agency is calling for a wolf cull .
They say the wolf population as of last winter was between 182 & 217 .
They want to limit the wolf population to 210 animals for the next 5 years .
They say the main reason for this decision is to raise the public 's acceptence of wolves , by limiting their numbers .
The hunt is to start in January and end before mating season in mid February .
Killing them is n't going to raise acceptence it 's just going to tell people that killing wolves is ok .
Wolves are an important part of our ecosystem and need to be protected , not killed .
The wolves almost became extinct in the 1970s .
We need to stop this madness before it's to late for these wolves .
read petition letter ▾
We the undersigned would like you to find a different solution to control the wolf population other then killing them .
They almost became extinct in the 1970s .
Killing wolves is not going to raise the public 's acceptence it 's just going to show them that killing wolves is ok .
Wolves are an important part of our ecosystem and need to be protected , not killed .
We thank you for taking the time to read this .
Police agent Shaher Elsohemy testified that the 34 - year - old Mississauga man told him he had sought advice from his father , who operated an Islamic school , about whether " physical action in Canada , an attack on Canadian soil " was permissible under Islamic law .
" His father told him there 's nothing wrong with it , in other words it 's acceptable , " said the Crown 's star witness .
" And if civilians happen to be there , that is their destiny . "
Abdelhaleem 's moral conscience was eased after his father , Tariq Abdelhaleem , issued a fatwa , or religious ruling , explained Elsohemy .
Court was told that although Abdelhaleem was opposed to adding metal chips to truck bombs , because of the potential for mass carnage , he admitted it would be " good " if there were some fatalities .
That , he believed , would show authorities that members of the group , now known as the Toronto 18 , were a force to be reckoned with .
" Abdelhaleem informed me that Zakaria Amara ( the mastermind of the bomb plot ) wants to add metal chips to the bomb but that he was in disagreement , " said Elsohemy , who easily gained Abdelhaleem 's trust because the two had once been close friends .
" But , he said if some got killed it 's good so that they know we 're not afraid , " recalled Elsohemy about a discussion the pair had at a coffee house in late April 2006 .
Elsohemy , who was paid $ 4.1 million for his work as an undercover agent and is currently in the witness protection program , said Abdelhaleem told him that if the intent was to kill civilians there were " more logical " targets .
Rather than packing trucks with fertilizer bombs destined to strike the Toronto Stock Exchange , the Front St. office of Canada 's spy agency and a military base near Highway 401 , Abdelhaleem suggested striking Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga , a football field or poisoning food at a factory , said the witness .
Abdelhaleem , the first adult to stand trial of the 18 individuals arrested in June 2006 , is alleged to have used Elsohemy to set up the purchase of three tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertilizer destined for explosives .
With a degree in agricultural sciences , and an uncle who purportedly owned a large chemical plant , Elsohemy quickly became the guy the plotters turned to to obtain bomb - making chemicals .
Elsohemy testified about numerous meetings he had with Abdelhaleem , who referred to himself as the plot 's " coordinator " or " planner . "
Abdelhaleem , who is expected to testify in his own defence , is charged with participating in a terrorist group and intending to cause an explosion .
He pleaded not guilty to both counts and elected to be tried by a judge alone and not a jury .
Of the 18 people charged , one youth was convicted and four adults have pleaded guilty , including Amara .
Seven have had their charges stayed .

Who ’s Greedy ?
Tweet
William M. ( as he calls himself in his e-mail to me ) asks me to reprise this blog post from December 2004 .
I do so greedily .
Ever notice how enthusiastically our popular and political culture endorses and even celebrates self - interestedness ?
Each of us is encouraged to exercise , to lose weight , to quit smoking , to eat healthier foods , to go back to school to complete that college degree .
We ’re advised to do all sorts of things that are good principally for us , individually .
This advice proudly encourages self - interested motivation .
Here are just two examples .
The first is from Teen Scene magazine :
Stress does cause weight gain .
If you ’re stressed , you ’re likely to eat “ comfort food ” and not realize how much you ’re eating .
Stress may trigger chemicals in your body that cling to fat cells .
Stress also evaluates your heart rate and makes you vulnerable to illnesses .
If you ’re feeling stressed , take a breather .
Find at least an hour to do something for yourself .
Or this quotation from exercise guru Bob Bohnam :
Surely you can set aside half an hour three times a week to train , jog or do some sort of exercise .
Make training part of your weekly routine , like working , running errands or shopping .
You spend a lot of time doing things for your employer , family and friends .
You also need to do something for yourself .
Make going to the gym your time .
It ’s for your health .
( I found these quotations by Googling [ exercise “ do something for yourself ” ] – which turned up 3,610 hits . )
…..
I do not dispute the wisdom of exercising , eating right , and stopping to smell roses and other fragrant flowers .
Nor do I object to self - interested actions .
But I have long been struck by how certain actions – exercising , eating low - fat diets , quitting smoking – are routinely celebrated , esteemed , even idolized , despite being almost wholly self - interested .
Other self - interested actions , in contrast – such as financial investing , or running a profit - seeking business in a profit - seeking way – are looked upon much more suspiciously .
( For example , in this recent exchange on the merits of private vs. government provision of health - care , one commenter ridiculed as being obviously absurd the notion that health - care provision should be motivated by self - interest — what he calls “ greed . ” )
The fact , then , is that our culture does not simple - mindedly elevate other - regarding actions over self - interested actions .
Many obviously self - interested actions are admired and encouraged .
Only some self - interested actions are slapped with the label “ greed ” and condemned as ugly and harmful .
Jogging to stay healthy is virtuous ; managing your pharmaceutical firm to stay profitable is inconsiderate ( and for many people downright scandalous ) .
Curiously , the set of self - interested actions that are widely praised are those whose positive effects redound almost exclusively to each self - interested actor .
If I exercise and eat right , the resulting health and beauty benefits are mine alone .
My healthier heart , bulgier biceps , and more - slender body do nothing to improve my neighbor ’s well - being .
( In fact , my exercise and good diet might harm him , for they improve my chances of getting the pretty girl whom we ’ve both been eyeing . )
In contrast , prominent among the self - interested actions that are popularly suspect are those whose fulfillment requires self - interested actors to provide benefits to others .
Of course , the business firm that earns profits in the market yields benefits to its self - interested principals – but it does so only insofar as it yields benefits to others .
And the greater the benefits provided to others , and the greater the number of others provided with these benefits , the greater are the benefits that the self - interested , profit - seeking business principals enjoy .
That is , when someone selfishly jogs to improve his or her health , we applaud .
When that same someone selfishly seeks financial profit by offering goods or services for sale to consumers , many of us are wary .
( And even most of the other of us who are n’t wary do n’t positively praise this variety of self - interested behavior .
We merely tolerate it as necessary . )
Selfish behavior that is exclusively self - regarding is praised ; selfish behavior that requires the selfish actor to consider and satisfy and please strangers is suspect .
Curious .

Mixing up a scientific taste sensation ( Image : Staff Hood Gamma ) Superdry Martini : 55 millilitres gin , 15 millilitres dry vermouth , 3 microlitres of tannin essence , shaken with ice then strained into a glass and garnished with a green olive .
The secret here is to add 150 microlitres of tannin essence to the bottle of vermouth ; tannins have a “ mouth - puckering ” effect that makes this martini super - dry .
The essence is made by gently heating 1 kilogram of macerated grape seeds in a rotary evaporator , which distils off the tannins .

Pakistan has arrested nearly half of the Afghanistan Taliban ’s leadership in recent days , Pakistani officials told the Monitor Wednesday , dealing what could be a crucial blow to the insurgent movement .
In total , seven of the insurgent group ’s 15 - member leadership council , thought to be based in Quetta , Pakistan , including the head of military operations , have been apprehended in the past week , according to Pakistani intelligence officials .
Western and Pakistani media had previously reported the arrest of three of the 15 , but this is the first confirmation of the wider scale of the Pakistan crackdown on the Taliban leadership , something the US has sought .
“ This really hurts the Taliban in the short run , ” says Wahid Muzjda , a former Taliban official turned political analyst , based in Kabul .
Whether it will have an effect in the long run will depend on what kind of new leaders take the reins , he says .
News of the sweep emerged over the past week , with reports that Pakistani authorities had netted Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the movement ’s second in command , as well as Maulavi Abdul Kabir , a prominent commander in charge of insurgent operations in eastern Afghanistan , and Mullah Muhammad Younis .
Pakistan has also captured several other Afghan members of the leadership council , called the Quetta Shura , two officials with the Pakistani Intelligence Bureau , and a United Nations official in Kabul told the Monitor .
These include : Mullah Abdul Qayoum Zakir , who oversees the movement ’s military affairs , Mullah Muhammad Hassan , Mullah Ahmed Jan Akhunzada , and Mullah Abdul Raouf .
At least two Taliban shadow provincial governors , who are part of the movement ’s parallel government in Afghanistan , have also been captured .
A Taliban spokesman denied the arrests , saying that they were meant to hide the difficulties that United States and NATO forces were having in Afghanistan .
Why Pakistan ’s sudden crackdown ?
The crackdown may to be related to efforts by some Taliban leaders to explore talks with Western and Afghan authorities independently of Pakistan , the UN official said .
Pakistan is widely suspected of backing the Afghan Taliban in a bid to maintain influence in Afghanistan , a charge Islamabad has long denied .
But Pakistan may also be wary of Taliban attempts to initiate talks without its involvement or sanction .
“ Pakistan wants a seat at the table , ” says the UN official , who is familiar with Taliban efforts to initiate talks .
“ They do n’t want the Taliban to act independently . ”
“ It ’s possible that Mullah Baradar and those around him wanted to start thinking about an eventual settlement , ” says Mr. Muzjda .
Former and current Taliban figures emphasize , however , that such a settlement necessarily involves a timetable for withdrawal of foreign forces in the country .
Reports emerged last month that the outgoing head of the UN mission here , Kai Eide , had met commanders associated with the Taliban leadership to explore the possibility of talks .
Mr. Eide has declined to comment .
Much about the arrests and Pakistan ’s motives remain unclear , but they do reflect Pakistan ’s evolving approach to the Afghan Taliban leadership inside its borders .
“ A year ago when this [ Obama ] administration was completing its first Afghanistan review and we asked the Pakistanis about the Afghan Taliban leadership operating from their country , they flatly denied it , ” says Bruce Riedel , a former CIA analyst who led President Obama ’s initial Afghanistan policy review .
“ Now not only do they say there are senior Taliban leaders in their country , but they are frankly taking action against them . ”
With the arrests of such important senior leaders as Baradar and Mr. Zakir , “ we have what are very significant catches , ” says Mr. Riedel , now a South Asia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
“ This is going to have a disruptive impact on the Taliban and its activities in Afghanistan . ”
US Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) chief Robert Mueller met with Afghan Interior Minister Hanif Atmar and his Pakistani counterpart , Rehman Malik , Wednesday , Pakistani officials say .
The three discussed the possibility of transferring Mr. Baradar and other captured Taliban leaders to Afghanistan .
Mr. Malik told reporters in Islamabad that the captured insurgents would be transferred , but did not give a time frame .
" We have to ensure first that these people did not commit any crimes against Pakistan , " says an official in the Pakistani Interior Ministry , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Washington and Kabul have been pushing to have the insurgents transferred so that they can be interrogated directly , since currently American officials have limited access to the prisoners .
Are top commanders replaceable ?
Zakir , who was held in Guantánamo and released in 2006 only to rejoin the Taliban , has played a significant role in shaping the movement ’s military strategy in recent years , Taliban and Afghan officials said .
His presence is particularly felt in southern Afghanistan , where he has organized the resistance to US offensives such as the ongoing campaign in Marjah .
“ He is a brilliant organizer , ” said Abdul Salaam , a Taliban commander in Kandahar Province , in an interview last summer .
“ Many of the fighters and commanders look to him as a leader . ”
Afghan officials and analysts credit Baradar with modernizing the Taliban movement , changing it from a largely fundamentalist movement that shunned compromise to one that increasingly spoke in nationalist terms and reached out for allies in its fight against foreign forces .
“ The Taliban is trying to convince the world that it is a just cause , ” says Muzjda .
“ They issue appeals to international bodies and prohibit their fighters from attacking Shias , for example .
This is new , and Baradar had a lot to do with this . ”
“ The Taliban are under a lot of pressure from these arrests , ” says Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaif , a former Taliban official who lives in Kabul .
He and others associated with the group insist , however , that the arrests will not fundamentally alter the movement .
“ You can arrest Mullah Baradar , but there are many Mullah Baradars out there , ” says Mr. Zaif .
“ The commanders are replaceable .
The fighters on the ground will keep fighting . ”
Muzjda and other analysts say the true impact of the arrests may not be felt for some time .
“ We will have to wait and see if this changes everything , ” says Muzjda , “ or if the Taliban will be able to regroup like they have done so many times before . ”

Opera unleashed a beta version of its browser this morning , and 10.5 claims the lead over Google Chrome and Apple 's Safari in the Javascript stakes .
The speed improvement is down to a new Carakan ECMAScript engine .
The Rolls Royce of browsers has long been the innovation lab for the rest of the industry , with rivals touting features first seen on Opera as their own " inventions " years later .
It 's maintained an emphasis on usability ( with extreme customisation made easy ) and performance - without getting bloated along the way .
But Opera has lagged rivals in scripting performance , and this has become increasingly important as complex web applications , such as Google Docs , become more widely used .
A pre-Alpha circulated before Xmas .
Some sites testing this gave Opera almost a half second advantage of the current leader , Google 's Chrome .
It 's around 2.5 times faster than Opera 10.2 , or seven times faster than the current 10.1 release .
The major change in Carakan is a move from a stack to a register based architecture .
Carakan will also compile scripts down into native code .
( For a detailed and interesting overview of the scripting engine see Jen Lindstrom 's blog post . )
In two other areas , Opera has held an embarrassing large historical lead over its main rivals and laggards , Firefox and IE : memory footprint and caching .
In 10.5 the caching engine has been rewritten , with opera : cache giving a new and very detailed browsable view of the cache .
A whole heap of non-functioning niceties are missing , but this is a beta .
Colour me in
10.5 alpha with a translucent skin
Opera 10.5 also sees big changes with GUIs .
The Windows version gains a spooky new translucent Glass look in Vista and Windows 7 .
It 's more deeply integrated into the UI , so hovering the mouse over the Opera icon on the taskbar brings up previews for each page .
The Windows taskbar now shows page previews [ click to enlarge ]
Using a transparent theme does n't make it easier to use
For Mac users , 10.5 will go Cocoa .
Not all the features are yet available for Mac testers , but it already looks a little more native .
Because 10.5 dispenses with the Qt toolkit , it wo n't require a faff around grabbing the libraries - which can happen .
It will use Gtk where Gnome is the desktop .
The pulsating , ever - growing brain that 's used to be KDE is n't yet supported .
Mac and Linux milestones will lag behind the Opera version , the company says , to get new features tested on Windows first .
The other major feature is Porn Mode , here called a " Private Tab " or " Private Window " .
Wipe your feet on the way out . ®
* You can spend weeks downloading conflicting Firefox add - ons , or a few minutes at this chap 's blog , to appreciate the many ways in which you can bend Opera to your will .
Well worth a look if you 're on a Netbook or still on a 1024x768 display - where every pixel counts .

Bret Lambert ( blambert@ ) , your friendly OpenBSD hacker in Norway , writes in about some hardware requests that have been added to want .
html recently .
The requests focus on ( for now ) unsupported or partially supported hardware that is under active development .
Machines like the Lemote Yeelong , more SGI hardware and USB infrared dongles are being asked for and Bret asked some of his fellow developers why they requested this gear .
Please read on for their replies .
Jasper Lievisse - Adriaanse ( jasper@ ) would like a Lemote Yeelong :
The Lemote Yeelong is a netbook containing a 64 - bit Loongson - 2F MIPS processor .
The OpenBSD port to this machine is still very new and more developers having access to this device will ensure it 's maturing .
Otto Moerbeek ( otto@ ) was also interested in getting one of these , but he already had his request fulfilled by a kind donor .
Gilles Chehade ( gilles@ ) is interested in getting some IR dongles :
I have a few IR controlled devices and I figured it would be fun to play with them from my OpenBSD laptop .
So I ordered this tiny USB IrDA adapter which is not recognized and attaches to ugen .
After looking at the code from umodem ( 4 ) and uipaq ( 4 ) , I decided to try to write a driver for my device , and after a few hours of work I managed to get something working .
The driver makes device accessible through the ucom ( 4 ) driver which makes it behave like a tty ( 4 ) .
I would love it if people would send me a few different adapters so that I could improve ( and learn more about ) my driver .
Miod Vallat ( miod@ ) would like access to some more SGI hardware :
Basically at the moment , we have support for all the high - end sgi hardware ( including machines no other free operating system runs on ) , with the following things missing : SMP , except on Octane .
SMP on other platforms coming soon ( during the next release cycle , really ) .
frame buffers .
jsing@ is working on this but slacking on his current code .
the serial ports on Origin 300 ( hence the request for one ) , which prevent the machine to be supported at the moment ( it 's a headless machine ) .
This is the kind of driver you can't really work on without having physical access to the machine .
the ATA part of the IOC4 chip on Origin 350 and Tezro ( hence the request for one , since we know Origin 350 works ) .
This is the kind of driver you can't really work on without having physical access to the machine , as well ( the initial Origin 350 specific work was written blind in f2k9 , and debugged remotely on Theo 's machine , and it took about one week to fix the few bugs until interrupts got routed correctly , and I do n't really want to live this again ) .
As for what 's been done , very roughly : by 4.6 we had a stabler - than - ever O2 support , and rough Octane , Origin 200 and Fuel support .
The intent of the 4.6->4.7 release cycle was to get SMP working on one platform ( Octane ) and improve hardware support ; and indeed , more mips - specific kernel bowels have been cleaned up , to pave the way for future work ; hardware support has improved with support of the Origin 350 family , and more bugs have been fixed allowing most of the PCI devices , if not all , to work in these machines ( this includes devices with PCI - PCI bridges , and Cardbus bridges , although the latter is not enabled by default ) .
With this work over , the next release cycle ( 4.7 -> 4.8 ) will focus more on SMP and the NUMA aspects of the high end systems : I intend to get SMP working on the remaining models ( Origin family ) , and work on making the kernel aware of the memory physical location and connection , something which will benefit amd64 SMP systems as well .
I also am working on extensive changes to the pmap code for these systems , allowing use of much more physical memory than the current limit of a few GB , and extending the userland address space beyond 2GB ; the switch from 4KB kernel pages to 16KB on the high end systems , which occured during this release cycle , is one of the preliminary steps of this roadmap .
Helping out is easy - if you are interested in seeing support for the hardware that is needed or you have some suitable gear laying around that is not being used anymore , please contact the developers and help them out .
Other hardware requests that can be found on want .
html also need your attention , so if you 'd like to support development but do n't have a Lemote or a nice SGI box but do have some of the other hardware being requested there , simply send the requesting developer an e-mail .
The government is determined to protect high - ranking Israeli officials from arrest in the UK , the attorney general said , as it emerged that a further visit by the Israeli military had been cancelled .
Speaking at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem today , Baroness Scotland said Israeli leaders should not face arrest for war crimes under the law of " universal jurisdiction " , following attempts by British lawyers last month to obtain a warrant for the former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni .
" The government is looking urgently at ways in which the UK system might be changed to avoid this situation arising again , " Scotland said .
" Israel 's leaders should always be able to travel freely to the UK . "
Scotland 's assurance comes as the Guardian learned that the Israeli military had cancelled a visit by a team of its officers to Britain after fears they risked arrest on possible war crimes charges .
A group of officers , reportedly from the rank of major up to colonel , were invited by the British army for a meeting on military co-operation but cancelled last week .
There were also reports today that Israeli officials feared possible arrest warrants and contacted British authorities to demand a guarantee that the officers would not be arrested .
Last week , British officials reportedly said they could offer no such guarantee and the Israeli military promptly cancelled the visit .
The Israeli military , also referred to as the Israel Defence Force , declined to comment .
News of the latest cancellation by high - profile Israeli politicians or army officers is likely to intensify debate around the ability of UK - based lawyers to obtain arrest warrants .
In October , Moshe Ya'alon , a former general and current cabinet minister , turned down an invitation to visit London for fear of arrest over an Israeli air strike in Gaza dating back to 2002 .
Two weeks earlier , lawyers also tried to secure an arrest warrant against Ehud Barak , Israel 's defence minister , while he was visiting Britain .
They did not succeed since as a serving minister Barak still has diplomatic immunity .
Israeli leaders have grown increasingly frustrated about the threat of legal action against individuals and said they would be pressing Scotland to change UK law in meetings today in Jerusalem .
" The risk to senior Israeli figures does concrete and immediate damage to bilateral relations " , said the deputy foreign minister , Danny Ayalon , today .
" Organisations that are hostile to Israel try to exploit the legal channels and legal tools to threaten the Israeli and British decision - makers , including the authorities of the attorney general herself , and to thereby create political facts that should be determined around the diplomatic negotiating table .
" The UK is one of a number of countries where private prosecutions can be brought for alleged war crimes committed abroad .
Following the attempt to obtain an arrest warrant for Livni from a London magistrates ' court last month , the Guardian reported Foreign Office plans to change the legal process so that the attorney general would first approve warrants before suspected war criminals could be arrested .
The " safeguards " were to apply to all visiting foreign leaders , not just Israelis , but provoked outrage from lawyers .
" If there is evidence against Israeli leaders and a judge thinks that there is a case to answer , then why does the process need to be changed ? " , said Daniel Machover , a partner at Hickman & Rose , whose firm obtained an arrest warrant in 2005 for the Israeli general , Doron Almog .
" In my view , it is not constitutionally proper to give the attorney general involvment at the arrest stage .
We would not have a politician standing next to a policeman who decides whether or not to arrest someone , why should we have a politician standing next to a judge ? "
The good news is that cats and babies can live very happily together provided you plan well in advance and respect the needs of your cat .
In the House , lawmakers like Mr. Kratovil , Mr. Cardoza and other swing Democrats will come under increasing scrutiny from leadership as a vote draws near .
Of the 219 Democrats who initially voted in favor of the House measure , roughly 40 did so in part because it contained the so - called Stupak amendment , intended to discourage insurers from covering abortion .
Some , notably Representative Bart Stupak , the Michigan Democrat for whom the amendment is named , will almost certainly switch their yes votes to no because the new version being pushed by Mr. Obama would strip out the House bill ’s abortion restrictions in favor of Senate language that many of them consider unacceptable .
An additional 39 , like Mr. Kratovil , are fiscal conservatives who voted no the first time around .
Ms. Pelosi is hoping that she can get some to switch those no votes to yes in favor of Mr. Obama ’s less expensive measure .

But persuading Democrats who are already on record as opposing a health overhaul to do a turnabout will not be an easy task , especially during a midterm election year in which Democrats ’ political prospects already look bleak .
Of the 39 Democrats who voted against the House measure , 31 , including Mr. Kratovil , represent districts that were won in 2008 by Senator John McCain of Arizona , Mr. Obama ’s Republican rival .
Fourteen , including Mr. Kratovil , are freshmen , who are generally considered more politically vulnerable than more senior lawmakers .
“ The concern among Democrats right now is that there are more yes votes reconsidering than no votes , ” said David Wasserman , who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
“ My sense is that for Democrats to pass this bill , they would have to convince several members who are already in serious jeopardy , even after voting no on the first health care bill , to put passage of the bill ahead of their own chances of being competitive in the fall . ”
But politicians do not want to be martyrs .
They want to hold onto their seats .
Ms. Pelosi is facing resistance from some of her most senior members , like Representative Ike Skelton , Democrat of Missouri and chairman of the Armed Services Committee .
He has been in office since 1977 , but is facing his toughest re-election challenge in years .

IT ’S A BRIGHT , BALMY SUNDAY afternoon and I ’m driving through the western outskirts of Auckland , New Zealand , the kind of place you never see on a postcard .
No majestic mountains , no improbably green pastures — just a bland tangle of shopping malls and suburbia .
I follow a dead - end street , past a rubber plant , a roofing company , a drainage service , and a plastics manufacturer , until I reach a white building behind a chain - link fence .
Inside is a kernel of a nation within a nation — a sneak preview of what a climate change exodus looks like .
This is the Tuvalu Christian Church , the heart of a migrant community from what may be the first country to be rendered unlivable by global warming .
Tuvalu is the fourth - smallest nation on Earth : six coral atolls and three reef islands flung across 500,000 square miles of ocean , about halfway between Australia and Hawaii .
It has few natural resources to export and no economy to speak of ; its gross domestic product relies heavily on the sale of its desirable Internet domain suffix , which is .tv , and a modest trade in collectible stamps .
Tuvalu ’s total land area is just 16 square miles , of which the highest point stands 16 feet above the waterline .
Tuvaluans , who have a high per-capita incidence of good humor , refer to the spot as “ Mount Howard , ” after the former Australian prime minister who refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that low - lying island nations are particularly endang­ered by rising seas and will also be buffeted by more frequent and more violent storms .
Already , warmer ocean temperatures are eating away at the coral reefs that form Tuvalu ’s archipelagic spine .
Tuvaluans themselves point to more tangible indicators of trouble — the “ king tides ” that increasingly sluice their homes , the briny water oozing up into the “ grow pits ” where they used to cultivate taro and other vegetables .
As Julia Whitty predicted in this magazine in 2003 , the prognosis has become sufficiently dire that the residents of Tuvalu and other low - lying atoll islands “ are beginning to envision the wholesale abandonment of their nations . ”
Around one - fifth of the 12,000 - some inhabitants have already left , most bound for New Zealand , where the Tuvaluan community has nearly tripled since 1996 .
Inside the church I find a vibrant scene , suggesting both the resilience of Tuvaluan culture and its ability to adapt .
Rows of green plastic chairs are filled with several hundred chattering churchgoers , some in traditional lavalavas — vivid cotton skirts emblazoned with flowers — others in Western dresses and suits .
A border of bright blue , yellow , and pink stars rings the upper walls — in Tuvalu these might be constructed from frangipani blossoms , but here they are woven from the plastic bands used to tether shipping cargo .
As soon as I sit down , a young man in a dapper dark suit strikes up a conversation .
He came here in 1997 , is making good money , and has n’t been home once .
“ You may have heard the news about Tuvalu — with global warming , the sea is rising , ” he says cheerfully .
“ So better we come here to be safe . ”
Tuvaluans , resigned to fielding reporters ’ questions about their homeland ’s impending doom , often offer observations like this unprompted .
After the service , the congregation drifts outside to the gravelly yard , where a group of visitors from the islands is reenacting the crucifixion of Christ on a makeshift stage draped with threadbare astroturf .
Reverend Elisala Selu , a thoughtful , soft - spoken man who has worked second jobs to avoid burdening his congregants , explains that Tuvaluan politicians are reluctant to encourage the mass evacuation of their voting base , and so the church , wanting people to be prepared , has taken matters into its own hands .
It instructs followers not to assume that , like Noah , they will be delivered by God from the rising waters , and hosts groups of congregants who visit New Zealand to see if they might like to relocate here .
But , Selu confides , life in New Zealand is n’t always easy .
The Tuvaluans are one of the country ’s poorest communities .
Just over half the adults have found work ; the median income is about $ 17,000 for men , $ 10,000 for women .
There are those here illegally — overstayers , in Pacific parlance — who struggle to make ends meet ;
Tuvaluans on the run from debt collectors after buying cars on shady financing schemes ; children left unattended for long hours because their parents work multiple jobs as cleaners or laborers or farmworkers .
Then there ’s the jarring adjustment to urban Auckland from a place where most citizens do n’t pay rent or buy food , but sleep on grass mats beside the road on warm nights , go fishing or pick breadfruit when they ’re hungry , and where , as one jovial Tuvaluan remarked to me , “ the only crime is cycling in the night without a torch [ flashlight ] . ”
Selu frets about the new generation of Tuvaluan children born in New Zealand .
“ We try to run away from the sea rise in Tuvalu , but this is another sea - level rise , ” he says with a wry smile .
“ The next generation gets caught by two cultures .
Before Tuvalu sinks physically , our identity might sink in a foreign country . ”
Tuvalu and other low - lying island countries like Kiribati and the Maldives are , in one sense , the starkest example of how climate change will reshape the world .
But Auckland ’s Tuvaluan community also represents a best - case scenario — so far their migration has been orderly , and their numbers are minuscule compared with the millions of impoverished people who live in global warming hot spots like Africa ’s Sahel , coastal Bangladesh , and Vietnam ’s deltas .
Koko Warner , an expert on climate change and migration at the United Nations University in Bonn , says the displacement of those populations could be “ a phenomenon of a scope not experienced in human history . ”
Yet little has been done to prepare .
In fact , our understanding of exactly how global warming will affect people — how many lives will be threatened , and what we could do to avert a succession of humanitarian disasters — remains extremely rudimentary .
As Bill Gates has caustically observed , “ It is interesting how often the impact of climate change is illustrated by talking about the problems the polar bears will face rather than the much greater number of poor people who will die unless significant investments are made to help them . ”
IN JUNE , I TRAVELED to the verdant , secluded campus of Columbia University ’s Earth Institute , near the New York Palisades , to find out how global warming will reconfigure the world ’s political geography .
Earth Institute scientists , along with researchers from the United Nations University , have conducted a global study to chart how environmental change will affect vulnerable populations .
Alex de Sherbinin , one of the project ’s lead researchers , explained that the investigation was prompted by the realization that existing data about how many people could be uprooted by climate change had been “ essentially grabbed from thin air . ”
The most commonly cited factoid , which pops up even in authoritative sources like the British government ’s Stern Review on climate change , predicts 200 million “ environmental refugees ” by 2050 — 1 in every 34 people on Earth .
But even the scholar who produced that number — Norman Myers , an Oxford ecologist — concedes that it required some “ heroic extrapolations . ”
None of the existing figures uses a vetted scientific methodology , and most rely instead on crude estimations , like choosing the most sensitive regions and assuming that every single inhabitant will have to leave .
De Sherbinin ’s project takes a more fine - grained approach .
“ We found that livelihood would be the main factor in how people decide to stay or go , ” he explained .
The aim is to connect hard scientific data about glacier melt , precipitation , drought , and sea rise with knowledge of how people interact with their environment , obtained through extensive field interviews .
The fieldwork is used to figure out whether there are ways to help , say , a farmer remain on his land as rainfall declines , or whether he will need to relocate to survive .
De Sherbinin gave me a quick tour of the world ’s prospective disaster zones by way of his laptop .
He brought up a map of Tuvalu ’s main island of Funafuti , rendered in such detail that you could see which houses will be submerged if the sea rises by three feet .
Then , the Ganges delta region of Bangladesh and India , home to 144 million people .
Variegated red patches indicated population density — overlapping some of the deepest red spots were blue blotches marking the places most likely to be lost to flooding .
Next : Vietnam , which de Sherbinin says is likely to lose more agricultural land ( especially in the Mekong delta ) to sea - level rise than any other country .
Blue streaks — signifying a 6.6 - foot rise — on the high end of what scientists think is possible — erased land inhabited by 14 million people .
Finally , a map of the Sahel region of West Africa , where nearly half the population survives on subsistence farming , and where rainfall is projected to decline severely .
Overall , the number of Africans facing water shortages is expected to double by 2050 .
“ For a lot of these places , prospects do n’t look too good — I do n’t want to suggest easy solutions , ” de Sherbinin said .
But some people , he argued , have options .
In Africa , he pointed out , while desertification is a grave problem , much of the continent lacks water capture and storage systems .
“ There ’s a potential to do much more .
If these countries had the wherewithal — most of them do n’t — they could develop in irrigation . ”
I heard a similar argument from Paul Kench , a geomorphologist at the University of Auckland and an expert on atoll islands .
Kench looked like someone who spends a lot of time on beaches — shorts , sandals , sandy hair , golden tan .
He argued that many climate scientists draw overly broad conclusions from abstract data about sea - level rise without observing the precise ways that oceanic change affects particular places .
Like many New Zealanders , he has a relentlessly practical streak , and he insisted that many residents of Tuvalu and other imperiled countries could actually stay put , if only people would pay proper attention to the science .
Using data from Tuvalu , the Maldives , and Kiribati , Kench and his coauthor , Peter Cowell , are creating computer models visualizing what will happen as the sea rises .
“ What we ’ve been unable to do is totally destroy an island , ” he said .
Instead , he explained , as waves wash over these narrow slivers of land , they reshape their contours .
On some islands , rising seas lifted sand from the beach and deposited it farther inland , steepening the island ’s plane and raising its highest point .
In Tuvalu , storms shaved rubble off the reefs and welded it to nearby islands , building new outer layers “ like onion skins . ”
On other islands , seasonal tides shuffled sand from one side to another , so that in January the eastern part of the island might grow , only to recede in July as the western side extended .
Kench argued that in many Pacific atoll nations , people are clustered densely in the islands ’ most fragile places ( in turn creating man-made environmental strains that amplify the effects of climate change ) .
“ With some careful planning , you could identify safe places to live .
You could identify islands more sensitive to change than others , ones that can take more people than others .
There ’s lots of quite sensible things we could do . ”
The Maldives has invited Kench to research such possibilities .
( Keeping its options open , the government is also considering buying land in Australia . )
Right now , Kench said , in most low - lying island nations there ’s almost “ no information to base decisions on ” — even on basic questions like the relationship of valuable resources to the waterline .
“ That reads like stamp collecting — cataloging environmental resources and processes .
But it gives you great power to make sensible decisions . ”
Kench ’s vision was appealing — the idea of a people joining hands with science and orienting their lives even more intimately around the rhythms of their environment .
But it was hard to envision anyone enacting the kind of exquisitely calibrated resettlement plan that he had in mind — either local governments , starved for cash and expertise , or institutions like the World Bank , which tends to react to environmental fragility by pouring concrete .
And redistributing Tuvalu ’s population more wisely could n’t safeguard against the projected increase of ferocious storms , the erosion of coral , or salinization of the islands ’ scarce arable soil .
Yet because a certain amount of environmental change is locked in no matter what negotiators at Copenhagen decide , Kench ’s type of thinking is sorely needed .
Thomas Fingar , the former chairman of the National Intelligence Council , conducted an assessment of the national security implications of climate change in 2008 .
“ The international system needs to think about this , whether it ’s prepositioning water , tents , and so on , developing assistance programs , ” Fingar told me .
Instead , he noted drily , when he delivered his analysis to the House committees on intelligence and global warming , it got “ overshadowed by a debate over whether this topic was incredibly important or incredibly stupid . ”
He added , “ Should n’t we start thinking about coping strategies ?
Stop ringing the damn alarm bell and go buy some buckets . ”
The Obama administration is turning to these questions , but it ’s playing catch - up for years of lost time .
The United Nations Development Programme estimates that $ 86 billion will need to be spent annually by 2015 to help developing countries adapt to the effects of global warming .
The UN has launched a fund for this purpose , but it has only collected $ 100 million so far .
What ’s more , rich countries commonly use so - called adaptation funds as a bargaining tool to push for lower emissions from the industrializing countries of the developing world .
Thus the fate of Tuvalu , which generates a tiny fraction of the world ’s greenhouse gases — and aims to be carbon neutral by 2020 — is held hostage by the 4.3 percent produced by India , the fourth - largest emitter .
“ Doing a deal in Copenhagen is , to an important extent , about engaging developing countries , ” Yvo de Boer , the UN ’s top climate change official , has said .
“ And an important part of engaging countries is providing funds . ”
Even some environmental and humanitarian groups have been wary of the topic , believing that shifting the conversation to seawalls and water storage will undercut political momentum for cutting emissions .
“ There has been an unwitting conspiracy between strong advocates for doing something to prevent the consequences of climate change and those who deny that climate change is a problem , ” L. Craig Johnstone , the UN ’s deputy high commissioner for refugees , told me .
“ The one is fearful that if adaptation and disaster response are seen as the answer , people will stop trying to do anything about global warming .
The others think it ’s all nonsense . ”
As a result , the notion of either adapting to climate change or migrating because of it barely figures on the agenda at international climate talks .
Johnstone remarked that he was proud to have “ broken new ground ” by simply chairing a meeting on the subject at climate talks in Poland late last year .
“ A lot of times people say , ‘ It ’s interesting but we do n’t know how to cope with this , ' ” says Warner of the United Nations University .
“ Does it belong in Copenhagen ?
Or is it something different ? ”
TUVALUANS , MEANWHILE , lack the luxury of procrastinating over existential questions such as , When does a nation cease to be a nation ?
Can you maintain a government , let alone an identity , if your land can no longer be inhabited ?
Mose Saitala has thought a lot about such dilemmas .
He was the Tuvaluan secretary of finance in the 1990s , when the government became convinced that its country could disappear in 50 years .
It even considered moving people to 2,000 acres of land that Tuvaluans had contemplated acquiring in Fiji , until a coup and ethnic tensions made the plan unpalatable .
Today , the genial Saitala lives in Auckland , where he helps to run a finance company that serves Pacific Islanders .
When we met , I expected him to advocate for New Zealand to open its doors to more Tuvaluan migrants .
( New Zealand has only allocated them 75 slots annually in a visa program for Pacific workers . )
But Saitala had a more creative proposition in mind .
“ Tuvalu has a lot of resources — $ 100 million in reserves , ” he mused .
“ They can easily buy a place that 10,000 people can fit into .
Vanuatu , Solomons , and Papua New Guinea all have uninhabited islands .
For me , I would prefer a big island off Australia , like the Norfolk Islands . ”
In his mind , the major obstacles were legal and political ones : Could Tuvalu still earn money from fishing rights in its territorial waters if its people moved elsewhere ?
Would another country allow Tuvalu to remain an independent entity within its boundaries , perhaps a protectorate ?
And , after spending much of its savings buying a new homeland , would Tuvalu ’s government still be able to provide services to its people ?
In numerous ways , climate change will unsettle laws and institutions shaped by the crises of a different era .
The existing international system grew from the upheavals of World War II , crafted to react to violent conflicts whose existence is obvious and whose victims are reasonably easy to identify .
But people displaced by environmental change fall through the cracks of that system .
Refugee law only covers those who have been driven from their homeland for political reasons ; because resources for such exiles are already strained , there is enormous resistance to broadening the definition .
The apolitical , indeterminate effects of climate change , which require action in advance , not after the fact , may be beyond what the existing humanitarian regime can handle .
If we do n’t prepare , warns Walter Kälin , the UN secretary - general ’s representative on the human rights of internally displaced persons , “ people from islands and territories will start to migrate , legally or with an irregular situation , and overall the society will slowly disintegrate .
For a certain time there will be a government , but it will be a fiction .
It will be a slow process of whole nations dying in the social sense in addition to the geographical sense . ”
On my last Saturday in Auckland , I return to the church .
Tuvalu ’s prime minister , Apisai Ielemia , is visiting New Zealand , and he ’s convened a meeting with his Auckland compatriots .
A small group of Tuvaluans , mostly older adults this time , files into the hall wearing formal clothing and bearing the obligatory plates of food — an easy tradition in a place where anyone can fish for free , but one the poor among Auckland ’s Tuvaluans struggle to maintain .
Ielemia makes a brief speech and asks the attendees to voice their concerns , and after a while , the conversation inevitably turns to climate change .
Ielemia deflects queries with a smile , explaining that there is no official policy to relocate more Tuvaluans .
The group is n’t satisfied .
A short , energetic woman dressed in Lycra shorts under a denim skirt stands up and lets out an exasperated tirade in Tuvaluan and English .
“ When something happens , we should have a plan in place so that people know what to expect , instead of just reacting .
What is the plan ? ” she demands .
“ What is the plan ? ”
So far , no one seems to have an answer .

Sidelights
Norwegian politician Jens Stoltenberg ascended to the post of prime minister of his country in 2005 .
The election results signified a shift to the left for this Scandinavian nation of 3.4 million , which has prospered immensely thanks to its North Sea
oil exports , and Stoltenberg promised to use that wealth to boost Norway 's already generous network of social services .
The telegenic Stoltenberg is sometimes compared to British Labour Party leader Tony Blair because of his relatively young age as head of his country 's leading party of the left .
Stoltenberg was born on March 16 , 1959 , in Oslo , Norway 's capital .
His father , Thorvald , would later serve as Norway 's foreign minister , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , and head of the Norwegian Red Cross , while Stoltenberg 's mother , Karin , would be appointed to a junior minister post in the Norwegian government .
Both were members of the Norwegian Labour Party ( Det norske Arbeiderparti , or DNA ) , which had been in power for much of the twentieth century thanks to consistently robust voter support for its democratic - socialist policies .
Stoltenberg joined the DNA as a teen , and studied economics at the University of Oslo .
Between 1979 and 1981 he was a part - time journalist for the Arbeiderbladet , a national newspaper , and went on to serve as information secretary for the Oslo Labour Party in 1981 .
He headed the Labour Youth League after 1985 , and spent a year as an executive officer for Statistics Norway , the government agency whose American equivalent is the U.S. Census Bureau .
He also taught economics at his alma mater before advancing to the post of chair of the Oslo chapter of the DNA in 1990 and state secretary at the Department of the Environment .
Two years later , he became a deputy leader of the party .
Stoltenberg was first elected to Norway 's Storting , or parliament , in 1993 , representing Oslo .
That same year he was named minister for trade and energy in the government of Gro Harlem Brundtland , and served for three years .
He switched portfolios in 1996 to become minister of finance in the government of Brundtland 's successor , Thorbjørn Jagland .
After 1997 , Stoltenberg served as head of the standing committee on oil and energy affairs in the Storting , while Kjell Magne Bondevik , a Lutheran minister and Christian People 's Party member , became Norway 's first non-Socialist prime minister since World War II .
Stoltenberg served his first term as prime minister after Bondevik 's government resigned in March of 2000 .
Stoltenberg 's party had tried to push for a vote on building new power stations fired by Norway 's rich stores of natural gas .
Bondevik and his coalition government had opposed the bill , and responded with a proposal to further restrict greenhouse gas emissions .
Storting members voted with the DNA , which had argued the country 's demand for electricity necessitated the new natural gas - fired power stations .
Stoltenberg took over the government at a time when many significant reforms were already underway .
These included the controversial privatization of several industries , and his administration struggled to maintain the public 's confidence .
At the time , some were clamoring for a reduction in the traditionally high taxes that Norway and other Scandinavian countries levied to cover their extensive social - service programs , which included universal health care and free university education .
Norway 's oil revenues went into the country 's Petroleum Fund , and its coffers had swelled in recent years .
Stoltenberg advised a cautionary route when he presented his government 's first budget to the Storting later in 2000 , warning that it would be imprudent to spend the oil riches for short - term gains .
" Spain destroyed its economy when it discovered gold in Latin America , " Financial Times journalists Valeria Criscione and Quentin Peel quoted him as saying .
" You had the Dutch disease when Holland spent all its income from gas in the 1970s , and the same in Norway in the 1980s when we spent too much .
We have learned our lesson . "
In parliamentary elections held on September 10 , 2001 , Stoltenberg 's party lost heavily , taking just 24 percent of the vote in its worst showing since 1924 .
Bondevik returned as prime minister to head a center - right government , and Stoltenberg concentrated on realigning the DNA to help it return to power .
He won a hotly contested battle against Jag - land for the party leadership in 2002 , and prepared for the 2005 elections .
In that contest , the DNA secured a majority , but the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party did well at the polls , too , which necessitated the formation of a coalition government .
Sworn in as prime minister for the second time on October 17 , 2005 , Stoltenberg presided over a country that had continued to prosper since his first term on the job .
Norway boasted a four - percent annual growth rate and had one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the world .
It was usually listed at the top of the United Nations ' Human Development Index , which ranked the best countries to live in the world .
Thanks to rising prices per-barrel on the world oil market , the Petroleum Fund held a staggering $ 190 billion .
Stoltenberg and the DNA proposed to spend a little more than five percent of that , or ten billion dollars , on health care , education , and senior citizen services in the coming years .
" Norway has great possibilities and we have to use these for everyone in our country , " he wrote in an editorial in Norway 's largest newspaper , Verdens Gang , according to a UPI International Intelligence report .
" That means we must spend the big money on the big issues . "
A more problematic debate is likely to loom over the question of European Union ( EU ) membership — Norway is one of the last European countries choosing to remain out of the EU , a status supported by most of the leftist parties , but Stoltenberg has backed the pro-EU side .
Stoltenberg is married to Ingrid Schulerud , a diplomat who holds a high - ranking post within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
They met while students at the Cathedral School of Oslo , when Schulerud beat him in a student - government election .
They have two children .
In 2005 Stoltenberg appeared in The Rich Country , a documentary film that tracked his path to a second term as prime minister .
His wife and children did not appear in it , but in one segment he cooks a dinner of the national delicacy , whale meat , for his parents .
The prime minister is reportedly an avid online gamer , and in multiplayer contests like Age of Empires he uses the name Steklov , which the Soviet Union 's secret service , the KGB , once used to identify him .

Why GTAIV 360 DLC Will Eventually Go to The PS3
This is pure speculation , so take it all with a grain of salt .
It 's just for fun and is only a possibility .
But with that said , read on :
The possibility of Grand Theft Auto 's downloadalbe content going cross platform all depends on the details of Microsoft and Rockstar 's DLC ( downloadable content ) exclusivity deal , which of course , are under wraps .
The questions to consider are the following :
1 ) Is this deal a " timed exclusive " , meaning , does Microsoft have the rights to this add on content only temporarily , sticking Rockstar with a gag - order on speaking of any future plans for said content ?
( I.E. " Bioshock " )
2 ) Does the deal ban Rockstar from creating any other type of downloadable content for other systems during the course of their deal ?
Meaning , can Rockstar create it's own exclusive DLC for Sony 's machine as well ?
What would happen if Rockstar decided to do a separate set of episodes for the PS3 at the the same time ( as unlikely scenario as this is ) .
3 ) Is the downloadable content exclusively meant to be exactly what it sounds like is it ?
Meaning , after all the episodes are released via XBox Live , can a packaged disc version of this content be sold at retail ?
4 ) If Microsoft fails to meet a certain sales goal on the DLC in an alloted amount of time , do they lose their exclusivity ?
These are all questions that could effect whether or not the DLC has the option to go cross-platform .
Here is what we do know .
Please keep in mind the statistics below are real , but other than that there is plenty of estimation going on .
1 ) First week sales for GTA IV were 6 million copies ( 1 ) , with an expected 15 million copies to be sold by the end of the year ( 2 ) .
Given the split between the two machines , and the larger install base on the XBox 360 due to it's one - year jump on the PS3 , the current ratio is about exactly 58 ( Xbox ) / 42 ( PS3 ) , as cumulative sales for the game have been 5.8 million and 4.3 million , respectively ( 3 ) .
During GTAIV 's first week , of the 6 million copies sold , 3.3 million were XBox 360 .
This also means that by the end of the year , if the 15 million mark is reached , we 'll see about 8 million copies sold for XBox and about 6 million sold on PS3 , give or take a million copies .
2 ) The next question is , how many users actually buy downloadable content ?
Well , lets look at Call of Duty 4 , which has about the same amount of XBox users attached to it as GTAIV , and is wildly popular on XBox Live , currently with 6.3 million copies sold .
( 4 ) When COD4 released it 's downloadable content for XBox 360 , it set a new record for sales of DLC on XBox Live , selling over 1 million copies in it 's first week of release .
(5) At that time , the install base for the XBox 360 version of the game was at about 5.7 million ( 6 ) , ( ironically right about where the 360 GTAIV is now ) .
This means that during the first 10 days of the DLC 's release , roughly 1/6 customers bought the DLC .
If we compare this same 1/6 ratio to the expected 15 million copies that GTA will sell by the end of the year , and only 58 % of those are for the XBox ( based on the current Xbox 360 vs PS3 ratio ) , that leaves us with an expected 8.7 million copies of the game sold for 360 .
If 1/6 of those customers purchase the content in the first week like they did in the case of the comparable Call of Duty IV , that estimates that 1.45 million copies of the DLC will be sold during the first week .
Of course additional copies will be sold in consecutive weeks , but sales will dwindle with each week forward .
This is also assuming that the content were to be launched on December 31st ; ) .
Now here is the question :
Is that enough to justify the exclusivity ?
Here is where the big glimmer of hope comes in for PS3 users .
The PSP saw a similar episode with two of it's releases " Grand Theft Auto : Liberty City Stories " and " Grand Theft Auto : Vice City Stories " .
These were - in essence - expansion packs of the original " GTA3 " and " GTA Vice City " .
Virtually the same maps - with minor modifications - but a whole new story and adventure .
The problem was , these two " exclusive " PSP titles , did not sell enough copies to " waste " them on the PSP , and eventually PS2 ports were released .
See , with GTA series being such a hot commodity , anything under 10 million sales is almost looked at like being a failure .
" Liberty City Stories " sold 4.8 million on PSP , but it took the PS2 port to churn out another 3.2 million in sales , still not reaching that magic number . ( 7 ) .
It 's sequel , " Vice City Stories " , also failed to do anything significant , selling only 2.69 million on PSP , then .69 million on PS2 ( ouch ) .
( 8 ) These numbers pale in comparison to the totals sales granddaddies GTA3 on PS2 ( 11 million ) and GTA Vice City PS2 ( 14 million ) , not to mention the extra bit squeezed out of the original XBox double pack ( 2.2 million , ahem ) .
What this tells us is , despite the smaller PSP install base , even with the PS2's larger install base , not many went for the " expansion packs " that were " Liberty City Stories " and " Vice City Stories " - which is about what you can expect from the XBox DLC - simply a smaller adventure in the pre-existing city .
Where PS3 users will ultimately win , is with that 1/6 to 1/7 ratio .
Based on the above statistics , we can assume that given the fact that the install base is cut in half by limiting the DLC to one system , the DLC will not reach it 's full sales potential on the XBox 360 alone .
The minute Rockstar and Microsoft 's agreement is null and void , you can expect to see the DLC elsewhere , whether on the PSN , or collected as a budget $ 29.95 Blu - Ray disc for PS3 .
The truth of the matter is , Rockstar wo n't " allow " something with the GTA logo on it to " fail " , and will do whatever it takes to milk it for all it 's worth .
Now , if Microsoft 's exclusivity deal with Rockstar for the DLC is 100 % exclusive , owned by Microsoft until the aliens come , then the above numbers do n't mean anything and speculation is worthless .
But , we all know that 's not how these things work ( ahem , Bioshock ) .

Student Built Spider Robot From Spare PartsTUCSON , Ariz . --
Picture a spider - like robot that teaches itself to walk , can adapt when damaged and watches its maker as he moves around the room .
That might sound terrifying .
Add artificial intelligence into the mix and you have all the makings of a science - fiction horror film .
Luckily , the UA electrical engineering senior and creator of the hexapod , Matt Bunting , said he plans to teach the robot only basic emotions .
" I 've definitely thought about adding ( artificial emotion ) , but the emotions would be very simplistic -- happy , sad , bored -- just very simple emotions .
You can only do so much , " he said .
Needless to say , Bunting 's project for his spring 2009 cognitive - robotics class is drawing a lot of attention from the robotics world .
Major companies have offered free equipment and exposure in exchange for his skills .
Bunting 's passion for technology developed early .
When he was 12 , he built a Lego car with an attached Web cam that he used to chase his cat around the house .
In high school , his endeavors became more complex -- like adapting a golf cart to be radio - controlled and installing custom alarm systems in his Jeep .
" I 've always enjoyed robotics , " he said .
" It 's really been an interest of mine ever since I can remember .
" His most ambitious project came after University of Arizona professor Anthony Lewis asked his class to build a robot using class lessons .
Bunting 's resulting hexapod was a " Frankenstein " of spare parts he had collected from previous endeavors .
It was the most impressive device Lewis can recall a student ever turning in .
" The robot was surprisingly complex and sophisticated for a project , " he said .
" It was pretty amazing .
" After giving his student a grade of A , Lewis offered him a job in his lab .
There , Bunting refined his design and posted a video of the upgraded robot on YouTube .------------------------------------------Hexapod robot designed at the Robotics and Neural Systems Laboratory ( RNSL ) at the University of Arizona .
The hexapod is using Robotis AX - 12 , RX - 10 , and RX - 28 servo motors .
The controller is a Fit - PC2 with Intel Atom Z530 Processor computer running Ubuntu 9.04 , with a custom PIC18F4550 based USB board to pipe motor control protocol .
This is a demonstration of the new leg design which is much more solid than the previous design .
Also , new 3D balance gestures have been included based on a spring model .
Balance gestures are shown both turned on and off for comparison .
The gray plastic was designed in Solidworks , and was created using a Dimension BST 1200es 3D printer .
Inverse kinematics is used with a dynamic walking gait .
The dynamics still need work to be smoother and faster .
The legs are not calibrated perfectly either , which can be seen when a foot occasionally lifts up .
Currently the robot has foot contact sensors which will be used in the future for terrain adaptation .
Three AX - 12 motors will be used to control a camera with 3DOF .
For many the Hummer has become a symbol of all that is wrong with America : wastefulness without regard to consequences , entitlement beyond the scope of reason , and individualism to the point of arrogance .
Based off the American military ’s vehicle Hum-vee , which is meant to be driven in combat zones , many are perplexed as to why anyone would choose to drive what is essentially a military design through American suburbs , especially considering that the vehicle gets around 9 - 16 miles per gallon .
However , a new study shows that Hummer owners believe that they in fact possess the ‘ moral highground ’ .
In a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research , scientists conducted interviews with twenty Hummer owners .
“ As we studied American Hummer owners and their ideological beliefs , we found that they consider Hummer driving a highly moral consumption choice , ” write the authors .
“ For Hummer owners it is possible to claim the moral high ground . ”
According to the study , Hummer owners see themselves as upholding American foundational myths , like the “ rugged individual ” and “ boundless frontier ” .
To them they represent a heroic bastion against the ‘ anti- American ’ attitudes they view in their critics .
“ Our analysis of the underlying American identity discourses revealed that being under siege by ( moral ) critics is an historically established feature of being an American , ” the authors explain in their paper .
“ The moralistic critique of their consumption choices readily inspired Hummer owners to adopt the role of the moral protagonist who defends American national ideals . ”

Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada -- Socialist Voice --
On February 12 , 2010 , the corporate sporting behemoth known as the 21st Winter Olympic Games will open to great fanfare here .
In a time of economic hardship and government cuts to social programs across Canada , huge sums of public money have been spent to stage this uber spectacle .
Billions of dollars have been spent constructing venues , a new convention centre and airport terminal ; widening and paving untold kilometres of roads and highways ; building a hugely expensive rapid transit line connecting the city ’s airport to its downtown ; and erecting new hotels to serve the influx of corporate sponsors and spectators .
The hotel , travel , restaurant and real estate industries hope to make a killing off the influx of out - of - town spectators and partygoers .
Construction companies have already earned hundreds of millions of dollars during the years of preparation furiously pouring concrete and asphalt .
The official line says there will also be lots of long - term tourism dollars to be made , though this has not happened in other host cities .
Some of the world ’s largest corporations are games sponsors , including Coca - Cola , VISA , General Electric , Samsung and McDonald’s .
Canadian sponsors include the Royal Bank , Petro Canada , Hudson ’s Bay Company and Bell .
The scale of their participation during the two weeks of competition is such that they have booked entire hotels and restaurants to cater to their executives , invited guests and assorted hangers - on .
Militarisation and clampdown on democratic rights
When Vancouver first submitted a bid for the Winter Olympics , the budget for “ security ” was said to be C$ 175 million .
The final cost will exceed $ 1 billion .
An army of Canadian military , federal police agencies and municipal police , about 10,000 altogether , will police the city , complemented by some 5000 security guards .
A vast network of surveillance cameras of public spaces has been installed , and barbed wire fences and other barriers are going up all over the region to keep protesters and the non-ticket holding public away from games venues .
Police have stepped up harassment and intimidation of anti-Olympics organisers across Canada , in some cases visiting homes and workplaces to interrogate not only games ’ critics but also their acquaintances .
The rationale for the overwhelming display of military and police power is the same as that used to justify the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Palestine -- that behind every corner lurks a potential “ terrorist threat ” and the only way to combat that threat is to wage war .
Police have warned they will arrest anyone who attempts to stage protests near games venues or along key transportation routes .
The Vancouver police have acquired new weapons to deal with critics , including the Long Range Acoustical Device , a loudspeaker system first deployed against civilians in Pittsburgh last year during the G20 meeting of world political leaders .
It emits a powerful sonic wave to disperse crowds .
Transit police , meanwhile , will for the first time introduce dogs into the transit system to randomly sniff passengers and their belongings .
Two special laws have been adopted by the provincial government that , in cooperation with Vancouver ’s city council , will “ clean up ” the city and curtail visible expressions of opposition to the games .
The Assistance to Shelter Act ( termed the “ Olympics Kidnapping Act ” by housing rights advocates ) permits police to remove the homeless or other “ undesirables ” from streets surrounding Olympic venues and dump them at housing shelters or in other municipalities .
Bill 13 regulates public signage .
It is designed to protect the Olympic trademark and those of games sponsors , but critics say it will also be used to censor public expressions of opposition to the games .
At the University of British Columbia , for example , students in residence have been threatened with eviction if they post anti-Olympic signs in their windows .
In mid-December , Vancouver city officials ordered the removal of a mural painted on the outside wall of an art gallery in downtown Vancouver -- four sad faces and one happy face drawn inside the Olympics rings .
Police have refused to say whether police infiltrators will join protests and promote violence .
The issue is not a small one .
At a protest of world leaders in Montebello , Quebec , near Ottawa , in 2007 , infiltrators from the Quebec provincial police urged protesters to throw rocks and incited other forms of violence .
One police infiltration has already come to light .
When the Olympic torch arrived in Victoria , BC , on October 30 to commence its cross-Canada relay spectacle , hundreds of people staged a protest drawing attention to the contrast between lavish public spending on the Olympic Games and miserly funding of social programs .
Protesters blocked the relay for a time using civil - disobedience tactics .
Unknown persons used marbles to disrupt and potentially injure mounted police and their horses being used for crowd control , an action that protest organisers say did not come from their ranks .
One month later in Vancouver , the chief of Victoria police , James Graham , said his force had infiltrated the protest .
He told an amused international security conference , “ You knew that the protesters were n’t that organised when on the ferry on the way over ( from Vancouver ) they rented a bus … and there was a cop driving the bus . ”
Garth Mullins , an organiser with the Olympic Resistance Network , told a public meeting in Vancouver in late November , “ If there is violence at the Olympics , it ’s going to be started by the police . ”
Seated as a panelist at the meeting was Bud Mercer , the head of the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit .
Border controls
Stiffer controls at the nearby US - Canada border are restricting the movements of possible games critics .
On November 25 , 2009 , respected US journalist Amy Goodman , host of the daily Democracy Now !
radio program , was detained for several hours by Canadian border officials while on her way to a speaking engagement in Vancouver .
Although the Olympics was not the subject of her talk , officials were worried it might be .
They grilled her about it for several hours .
Eventually , she was allowed to continue her travel , but was ordered to leave the country within 48 hours .
On December 10 , 2009 , Marla Renn , an organiser with the Olympic Resistance Network in Vancouver and a chairperson of the Stopwar.ca coalition , was refused entry into the United States while on her way to Olympics - related speaking engagements in Portland , Oregon .
She was searched , photographed , fingerprinted and grilled for six hours about her political views and her contacts in the United States .
Her cell phone was taken and accessed , and her books and speaking notes were read and copied .
After that interrogation , she was delivered to Canadian authorities who subjected her to their own interrogation for several more hours .
US authorities ordered her not to return to the United States under threat of detention .
In an account of her treatment published in the weekly Georgia Straight , Renn wrote :
My refused entry to the U.S. , accompanied by interrogation , intimidation , and harassment by officials on both sides of the border , demonstrated once again how $ 1 billion in Olympic security is designed to stifle dissent , even the public - speaking variety , and not to ensure public safety as is officially claimed .
Concern about the conduct of the Olympics security force is especially warranted because of the epidemic of police violence sweeping Canada in recent years .
Tasers have caused dozens of deaths at police hands , including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) killing of Robert Dziekanski at the Vancouver airport in October 2007 that was captured on amateur video and broadcast around the world .
Deaths by police gunshot and common assault by police are on the rise .
In British Columbia alone there were 960 formal complaints of police misconduct in 2009 .
Meanwhile , the weak and ineffective RCMP Public Complaints Commission was effectively shut down by the federal government on December 31 , 2009 , when the four - year term of chair Paul Kennedy ended .
His appointment was not renewed nor has a replacement been named .
Kennedy recently issued a report highly critical of the RCMP ’s conduct in the killing of Dziekanski .
War games
Olympic games have always been a showcase for the militarism of host countries .
The Canadian Armed Forces , now engaged in a ruthless and predatory war in Afghanistan , is prominently featured in the preparations of these games .
Its vehicles routinely accompany the Olympic torch relay as it winds its way across Canada .
Soldiers will be on the streets of Vancouver throughout the competition .
Helicopters and aircraft fighters have been practicing “ security ” missions in the skies above the city for months .
It is rumoured that the opening ceremonies will pay tribute to Canada ’s war in Afghanistan .
By tradition , host countries of the Olympic Games issue calls for cessation of military hostilities and promotion of the “ ideals of peace ” for the duration of the event .
A resolution to this effect was introduced by Canada to the United Nations and approved on October 19 , 2009 – but the government of Canada has made no commitment to observe a truce in Afghanistan in February .
Social housing a victim of the games
Vancouver ’s controversial bid for the Winter Olympics was launched in 1999 by a provincial New Democratic Party government and a federal Liberal Party government .
To sell the bid to a wary population , the games were dressed up as a socially responsible event that would improve the city ’s sporting facilities , build new modes of public transport , employ “ green ” construction techniques and , above all , expand the stock of social housing .
Metropolitan Vancouver has a chronic housing crisis that sees thousands of people living without a roof over their heads and thousands more living in precarious or squalid conditions .
The city has the highest cost of housing and shelter in Canada .
The first and foremost concern about these games was always that poor people living in rooming houses would be evicted by landlords intent on sprucing up their facilities and renting them to games visitors at inflated prices .
A related concern was the expenditure of vast sums of public funds on a sporting event instead of social needs .
A pall of uncertainty hung over the bid even after it was awarded in the summer of 2003 .
The uncertainty was only lifted after deft maneuvreing by municipal politicians in the months that followed .
Vancouver mayor Larry Campbell ( since appointed to the federal senate ) blocked with two right - wing counsellors of the conservative NPA party and three counsellors of the progressive COPE party to hold a non-binding plebiscite on the games .
The yes side won 64 per cent – but only 46 per cent of eligible voters took part and voting was restricted to the City of Vancouver , ignoring the wider metropolitan region , let alone the province .
The yes side enjoyed the endorsement of the opposition New Democratic Party and most of its trade union affiliates .
Proponents of the Winter Olympic Games within the labour and social rights movements argued that support could “ leverage ” promises from the provincial and federal governments for increased social spending .
Yet once the plebiscite was in the bag , the vague promises by governments to build housing for Vancouver ’s poor and homeless population were tossed aside .
The last in a string of abandoned housing promises was the decision in early 2009 by a new city administration ( composed in its majority of a right - wing split from COPE ) to cancel the social housing content of the athletes ’ village , now deemed too expensive .
The village , located in downtown Vancouver , will instead be converted to luxury condominiums after the games .
( A remnant of social housing in the form of subsidised rents for some units is still being debated . )
Outrageously , the village then required a half billion financing guarantee from the City of Vancouver before it could be completed .
Fortress Investment Group of New York refused to continue its financing for the project , a consequence of US financial collapse .
The onset of the economic crisis in September 2008 triggered a new wave of cuts to social programs by the provincial government ( see Socialist Voice , October 5 , 2009 ) .
This is the main reason why public support to the games in the host province has been steadily declining .
Public transport : Another victim of broken Olympics promises
Another victim of broken games promises is public transport .
Most local politicians and transit experts agree that public transport priorities are a rapid service to the northeast of the city , creation of rail service to suburbs in the Fraser River Valley and substantial expansion of bus services .
However , Olympic priorities dictated construction of a rapid transit line connecting the downtown to the airport , at a cost of $ 2 billion , or $ 110 million per kilometre .
Vancouver ’s transit authority , Translink , says the Canada Line and other road and highway expansion has exhausted funds for any new public transport projects .
Meanwhile fares continue to rise .
They have risen 40 per cent in the past eight years .
In November 2009 , chief executive officer of Translink Thomas Prendergast abruptly resigned after 15 months on the job .
He gave no explanation for the decision but Gordon Price , a respected transportation planner and writer , commented that Prendergast “ looked at the situation , saw this was n’t going anywhere and said ‘ What am I doing here ? ’ ”
Price summed up the Vancouver region ’s transportation policy in a commentary in the November 13 , 2009 , Vancouver Sun , “ We ’re going full speed ahead , backwards .
To the world of the 1950s and '60s , when we assumed that we would be driving everywhere for everything , and went out and built it that way .
Now , in most of the region , we ’re doing it again . ”
Protests planned
Despite all the threats and obstacles , protests against the Olympic Games and its scandalous public funding have begun and will continue throughout .
The Olympic torch relay has met protests in many towns and cities across the country .
A key theme of protests have been the deplorable conditions and ongoing violations of the rights of Canada ’s Indigenous population , including those living in urban areas .
The Olympic Resistance Network ( ORN ) launched its work in Vancouver several years ago under the theme “ No Olympics on Stolen Indian Land ” to highlight the fact that much of the land on which the games will take place is unceded Indigenous territory .
One torch relay protest in Nairn Center , northern Ontario , blockaded the Trans Canada Highway on January 2 , 2010 , as the torch procession approached .
Eight young people were arrested and then later released .
One of them , Mark Corbiere from the Anishinabe people , stated in an ORN press release :
VANOC [ the Vancouver Olympic organizing committee ] and the government of Canada can no longer whitewash Canada ’s brutal legacy of ongoing colonialism , nor its abysmal environmental record ; these are the things Canada and VANOC really represent , and we will not let them use the Olympic spotlight to put their lies unchallenged before the global public .
A demonstration will take place in Vancouver to coincide with the opening of the games on February 12 .
It is being organised by the 2010 Welcoming Committee and its sponsoring and participating organisations , including the ORN .
Scores of public information and protest meetings and rallies have been held in the months leading up to the games .
The BC Civil Liberties Association has played a leading role in drawing attention to the violations of civil rights accompanying the Winter Olympics .
It is organising teams of legal observers who will observe political protests as well as other places and events that might experience police misconduct .
One event to take place on February 14 is shaping up as a confrontation with Olympics officials .
It is an annual march through the streets of Vancouver to commemorate the scores of Aboriginal women who have disappeared over the past decades in Canada and are presumed to have met violent deaths .
The traditional march route overlaps Olympic no - go zones .
March organisers say they will not change the traditional route to meet the whims of Olympic officials .
The two - week Olympic spectacle will leave in its wake a legacy of financial debt , deepening impoverishment , violations of civil and social rights , and a significant reinforcement of the tools and weapons of the national security state .
What ’s more , five weeks before the games ’ opening came news of yet another Olympic spending boondoggle in the making – Intrawest Corporation , the owner of the Whistler ski resort where most of the games ’ downhill events will take place , located 100 kilometres north of Vancouver , is in financial default and may require hundreds of millions of dollars of emergency bailout .
Such a legacy deserves to be challenged .

Search functions and Gmail inaccessible for more than an hour as China 's censors fire warning shot
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Google suffered intensive disruption in China tonight just days after it was warned by the authorities to scale back its search operations .
Search functions and Gmail were inaccessible for more than an hour in a move seen by web watchers as a warning shot across the bows by China 's censors .
" This is definitely a warning to Google , as well as other foreign companies , " said Xiao Qiang , the founder of China Digital Times .
" It is also a strong warning to Chinese netizens .
The government is showing its determination to keep the internet under control . "
Earlier in the day , the main state and communist party media - Xinhua and People 's Daily - condemned Google for providing links to pornographic websites through its search engine .
Last week , the government ordered the US company to halt foreign website searches as a punishment .
Many Chinese netizens believe the move is intended to distract attention away from the domestic controversy over Green Dam censorship software , which must be sold with all new computers from 1 July .
In a rare move , the US has lodged a complaint over the tightening of censorship rules .
Google agreed to self - censor in compliance with requests by local officials after setting up a China subsidiary and locally hosted website in 2005 .
One reason for this controversial decision was that its services were frequently being disrupted or slowed .
That has been rare since .
The extent of the latest blockage was not immediately apparent , but the head of Google 's China operations , Kai-Fu Lee posted a call for patience online : " We have received your feedback , we are just investigating , please be patient and wait for feedback from Google overseas , thanks for your support . "
Frustration against censorship is high .
Angry Chinese bloggers have called for a boycott of the internet on 1 July .
Mars Spirit rover gives up the ghost as Nasa abandons space vehicle in sand trap
After spending six years trundling across the rocky surface of the Red Planet , the Mars rover Spirit has finally given up the ghost .
The Nasa rover has driven five miles over plains , plateaus and even up a mountain as tall as the Statue of Liberty .
But now the U.S space agency has conceded defeat after repeated attempts to free it from a sand pit where it has been stuck for the last nine months .
Nasa 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit recorded this forward view of its arm and surroundings during the rover 's 2,052nd Martian day , on October 11 , 2009 .
With Martian winter approaching , the focus instead will turn to improving Spirit 's tilt so its solar panels can receive maximum sunlight .
' Spirit has encountered a golfer 's worst nightmare : the sand trap that no matter how many strokes you take you can't get out of it , ' said Nasa 's Doug McCuistion , who heads the Mars exploration programme .
Nasa said Spirit can still do research while stuck in place , provided it survives the winter .
Scientists wasted no time drawing up new research priorities for the former rover , including studying the planet 's core , tracking the weather and examining the soil in detail .
Spirit and its twin , Opportunity , parachuted to opposite ends of the Martian equator in 2004 .
By poking into craters , drilling into rocks and driving across the bumpy surface , they discovered geological evidence that water flowed on the Martian surface eons ago .
This bird 's - eye view combines a self - portrait of the spacecraft deck and a panoramic mosaic of the Martian surface as viewed by Nasa 's Spirit rover in 2005
Wild rover : Spirit's ' hand , ' is poised in front of the rock nicknamed Adirondack , the rover 's first science target in 2004
Designed to last three months , both have dazzled scientists by working way past their warranty .
They are closing in on the record for the longest - running Mars surface mission held by the Viking 1 lander , which lasted on the red planet for six years and 116 days .
' We 're not giving up on Spirit .
Since the start of this mission , we 've really done everything that we can to try to squeeze every last little bit of science out of these rovers .
We 're going to keep doing exactly that ' said chief scientist Steve Squyres of Cornell University .
Spirit 's troubles began last April .
Driving backward because of a faulty wheel , it broke through the crusty surface and became mired in soft sand .
After spending half a year testing escape routes on Earth , Nasa decided to drive Spirit out the way it came in .
Despite several attempts , the rover 's operators made little progress , and slippage caused the wheels to sink deeper .
This view from the panoramic camera onboard Spirit shows the terrain surrounding the location called ' Troy , ' where Spirit became embedded in soft soil during the spring of 2009 .
The hundreds of images were taken between May and June 2009
Hopes for a great escape dimmed further when another wheel stopped turning , leaving four of its six wheels working .
Spirit started making small progress in the last two weeks by driving backward .
But Nasa conceded that was not enough to get it unstuck before winter .
With attention switched to winter survival , engineers are hurrying to get Spirit in position before the seasons change .
Over the next few weeks , driving commands will be sent to Spirit to try to lift its rear wheels up so that it 's facing north .
The boulder in the foreground is 16 inches tall on Martian sand and about 16 feet away from Spirit .
The false colour image was created in 2006
If the solar - powered robot geologist cannot significantly improve its angle , it will likely hibernate and have limited contact with Earth for months until it reactivates , project manager John Callas said .
Spirit is no stranger to hardship .
It had a rocky start on Mars , going into critical condition and sending nonsense back to Earth weeks after landing .
Engineers eventually fixed the computer problem .
Unlike its twin , Spirit landed in a Connecticut - sized crater named Gusev that contained limited evidence of past water and had to head for the hills to make discoveries .
There were moments of glory .
Spirit climbed a mountain in 2005 .
It also became the first to record dust devils as they were forming , which NASA made into movie clips .
What to do About Erlang 's Records ?
The second most common complaint about Erlang , right after confusion about commas and semicolons as separators , is about records .
Gotta give those complainers some credit , because they 've got taste .
Statically defined records are out of place in a highly dynamic language .
There have been various proposals over the years , including Richard O'Keefe 's abstract syntax patterns and Joe Armstrong 's structs .
Getting one of those implemented needs the solid support of the Erlang system maintainers , and it 's understandably difficult to commit to such a sweeping change to the language .
So what are the alternatives to records that can be used right now ?
To clarify , I 'm really talking about smallish , purely functional dictionaries .
For large amounts of data there 's already the gb_trees module , plus several others with similar purposes .
In Python , a technique I often use is to return a small dictionary with a couple of named values in it .
I could use a tuple , but a dictionary removes the need to worry about order .
This is straightforward in Erlang , too :
fun( length ) -> 46 ; ( width ) -> 17 ; ( color ) -> sea_green end .
Getting the value corresponding to a key is easy enough :
Result ( color )
This is handy , but only in certain situations .
One shortcoming is that there 's no way to iterate through the keys .
Well , there 's this idea :
fun( keys ) -> [ length , width , color ] ; ( length ) -> 46 ; ( width ) -> 17 ; ( color ) -> sea_green end .
Now there 's a way to get a list of keys , but there 's room for error : each key appears twice in the code .
The second issue is there 's no simple way to take one dictionary and create a new one with a value added or removed .
This road is becoming messy to go down , so here 's more data - driven representation :
[ {length , 46} , { width , 17} , {color , sea_green} ]
That 's just a list of key / value pairs , which is searchable via the fast , written - in - C function lists : keyfind .
New values can be appended to the head of the list , and there are other functions in the lists module for deleting and replacing values .
Iteration is also easy : it 's just a list .
We still have n't bettered records in all ways .
A big win for records , and this is something few purely functional data structures handle well , is the ability to create a new version where multiple keys get different values .
For example , start with the above list and create this :
[ {length , 200} , {width , 1400} , {color , sea_green} ]
If we knew that only those three keys were allowed , fine , but that 's cheating .
The whole point of dictionaries is that we can put all sorts of stuff in there , and it does n't change how the dictionary is manipulated .
The general solution is to delete all the keys that should have new values , then insert the new key / value pairs at the head of the list .
Or step through the list and see if the current key is one that has a new value and replace it .
These are not linear algorithms , unfortunately .
And you 've got the same problem if you want to change multiple values in a gb_tree at the same time .
What I 've been using , and I admit that this is n't perfect , is the key / value list approach , but forcing the lists to be sorted .
This allows the original list and a list of changes to be merged together in linear time .
The downside is that I have to remember to keep a literal list in sorted order ( or write a parse transform to do this for me ) .
There 's still one more feature of records that can't be emulated : extracting / comparing values using Erlang 's standard pattern matching capabilities .
It 's not a terrible omission , but there 's no way to dodge this one : it needs compiler and runtime system support .

Woman competing in free - dive comp Cramps at bottom of 7 m pool Beluga whale carries her to top
A DROWNING diver has a beluga whale to thank for helping to save her life after her legs were paralysed by cramps .
Yang
Yun was taking part in a free - diving contest at Polar Land in Harbin , north - east China , in which participants were required to sink seven metres to the bottom of a pool and stay there for as long as possible without the aid of breathing equipment .
Ms Yun , 26 , thought she was going to die amid the beluga whales she shared the arctic pool with , after struggling to move her legs while trying to kick her way to the surface .
" I began to choke and sank even lower and I thought that was it for me - I was dead , ” she told The Sun .
“ Until I felt this incredible force under me driving me to the surface . "
That “ incredible force ” was Mila , a beluga whale which had noticed her distress and clamped its jaws around her leg .
Using her sensitive nose , Mila drove Ms Yun carefully to the surface , to the amazement of onlookers and an underwater photographer who captured the entire incident on film .
" Mila noticed the problem before we did , ” an organiser told The Sun .
" She 's a sensitive animal who works closely with humans and I think this girl owes her her life . "

It ’s modern warfare online poll time again .
While most polls on the internet that are labeled as “ unscientific ” usually fade into obscurity even before all the votes are tallied , every now and then one becomes a meme .
Thursday morning , a Wonkette blog post titled “ Fox News Poll : Yes , We Are Insanely Racist Crazy People ” made it onto Digg ’s recommended list .
ADVERTISEMENT
The FOXNews.com poll asked , “ What Do You Think Tea Party Movement Is About ? ”
How to define the Tea Party movement was nearly as big an issue last week at the National Tea Party Convention as the political issues discussed , from government fiscal responsibility to greater accountability of public officials .
Some participants drew cheers for raising more controversial topics , such as President Obama ’s nationality , but others argued that those points were , at best , politically unproductive .
Meghan McCain went further on Monday and called segments of the movement “ racist . ”
One choice that stands out is “ Fruitless mix of racism , conspiracy theories , ” which — hopefully — was n’t worded to imply that there could be a potentially fruitful mix of the two .
Wonkette ’s Jim Newell cracked , “ What is this about ‘ fruitless ’ though ?
Racism and conspiracy theories have put the Republicans in great shape for 2010 .
If that ’s ‘ fruitless , ’ then consider these teabaggers fruity . ”
When Wonkette wrote the poll up Wednesday late afternoon there were 92,876 votes tallied , with 65 % opting for “ Fruitless mix ” and 23 % saying “ Small government and responsibility . ”
Only 10 % selected “ Voicing outrage at out - of - touch politicians ” , while 2 % picked “ Exposing Democrat ’s socialist agenda . ”
Oddly enough , the poll says 1 % selected “ Other ” , which puts the total at 101 % for the sometimes - mathematically - challenged network .
ADVERTISEMENT
At about an hour before noon on Thursday , 163,793 votes at the Fox poll put “ Fruitless mix ” even further on top with 76 % .
Conservatives are complaining that “ Reddit Loonies Hijack[ed the ] FoxNews Poll ” , while Democratic Underground members chortle at the “ fun ” results they helped elicit .
Last October , RAW STORY reported , “ Using emails , community sites , political blogs and Tweets , conservatives have mounted a strike to ‘ win ’ an online NPR poll on the war between the White House and Fox News . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The 2009 NPR poll asked “ In White House Vs. Fox News War Of Words , Who Gets Your Vote ? ” Conservatives bragged in Tweets that they were helping spin the poll back in favor of Fox , while liberals fought on behalf of the Obama White House .
A Democratic Underground user complained , “ We complain that people can vote more than once in this poll , but then we ’re posting ‘ DU this Poll ’ here for every single poll we find online everyday .
We complain about unscientific polls , but then we ’re encouraging our fellow DU ’ers to make every unscientific poll out there even more unscientific by flooding it with votes from DU .
And for what ?
And if we ’re worried about the ‘ American Public ’ getting a false impression of the nation ’s views by a poll being ‘ freeped , ’ then what ’s our excuse when we flood the same polls with our votes ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A more scientific poll released on Thursday , conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News , shows that “ few Americans say they know much about the ‘ tea party ’ movement , which emerged last year and attracted voters angry at a government they thought was spending recklessly and overstepping its constitutional power . ”
But nearly two - thirds of those polled say they know just some , very little or nothing about what the tea party movement stands for .
About one in eight says they know “ a great deal ” about the positions of tea party groups , but the lack of information does not erase the appeal : About 45 percent of all Americans say they agree at least somewhat with tea partiers on issues , including majorities of Republicans and independents . ….
The new poll shows Republicans divided about the tea party movement , which threatens to cause a rift in the lead - up to November ’s midterm elections .
Two - thirds of those calling themselves “ strong Republicans ” view the movement favorably , compared with 33 percent among “ not very strong Republicans . ”
Overall opinion is about evenly split , with 35 percent of all Americans holding favorable views of the movement and 40 percent unfavorable ones .
A quarter expressed no opinion .
Nearly six in 10 Democrats have unfavorable views , while independents are split , 39 percent positive and 40 percent negative .
“ The new poll offers a portrait of tea party supporters as overwhelmingly white , mostly conservative and generally disapproving of Obama , ” the Post reports .

The Post / ABC News poll did n’t contain any questions linking the movement to racism or conspiracy theories .
Google has been hit with a barrage of anti-trust complaints in Germany , with two publisher groups , a mapping firm and a Microsoft - owned ad firm launching an enveloping movement on the ad broker and sometime search firm .
The quartet of actions follow hard on the heels of a Paris - backed pummeling for Google in France , and a little local difficulty in China .
Germany 's Federation of Newspaper Publishers and Association of German Magazine Publishers have both taken umbrage at the search engine 's serving up of slivers of news articles without payment .
Meanwhile , Euro - Cities , a German mapping firm , has apparently complained that Google 's policy of letting just anyone embed Google maps in their sites is anti-competitive and is killing its own business .
Lastly , Ciao , a price comparison and review site owned by Microsoft , is trying to wiggle out of a contract that ties it into showing Google adsense ads .
Microsoft claims the deal violates competition rules , a claim which presumably has nothing to do with Microsoft wanting to build its own advertising business .
At first glance , the Microsoft suit smacks of a contractual spat rather than a genuine competition issue .
However , the publishers and the mapping firm 's complaints are hinting at broader issues .
In the case of mapping , Google has so much cash lying around that it can give stuff away for free - meaning other firms are deprived of their business models .
It 's the same complaint firms are making in the US about the firm 's bid to run the white space database .
And the German publishers ' complaints are arguably more significant than the Belgian publishers ' complaint that was settled back in 2007 .
For a start , they include some heavyweight pan-European players like Axel Springer .
Plus since 2007 , publishers worldwide have become much more vocal about what they see as Google 's free riding on their content , with the likes of Rupert Murdoch happy to call Google a parasite for its co-opting of his content .
It 's fair to say that the German intellectual elite may be a little more in tune with the publisher 's complaints than they may have been a few years ago .
Last week , German justice minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger said the firm was becoming a monopoly .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has slated the firm 's book scanning project .
Germany 's position is broadly in line with France , whose culture minister has slammed Google books , while president Sarkozy has floated the idea of a special Google tax to offset the pain caused to French auteurs and artists by Google - aided piracy .
A Google spokesperson told Bloomberg it was " convinced " that it complied with all the relevant German and European laws .
It would be an incredibly cynical person who would suggest that Google 's sudden qualms about working in China and subsequent seeking of Hillary Clinton 's protection had anything to do with a suddenly more hostile regulatory environment in Europe . ®
The Problem : Confused Consumers
Sounds great , right ?
Now you do n't have to be a seasoned professional investor to capitalize on all the great real estate deals out there .
You just need an Internet connection and a bank account to wire funds to your auction account for the required 5 % deposit .
This means lots of novices are getting involved , but that 's a problem .
Even though disclosures exist to warn bidders that they should thoroughly research the properties they 're bidding on , confused consumers who think they 're getting a great deal are sometimes bidding on what might as well be toxic waste .
In fact , the auction websites contain listings for all kinds of foreclosed property .
That means not all the listings are first mortgages : some are second liens .
In some cases , bidders think they 're getting an ownership interest on a condominium , when they 're actually getting a worthless second lien that the condo association has levied on the foreclosed occupant for unpaid maintenance fees .
An Example
The best way to understand what 's going on is through considering an actual example .
Last Thursday , February 18th , a bidding war went on for a listing on the auction web site for Miami - Dade 's Clerk of Court .
Here 's a screen shot of the listing ( click for larger image ) :
As you can see , it shows the assessed value of this property as $ 213,969 .
Yet , the judgment amount is only $ 5,210 .
To an unsuspecting consumer , it sounds like you could get a great deal .
Bidding started at $ 8,600 at 10:28 am .
The auction ended at 1:24 pm with the winning bid of $ 20,500 .
But this winner was actually a loser .
If you perform a records search , you find out that the defendant ( foreclosed occupant ) has another foreclosure lawsuit pending on the same property by Chase Home Finance , LLC .
Yet , the plaintiff in the lawsuit for the auction listing above is Walnut Park Homeowners Assn Inc -- not Chase Home Finance .
And you can find that separate lawsuit pending through the records search too .
This implies that a title search will almost certainly show that Chase Home Finance has the 1st mortgage on the property , while Walnut Park Homeowners Assn has a 2nd lien for $ 5,210 on the occupant 's unpaid maintenance fees .
Remember , when someone stops paying his mortgage on a condo , he often also stops paying his fees .
The Consequences
So what happens to the " winner " of a second lien ?
Well , they 've purchased garbage .
Now , they may be able to move into that condo for a few days , weeks or months .
But the bank that holds the mortgage will still ultimately foreclose , wiping out that second lien .
She never had an authentic ownership interest .
Then , the winner must then vacate the premises , unless she wants to pay whatever the bank demands to wipe out its first mortgage , often hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Think about the insanity of what 's going on here .
Bidders are paying a premium for a second lien .
And it 's worthless : a first lien foreclosure will automatically extinguish that second lien anyway .
In the example above , the bidder agreed to pay approximately four times the debt incurred by the former occupant 's unpaid maintenance fees .
Why ?
Obviously because she thought she was getting an ownership interest in the condo for a steal .
Unfortunately , she did n't do her homework .

If officials in Pennsylvania 's capital , Harrisburg , have their way , the borough of Centralia , Pa. , will soon cease to exist .
There 's not much left of the northeastern Pennsylvania coal town these days .
Even in the early 1980s , some two decades after the underground fires began , more than a thousand people called Centralia home .
But as the poisonous gases continued to seep from fissures in the ground , and as the sudden sinkholes threatened to cast people into the smoldering depths , the town emptied out .
Today , fewer than a dozen people remain .
Now the state wants those last holdouts gone .
As the Associated Press 's Michael Rubinkam reports , state officials have ordered Centralia 's remaining residents to leave so that their homes can be demolished .
Nobody really knows exactly what started the fire , which began at a town dump in 1962 .
The burning trash ignited an exposed coal seam , and the fires seeped into the labyrinth of tunnels and shafts below .
Over the next two decades , firefighters tried eight times to douse the subterranean blaze , but the fire always seemed to be several steps ahead of them .
Eventually , they gave up .
Extinguishing the fire would be too expensive , and anyway it did n't seem to pose too much danger .
In the early years of the fire , Centralians enjoyed not having to shovel their sidewalks and being able to harvest tomatoes from the warm ground in midwinter , Smithsonian magazine notes .
But then , as the ground below turned to ash , the pavement started to buckle .
The trees started dying .
People started passing out in their homes from the toxic fumes .
Centralia 's moment of clarity came in 1981 , when the ground beneath 12 - year - old Todd Domboski opened up .
Todd , who had been cutting through a resident 's yard , saved himself from plunging into the toxic inferno below by clinging to a tree root until a cousin rescued him .
Two years later , Congress appropriated $ 42 million to buy and demolish every home in the town .
By 1990 , only 63 people remained .
In 2002 , the US Postal Service eliminated Centralia 's ZIP Code .
Still , a few diehards remained , squatting in houses they no longer own after the government seized them through eminent domain in the early 1990s .
Some claim that the whole thing is a plot to seize mineral rights .
As the Monitor 's Carmen Sisson noted in 2006 , Centralia 's mammoth deposits of anthracite , which once promised limitless prosperity , are now expected to burn for another 250 years .
Today , the town is not so much of a ghost town as it is a big open space with a grid of empty streets .
The homes have been demolished , the rubble cleared , and the driveways now lead to nowhere .
As the AP 's Michael Rubinkam notes , it did n't have to be this way .
Had town officials taken swift action back when they first became aware of it , Centralia could still exist .
Half - measures .
Complacence .
Conspiracy theories .
Denial .
These themes are familiar to anyone who follows environmental topics .
As Centralia is deleted from Pennsylvania 's official registers , we can only hope that the name will remain in our minds as a lesson about how creeping , incremental threats can , if ignored , destroy the very ground ground beneath our feet .

Let me be blunt : charging people $ 500.00 plus the costs of travel and lodging to go to a “ National Tea Party Convention ” run by a for profit group no one has ever heard of sounds as credible as an email from Nigeria promising me a million bucks if I fork over my bank account number .

Iceland 's president has refused to sign a controversial bill to repay $ 5 bn ( £ 3.1 bn ) to the UK and the Netherlands .
President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson said he would instead hold a referendum on the bill , following public protests .
The legislation was designed to compensate governments forced to bail out their savers with Icesave accounts following Iceland 's banking collapse .
Opponents argue the terms of the payments will unfairly hurt Iceland and its recovery from economic crisis .
Some reports say those opponents form a large majority of Icelanders - some 70 % are said to be likely to vote " no " in a referendum .
Legislation to repay the money was approved by Iceland 's parliament in December , but the approval of the president is also required before it can be passed into law .
It is now up to the government to decide how to proceed .
It must consider whether to go ahead with a referendum or whether to withdraw the bill and reopen negotiations with the UK and the Netherlands about a repayment schedule .
The right to choose
The government has seen significant public opposition to the bill .
THE STORY SO FAR ...
Early October 2008 : Icelandic banks collapse forcing the government to take control October 2008 : Amid a bitter row with Iceland over who should pay , UK and the Netherlands promise to compensate their nationals who have Icesave accounts November 2008 : IMF approves $ 2.1 bn loan for Iceland .
Financial support from other countries brings total amount to $ 10 bn .
June 2009 : Iceland 's new government agrees to reimburse UK and Netherlands August 2009 : Icelandic parliament approves first Icesave bill detailing payment schedule September 2009 : UK and the Netherlands reject payment terms December 2009 : Amended bill with more stringent conditions approved by parliament On Saturday , the president received a petition calling for the bill to be vetoed , signed by almost a quarter of the country 's population .
Campaigners against the bill say that the Icelandic public are being forced to pay for the mistakes of banks .
The total compensation package equates to about 12,000 euros ( $ 17,300 ; £ 10,800 ) per Icelandic citizen .
Announcing the decision to hold a referendum on the bill , President Grimsson said that the Icelandic public had the right to choose .
" It is the job of the president of Iceland to make sure the nation 's will is answered , " he said .
" I have decided ... to take the new law to the nation .
The referendum will take place as quickly as possible . "
Lending doubts
In response to the decision , the Icelandic parliament , which approved the new bill last month , said the move could further tarnish Iceland 's image abroad .
ANALYSIS By Ingibjorg Thordardottir , BBC News
The president 's decision to call a referendum on the Icesave law is likely to be met with mixed reactions by the Icelandic people .
Many believe Iceland is paying too much back to Britain and the Netherlands and want the law courts to decide what the fair repayment amount should be .
Others say that passing the law is fundamental to Iceland 's economic recovery - especially since bodies like the IMF and the Nordic countries have said they will not release much needed loans unless an Icesave agreement is finalised .
The decision is a blow to the Icelandic government which sees the legislation as a vital step in Iceland 's economic recovery .
It will now have to decide whether to withdraw the bill and try to renegotiate a different deal with the UK and the Netherlands or to go ahead with a referendum .
The prime minister has already made it clear that Iceland will honour its international obligations but has not said how that will be done .
But the president says that a referendum is the the only way for there to be a fair and conclusive result for the Icelandic people to this drawn - out crisis .
" Uncertainty ... in the formal dealings with others countries can have unforeseen , wide - ranging and potentially damaging consequences for our society , " warned Johanna Sigurdardottir , Iceland 's Prime Minister .
The Treasury 's City Minister , Lord Myners , said he shared the Icelandic parliament 's disappointment , and warned the public against voting against the bill in the referendum " The Icelandic people , if they took that decision , would effectively be saying that Iceland does n't want to be part of the international financial system , " he said .
The Dutch government said Iceland was still " compelled to pay back the money " .
BBC Brussels correspondent Dominic Hughes said the longer - term impacts of the decision could be significant for both political and economic reasons .
" It 's seen as a blow to the country 's hopes of a quick entry to the European Union , " he said .
" In fact , the whole debate has soured feeling in Iceland towards the EU .
" It also throws doubt on further aid payments to Iceland from international lenders . "
Iceland 's credit status has already taken a knock .
One agency that grades the fitness of a country 's finances , Fitch Ratings , has put the country 's debt rating at " junk " status , meaning it must pay a higher interest rate to attract borrowers who are not certain to be paid back .
The crisis in Iceland 's banks forced it to borrow billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) - loans made on the condition that the issue of Icesave compensation would be resolved .

Those wishing to express outrage can do so at Showdown In Chicago on October 25 - 27 .
Showdown is a series of demonstrations when thousands of Americans - retirees , farmers , workers , homeowners , renters , students , clergy , and small business owners - come together on the streets of Chicago to demand a banking system that puts the American people first and a Congress that makes it happen !
Dean Baker , Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , says Wo n't You Please Come to Chicago ?
A bill that would require the Fed to disclose what it did with more than $ 2 trillion in loans to banks and other financial institutions was originally co-sponsored by Ron Paul and Alan Grayson , one of the most conservative and one of the most progressive members of Congress .
Due to public pressure , it now has more than 270 co-sponsors .
Reining in the power of the financial industry will be a long hard fought war , but it is one that must be fought .
The crates of whisky were found under a hut built and used by Shackleton Five crates of Scotch whisky and brandy belonging to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton have been recovered after more than 100 years in the ice .
They were buried beneath Shackleton 's Antarctic hut , built in 1908 for a failed expedition to the South Pole .
Some of the crates have cracked and ice has formed inside , which means experts will face a delicate task in trying to extract the contents .
The ice - bound crates were first discovered three years ago .
The master blender at whisky company Whyte and Mackay said the find was a " gift from the heavens " for whisky lovers .
Richard Paterson , whose firm supplied the Mackinlay 's whisky for Shackleton , said : " If the contents can be confirmed , safely extracted and analysed , the original blend may be able to be replicated .
The unexpected find of the brandy crates ... are a real bonus
Al Fastier
New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust " Given the original recipe no longer exists this may open a door into history . "
The alcohol was removed from the ice by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust , which had initially believed there to be just two crates .
Al Fastier from the trust said : " To our amazement we found five crates , three labelled as containing whisky and two labelled as containing brandy .
" The unexpected find of the brandy crates , one labelled Chas Mackinlay & Co and the other labelled The Hunter Valley Distillery Limited , Allandale , are a real bonus . "
Shackleton 's expedition to reach the South Pole was unsuccessful Mr Fastier said the trust was confident the crates contained intact alcohol , given that liquid could be heard when the crates were moved .
The smell of whisky in the surrounding ice also indicated full bottles of spirits were inside , albeit that one or more might have broken .
Shackleton 's expedition ran short of supplies on their long trek to the South Pole from Cape Royds in 1907 - 1909 and they eventually fell about 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) short of their goal .
Shackleton 's expedition sailed from Cape Royds hurriedly in 1909 as winter ice began forming in the sea , forcing them to leave some equipment and supplies , including the whisky , behind .
However , no lives were lost .
The pole was first reached in 1911 by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen .

It seems like an annual rite : to usher in the new year , cable providers and networks squabble over programming fees .
This time around , the tussles involved Time Warner Cable and Fox , and Cablevision and Scripps , which owns the Food Network and HGTV .
These fights , unlike most corporate standoffs , are waged in public , with both sides running TV spots and newspaper ads pleading their cause .
This might seem like an obvious strategy , but it ’s also a dangerous one .
These ads may remind some viewers of how much they love Bobby Flay .
But they also remind those who ’ve never glanced at “ Iron Chef ” how much of their cable bill goes to channels that they do n’t watch .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
That ’s a problem , because while cable TV has always relied on “ bundling ” — you have to buy a package of channels rather than picking only those you want — in recent years the practice has come under fire , in no small part because the price of those bundles keeps rising .
The bundles do , of course , include many more channels than they did a decade ago .
But , as Kevin Martin , the former head of the F.C.C. , was fond of pointing out , if you ’re watching only sixteen channels why should you pay for eighty - five ?
So consumer advocates have been pushing for a system of so - called “ à la carte ” programming , expecting that this would drive down prices for consumers .
In fact , it probably would n’t .
The simple argument for unbundling is : “ If I pay sixty dollars for a hundred channels , I ’d pay a fraction of that for sixteen channels . ”
But that ’s not how à- la - carte pricing would work .
Instead , the prices for individual channels would soar , and the providers , who would n’t be facing any more competition than before , would tweak prices , perhaps on a customer - by - customer basis , to maintain their revenue .
That does n’t necessarily mean that Bravo would suddenly cost fifteen dollars a month , but there ’s little evidence to suggest that à- la - carte packages would be generally cheaper than the current bundles .
One recent paper on the subject , in fact , estimated the best - case gain to consumers at thirty - five cents a month .
But even if it was n’t a boon to consumers an à-la - carte system would inject huge uncertainty into the cable business , and many cable networks would n’t get enough subscribers to survive .
That ’s a future that the industry would like to avoid .
So far , the task has n’t been too difficult , in part because consumers have n’t shown much unbundling fervor .
If there were sizable demand for à la carte , you ’d expect at least one of cable ’s competitors , like DirecTV , Dish Network , or Verizon ’s FiOS , to offer it , but none do .
You ’d also think that , as bundles have grown more expensive , and as building your own TV experience has become easier — by watching online , downloading from iTunes , and getting high - definition network broadcasts via antenna — cable and satellite would have got less popular .
But subscriptions continue to grow .
Some of this , presumably , is just inertia .
But it ’s also true that consumers often find bundles appealing .
Many popular consumer products , like the iPhone , are bundles , as are newspapers and magazines : you buy the whole thing , not only the articles you want to read .
TV networks themselves are bundles : if you subscribe to HBO ( a channel that cable systems do offer à la carte ) , you pay for all its shows .
Consumers also seem to like another form of bundling ; namely , flat - rate pricing .
At Disneyland , people used to pay an admission fee and then buy tickets for individual rides .
But in 1982 Disney introduced all - in - one pricing , and attendance rose .
Likewise , people buy gym memberships instead of paying by the visit , prefer all - in - one calling plans , and vehemently oppose the idea of metered Internet access .
The appeal of bundling is partly that it reduces transaction costs : instead of having to figure out how much each part of a package is worth to you , you can make a blanket judgment .
Bundling eliminates the problem of fretting about small expenditures , which may be one reason that flat - rate pricing is very common in the vacation industry ( cruise ships , all - inclusive travel packages , and so on ) .
It also offers what economists call option value : you may never watch those sixty other channels , but the fact that you could if you wanted to is worth something .
Many consumers also perceive bundles as bargains ; getting a bunch of things for one price feels like a deal , even when it ’s not .
This ought to mean that cable providers and TV networks have little to worry about .
But their reasonably stable world could easily be upended .
Successful bundling depends on the idea that what you ’re paying for is “ cable television , ” rather than merely a collection of channels .
Public fights over programming costs disrupt that idea .
When HGTV says it wants more money for its programming , it makes people who do n’t watch HGTV wonder why they should pay anything for it at all .
And , as these fights raise the cost of programming , the bundle looks less like a bargain , and the appeal of à la carte grows .
Both the providers and the networks , then , would benefit from dialling down the volume and the price increases .
But , while it ’s in the long - term interest of the industry to keep consumers happy with bundling , it ’s in the short - term interest of the individual players to maximize profits , even if that means alienating viewers and making alternatives to bundling look better .
In the past decade , media businesses , from music to newspapers , have suffered from the impact of unbundling .
Civil wars in the cable business make it likely that it ’ll be next . ♦

Java Build Tools : Ant vs. Maven
TRANSLATIONS : Spanish ( gracias , José ! )
UPDATED 2010 -01-06 : linked to demonstration of the “ 10 minute mvn clean build ” problem , and added notes about : slow build times , excessive memory use , bad test result output , untrusted repository artifacts , and external configuration files .
UPDATED 2010 - 02 - 21 : linked to Spanish translation ( courtesy of José Manuel Prieto )
The best build tool is the one you write yourself .
Every project ’s build process is unique , and often individual projects need to be built multiple different ways .
It is impossible for tool authors to anticipate every build ’s requirements , and foolhardy to try ( Apache developers : take note ) .
The best any tool can do is provide a flexible library of reusable tasks that can easily be adapted to your needs , but even that is insufficient .
Off - the - shelf tasks never suit your project perfectly .
You will waste countless hours struggling to make those tasks do exactly what you need , only to give up and write a plugin instead .
Writing your own custom build tool is quick and easy , and requires less maintenance than you fear .
Do n’t be afraid : builds should fit your project , not the other way around .
If you do n’t want to write your own build tool , then you should use Rake .
Rake is the best existing build tool for Java projects .
Rake provides a bunch of standard methods to perform common build tasks , and anything else can be quickly implemented in Ruby .
Writing build scripts in a real programming language gives
Rake a huge advantage over other tools .
There are other advantages , too , but none are as important .
So , you should write custom build tools for your projects .
If you do n’t want to , then you should switch to Rake .
If you ca n’t switch , you should lobby for the right to switch .
If politics drives technology decisions , if you will never be allowed to switch , then quit your job or leave the project .
If you lack the courage to quit , then use Ant .
Ant is the second best existing build tool for Java projects .
Although inferior to Rake ,
Ant is still a great build tool .
Ant is mature and stable , it is fast , and it comes with a rich library of tasks .
Ant makes it possible ( but not at all easy ) to script rich , complex builds processes custom - tailored to your project .
So , write your own build tool , or else switch to Rake , or fight to switch to Rake , or quit and go some place where you can use Rake .
And if all else fails , use Ant until you can find a new job somewhere else that uses Rake .
That ’s it !
Those are the only choices I can recommend !
Because you never , ever , under any circumstances want to use Maven !
Maven builds are an infinite cycle of despair that will slowly drag you into the deepest , darkest pits of hell ( where Maven itself was forged ) .
You will initially only spend ten minutes getting Maven up and running , and might even be happy with it for a while .
But as your project evolves , and your build configuration grows , the basic pom.xml that you started with will prove inadequate .
You will slowly add more configuration to get things working the way you need , but there ’s only so much you can configure in Maven .
Soon , you will encounter Maven ’s low glass ceiling for the first time .
By “ encounter , ” I mean “ smash your head painfully against . ”
By “ for the first time , ” I mean “ you will do this repeatedly and often in the future . ”
Eventually , you ’ll figure out some convulted pom.xml hackery to work around your immediate issue .
You might even be happy with Maven again for a while … until another limitation rears its ugly little head .
It ’s a lot like some tragic Greek myth , only you are the damned soul and the eternity of suffering is your build process .
Seriously .
Maven is a horrible implementation of bad ideas .
I believe someone , somewhere had ( perhaps still has ) a vision for Maven that was sensible , if not seductive .
But the actual implementation of Maven lacks any trace of such vision .
In fact , everything in Maven is so bad that it serves as a valuable example of how not to build software .
You know your build is awesome when it works the opposite of Maven .
Consider the test results output from Maven ’s Surefire plugin .
Everything seems fine as long as all of your tests are passing , but Surefire reports are a nightmare to debug when things go wrong !
The only information logged to the console is the name of the failing test class .
You must manually cross-reference that name with a log file written in the target / surefire - reports / directory , but those logs are written one per test class !
So , if multiple test classes fail , you must separately check multiple log files .
It seems like a minor thing , but it quickly adds up to a major annoyance and productivity sink .
Maven advocates claim their tool embraces the principle of Convention Over Configuration ; Maven advocates are liars .
The only convention Maven supports is : compile , run unit tests , package . jar file .
Getting Maven to do anything else requires configuring the conventions .
Want to package a .war file ?
Configure it .
Want to run your application from the command line ?
Configure it .
Want to run acceptance tests or functional tests or performance tests with your build , too ?
You can configure it , but it involves not running your unit tests , or not running them during the conventional unit test phase of your build process , or …
Want to generate code coverage metrics for your project ?
You can configure that , too , but your tests will run twice ( or only once , but not during the conventional unit test phase ) , and sometimes it reports 0 % code coverage despite the comprehensive test suite .
Speaking of configuration , Maven has the worst configuration syntax since Sendmail : alternating normal form XML .
As a consequence , Maven configuration is verbose , difficult to read and difficult to write .
Things you can do in one or two lines of Ruby or XML with Rake or Ant require six , seven , eight lines of pom.xml configuration ( assuming it ’s even possible with Maven ) .
There ’s nothing consistent about Maven ’s configuration , either .
Some things are configured as classpath references to . properties files bundled in . jar files configured as dependencies , some things are configured as absolute or relative paths to files on disk , and some things are configured as system properties in the JVM running Maven .
And some of those absolute paths are portable across projects because Maven knows how to correctly resolve them , but some are not .
And sometimes Maven is smart enough to recursively build projects in the correct order , but sometimes it ’s not .
And some things are n’t even configured in the pom !
Some things , like Maven repositories , servers , and authentication credentials , are configured in settings.xml .
It is perfectly reasonable to want to keep user ’s passwords out of pom.xml files which will be checked into the project ’s version control repository .
But Maven ’s solution is terrible : all this configuration goes in a settings.xml file that lives outside of any project ’s directory .
You ca n’t directly share any of this configuration between your desktop and laptop , or with other developers , or with your project ’s build servers .
But it is automatically shared with every single Maven project you work with , and potentially every single Maven project every user on that machine works with .
When a new developer joins your project , they must manually merge the necessary configuration into their existing settings.xml .
When a new agent is added to your build server farm , the necessary configuration is manually merged into its existing settings.xml .
Ditto for when you migrate to a new machine .
And when any of this configuration needs to be updated , it must be manually updated on every single machine !
This was a solved problem before Maven came along , too : properties files .
Project teams can put generic configuration like this in a properties file which is checked in to version control , and individual developers can override that information in local properties file which are not checked in to version control .
All this stuff in Maven — the conventions , the configuration , the process — is governed by “ The Maven Way ” .
Unfortunately , “ The Maven Way ” is undocumented .
You can catch fleeting glimpses of it by trawling the Maven documentation , searching the Google , or buying books written by Maven developers .
The other way you encounter “ The Maven Way ” is by tripping over ( or smashing against ) its invisible boundaries .
Maven was not built to be flexible , and it does not support every possible build process .
Maven was built for Apache projects , and assumes every project ’s build process mirrors Apache ’s own .
That ’s great news for open - source library developers who volunteer on their own time and to whom “ release ” means “ upload a new .zip file to your website for others to manually find , download , and add to their own projects . ”
It sucks for everyone else .
While Rake and Ant can accommodate every build process , Maven can’t ; it is possible , and in fact quite likely , that Maven just does n’t support the way you want to build your software .
And Maven ’s dependency management is completely , entirely , irrevocably broken .
Actually , I take that back ;
Maven ’s strategy of downloading ibiblio to the user ’s home directory and then dumping everything on the classpath is incredibly stupid and wrong and should never be confused with “ dependency management . ”
I recently worked on a Maven project which produced a 51 MB .war file ; by switching to Ant with hand - rolled dependency management , we shrunk that .war file down to 17 MB .
Hrmmm … 51 – 17 = 34 = 17 × 2 , or : 2/3 of the original bulk was useless crap Maven dumped on us .
Extraneous dependencies do n’t just eat up disk space , they eat up precious RAM , too !
Maven is an all - around memory hog .
Relatively simple projects , with only a parent pom and a few sub-modules , require extensive JVM memory tuning with all those fancy JAVA_OPTS settings you typically only see on production servers .
Things are even worse if your Maven build is integrated with your IDE .
It ’s common to set your JVM ’s max heap size to several hundred megabytes , the max permgen size to a few hundred megabytes , and enable permgen sweeping so classes themselves are garbage collected .
And all this just to build your project , or work with Maven in your IDE !
Funny story : on that same project I once endured a ten minute “ mvn clean ” build because Maven thought it needed yet more crap in order to “ rm - rf ./ target / ” ( see a similar example : http://gist.github.com/267553).
Actually , there ’s nothing funny about that story ; trust me : you do n’t want a build tool which automatically downloads unresolved dependencies before cleaning out your build output directories .
You do n’t want a build tool which automatically downloads unresolved dependencies , PERIOD !
Automatically downloading unresolved dependencies makes your build process nondeterministic !
Good ol ’ nondeterminism : loads of fun in school , not so fun at work !
And all that unnecessary , unwanted network chatter takes time .
You pay a performance penalty for Maven ’s broken dependency management on every build .
Ten minute clean builds are horrible , but adding an extra minute to every build is even worse !
I estimate the average additional overhead of Maven is about one minute per build , based on the fact that the one time I switched from Maven to Ant the average build time dropped from two and a half minutes to one and a half .
Similarly , the one time I switched from Ant to Maven the average build time increased from two minutes to three .
You have no control over , and limited visibility into , the dependencies specified by your dependencies .
Builds will break because different copies of Maven will download different artifacts at different times ; your local build will break again in the future when the dependencies of your dependencies accidentally release new , non-backwards compatible changes without remembering to bump their version number .
Those are just the innocent failures , too ; the far more likely scenario is your project depends on a specific version of some other project which in turn depends on the LATEST version of some other project , so you still get hosed even when downstream providers do remember to bump versions !
Every release of every dependency ’s dependencies becomes a new opportunity to waste several hours tracking down strange build failures .
But Maven is even worse than that : not only does Maven automatically resolve your project ’s dependencies , it automatically resolves its own plugins ’ dependencies , too !
So now not only do you have to worry about separate instances of Maven accidentally downloading incompatible artifacts ( or the same instance downloading incompatible artifacts at different times ) , you also have to worry about your build tool itself behaving differently across different machines at different times !
Maven ’s broken dependency management is also a gaping security hole , since it is currently impossible in Maven to determine where artifacts originally came from and whether or not they were tampered with .
Artifacts are automatically checksummed when they are uploaded to a repository , and Maven automatically verifies that checksum when it downloads the artifact , but Maven implicitly trusts the checksum on the repository it downloaded the artifact from .
The current extent of Maven artifact security is that the Maven developers control who has write access to the authoritative repository at ibiblio .
But there is no way of knowing if the repository you download all your dependencies from was poisoned , there is no way of knowing if your local repository cache was poisoned , and there is no way of knowing which repository artifacts in your local repository cache came from or who uploaded them there .
These problems are not caused by careless developers , and are not solved by using repository managers to lock down every artifact Maven needs .
Maven is broken and wrong if it assumes humans never make mistakes .
Maven is broken and wrong if it requires users to explicitly specify every version of every dependency , and every dependency ’s dependencies , to reduce the likelihood of downloading incompatible artifacts .
Maven is broken and wrong if it requires a third - party tool to prevent it connecting to the big , bad internets and automatically downloading random crap .
Maven is broken and wrong if it thinks nothing of slowing down every build by connecting to the network and checking every dependency for any updates , and automatically downloading them .
Maven is broken and wrong if it behaves differently on my laptop at the office and at home .
Maven is broken and wrong if it requires an internet connection to delete a directory .
Maven is broken and wrong .
Save yourself .
Digital purchases might be the future , but that 's just the thing with the future ; it 's in the future .
Today is the present , and today , people still prefer buying things that are pressed on plastic and come in boxes .

A study performed by the NPD Group has found that during Q3 2009 ( August - September ) , 90 % of all game purchases were " physical " , meaning they came on a disc or cartridge .
Leaving the other 10 % of purchases to be ... anyone ?
Yes , digital , meaning they were downloaded .
The study also had some interesting numbers on games piracy , especially if you 're a Nintendo , Microsoft or Sony executive gripped by fear : " only " six million gamers admitted to downloading games illegally during the same period .
Six million sounds like a lot , but the NPD Group say that 's only 4 % of all gamers .

And of that 4 % , 72 % of the pirating was being done on PC and Mac .
So while console piracy is definitely a problem , it 's might not be the epidemic some platform holders and publishers would have you believe .

Angry with the way Citibank was handling his account , William A .
White dug up a bank employee 's home address , her telephone number and the name of her husband .
He then sent the information to Jennifer Petsche in an e-mail , threatening to share it with other dissatisfied customers .
" Consider this , " White wrote .
" As I 'm sure , being in the collection business and having the attitude about it that you do , that you often make people upset .
Lord knows that drawing too much publicity and making people upset is what did in Joan Lefkow . "
But because
White sought personal gain from Petsche -- he wanted to improve his credit score by getting her to clear up his disputed credit card debt -- prosecutors have charged him with threatening her with the intent to extort .
Roanoke Times
White , the self - proclaimed commander of the American National Socialist Workers Party , was convicted of three counts of communicating threats in interstate commerce and one count of witness intimidation , the U.S. Justice Department said in a release .
White , who was acquitted on three other counts , faces a maximum of 25 years in prison .
UPI
The verdict , however , was not a total repudiation of White 's assertion that the First Amendment should protect his incendiary speech .
Of seven counts against White , the federal jury acquitted him of three .
White , who will be sentenced later , could face up to 35 years in prison .
At least for now , the convictions will silence a man called " possibly the loudest and most obnoxious neo -Nazi leader in America " by the Southern Poverty Law Center , which monitors hate groups
In closing arguments to the jury , Justice Department attorney John Richmond spent more than an hour recounting the personal attacks and death wishes that White leveled against a bank employee from Missouri , a nationally syndicated columnist from Maryland , a university administrator from Delaware , a small - town mayor from New Jersey , a human rights lawyer from Canada and two tenants of an apartment complex in Virginia Beach .
White has been in jail almost continuously since his arrest in October 2008 .
The convictions marked a huge setback for an online agitator who up until now has managed to straddle the fine line between free speech and illegal threats .
Earlier this year , a judge in Chicago dismissed a similar charge against White on free speech grounds .
Roanoke Times
William A. White ( " Bill White " ) and I do n't agree on a whole heck of a lot , but I respect his intelligence and clarity .
Sadly , we wo n't have him as part of the discussion anymore because some people were upset by his words :
Looks like a loophole : she was scared , he stood to gain -- by not getting reamed by a bill collector .
Very dodgy logic here .
More detail : This is bad news indeed .
While
White may have stepped over the line , time in jail for speech is not a good precedent -- especially since loopholes have had to be employed .

Treasure Fingers - Live at Muse ( District Ignition / Snatch Rewired ) in Washington DC * right click to download
Here ’s a live set that was recorded last weekend in DC .

I ’ll try to get to that soon .
It ’s 2 hours long , so the file is pretty big .

Ricky 's been checking out a school in Reading where learning is less textbook and more hi-tech 3D technology ...
" It 's Monday morning .
Your first lesson of the day is science and you 're not looking forward to spending the next couple of hours staring at the white board and into a textbook .
Well , thanks to the latest technology , boring lessons could be a thing of the past .
One secondary school in Reading in the south - east of England is using 3D projectors to make lessons more enjoyable .
How it all works
They 've installed a hi-tech projector at the front of the class which beams out images onto the whiteboard .
Once the students put on their special glasses , the pictures in front of them become very real .
I joined Year 7 to check out the 3D lesson for myself .
We were looking at the human body , and exploring how our ears function .
Learning in 3D
Once I put the 3D glasses on , the images leapt out in front of me .
Students attempt to touch the 3D ear floating around the classroom !
I could see the ear in great detail and it felt close enough to touch .
The 3D lessons are interactive and they make the lessons memorable and fun .
Some of children in the classroom got a bit of a fright as the images zoomed towards them , I heard a few screams and gasps .
Ricky 's verdict
The graphics were really impressive and some of the kids even thought the 3D lesson was better than going to see Avatar at the cinema !
Soon , more schools could be teaching in 3D .
That 's because the price of the projectors have come down over the last couple of years .
The special glasses are still pretty costly , but experts are now finding a way to make them cheaper too .
So move over 2 D ... it 's all about the 3D ! "

Ovechkin drops the gloves , Bradley fights instead ( Photo © AP Photo )
Russian superstar Alexander Ovechkin was really close to battle in another NHL fight , but Matt Bradley stole him the scene and fought instead of him during the third period of the Tuesday ’s match between the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning .
The first brawl was started by Stewe Downie after a clean hit by Ovechkin , but it was quickly stopped by the refs , who gave the two players a minor penalty .
When they got out of the penalty box Ovechkin was ready to go as he dropped the gloves and the helmet too , but when he and Downie were approaching each other , Matt Bradley intervened and started fighting Downie himself , not allowing his captain to fight .
“ I did n’t see him actually , ” said Ovechkin after the match to the Washington Post .
“ So I dropped my helmet , dropped my gloves , ready to fight , and Brads jumped in the fight for me .
He do a great job . ”
“ We had a guy like that going after our best player , obviously we ca n’t let that happen , ” Bradley stated to the Washington Post .
“ I ’ll bet they would do the exact same thing if someone was squaring off with Stamkos .
I mean , you do n’t let guys like that go after your best players , and he ’s our best player .
And no matter who it is , we ’re not gonna allow someone like Downie to go after him . ”
Below is the video of the fight .
Pour sauver une industrie musicale sinistrée , les pouvoirs publics ont choisi de développer le marché digital .
Dans son rapport du 6 janvier , dont les conclusions ont été reprises par Nicolas Sarkozy , la mission Création et Internet propose de faire cofinancer par l'Etat une " carte musique " de paiement en ligne pour les 15 - 24 ans .
Au - delà de cette mesure , la mission entend viabiliser les offres des entrepreneurs du Net , qui peinent à rester rentables .
Sites de téléchargement légal ou plates - formes de streaming , ils ont pour nom Spotify , Deezer , Jiwa , WorMee , AlloMusic ou MusicMe .
Depuis deux ans , ils ont connu un spectaculaire développement .
Sans doute parce qu'ils essaient de concilier la boulimie musicale des internautes , leur habitude de la gratuité , le respect des droits des auteurs et des producteurs .
Sur les sites de musique en streaming , l'ordinateur joue le rôle d'une radio , avec l'avantage pour l'utilisateur de pouvoir choisir gratuitement les morceaux de ses artistes et groupes préférés .
Faciles d'utilisation , ces sites de plus en plus nombreux misent sur l'accès à l'écoute , alors que le téléchargement reste dans une logique de possession .
Si Spotify , société suédoise installée en Angleterre , se dégage en 2010 comme le leader mondial du genre , la France est le pays où se sont lancées le plus grand nombre d'entreprises de streaming .
Sans doute parce que le pionnier du phénomène , Benoît Tersiguel et son site illégal Radio.blog.club , était français .
Condamné pour " contrefaçon " , il en a inspiré d'autres comme Blogmusic , converti ensuite à la légalité sous le nom de Deezer , lancé en 2007 par Jonathan Benassaya , et devenu le numéro un français avec 6,5 millions de visiteurs par mois .
Malgré ce succès , " l'activité n'est pas encore rentable " , déplore Jonathan Benassaya .
Difficile jusque - là pour Deezer et ses concurrents de trouver un modèle économique viable .
Le premier modèle envisagé était celui de la gratuité d'accès , financée par la publicité .
Sur Internet , cette manne se révèle insuffisante .
Aujourd 'hui , l'ensemble de ces sites mise sur l'abonnement payant accessible sur mobile , baptisé " forfait Premium " .
Le principe est partout le même : pour un forfait de 9,99 euros par mois , l'abonné a accès à tout le catalogue du site , sans publicité , en qualité sonore supérieure et avec la possibilité de télécharger et d'écouter , tant que dure l'abonnement , ses " playlists " sur des supports mobiles comme le téléphone .
Si les premiers résultats de cette formule semblent encourageants , l'équilibre économique de ces sites demeure très fragile .
Principales raisons pointées par leurs propriétaires : le coût et la complexité de la constitution d'un catalogue de titres et le tarif des rétributions aux ayants droit .
Négocié maison de disques par maison de disques , ce contenu est payé par les sociétés de streaming sous forme d'avances annuelles aux labels , en particulier aux multinationales du disque .
" Les avances demandées peuvent ê tre énormes " , estime Jean - Marc Plueger , patron du site Jiwa .
" Une major peut demander plusieurs centaines de milliers d'euros pour un catalogue qui n'en rapportera que quelques dizaines de milliers la première année . "
Ces tarifs deviendraient un frein au bon développement de ces sociétés .
" Il est difficile de lever des fonds , confirme M. Plueger , car les capital - risqueurs voient que l'argent ne sert pas à investir dans la technologie ou le personnel qualifié , mais à faire de gros chèques aux majors . "
Un fonctionnement que la mission Zelnik a jugé pénalisant pour le bon développement du marché digital , au point de proposer que les droits des catalogues soient gérés de manière collective par une société civile - et non plus entre maison de disques et sites de streaming - et que ces sites soient désormais assimilés à une radio , et soumis au régime dit de la " licence légale " ( accès illimité aux catalogues contre un pourcentage de leur chiffre d'affaires ) .
Si ces mesures ont été plébiscitées par Deezer , Jiwa et autres WorMee , les représentants des quatre majors et leur syndicat , le SNEP , ainsi que la Sacem , s'opposent vent debout à de telles propositions .
" Si les sites de streaming ont eu du mal à décoller , c'est que leur premier modèle économique , celui de la publicité , n'était pas viable , conteste Pascal Nègre , le patron d'Universal Music France .
Nous croyons beaucoup plus à celui de l'abonnement payant . "
Pas question en tout cas de brader les catalogues .
" La gestion collective est toujours un appauvrissement de celui qui met en gestion .
D'ailleurs cette solution n'est envisagée dans aucun autre pays , pourquoi toucherions - nous moins en France ?
Ces start - up doivent être prêtes à perdre quelques millions pour se lancer . "
Ces oppositions seront matière à négociations entre tous les partenaires de la filière musique , avec , en cas d'impasse , la possibilité pour l'Etat de légiférer .

They might be the only businesses in Colorado begging for their products to be taxed .
But a number of medical - marijuana dispensaries say taxation is critical for their industry ’s long - term health , and many say they ’ve been collecting sales taxes for months — before a legal opinion issued Monday saying their products are taxable .
After the opinion from Attorney General John Suthers , medical - marijuana dispensaries could be facing penalties for not collecting sales taxes that could include fines and , ultimately , seizure .
Mark Couch , a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Revenue , said agency officials met Monday to discuss sending a letter to dispensaries statewide to inform them about paying the state ’s 2.9 percent sales tax .
“ We ’ll be actively contacting them to remind them of their legal obligations , ” Couch said .
Dispensaries also must obtain state retail sales - tax licenses , which cost $ 4 for one year .
Starting in January , businesses can purchase two - year licenses for $ 16 .
Suthers ’ opinion said medical marijuana is subject to state sales tax as are food products made with it .
Marijuana seed , however , is considered an agricultural product and exempt from sales tax .
For dispensary owners like Miles Zalkin , who operates Pain Management of Colorado in Denver , the opinion just means business as usual .
“ We ’ve been collecting sales tax from Day One , ” said Zalkin , whose business has been open just over a year .
“ We run our business as if it was regulated . ”
Zalkin estimated he ’s collected tens of thousands of dollars in Denver and state sales taxes .
“ We are in favor of taxation , ” he said .
“ We are in favor of seeing new regulation come in and clean this industry up . ”
Couch said that of some 60 dispensaries in Colorado that revenue officials have identified — and he said there may well be more — about half are paying sales taxes .
He said the department has no way to track how much has been collected in sales taxes from dispensaries , and the agency has no estimates of how much revenue medical marijuana will generate .
California officials reported having collected about $ 11.4 million in tax on some $ 142 million of medical - marijuana sales in 2005 - 06 .
A number of cities and counties have taken the position that sales taxes apply to medical marijuana .
Boulder officials estimated the city is reaping between $ 2,400 and $ 3,000 a month from medical - marijuana sales .
City officials in Denver said the city has no estimate on how much sales - tax revenue the dispensaries will produce but is preparing to instruct dispensaries on how to collect the sales tax and remit it to the city .
Denver ’s sales tax is 3.62 percent .
Ernie Travis , owner of Boulder Vital Herb , said he recognized early that paying sales taxes was important “ to make marijuana look legitimate to the community . ”
Travis added , “ There ’s a lot of positive things marijuana can do .
Taxes is just one of them . ”
Lawmakers likely will be asked in January to set up regulations on the industry .
For Rep. Steve King , a Grand Junction Republican and a veteran police officer who used to present anti-drug programs in schools , the irony is inescapable .
“ It is absolutely weird , ” King said about the thought of regulating the sale of marijuana , “ but just because I may not like a law does n’t mean I do n’t have an obligation to make it so it ’s functional . ”

I heard from two people recently .
One a friend whose brother is a member of the Teamsters and asked his sister directly , " Is Barack really going to try to tax my health care plan ?
He said he would not do that .
If so , I am done with him . "
The other , my brother a RN who is also a member of a union who called me in the wee hours of the morning chomping on the bits about congress taxing his health care plan and he heard this in the break room at his job .
I could not say anything to him because those in the bubble at 1600 PA AVE think they can get away with this and they probably will .
Hell , they have gotten away with watering down this health care bill , no health insurance bill , to practically nothing .
Our president said that he did not campaign on the public option , when all his statements , speeches pointed that he did but we are looking at selective memory here .
Our President said he would get cheaper drugs to us in this country and chastised the Bush Administration for the Medicare D sweetheart deal to the pharmaceutical companies when now the White House did the same damn thing , no cheaper drugs for us , American citizens .
To even be more direct , remember this about the pharmaceutical companies ?
And the icing on the cake is when the White House put that pressure down on the Byron Dorgan 's Drug Importation Amendment and Democrats , yes , Democrats voted no for cheaper drugs to protect the White House sweetheart deal .
Sigh , Turkana is right , we have crumbled down to nothing with this health care bill , no health care insurance bill .
Now the Labor Unions have stepped in .
The very same tax the White House is talking about will have direct affect to members of unions across this country .
It will tax their health care plans .
But do the White House or even Democrats in congress get it ?
Union leaders , who are fighting a proposal to tax high - end health care plans ( which would hit many union and non-union workers ) , have been working closely with House Democratic leadership to fight the provision and are slated to go to the Hill to talk strategy soon .
( Updated Below ) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Cali . ) , along with Rep. Joe Courtney ( D - Conn . ) , have both stressed their opposition to the so - called Cadillac Tax , on both policy and political grounds .
In its place , they want to finance reform by issuing a tax on the wealthy -- a provision that labor supports .
But the deck seems stacked against them -- both the Senate and the White House are committed to including the excise tax in the final health care bill , citing the benefit it has in reeling in health care costs .
In an hour - long meeting on Monday , the president did his best to present the benefits of the proposal in an effort to alleviate some of labor 's concerns .
Details of the White House meeting are scant , with union sources staying uncharacteristically mum .
But sources tell the Huffington Post that Obama re-affirmed his support of the excise tax while also signaling that he would try and find ways to dull its affect on working families .
Several compromises were broached , including the possibility of raising the tax threshold from family health care plans valued at $ 23,000 to those valued at $ 25,000 .
Whether this is enough of a concession to win labor 's support , which seems unlikely , or at least mollify their opposition remains to be seen .
But , at this juncture , the impasse over the excise tax seems quite vast -- to the point where it is no longer unreasonable to wonder if it could trip up the broader reform effort .
President Obama re-affirming his support of the excise tax .
Let me tell you what will happen .
Or more importantly , do you remember President Bush ( 41 ) and how he got out of office ?
The Democrats used his own words to vote him out , " Read my lips , no new taxes ... "
And what did President Bush ( 41 ) do ?
He raised new taxes .
Barack Obama is on video during the campaign promising not to raise taxes on the middle class in this country .
If the congress does this , expect videos out after the bill is signed , the next day .
And you think we can explain this away ?
When many Americans are hurting , do n't have jobs , hours cut on jobs , wages reduced , families struggling ?
Do you think the public will take this ?
I do n't think so .
Sure , the Republicans are gas bags and ass hats .
The public knows this .
But if you want to really suppress voting , do n't have boots on the ground , evaporated GOTV , then Democrats tax the shit out of the very public that put your asses in charge .
People that have union health plans , most have given major concessions to have this one luxury .
It is called decent health insurance which most Americans DON'T have .
Finally , what happened about repealing the Bush Tax Cuts ?
We are too afraid to do this , but do n't give a damn about taxing the shit out of folks who are barely making it out here ?
I am sorry , but none of this makes any damn sense to me .
What are the Democrats thinking !!
Update [ 2010-1-12 14:59:49 by icebergslim ] :
Bush Tax Cuts Expiring the end of 2010
Update [ 2010-1-12 15:2:18 by icebergslim ] :
inclusive heart makes a very valid point , it is not just union households that this will affect , but anyone will get clipped by this tax , which will force you to buy a plan at a cheaper cost and less coverage .
Good point .
Update [ 2010-1-12 16:38:52 by icebergslim ] :
This from the federal and postal employees union :
The letter from the federal and postal employees frames the tax as both inequitable and potentially damaging to the prospects of recruiting future government employees .
The groups write : " While the excise tax is slated to be imposed on the insurers on so - called high cost plans , the tax will be passed on to enrollees in the form of higher premiums , co-pays or reduced benefits .
[ Blue Cross blue Shield ] plans cover approximately 48 % of [ Federal Employees Health Benefits Program ] enrollees , or nearly 3.8 million Americans .
Single enrollees would be subject to the effects of the tax in 2013 , while families are hit in the third year .
Including other , non-BC / BS plans , more than one - half of active and retired enrollees will face the effects of these taxes that accumulate to thousands of dollars in the middle to out years of the Senate - passed bill .
Because we understand the value of all health care is counted towards the threshold amounts , enrollees with dental or vision coverage , or a Flexible Spending account , could reach the thresholds even sooner and feel the effects of this tax earlier .
Characterizing this tax proposal as a " Cadillac tax " is a misnomer .
It hits the average blue collar and white collar employee or annuitant .
FEHBP insurers will simply reduce coverage and , as the taxes increase , a downward spiral towards less coverage will ensue , which is antithetical to health care reform 's states purpose .
Penalizing FEHBP enrollees with this tax is a huge disincentive to qualified applicants seeking federal or postal employment .
It is bad for the government and bad policy overall .
People around here forget that Barack Obama told Hillary Clinton that words matter .
Well , words do matter , the words matter more so from our president .
When you continue to go back on what you said , you deserve to get blasted and many have the right to become suspect .
That means we have the right to question every step made by this administration and as the unions have reminded our president , he needs to remember what he said during the campaign .
Wasps used antibiotics millions of years before Fleming discovered penicillin
Dr Wasp : Beewolves ( Philanthus triangulum ) coated their cocoons with antibiotics to fight off harmful microbes
A humble wasp learned how to use sophisticated antibiotics millions of years before the invention of penicillin , research has shown .
Digger wasps of the family Philanthus , also known as " beewolves " , harness beneficial bacteria to manufacture a cocktail of drugs that protect its larvae from infection .
Scientists who made the discovery believe it could assist the development of new agents to combat human " superbugs " .
The era of antibiotics began in 1928 when Alexander Fleming spotted how penicillin produced by green mould killed bacteria .
But long before , Philanthus wasps were coating their cocoons with antibiotics to fight off harmful microbes .
The insects not only evolved a method of manufacturing antibiotics , they used them in a highly effective way , said the scientists writing in the journal Nature Chemical Biology .
Just as human experts have learned to do , the wasps combine different drugs that work together to destroy many different organisms .
The German researchers found that beewolves teamed up with a type of bacteria called Streptomyces in a symbiotic relationship that benefited both species .
In exchange for having a home , the bugs produced a cocktail of nine different antibiotics effective against a broad range of harmful bacteria and fungi .
Invading fungal mold and harmful bacteria are major threats to the wasp larvae .
Conditions in the warm and humid wasps ' nests , which contain large amounts of organic material in the form of prey food , make them breeding grounds for infection .
Pioneer : Sir Alexander
Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 - centuries after the beewolf began using antibiotics
Streptomyces can keep these potentially dangerous pathogens at bay .
Female beewolves cultivate the useful bugs in specialised antennal gland reservoirs and apply them to the ceilings of brood cells , said the scientists .
The wasp larvae , growing in the cells , later take up the bacteria and transfer them to the outside surfaces of their cocoons .
Laboratory tests showed that the beewolves employed an advanced form of " combination medication " using nine antibiotic varieties .
Johannes Kroiss , from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena , said : ' A combined treatment with streptochlorin and eight different piericidines we were able to isolate from the cocoon helps to fend off a very broad spectrum of micro-organisms .
' This can not be achieved with a single substance .
This means that millions of years ago , beewolves and their symbionts have already evolved a strategy that is known from human medicine as combination prophylaxis . '
The method exploits the " complementary or synergistic action " of two or more drugs , and is known to help prevent the development of resistant " superbugs " , said the researchers .
Co-author Martin Kaltenpoth , who heads a Max Planck research group on " insect - bacteria symbiosis " , said : ' We suppose that protective symbioses like the ones between beewolves and Streptomyces bacteria are much more common in the animal kingdom than previously assumed .
' An analysis of the substances involved not only contributes to the understanding of the evolution of such symbioses but could also lead to the discovery of interesting new drug candidates for human medicine . '
Consider the following C code which is based on an real - world situation .
struct bf1_31 { unsigned a : 1 ; unsigned b:31 ; } ; void func ( struct bf1_31 * p , int n , int a ) { int i = 0 ; do { if ( p [ i ] .a ) p[i ] .b += a ; } while ( ++i < n ) ; }
How would we best write this in ARM assembler ?
This is how I would do it :
func : ldr r3 , [ r0 ] , # 4 tst r3 , # 1 add r3 , r3 , r2 , lsl # 1 strne r3 , [ r0 , # - 4 ] subs r1 , r1 , # 1 bgt func bx lr
The add instruction is unconditional to avoid a dependency on the comparison .
Unrolling the loop would mask the latency of the ldr instruction as well , but that is outside the scope of this experiment .
Now compile this code with gcc - march=armv5te - O3 and watch in horror :
func : push {r4} mov ip , # 0 mov r4 , r2 loop : ldrb r3 , [ r0 ] add ip , ip , # 1 tst r3 , # 1 ldrne r3 , [ r0 ] andne r2 , r3 , # 1 addne r3 , r4 , r3 , lsr # 1 orrne r2 , r2 , r3 , lsl # 1 strne r2 , [ r0 ] cmp ip , r1 add r0 , r0 , # 4 blt loop pop {r4} bx lr
This is nothing short of awful :
The same value is loaded from memory twice .
A complicated mask / shift / or operation is used where a simple shifted add would suffice .
Write - back addressing is not used .
The loop control counts up and compares instead of counting down .
Useless mov in the prologue ; swapping the roles or r2 and r4 would avoid this .
in the prologue ; swapping the roles or and would avoid this .
Using lr in place of r4 would allow the return to be done with pop {pc} , saving one instruction ( ignoring for the moment that no callee - saved registers are needed at all ) .
Even for this trivial function the gcc-generated code is more than twice the optimal size and slower by approximately the same factor .
The main issue I wanted to illustrate is the poor handling of bit - fields by gcc .
When accessing bitfields from memory , gcc issues a separate load for each field even when they are contained in the same aligned memory word .
Although each load after the first will most likely hit L1 cache , this is still bad for several reasons :
Loads have typically two or three cycles result latency compared to one cycle for data processing instructions .
Any bit - field can be extracted from a register with two shifts , and on ARM the second of these can generally be achieved using a shifted second operand to a following instruction .
The ARMv6T2 instruction set also adds the SBFX and UBFX instructions for extracting any signed or unsigned bit - field in one cycle .
and instructions for extracting any signed or unsigned bit - field in one cycle .
Most CPUs have more data processing units than load / store units .
It is thus more likely for an ALU instruction than a load / store to issue without delay on a superscalar processor .
Redundant memory accesses can trigger early flushing of store buffers rendering these less efficient .
No gcc bashing is complete without a comparison with another compiler , so without further ado , here is the ARM RVCT output ( armcc -- cpu 5te - O3 ) :
func : mov r3 , # 0 push {r4 , lr} loop : ldr ip , [ r0 , r3 , lsl # 2 ] tst ip , # 1 addne ip , ip , r2 , lsl # 1 strne ip , [ r0 , r3 , lsl # 2 ] add r3 , r3 , # 1 cmp r3 , r1 blt loop pop {r4 , pc}
This is much better , the core loop using only one instruction more than my version .
The loop control is counting up , but at least this register is reused as offset for the memory accesses .
More remarkable is the push / pop of two registers that are never used .
I had not expected to see this from RVCT .
Even the best compilers are still no match for a human .
I do n't think many Brits thought twice about this headline which was published in The Guardian today .
They knew what it was about .
The headline did n't strike them odd , or strange , or wrong .
Me , I needed the subhead to allay my fears .
And to stop me from laughing .
A Seattle - based internet addiction specialist has revealed how computer and MMO addiction can cause serious ' intimacy disorders ' in young men , who only handle their sexuality with online pornography .
Dr Hilarie Cash set up Heavensfield rehab unit in Seattle last September , the first in - patient internet addiction clinic of its kind outside of the Far East .
Broken sexual template
And while Dr Cash admits to Vice Magazine this month that " you can have people who are raised with computers who are smart and worldly , " she is quick to add , " what I tend to see is people are physically at a deficit because they 're chronically sleep - deprived , they 've got carpal tunnel syndrome and they 're socially uncomfortable in the real word , as the only place they 're comfortable is in cyberspace . "
Many of her patients have never dated , instead " they 've handled their sexuality with pornography , which means that their sexual template is divided out between sex and intimacy .
That 's a recipe for an intimacy disorder – they do n't know how to bring sexuality and social things together . "
Cash tells two particularly harrowing stories about two extreme cases of young men who led lives of deception and become suicidally depressed because of their ' gaming habits ' .
" Both young men who were n't diagnosed with any problems that a clinician would have spotted before they became addicted , " she explains .
Internet porn addiction
As far as internet - porn addicts go , Cash also treats a lot of them too , " but they really are bracketed in their own category , " she notes , adding , " they are men who were exposed to porn at a young age , or were sexualised at a young age , maybe through abuse .
They 're older – 30 , 40 , 50 . "
" But almost universally , as I said before , the gamers I work with are accessing pornography , and my concern is that it 's a real ticking time - bomb that 's being created for ten or 20 years down the road . "
For those parents that find gaming to be taking over their children 's lives , Dr Cash recommends a device developed by Californian psychologist , Ken Woo that fits on the computer and controls the time the child can play .
Cash also claims that many games companies " hire professional psychologists these days to help them develop the best unpredictable reward payoff structures … [ stimulating ] the reward centres of the brain into releasing dopamine and opiates . "
And while the therapist openly admits she is not a heavy net - user herself and has always preferred face - to - face meetings as her primary form of social interaction , she genuinely does have some useful advice for reigning in the ways in which technologies control your life .
" We need to figure out how to build the firewalls into our lives that can help us cope with its influence , " she says .
" It 's ... analogous to our dealings with cars .
When we first had cars , we did n't have stop signs or safety belts .
But through all the accidents that happened , they figured out what they needed , and now driving a car is pretty safe . "

MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews is n’t always the most diplomatic guy , and on Wednesday night he showed that to be true when he paid President Obama what he probably thought was a compliment .
Praising the president ’s ability to inspire on stage , and arguing Obama had made serious strides in overcoming racial and political tensions in the US , Matthews said :

You know , I was trying to think about who he was tonight .
And , um , it ’s interesting .
He is post - racial by all appearances .
You know , I forgot he was black tonight for an hour .
You know , he ’s gone a long way to become a leader of this country and passed so much history in just a year or two .
MSNBC ’s top two anchors , Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow , had nothing to say about Matthew ’s comments , although the Countdown host did appear to be taken by surprise .
This video is from MSNBC , broadcast Jan. 27 , 2010 .

Later on , Matthews “ clarified ” his comments and said he was “ proud ” he said it .
That he was happy there was no “ ethnic fighting ” during Obama ’s State of the Union address .
MATTHEWS : And can I say one more point ?
MADDOW : Sure .
MATTHEWS : I think something that I`d mentioned earlier tonight .
And I`m very proud I did it and I hope I can say it the right way .
You know , this country has been — and I grew up in a country that was driven apart by race right until the `60s .
You couldn`t have a black member of the United States Cabinet .
There are no black Cabinet members in the Kennedy administration .
It has been such a big part of our life in big cities , this sort of ethnic debate , ethnic fighting .
And then to see the president of the United States who`s African - American , I was thinking tonight , this isn`t even an issue tonight .
How far we`ve come in just a year where it wasn`t a campaign issue in some parts of the country .
It was talked about as something that would hurt him .
And it wasn`t in the room tonight .
You can feel it wasn`t there tonight .
And that takes leadership on his part to get us beyond these divisions .
Really , national leadership .
And I felt it wonderfully then I saw it almost like an epiphany .
And I hope it`s true , I hope what I saw is true , that we`ve gotten beyond it .
At least — well , in the presidential level , I think .
It `s still going to be out there in American life , but I think he`s done something wonderful .
I think he`s taken us beyond black and white in our politics wonderfully so in just a year .
I think .

Wonkette mocks ,
“ It ’s fine , really .
If we were Boomers , we would forget that people were black sometimes too . ”
The Daily News reports , ‘ Chris Matthews forgot he was black ’ was high on Google ’s list of hot Web searches Thursday morning .
This is n’t the first time Matthews has made an unusual remark that set tongues wagging .
Covering the Potomac primaries for MSNBC , Matthews said he ‘ felt this thrill going up my leg ’ listening to Obama speak . ”
A Fox News article was quick to quote conservatives slamming Matthews .

“ For his idiotic racist comment last night , will Chris Matthews be flogged and pilloried like Imus was ? ” tweeted “ Shoehead . ”
“ When I 1st heard what Chris Matthews said I thought maybe Pres Obama just looked extremely light - skinned 4 some reason , ” tweeted “ QueenMelmendi . ”
Brent Bozell , founder and president of the Media Research Center , a conservative media watchdog organization , said the remarks reveal a prejudice on Matthews ’ part .
“ What Chris Matthews is saying is that he does n’t believe African - Americans are capable of giving speeches like that . ”
He said Matthews ’ remarks “ show the absolute contradiction in the liberal argument on color .
They purport to want a color - blind society , but are absolutely fixated on doing just the opposite .
[ Matthews ] ca n’t see Barack Obama as being qualified , because he ’s Barack Obama .
He sees him through a lens of being black . ”

Boulder , Colorado ( CNN ) --
The media have begun to make comparisons between Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Haiti .
And in some ways , the two events are comparable .
Like Katrina , the earthquake has produced effects of catastrophic proportions .
Both events rank among the largest catastrophes ever experienced in the Western Hemisphere .
They both have resulted in large loss of life and immense human suffering and make the coordination of emergency resources extremely difficult .
Ordinary citizens are left to fend for themselves in the wreckage .
And as we saw in Katrina and see now in Haiti , residents of disaster - stricken areas are the true first responders .
The aftermath of such catastrophes brings more prolonged suffering and massive recovery challenges .
People pay attention as the media cover them , but they turn their attention elsewhere when the cameras leave , even though many of the real challenges that victims and affected regions face emerge later .
Like the Gulf region , Haiti will struggle for years and perhaps decades to rebuild and recover .
But there , the comparisons end .
To get an idea of the distinction between the two events , imagine that all of the U.S. west of the Mississippi were to be destroyed or extensively damaged by some immense catastrophe in one minute , with absolutely no warning .
That is the situation Haiti faces .
As horrific as it was , Katrina was a region - wide catastrophe , not a national one .
Damage was enormous in the Gulf region , but the resources of the larger nation remained intact and available for mobilization , even though aid was slow in coming .
Katrina did not flatten our nation 's capital or prevent national leaders from communicating with one another .
Impacts were catastrophic in areas where Katrina struck , creating significant logistics problems , but the infrastructure of the rest of the nation was untouched .
Also important , it was possible to issue warnings for Katrina , which enabled the vast majority of those who were at risk to evacuate to safety .
The victims of the earthquake had no such warning .
In contrast , the earthquake in Haiti destroyed much of its capital , Port - au - Prince , and affected approximately one - third of the population of the entire country .
The proportion of the nation 's population that has been killed , injured or left homeless is enormous .
The facilities that could have assisted victims , such as hospitals , clinics and the UN headquarters for the nation , were destroyed or are not operational .
Aftershocks , which will continue for weeks , months and perhaps even years , will do additional damage and further compound both rescue and relief efforts .
There is another distinction that makes these events non-comparable .
Katrina affected the most vulnerable in the impact region : the poor , the elderly , the disabled , nursing home and hospital patients , and other at - risk groups .
But the concept of vulnerability takes on a new meaning in the Haiti earthquake .
The entire nation is desperately poor ; 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and more than half that number in abject poverty .
On almost all indicators of well - being -- health , education , literacy , income -- Haiti ranks very low .
The nation has a long history of rule by dictators , political coups and savage violence .
The capacity of Haiti's series of governments to provide services to its people has been abysmal for most of its history .
In many ways , residents of Haiti faced a daily disaster even before the earthquake .
These differences matter , and they should be kept in mind by those seeking to see parallels between the two catastrophes .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Tierney .
For those of you that use voice encryption products on mobile phones the last thing you would expect is for it to be easily decrypted and intercepted .
You may have shelled out good coin for your application and rely upon it for your intellectual security , but what if that security was not as tight as you had imagined , what if a readily available wiretapping utility attainable by anyone , and a simple Trojan slipped on to your device could compromise all of your calls ?
Blogger , hacker and IT security expert Notrax , has done just that .
For his own safety we will not reveal his name , however , Notrax has discovered that 12 commercially available mobile voice encryption products can be intercepted and compromised using a little ingenuity and creativity as he has carefully detailed on his website .
He tested 15 voice encryption products in total , 12 of them were “ worthless ” .
It ’s easy to take the software at face value when it “ tells you ” that the call is secured .
But how does someone actually go about being sure that it is secured ?
Notrax did some digging and discovered he could break in to almost all of them in under 30 minutes .
Secure means that Notrax did not manage to crack it .
It does not mean that someone else would not be able to crack it .
These calls can be tapped by anyone that has basic technical skills or the money to back up such an endeavour .
“ Statistics show Government agencies on average conduct 50,000 legal wiretaps per year ( legal= those where a court order is required ) , ( Let ’s not forget Echelon ) another 150,000 phones are illegally tapped by private detectives , spouses and boyfriends and girlfriends trying to catch a potential cheater .
Another estimate shows up to 100,000 phones are wiretapped by companies and private industry in some form of industrial espionage .
It is happening and it is a big business . ”
The ones that made it were PhoneCrypt .
It provides military grade technology to secure phone conversations in real time .
Also , PhoneCrypt ’s active protection agent monitors calls to protect against eavesdropping and wiretapping .
Out of the three survivors , only PhoneCrypt ’s solution was software - based .
SnapCell was safe , it ’s a private encryption device that snaps on to your mobile , they claim to protect your mobile voice , fax and data communications from wiretapping , eavesdropping and line interference .
SnapCell ’s website has been offline since January 21st for unknown reasons .
TopSec Mobile was also secure , it ’s a voice encryption device that can be connected to almost any mobile phone using Bluetooth .
The encryption is embedded in the TopSec Mobile hardware to avoid the susceptibility of GSM phones to manipulation .
If you are not using one of the above three voice encryption technologies , you may want to be on the lookout for a new solution .
Although these applications cracked are not entirely secure , it would take much effort to bypass them , like having the attacker be able to load software or a trojan on your phone without you knowing .
It ’s similar to a credit card , so as long as you keep it with you in a secure place you should be fine for the most part .

The owner of “ Tea Party Nation , Inc. ” and organizer of the Tea Party conference is quoted here as saying “ I want to make a million from this movement . ”
NINE people were killed when shooting broke out during a mass demonstration in a provincial Afghan town over the alleged burning of a Koran by foreign troops , police said today .
The violence erupted yesterday in the Garmsir district of the southern province of Helmand over rumours that NATO - led forces had defiled a copy of the Muslim holy book during a military operation , local residents and police said .
" Eight protesters were killed when the protesters attacked national security officials in Garmsir , '' deputy provincial police chief Khamal Dinkhan said .
The shooting of the protesters occurred after an Afghan national guardsman was killed by gunfire " from the demonstrators ' side ' ' , he said .
NATO 's International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) said yesterday that its troops had shot dead an " insurgent sniper ' ' who had shot an Afghan official in the Garmsir area .
But a spokesman for the force said there was no information to back up claims of civilian deaths in the incident , adding that investigations with Afghan security officials were under way .
A doctor at the emergency hospital in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that more than 10 people had been brought in " with gunshot wounds to the stomach , head and legs ' ' .
" Two of them are in serious condition , '' he said .
The incident occurred when more than 1000 Afghan villagers gathered in Garmsir to protest over the alleged burning of a Koran during a NATO operation on Monday , local residents and police said .
" During today 's protest an insurgent sniper shot an Afghan official who was within FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) Delhi in Garmsir district , '' ISAF said .
" ISAF service members identified the insurgent sniper , shot and killed him .
There were no other injuries or shots fired , '' it said .
Physicists in the U.S. have achieved the highest temperature ever reached in a lab — four trillion C — hot enough to melt protons and neutrons into a " soup . "
A computer simulation of the quark - gluon soup created after a collision between two gold ions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider .
( ( Brookhaven National Laboratory ) )
Scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York smashed gold ions together at nearly the speed of light to create matter at that temperature .
The researchers are trying to recreate the conditions of the early universe , a fraction of a second after the big bang 13.7 billion years ago .
The experiments were performed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven , a circular particle accelerator 3.8 kilometres long buried four metres below ground .
Before the construction of the Large Hadron Collider at the French - Swiss border , RHIC was considered the most powerful particle accelerator in the world .
Physicists believe that a substance called a quark - gluon plasma , a " soup " of subatomic particles , filled the universe within its first few microseconds .
The collisions at Brookhaven recreated that substance for less than a billionth of a trillionth of a second .
Its existence was recorded by the collider 's four detectors .
Data from those detectors was used to determine that the quark - gluon plasma created was 250,000 times hotter than the core of the sun .
The data also showed that the plasma behaved not as a super - hot gas , but as a near " perfect " liquid , that is , a fluid of quarks and gluons that flows with no frictional resistance .
" By matching theoretical models of the expanding plasma to the data , we can determine that the initial temperature of the ' perfect ' liquid has reached about four trillion degrees Celsius , " said Barbara Jacak of Stony Brook University in a statement .
The researchers are looking for irregularities in the plasma that might explain how matter formed out of the energy of the big bang .
In their research , reported this week in the journal Physical Review Letters , the researchers found that the normal interactions between the quarks and gluons broke down within " bubbles " inside the hot soup .
That break down of what physicists call " mirror symmetry " could point to a reason why matter predominated over anti-matter in the early universe .
This research into fundamental questions of physics also has practical applications .
Researchers are hoping to apply the knowledge gains to the field of " spintronics , " which could give rise to a new generation of more powerful solid - state computers and other devices .
RHIC physicists are planning upgrades to the collider 's detectors and collaborations with research at the Large Hadron Collider to continue their research .
At age 14 , Taylor LeBaron weighed over 300 pounds .
Thanks to a diet he devised influenced by video games , he has lost 150 pounds , or half of what he weighed before .
Speaking with the Today Show , LeBaron explained how he managed to lose all the weight .
He tackled the problem as if he were confronting a series of enemies in a video game — enemies being things like inactivity , eating , and stress .
The teen gave himself a “ currency , ” much like you would find in a game , in the form of calories .
“ It has the same aspects of a video game , ” LeBaron told Today .
“ You have enemies , you have allies , and you have money .
You have to play smart ; otherwise , you run out of your money .
Your score needs to be high at the end of the day . ”
“ If you say , ‘ I ’m going to lose 100 pounds in the next three months , ’ well that ’s not going to happen , ” he said .
“ You have to set it in bite sizes that are achievable .
Then when you can achieve that , you feel great ; you ’ve met a goal . ”

Psychological violence can be hard to prove
If you insult your wife or husband repeatedly , you could soon find yourself in court if you live in France .
The charge ?
Psychological violence .
That 's what the new offence will be called if a bill backed by the government is passed by parliament .
Once considered a purely private domain , rows between married or cohabiting couples could now prompt intervention from the state .
The French government wants to take the controversial step of introducing a new law banning " psychological violence " between married couples or partners living together .
But there are questions about how such an offence could be proved .
No visible scars
Many people fear that courts might find it tricky to assess the rival claims of squabbling couples .
He would start by saying I was very fat , that I was ugly , that I was n't any use for anything
Gabrielle
But the government says it would allow the authorities to deal with mental and verbal abuse in couples which leaves no visible scars , but where the victims are often badly damaged psychologically .
Gabrielle - not her real name - is a media professional in her 30s .
She has a good job in Paris but she says psychological violence by her ex-partner pushed her to the brink of a breakdown .
" It started when I got pregnant , " she told me .
" He would start by saying that I was very fat , that I was ugly , of course , that I was n't any use for anything , that I could n't even work . "
She said when she challenged him , he replied that it was a joke .
But the abuse continued .
One day , she says they had an argument in their car and he punched the windscreen so hard that it broke .
" I thought I was going to go crazy and he said , ' OK are you going crazy ?
I 'm just going to drop you at the psychiatric asylum ' .
And that 's what he did . "
Gabrielle says he drove to a hospital , told her to get out of the car and drove off .
" When he left I was just breaking down and my daughter was crying inside the car . "
' My word against his '
If there had been a law against psychological violence , Gabrielle said she would have taken her ex-partner to court .
But she admitted that proving the allegations would have been difficult .
" It would be basically my word against his , " she said .
" In very rare cases would he say something in front of somebody else . "
Even supporters of the bill have concerns about how courts could prosecute a crime for which there is unlikely to be any physical evidence .
Psychiatrist Marie - France Hirigoyen is an authority on psychological violence but she said she was " cautious " about a new law because she fears it might be easily misused .
" I think it 's important to have a law but it must be formulated so there is n't too much risk of manipulation or mistakes , " she told me .
Even if there are no physical blows , it 's still devastating
Dr Marie - France Hirigoyen
" I treat people whose lives have been torn apart but they have n't been hit .
There are no physical marks , no proof . "
Dr Hirigoyen suggested that recordings of phone calls could be used as evidence - along with medical and psychiatric assessments .
Lawyer Laurent Hincker , a fervent supporter of the bill , said it would not be the only crime on the books that is difficult to prove .
" There are other crimes which are also hard to prove , such as bullying or harassment in the workplace , " he said .
" For a long time people said you can't have a law against bullying because it's too difficult to prove , but now there is a law and people get convicted . "
One problem is that the concept of psychological violence may be hard to define .
But Dr Hirigoyen said it was obvious to a professional .
" It 's a relationship which is based on control and domination - and if you want to prevent physical violence , you have to take action early on , " she said .
Dr Hirigoyen said psychological violence was often the first step towards physical violence .
" But even if there are no physical blows , it 's still devastating , " she added .
Public misgivings
Last year the French government launched a TV campaign to increase awareness of psychological violence .
The government has launched a TV campaign to raise awareness
The campaign featured a 30 - second spot produced by a film director , Jacques Audiard .
It shows a man who denigrates and insults his wife .
It also links physical violence with mental abuse .
On average , almost three women die each week in France after being assaulted by a partner or ex-partner .
The government says if the authorities can deal with psychological violence , physical violence can be prevented or reduced .
But many members of the public have misgivings about how a law would work in practice .
Parliament is almost certain to pass this controversial bill on psychological violence .
It is backed by Prime Minister Francois Fillon and key members of the governing party .
And the move is being welcomed by women 's groups - and by those , like Gabrielle , who believe it could save women from mental breakdown and the threat of physical violence .

The Egyptians supposedly used it to guide the construction the Pyramids .
The architecture of ancient Athens is thought to have been based on it .
Fictional Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon tried to unravel its mysteries in the novel The Da Vinci Code .
" It " is the golden ratio , a geometric proportion that has been theorized to be the most aesthetically pleasing to the eye and has been the root of countless mysteries over the centuries .
Now , a Duke University engineer has found it to be a compelling springboard to unify vision , thought and movement under a single law of nature 's design .
Also know the divine proportion , the golden ratio describes a rectangle with a length roughly one and a half times its width .
Many artists and architects have fashioned their works around this proportion .
For example , the Parthenon in Athens and Leonardo da Vinci 's painting Mona Lisa are commonly cited examples of the ratio .
Adrian Bejan , professor of mechanical engineering at Duke 's Pratt School of Engineering , thinks he knows why the golden ratio pops up everywhere : the eyes scan an image the fastest when it is shaped as a golden - ratio rectangle .
The natural design that connects vision and cognition is a theory that flowing systems -- from airways in the lungs to the formation of river deltas -- evolve in time so that they flow more and more easily .
Bejan termed this the constructal law in 1996 , and its latest application appears early online in the International Journal of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics .
" When you look atwhat so many people have been drawing and building , you see these proportions everywhere , " Bejan said .
" It is well known that the eyes take in information more efficiently when they scan side - to - side , as opposed to up and down . "
Bejan argues that the world -- whether it is a human looking at a painting or a gazelle on the open plain scanning the horizon -- is basically oriented on the horizontal .
For the gazelle , danger primarily comes from the sides or from behind , not from above or below , so their scope of vision evolved to go side - to - side .
As vision developed , he argues , the animals got " smarter " by seeing better and moving faster and more safely .

" As animals developed organs for vision , they minimized the danger from ahead and the sides , " Bejan said .
" This has made the overall flow of animals on earth safer and more efficient .
The flow of animal mass develops for itself flow channels that are efficient and conducive to survival -- straighter , with fewer obstacles and predators . "
For Bejan , vision and cognition evolved together and are one and the same design as locomotion .
The increased efficiency of information flowing from the world through the eyes to the brain corresponds with the transmission of this information through the branching architecture of nerves and the brain .
" Cognition is the name of the constructal evolution of the brain 's architecture , every minute and every moment , " Bejan said .
" This is the phenomenon of thinking , knowing , and then thinking again more efficiently .
Getting smarter is the constructal law in action . "
While the golden ratio provided a conceptual entryway into this view of nature 's design , Bejan sees something even broader .
" It is the oneness of vision , cognition and locomotion as the design of the movement of all animals on earth , " he said .
" The phenomenon of the golden ratio contributes to this understanding the idea that pattern and diversity coexist as integral and necessary features of the evolutionary design of nature . "
In numerous papers and books over past decade , Bejan has demonstrated that the constructal law ( www.constructal.org) predicts a wide range of flow system designs seen in nature , from biology and geophysics to social dynamics and technology evolution .
Bejan 's research is supported by the National Science Foundation .
Finally , after years of watching me struggle with those impossible - to - open packets , Heinz has decided to take my advice and invest in new condiment applicators .
Impressive , but I suggested spray cans .
Named ( and trademarked ) the Dip & Squeeze , the new packet -y things offer both traditional ketchup squeezing capabilities with the added benefit of -- wait for it -- DIPPING !!
I 'm gonna need a spit cup .
Plus , 3 x the ketchup as a regular packet .
Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ?
If you answered , " I 'll never have to buy ketchup from the grocery store again " , you are .
High - five , cheapskate !
The future , to go : Heinz reinvents the ketchup packet [ crunchgear ]
Thanks to emerica and Julie , who put ketchup on everything including their partners .
Kinky !
I did n’t necessarily mean to piggyback off Greg ’s two posts on ORMs but c’mon , what ’s a hillbilly to do when he perpetuates such negative stereotypes ?
I mean , before you start knocking it , have any of you * tried * kissing your sister ?
He also has some blather in there on RDMSs and ORMs .
So I suppose I should hide my indignation behind something technical .
We ’re using BigTable for our project by way of Google App Engine .
The decision to use it was pretty easy once we landed on GWT as our platform .
The integration ‘ twixt GWT and App Engine is pretty seamless and hey , App Engine uses Big Table .
I ’m glossing over the dozens of times we ’ve second - guessed ourselves since making the decision though .
The most recent was just yesterday as a matter of fact when my friend expressed a couple of concerns :
How do we back it up ?
How do we do ad hoc reports against it ?
Over the course of the conversation , these boiled down to : How can we work with BigTable in a way we ’re used to with RDMSs ?
The inevitable option came up .
Maybe we should n’t use BigTable .
Maybe MySQL is more suitable if we ’re unsure .
That means moving off App Engine though and we like what we ’ve seen so far with it .
It was a bit of an uncomfortable conversation actually and this was between two very seasoned developers who have never shied away from new tech .
I think the reason for the awkwardness though is that we are n’t dealing with someone else ’s money .
This is a startup so it ’s a decision that he and I are going to have to live with .
In the end , being seasoned developers , we recognized that moving to a new development platform will just substitute one set of problems with another .
For basic transactions ( I hesitate to say OLTP because that will imply I know more about the term than I do ) , like getting some objects and saving them again , BigTable just plain works .
There ’s no ORM behind the scenes to map your data structure to the domain model .
You create a User and you save it .
Any relationships are automatically dealt with by some magic that is buried in the documentation somewhere , I ’m sure .
It really is like working with an ORM without actually having to deal with the mapping .
As for our two questions above , we have a tentative solution that I still like a day later and it will solve both problems .
Let ’s take the second one :
How do we do ad hoc reports against it ?
See this is where RDMSs shine , I think .
So breaking down the question we get :
How can we get the benefits of BigTable for transactional stuff and the benefits of RDMSs for reporting and ad hoc querying ?
Funny how CQRS starts to make sense when you have the right problem staring you in the face .
We ’ll have a separate relational database for querying .
As requests are sent to BigTable , we ’ll also dump them out to another service elsewhere that queues them up to be processed into the relational database .
This also addresses our first question :
How do we back it up ?
The nice thing about this approach is that we now have our offline backup though of course , backing up is only half the solution .
We also need some way to restore BigTable from our relational database easily .
But the idea seems sound enough even if the mechanics may prove otherwise .
Maybe this sounds unduly complicated .
It really does n’t to me .
App Engine and BigTable offer a lot of advantages .
They solve problems I do n’t want to deal with , most notably , scalability .
The ones they introduce , backing up and querying , by contrast , are pretty simple .
Besides which , I ’m scheduled for Udi ’s course in a couple of months anyway .
And for the record , I do n’t have any sisters .
Just three adventurous brothers .

Rubinstein suffered a heart attack two months ago
Zelda Rubinstein , the US actress best known for her role as the diminutive psychic in 1982 film Poltergeist , has died in Los Angeles at the age of 76 .
The 4ft 3in ( 1.29 m ) actress died in hospital on Wednesday after recently suffering a heart attack , her agent told the Los Angeles Times .
Eccentric medium Tangina Barrons was her first major role and one she reprised in two Poltergeist sequels .
More recently , Rubinstein appeared in Southland Tales and TV's Picket Fences .
She also appeared in a high - profile Aids public awareness campaign in the 1980s and was an outspoken activist for the rights of people of restricted height .
Haunted house
Born in Pittsburgh in 1933 , the former lab technician was almost 50 when she made her big - screen debut as a woman playing a Munchkin in The Wizard of Oz in 1982 's Under the Rainbow .
Poltergeist followed , in which her character came to the assistance of a suburban family living in a haunted house .
Fans will remember her child - like voice exhorting spirits to " go into the light " before declaring " this house is clean " .
She went on to appear with Molly Ringwald in Sixteen Candles , before returning as Tangina in Poltergeist II : The Other Side and Poltergeist III .
Rubinstein was sent to hospital at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center two months ago , after suffering a mild heart attack .
" She had ongoing health issues and unfortunately they finally overtook her , " her agent Eric Stevens said .
While Microsoft claims 70 - 80 % of all publishers in the world are currently in the process of developing Natal - based games , some developers are disputing the merits of Microsoft ’s motion - control peripheral .
It ’s certainly disheartening to see Microsoft dropping horsepower from the device , but what ’s more disturbing is seeing developers — the people responsible for the games we love — question it .
How will Natal fare when it launches this holiday season ?
Traveller ’s
Tales director Jon Burton has already given his thoughts on the device , saying it has a fundamental problem .
“ [ Natal is ] exceedingly clever , but the lag on the input and lack of physical buttons is really going to restrict the kind of games that can be done with it , ” he commented .
“ [ However , ] the software behind Natal stunned me , to be able to take effectively a bump-map of a person and turn that into a fully articulated and rigged polygonal skeleton is an incredible feat . ”
“ Whether Natal becomes a real game - changer – evolving the Xbox 360 into a new software platform – or simply remains an amusement , will relate heavily on its ability to find its ‘ killer app , ' ” said Weaseltron Entertainment Adrian Hirst in Develop ’s recent “ Jury ” feature .
“ Microsoft need to start showing some real killer games / applications for Natal before people really start getting interested in it as a platform . ”
I ’ve said this before , and I ’ll say it again : my greatest fear is that Natal will seem like a cheap gimmick at worst and a tech demo at best .
Microsoft did n’t demo
Natal at this year ’s CES ( at least not publicly ) , so it ’s hard to know just where it sits on the continuum .
Is it really an immersive experience , or will the lag truly pose a problem ?
Jon Burton is n’t the only one concerned about Natal ’s latency issues , so it ’s definitely something that should be addressed if it ’s significant .
We ’ll surely find out more about it at E3 this summer .
I guess it comes down to how developers harness the device ’s capabilities , as Hirst said , but I imagine it will take some time before they fully understand all of its intricacies .
You ca n’t release it and immediately expect someone to come along and create a killer app for it within the first year — let alone the first few months — that it ’s available .
Developers have hardly had Natal dev kits long enough to create AAA games .
Nevertheless , it really is the developers ’ responsibility in terms of selling Natal .
Andrew Oliver , Chief Technical Officer for Blitz Games Studios supported this by saying , “ Pushing out cheap rubbish can alienate the very people the industry is trying to attract .
Developers and publishers need to act responsibly for the longer term . ”
Many developers are unsure of Natal ’s ability to bring experiences that both hardcore and casual gamers can enjoy , even though Microsoft ’s Robbie Bach has said before that hardcore gamers will “ love Natal . ”
Skepticism is arguably Microsoft ’s greatest challenge in terms of marketing the peripheral to studios .
“ I ’m just not convinced that people can enjoy the same range and fidelity of games as they do on the Wii without at least some physical connection to the experience , ” added Proper Games developer Andrew Smith .
“ We ’ll see some cool stuff , no doubt about it , but I remain thoroughly skeptical as to whether it ’ll do much business , and as such I ’m personally quite reluctant to dive into it yet . ”
Despite the skepticism and even small criticisms , there are some developers in the industry who are optimistic about Microsoft ’s interface .
It will allow them to create new , immersive experiences , opening up a whole new avenue of games .
“ Natal is a lot more immersive [ than the Wii ] , ” stated Lightning Fish Games ’ Simon Prytherch .
“ It will allow us to do games not possible on the other platforms . ”
What do you think ?
Will Natal be a hit for Microsoft or a flash in the pan ?
And what of Sony ’s motion controller ?
We ’d love to hear your thoughts !
Mention Internet Explorer to most knowledgeable computer types and you 're likely to prompt a flood of profanities that would even embarrass the cast of Jersey Shore .
So do n't expect such folks to mourn at the funeral for Internet Explorer 6 , which takes place next week under the auspices of Denver 's Aten Design Group .
How did IE6 die ?
According to the announcement on view below , it was a workplace accident at Google Inc .
The services , to be held at 7 p.m. March 4 at Aten 's offices , at 1629 Downing Street , probably wo n't be a respectful affair , given that the event 's invitation urges folks to mix and mingle with the city 's " top IE6 haters . "
And that 's fine by me .
I 'm writing this on a borrowed computer because earlier today , mine was attacked by an evil replicating virus , or something similar , that Westword 's computer guru says was spawned by -- you guessed it -- Internet Explorer .
Burn in hell , IE6 !

LOS ANGELES  A New Age motivational speaker who led a sweat lodge ceremony in Arizona last year in which three people perished appeared in an Arizona courtroom in handcuffs and waist chains on Thursday to face charges of three counts of manslaughter .
His attorney said he would plead not guilty .
James A. Ray , 52 , president of James Ray International , a multimillion - dollar company in Carlsbad , Calif. , that promises followers a path to “ harmonic wealth in all areas of your life , ” was brought into Yavapai County Superior Court in Camp Verde wearing orange prison garb .
He sat impassively as his attorney , Luis Li , told Judge Warren Darrow about the intended plea and asked the judge to reconsider the $ 5 million bail set for his client , which he has been unable to post .
Mr. Ray was indicted on Wednesday .
A formal plea would be entered at his arraignment , which is expected later this month , according to Dennis W. McGrane , the chief deputy county attorney .
Camp Verde is less than 20 miles from the rustic retreat outside Sedona where the fatal sweat lodge ceremony was held on Oct .
8 . The victims  Kirby Brown , 38 , of Westtown , N.Y. ; James Shore , 40 , of Milwaukee ; and Liz Neuman , 49 , of Prior Lake , Minn .
 were overcome in a two - hour “ spiritual warrior ” ceremony , in which hot rocks were placed inside a tent so the 55 participants could sweat out whatever was ailing their souls .
Twenty others suffered heat - related injuries .

A recent report on the November 2009 U.S. trade deficit found that rising oil imports widened our deficit , increasing the gap between our imports and exports .
This is but one example that our economic recovery and long - term growth is inexorably linked to our reliance on foreign oil .
The United States is spending approximately $ 1 billion a day overseas on oil instead of investing the funds at home , where our economy sorely needs it .
Burning oil that exacerbates global warming also poses serious threats to our national security and the world ’s security .
For these reasons we need to kick the oil addiction by investing in clean - energy reform to reduce oil demand , while taking steps to curb global warming .
In 2008 the United States imported oil from 10 countries currently on the State Department ’s Travel Warning List , which lists countries that have “ long - term , protracted conditions that make a country dangerous or unstable . ”
These nations include Algeria , Chad , Colombia , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Iraq , Mauritania , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and Syria .
Our reliance on oil from these countries could have serious implications for our national security , economy , and environment .
Oil imports fuel “ dangerous or unstable ” governments
The United States imported 4 million barrels of oil a day — or 1.5 billion barrels total — from “ dangerous or unstable ” countries in 2008 at a cost of about $ 150 billion .
This estimate excludes Venezuela , which is not on the State Department ’s “ dangerous or unstable ” list but has maintained a distinctly anti-American foreign and energy policy .
Venezuela is one of the top five oil exporters to the United States , and we imported 435 million barrels of oil from them in 2008 .
As a major contributor to the global demand for oil the United States is paying to finance and sustain unfriendly regimes .
Our demand drives up oil prices on the global market , which oftentimes benefits oil - producing nations that do n’t sell to us .
The Center for American Progress finds in “ Securing America ’s Future : Enhancing Our National Security by Reducing oil Dependence and Environmental Damage , ” that “ because of this , anti-Western nations such as Iran — with whom the United States by law cannot trade or buy oil — benefit regardless of who the end buyer of the fuel is . ”
Further , the regimes and elites that economically benefit from rich energy resources rarely share oil revenues with their people , which worsens economic disparity in the countries and at times creates resource - driven tension and crises .
The State Department cites oil - related violence in particular as a danger in Nigeria , where more than 54 national oil workers or businesspeople have been kidnapped at oil - related facilities and other infrastructure since January 2008 .
Attacks by insurgents on the U.S. military and civilians continue to be a danger in Iraq .
Our oil dependence will also be increasingly harder and more dangerous to satisfy .
In 2008 the United States consumed 23 percent of the world ’s petroleum , 57 percent of which was imported .
Yet the United States holds less than 2 percent of the world ’s oil reserves .
Roughly 40 percent of our imports came from Canada , Mexico , and Saudi Arabia , but we ca n’t continue relying on these allies .
The majority of Canada ’s oil lies in tar sands , a very dirty fuel , and Mexico ’s main oil fields are projected dry up within a decade .
Without reducing our dependence on oil we ’ll be forced to increasingly look to more antagonistic and volatile countries that pose direct threats to our national security .
Climate change is a major threat to U.S. and world security
Meanwhile , America ’s voracious oil appetite continues to contribute to another growing national security concern : climate change .
Burning oil is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore a major driver of climate change , which if left unchecked could have very serious security global implications .
Burning oil imported from “ dangerous or unstable ” countries alone released 640.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , which is the same as keeping more than 122.5 million passenger vehicles on the road .
Recent studies found that the gravest consequences of climate change could threaten to destabilize governments , intensify terrorist actions , and displace hundreds of millions of people due to increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters , higher incidences of diseases such as malaria , rising sea levels , and food and water shortages .
A 2007 analysis by the Center for American Progress concludes that the geopolitical implications of climate change could include wide - spanning social , political , and environmental consequences such as “ destabilizing levels of internal migration ” in developing countries and more immigration into the United States .
The U.S. military will face increasing pressure to deal with these crises , which will further put our military at risk and require already strapped resources to be sent abroad .
Global warming - induced natural disasters will create emergencies that demand military aid , such as Hurricane Katrina at home and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami abroad .
The world ’s poor will be put in the most risk , as richer countries are more able to adapt to climate change .
Developed countries will be responsible for aid efforts as well as responding to crises from climate - induced mass migration .
Military and intelligence experts alike recognize that global warming poses serious environmental , social , political , and military risks that we must address in the interest of our own defense .
The Pentagon is including climate change as a security threat in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review , a congressionally mandated report that updates Pentagon priorities every four years .
The State Department will also incorporate climate change as a national security threat in its Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review .
And in September the CIA created the Center on Climate Change and National Security to provide guidance to policymakers surrounding the national security impact of global warming .
Leading Iraq and Afghanistan military veterans also advocate climate and clean - energy policies because they understand that such reform is essential to make us safer .
Jonathan Powers , an Iraq war veteran and chief operating officer for the Truman National Security Project , said “ We recognize that climate change is already affecting destabilized states that have fragile governments .
That ’s why hundreds of veterans in nearly all 50 states are standing up with Operation Free — because they know that in those fragile states , against those extremist groups , it is our military that is going to have to act . ”
The CNA Corporation ’s Military Advisory Board determined in 2007 that “ Climate change can act as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world , and it presents significant national security challenges for the United States . ”
In an update of its 2007 report last year CNA found that climate change , energy dependence , and national security are interlinked challenges .
The report , “ Powering America ’s Defense : Energy and the Risks to National Security , ” reiterates the finding that fossil fuel dependence is unequivocally compromising our national security .
The board concludes , “ Overdependence on imported oil — by the U.S. and other nations — tethers America to unstable and hostile regimes , subverts foreign policy goals , and requires the U.S. to stretch its military presence across the globe . ”
CNA advises , “ Given the national security threats of America ’s current energy posture , a major shift in energy policy and practice is required . ”
Big
Oil is heavily profiting from the status quo
Many major oil companies and their trade association , the American Petroleum Institute , are some of the most vocal opponents of increasing American energy independence and reducing global warming pollution .
This is likely because they profit by buying oil from “ dangerous or unstable ” states .
This includes importing oil from Syria , Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , Mauritania , Iraq , Congo , Colombia , Chad , and Algeria .
In 2008 Chevron made a profit of $ 23.9 billion while nearly half of its imports — 138 million barrels of oil — came from these countries .
ExxonMobil made $ 45.2 billion while getting 43 percent of its oil — 205.6 million barrels — from these countries .
About one - third of BP ’s imports — 110.6 million barrels — were from these countries in 2008 , when the company ’s profits were $ 25.6 billion .
Approximately 25 percent of ConocoPhillips ’ imports were from “ dangerous or unstable ” countries — 116.7 million barrels — in 2008 , contributing to its $ 52.7 billion profit .
And Shell raked in $ 31.4 billion that year , also importing one - quarter of its oil — 61.8 million barrels — from these countries .
( Note : Shell includes Shell Chemical LP , Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc , Shell US Trading Co , Shell Oil Co , and Shell Oil Co Deer Park ) .
With that kind of money it ’s no wonder Big Oil is doing everything in its power to maintain the status quo .
The companies are spending record amounts on lobbying to stop clean - energy and climate legislation .
The American Petroleum Institute spent $ 75.2 million for public relations and advertising in 2008 , and in the third quarter of 2009 the oil and gas industry outspent all other sectors lobbying on climate change , with Exxon Mobil leading the pack spending $ 7.2 million .
Oil companies are also the main source of funding for API ’s front group , Energy Citizens , which makes false claims that climate change legislation will be a national energy tax and job killer .
In reality , passing clean - energy and pollution reduction legislation will be affordable and even save consumers money while creating a net of 1.7 million jobs .
Clean energy can help bring the economy back to life
The United States has an opportunity right now to reduce its dependence on foreign oil by adopting clean - energy and global warming pollution reduction policies that would spur economic recovery and long - term sustainable growth .
With a struggling economy and record unemployment , we need that money invested here to enhance our economic competitiveness .
Instead of sending money abroad for oil , investing in clean - energy technology innovation would boost growth and create jobs .
Reducing oil imports through clean - energy reform would reduce money sent overseas for oil , keep more money at home for investments , and cut global warming pollution .
A Center for American Progress analysis shows that the clean - energy provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and ACES combined would generate approximately $ 150 billion per year in new clean - energy investments over the next decade .
This government - induced spending will come primarily from the private sector , and the investments would create jobs and help reduce oil dependence .
And by creating the conditions for a strong economic recovery , such as creating more finance for energy retrofits and energy - saving projects and establishing loans for manufacturing low - carbon products , we can give the United States the advantage in the clean - energy race .
Investing in a clean - energy economy is the clear path toward re-establishing our economic stability and strengthening our national security .

DETROIT  General Motors said on Wednesday that it would shut down Hummer , the brand of big sport utility vehicles that became synonymous with the term gas guzzler , after a deal to sell it to a Chinese manufacturer fell apart .
The buyer , Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines , said in a statement that it had withdrawn its bid because it was unable to receive approval from the Chinese government , which was trying to put a new emphasis on limiting China ’s dependence on imported oil and protecting the environment .
Tight financial markets also hurt the deal .
When the commerce ministry did not bless the transaction , the well - capitalized Chinese banks became reluctant to lend money to Tengzhong , even though it tried to set up an overseas subsidiary to buy Hummer .
That left Tengzhong trying to borrow money from Western banks that have been curtailing their lending even to established borrowers , much less a little - known company from western China .
A spokesman for Hummer , Nick Richards , said G.M. had no specific timetable for completing its wind - down , but left open the possibility that G.M. would be open to new bids .

EACH New Year 's
Day lots of people make plans to do more exercise or give up smoking .
But by January 2nd many of them have not moved from the sofa or are lighting another cigarette .
Such triumphs of optimism over experience are common enough .
But like other examples of repeated procrastination , they are hard to explain using standard economic models .
These models recognise that people prefer to put off unpleasant things until the future rather than do them today .
Asked on January 1st to pick a date for that first session in the gym , say , you may well choose to start in two weeks ' time rather than tomorrow .
But the standard models also assume that your choices about future actions are “ time - consistent ” — they do not depend on when you are asked to make the choice .
By January 14th , in other words , you should still be committed to going to the gym the next day .
In the real world , however , you may well choose to delay your start - date again .
In a 1999 paper * on the economics of procrastination , Ted O'Donoghue and Matthew Rabin pointed out that people are often unrealistically optimistic about their own future likelihood of doing things — such as exercise or saving — that involve costs at the time they are done , but whose benefits lie even further ahead .
Mr O'Donoghue and Mr Rabin showed that this sort of behaviour can be explained if people are time - inconsistent .
“ Present - biased ” preferences mean that people will always tend to put off unpleasant things until tomorrow , even if the immediate cost involved is tiny .
As long as they are unsure of the precise extent of this bias , they believe ( incorrectly ) that they will in fact “ do it tomorrow ” .
But since they feel this way at each point in time , tomorrow never quite comes .
Such a model can therefore explain endless procrastination .
It can also suggest ways to change behaviour .
A recent NBER paper by Esther Duflo , Michael Kremer and Jonathan Robinson argues that a tendency to procrastinate may explain why so few African farmers use fertiliser , despite knowing that it raises yields and profits .
In trials on the farms of maize farmers in western Kenya , the three economists found that using half a teaspoon of fertiliser per plant increased seasonal profits by an average of 36 % per acre , even if farmers made no other changes to their farming techniques .
Doing so after it was clear that the seeds had sprouted eliminated most of the risk of paying for fertiliser in a year of poor weather .
Only 9 % of the farmers believed fertiliser would not increase their profits .
Yet only 29 % had used any in either of the two preceding seasons .
When asked why , almost four - fifths of farmers said that they did not have enough money to buy fertiliser for the land they farmed .
Yet fertiliser was readily available in multiples of a kilogram , so even poor farmers earned enough to buy fertiliser for at least a fraction of their fields .
Better intentions made little difference : virtually all farmers said they planned to use fertiliser the following season , but only 37 % actually did so .
The reason for this gap between intent and action , the economists argue , is that many farmers are present - biased and procrastinate repeatedly .
Right after the harvest , when farmers are cash - rich , most can afford to buy fertiliser .
But going to town to buy it imposes a small cost : a half - hour walk , say , or a bus ticket .
So farmers postpone the purchase , believing they will make it later .
But they overestimate their ability to put aside enough money to do that , ensuring that their plans to buy fertiliser meet much the same fate as a typical new - year resolution .
A model of such preferences generates several interesting predictions .
It suggests that a tiny discount — enough to make up for the small costs associated with buying fertiliser — should induce present - biased farmers to make the purchase .
The model also suggests that a given discount would be more effective if offered immediately after the harvest rather than just before the next planting period , by which time it would be useful only for those farmers who had no problems with saving money .
Solving St Augustine
The economists devised a scheme in which farmers paid the full market price for fertiliser , but had it delivered to their homes by a non-governmental organisation at no additional cost .
A subset received this “ discount ” at harvest time , while another group were also offered free delivery , but only when planting time was imminent .
Still others were offered a 50 % subsidy on the market price , an approach commonly taken by governments to encourage fertiliser use .
As the model of time - inconsistent preferences predicted , the offer of free delivery early in the season pushed up usage of fertiliser by 11 percentage points over a control group who were not offered anything .
The same discount late in the season , however , had a statistically insignificant effect .
A 50 % subsidy later in the season , a much costlier policy than free delivery , pushed up usage by about as much as the early discount .
Interestingly , nearly half of a group of farmers who were offered a choice picked early rather than late free delivery .
Early delivery means advance payment , with any interest that might have been earned in the interim being forgone .
Many farmers , it seemed , were well aware of their own tendency to procrastinate and were looking for a way to force themselves to buy fertiliser .
Such devices can help other procrastinators , too .
In recent field trials in the Philippines some smokers who wanted to quit were offered a “ commitment contract ” .
Those who signed up put money into a zero - interest bank account .
If they passed a test certifying that they were nicotine - free six months later , they got their money back .
If not , it went to charity .
The contract increased the likelihood of quitting by over 30 % over a control group .
Those new - year resolutions need not turn to ash .

More bad news for the dwindling number of remaining fans of the Paleolithic Continuity Theory ( PCT ) in the form of a newly - published study in the PLoS Biology Journal .

Sowing their seeds : Neolithic farmers spawned most European males
By Katherine Harmon
Agriculture emerged on the human cultural scene about 10,000 years ago , spreading rapidly through Europe from the Near East to the British Isles in about 4,000 years .
But did this world - changing technology get disseminated via an expanding wave of industrious farmers or through word - of - mouth among local hunter - gatherer populations ?
To help answer this much - debated question , researchers have peered into the genetics of modern Europeans for clues .
Mark Jobling of the University of Leicester in the U.K. and his colleagues found not only that agriculture seems to have spread westward via a new group of Neolithic people from the Near East , but also that these new farmers were incredibly successful with the local ladies , leaving their genetic traces in their modern male descendents .
“ We focused on the commonest Y - chromosome lineage in Europe , ” Jobling said in a prepared statement .
The team analyzed a single haplotype , R1b1b2 ( which is carried by about 110 million men in Europe today ) from 2,574 European men whose families had been living in the same location for at least two generations .
This common haplotype , however , is not randomly distributed across the continent .
“ It follows a gradient from south - east to north - west , ” he said .
About 12 percent of men in eastern
Turkey have it , whereas some 85 percent of men carry it in Ireland .
Others have previously speculated that this distribution was due to earlier , Paleolithic expansion from Africa .
But Jobling and his fellow researchers asserted that it reflects a rapid , more recent genetic spread during the Neolithic — one that has a “ striking ” correlation with known Neolithic sites .
“ The geographical distribution of diversity within the haplogroup is best explained by its spread from a single source from the Near East via [ Turkey ] during the Neolithic , ” the authors concluded in their study , which was published online January 19 in PLoS Biology .
“ In total , this means that more than 80 percent of European Y chromosomes descend from incoming farmers , ” geneticist Patricia Balaresque , also of the University of Leicester and lead study author , said in a prepared statement .
“ In contrast , most maternal genetic lineages seem to descend from hunter - gatherers . ”
How could these early European ancestors come from such different groups ?
“ To us , this suggests a reproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous hunter - gatherer males during the switch from hunting and gathering to farming , ” Balaresque said .
“ Maybe , back then , it was just sexier to be a farmer . ”
A series of aggressive federal probes into the recalls of Toyota autos are looking at whether the automaker has been less than forthcoming about the safety defects in some of its vehicles .
But in Japan many believe it ’s the U.S. government that has something to hide .
Congressional hearings on the recalls , they say , are part of conspiracy to help prop up Toyota ’s largest American rival , General Motors Co. , which the government bailed out of bankruptcy last year , becoming the majority shareholder .
The evidence suggests otherwise , and top Toyota executives have sought to debunk such speculation .
Even so , “ the conspiracy theory on these Toyota hearings is alive and well in Japan , ” said Jeffrey Kingston , a professor at Temple University in Japan .
“ Conspiracy theories do n’t deal with the facts , but there ’s a comfort factor among the Japanese public in believing that Japan is being made the scapegoat for U.S. economic problems . ”
In the case of Toyota , however , the theory that it has been singled out for criticism fails to take into account that U.S. corporations regularly come in for beatings by Congress -- with Wall Street banks being just the most recent examples .
And in granting GM and Chrysler tens of billions of dollars of aid , Congress for years blamed the companies ’ leaders for poor management and lousy products .
What ’s more , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating reports of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles years before the government took its controlling interest in GM and a 10 % stake in the post - bankruptcy Chrysler Group .
Indeed , NHTSA is now under fire for not acting more quickly and more forcefully in demanding that Toyota take action to address sudden acceleration .
“ It ’s not about politics , it ’s about safety , ” said Kurt Bardella , spokesman for Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Vista ) , the ranking minority on a House committee that organized one of the Capitol Hill hearings this week .
The view that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee efforts to review Toyota ’s safety defects and recalls to assist U.S. companies is “ idiotic ” considering that Issa was an ardent opponent of the automaker bailouts , Bardella said .
Even Toyota ’s president , Akio Toyoda , and his top U.S. executive rejected the notion when queried during congressional hearings this week .
“ I do n’t believe that ’s true .
I think the government ’s acting fairly , ” Jim Lentz , Toyota ’s top U.S. sales executive , told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee .
Lentz also apologized for a series of missteps that allowed the sudden - acceleration problem to go unchecked for years , ultimately leading Toyota to issue nearly 10 million recall notices and temporarily halt sales of eight models .
At least 34 deaths have been blamed on sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles , according to complaints filed with NHTSA , which the agency said is more than all other automakers combined .
Still , to some in Japan , the congressional hearings are reminiscent of the anti-Japanese hysteria of the 1980s , when Japanese investments in high - profile properties such as the Rockefeller Center in New York set off a political firestorm .
One Japanese customer , who bought her fourth Toyota car in June but declined to give her name , said she felt safe driving her Toyota .
“ I think things are being exaggerated in the U.S. , ” she said .
Even some Japanese analysts , while acknowledging problems in Toyota ’s handling of its recall , said they thought Congress has been a bit too opportunistic in its pursuit of a solution .
“ It does seem that emotions are a factor at these hearings , ” said Masahiro Fukuda , manager of Fourin Inc. , a research and publishing company specializing in the auto industry .
“ Many Japanese see these hearings as an effective way for the U.S. to beat up Toyota and allow General Motors and Chrysler to recover and grab a bigger share of the market , ” said Koji Endo , an analyst at Advanced Research Japan , an independent research house .
While acknowledging the safety problems that prompted the recalls , some in the United States also wonder whether the passion with which Congress has gone after Toyota during the hearings is n’t partially fueled by economic self - interest .
It “ ca n’t be ignored , ” said Mark Zupan , dean of the University of Rochester ’s School of Business .
Zupan said that if lawmakers applied the same standard to all auto companies , the hearings would never end .
“ This is not an unbiased jury . ”
Toyota has made things worse by not addressing its problems more aggressively , he said .
On Friday , auto information company Edmunds.com released its analysis of sudden - acceleration complaints to NHTSA and found that while Toyota ’s rate of complaints was higher than any other automaker , Ford Motor Co. also had a high number .
“ The emphasis of the recent congressional hearings seems to have been who learned about what and when they learned it .
The core issue of what ’s really causing the unresolved cases of unintended acceleration has been skirted , ” said Jeremy Anwyl , chief executive of Edmunds.com .
“ The truth is that no one can say for sure . ”
Anwyl said sudden acceleration should be the subject of a cross-industry and government safety agency collaboration to pool data and resources to discover the cause .
In Tokyo , consumers believe the Toyota recalls have called into question the entire nation ’s reputation for producing quality products .
Hideo Usuda , 67 , a retiree who does n’t drive , said , “ Toyota ’s handling [ of the recall will ] affect Japan ’s national interest . ”
But Fukuda also said Toyota has itself to blame .
The company , he insisted , “ has n’t been sensitive enough to concerns of average consumers . ”
The fallout from the automaker ’s massive recall in the U.S. is also spreading to Toyota ’s home market .
Japanese officials are investigating 38 consumer complaints about sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles , officials have announced .
It was the first indication that the accelerator problem had affected Japanese car buyers .

Do you remember what you wanted to be when you grew up - and have you achieved it ?
A study run over the past 50 years has tested what helps childhood aspirations become reality .
In 1969 when they were 11 years old , 14,000 British children were asked to write 30 - minute essays predicting what they might become in the future .
My husband would have just won £ 200 so we decided to go to the Moon for our holiday while we had not got any children
I may get married and I have to cook his meals before he comes or he will start to moan
Two of the essays
As well as evidence of individual ambition , the essays offered snapshots of how the children imagined life would be when they reached 25 .
Many mentioned future holidays on the Moon - not surprising , as the essays were written in the same month as the first lunar landing in July 1969 .
Most foresaw marriage on the horizon .
No - one mentioned divorce , and the concept of co-habitation seemed almost inconceivable .
As many boys as girls wrote about either getting married or having children .
" You have the girls at 11 writing not just about doing housework , but having very clear career aspirations , albeit perhaps to be a teacher or a hairdresser , but very much thinking about themselves in the world of work , " says Professor Jane Elliott of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies , part of the Institute for Education which is carrying out the lifetime survey .

Or catch up on the iPlayer " There is definitely an observable link between what people are aspiring to do when they are 11 years old and what they end up doing when they are older . "
Of those with professional aspirations at age 11 - with dreams of being a vet , a lawyer , an architect - more than half did indeed end up entering professional occupations , even if their eventual career was n't quite the one they had had in mind .
BRUCE , IT MANAGER
At 11 , Bruce wrote about his 25 - year - old self : " I work for a Newspaper as a journalist .
I am quite a successful journalist and earn quite a lot of money .
I wish to be an author when I am older and write several books I hope to be quite wealthy later in life when my books are published . "
Bruce and his father
That dream has not come to pass , but as an interim manager for a number of IT projects , he is successful and has houses in both the UK and United States .
His father was captain on a cruise ship and would be away from home for months at a time .
In his absence , Bruce 's mother ran the house .
He recalls how strict she was .
" I remember we had to call her the major and when my Dad was home she would say to him , ' You 're the captain of the ship but I 'm the major at home ' .
" She use to say to me ' You can do absolutely anything , Bruce . '
She had great faith in my abilities and at the time I wrote the essay , I think people saw me as being something of a clever dick .
I knew I was fairly bright , as I was in the upper stream and had just passed the 11 Plus .
I had this unshakeable belief in my abilities . "
Research using data from the thousands of individuals in the 1958 Birth Cohort Study , by Professor Ingrid Schoon , confirms that parental aspirations and involvement with their children 's education has a significant impact on academic attainment .
This is true even once socio-economic disadvantage has been taken into account .
KIM , WOULD -BE WANDERER
Kim , right , with her parents and younger siblings
At 11 , Kim imagined a life revolving around travel - working with the animals in Africa , and studying the aardvark and the warthog .
Her essay ends ambitiously : " I plan to see the whole world before I die and maybe to see the Moon beneath my feet . "
Her life has followed that pattern - she left school at 18 and went to Greece , Italy and other parts of Europe .
Falling in love with an Australian , they married and travelled the world together .
After living for seven years in Australia , the couple returned to the UK and they now have three children .
Kim still dreams of travel .
" My husband is so stressed at work that all he can think of is getting a recliner and Sky sport .
All I can think of is getting into a camper van and taking off .
I 'd quite like to throw all my cards up in the air .
I 've had long enough of working 9 - 5 . "
She still remembers writing her essay .
Kim and her mother , Peggy " I remember being that age and having those very strong feelings about wanting to travel .
It was n't so much the cities - it was the wild remote places I wanted to see .
I could n't wait .
I had such itchy feet - and I still have itchy feet unfortunately . "
While the 1958 Birth Cohort Study includes a detailed housing history for all its respondents , foreign travel is not included .
But of the 18,558 members born in one week in 1958 , 7 % - 1,340 people - have emigrated overseas and are no longer part of the study .
MARGARET , POLICE OFFICER Margaret as a child , and as a cop At 11 , Margaret was strongly influenced by her mother , who acted as a " ministering angel " to the small community in which they lived .
Her mother would make food for the local old folk , tend to the sick and even lay out those who died .
Margaret accompanied her , and as a child wanted to be a nurse .
She wrote : " I am working at the Royal hospital .
I am only part time , and I have a family .
Every day I meet new people and I like this very much .
I am leading a good life and it is the best because you go out in the morning happy and come in happy . "
And so she was - for a while .
Margaret started work at the local psychiatric hospital , but some of the inmates frightened her .
Within a year she left , and joined the police force . " [ Here ]
I use at least some psychology to try to understand why some of the people I might have to arrest do what they do .
I do help all kinds of people , " she says .
She 's still very involved in the community , and has received an MBE for her work .
Ms Elliott says Margaret is not alone in changing her career path .
" Between the ages of 33 and 42 , about four in 10 of those in the 1958 cohort shifted from one type of occupation to another . "
ANNE , WORKING MOTHER
Anne had no problems envisaging her future self at age 11 .
" It was a Monday and off to work .
I work in a hairdresser , and looking for a shop - when I have saved up some money I will buy one . "
But a family move left her without a college place to study for the job she wanted , and reluctantly she joined the bank - a workplace where opportunities were limited and where the height of career progression for her and the other female employees was making first cashier .
1958 British Birth Cohort Study Run by Centre for Longitudinal Studies , Institute of Education
Those in the study who 've lost contact with researchers can get in touch with the centre
One of its three British cradle - to - grave surveys along with 1970 and 2000 - 1 Plus Medical Research Council 's study of children born in 1946 " There were n't any female bank managers so you could n't see yourself going up the ladder .
But as I got older , I realised relationships and living were more important than a career , " Anne says today .
After having three children , she left the bank and took a succession of jobs which fitted in around the school run , such as Avon Lady and making furniture for dolls houses .
Her husband , a builder , has been at the mercy of fluctuations in the property market and after a long period without work , the couple 's debts mounted , culminating in him being declared bankrupt .
Anne 's working life - largely part - time jobs fitted around family commitments - is typical of women of this generation , says Ms Elliott .
Further research at the centre shows how many women moved to a lower status occupation after taking time out to care for their children .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I always wanted to be a doctor and yet was never encouraged at school or told I had the ability - so I think I was scared of failing and studied biochemistry instead .
After gaining my PhD , I gave it all up and now have a successful marketing career .
But I still wish I 'd had the courage to study medicine .
Joanna , Atlanta , GA Aged 10 or thereabouts , and loving books , but also being a child of the Apollo era , I wanted to be either a librarian or an astronaut .
And in reality ?
Also being good with numbers , I became an accountant .
I 'm not too upset at not becoming a librarian but I would have loved to have flown the space shuttle .
Helen , Berkshire I found my old record of achievement whilst clearing out my messy spare room this weekend .
It was so cute .
In it , my younger self had written about how I will work hard to achieve my dream job as an animator .
Every single step I have made since I wrote that has been towards fulfilling this goal - which I did .
I have worked across children 's TV and next - gen games as a character animator and I love , love , love it .
Dani , Bristol , England
When I was 11 I already was given my first computer by my parents .
I wanted to be the next Bill Gates .
Not quite there yet but I 'm a software architect so I 'm still playing around on computers .
For me , the goal has n't changed but the perspective has .
Michael Simcoe , Bangor , Wales
My sister and I used to imagine we were surgeons and do ' operations ' on each other , pretend to suture and mend broken arms and legs when we were little .
As a teenager I was adamant that medicine was definitely not for me , especially as our dad wanted one of us to follow in his footsteps .
I later went on to graduate from medical school and become a real - life doctor after all .
Katherine , Birmingham
One of my very first words was " tractor " and I always dreamed of being a tractor / digger driver .
I fulfilled that ambition in my teens and early 20s and now I work for a large construction machinery company in the world where I now teach people how to design them for a living .
This also means I have unlimited access to a vast array of the very best big boys toys known to man .
No wonder I 'm always smiling as walk into the office each day .
Simon Wright , Cheshire , England I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up .
Although I am not one , I work as an aerospace engineer , which is the practical implementation of my dream .
I may not get to space , but my work will .
Cristina , Bristol
The thing is we still focus on professions " what do you want to be " if you look at it form a broader " what do you want to do , " a different picture emerges .
Think about the aspects of that profession that made you want to be , say , a doctor and see if those things that attracted you are a feature of what you now do .
I desperately wanted to be an actor .
The bit I liked was standing in front of people and having people listen to what I have to say .
I get to do that job every day in what I do ( manager ) .
Rob , London I switched from being in the police , to social work , to other forms of caring - type jobs when I was a kid .
After a few years feeling around in the wilderness ( including a brief but awful stint in the forces ) I started a psychology degree and immediately loved it .
Now a forensic psychologist , so guess I finally found my destiny in a caring profession .
Aeriel , up north
At 15 I wanted to be a vet , but my headmistress , who was one of the old school , said no self - respecting farmer would want a female to attend his prize bull .
I later had a change of heart and entered the nursing profession , where I spent the best part of 43 years .
Elaine Whitham , Congleton England
When I was a little girl I was always painting and drawing , and I wanted to grow up to be an artist and own a cattery .
I am now a successful children 's book illustrator , but I have just the one cat .
Sarah , Chichester , UK
My whole childhood and teen years I wanted to be an astronaut and visit the moon and I am now lucky enough to be sending this e-mail from MARS !
... sorry I meant eating a MARS on lunch break from my IT job .
Mark , London
The only job I ever wanted to do was to go to sea .
At 11 or 12 I was n't clear exactly what it was I was going to do at sea when I got there .
I suppose I had some romantic notion that life at sea was all sunshine and fun .
However , I did join the Merchant Navy as an engineer and 17 years later came ashore and started to look after ships from a desk .
I am still in the business and still enjoying it .
Robert James , London
I have a sheet of official primary school paper from 1978 which asks what I want to be when I leave school - and at 10 years old I have written " computer programmer " .
And here I am , all this time later , in IT .
My whole school / college career was aimed at this profession and apart from my Saturday job in a supermarket , I 've never worked at anything else .
How I wish I 'd chosen something else .
Caroline
When I was a child , I wanted to be an ice skater , an England footballer ( mens ' team ) but also the team medic , a doctor , an actress , a pianist , an RAF fighter pilot , a long - distance lorry driver , a relief worker , the wife of Prince Edward and a writer .
I now work as a freelance writer , probably the only option on my list that is still open to me .
Catherine O , Maidenhead , UK I wanted to be a dentist from about 11 years old .
I 'm currently sitting in my surgery waiting for my next patient 16 years later .
Rhys , Wales
As a child I always wanted to be a doctor and help my sisters who were frequently ill and would not play with me .
I did become a doctor after graduating medical school in Afghanistan .
Arriving in the UK soon after that , my worst nightmare was not being able to practice medicine at all .
I am now a doctor working in the NHS and loving every minutes of it .
Asif Faizy , Basingstoke I wanted to be a vet or join the forces .
As there was no money , or encouragement going spare , being a vet was out of the question so I opted for the Army .
One back injury later , I have found a niche within environmental management , with lots of support and encouragement from family and a previous manager I now class as a friend .
I always loved nature as a child ...
Lisa F , Shrewsbury , UK From about the age of 10 I wanted to join the Royal Navy .
My uncle had served in the RN - I heard the stories of the Far East , and think that lit the fire .
At 16 I joined Ganges , went on to become a CPO WEA Submariner , served in the Falklands on the Sheffield .
Good times .
John Young , Glasgow
When I was a child , I was allured by the mystery of Argos .
When I used to walk past with my mother , I would point it out and say how I wanted to work there when I was an adult .
I had completely forgotten about that until some years later , when I was working part - time to support my studies in ... you guessed it , Argos .
I 've now got my degree , and started my career in the IT / Finance sector , but I am always very proud to say I have had my dream job in life already .
Michael , Kent
At the age of three I announced to my mum that I was n't going to primary school ; I was going to nurses ' college .
In three months time I 'll qualify as a doctor .
I was n't far wrong .
Rachel , Manchester
They say never work with children or animals , my girls did both .
One is a teacher and the other is a veterinary student and that 's what they wanted since they were about four years old .
Well done girls .
Russell O'Brien , Nottingham I always wanted to be a teacher when I grew up .
I 'm writing this from my PGCE course .
Guess dreams can come true .
Becky , London , UK I wish I had had my daughter 's foresight when I was 11 .
She has been adamant for the last five years ( she 's 15 now ) that she wants to be a marine biologist .
Had I thought of it when I was 11 , I would have studied for it with more enthusiasm than even she is showing now .
As it is , I have ended up a financial adviser in rural Norfolk .
Not ideal , but at least I 'm near the sea .
David , King 's Lynn Like many children I had an ambition - to be a flute - playing , ballet - dancing nun .
Obviously The Sound of Music had made a huge impression on me .
I learnt ballet and the flute , so two out of three was n't bad .

One day at the supermarket , my little daughter said she wanted to be a check - out girl when she grew up .
Now she runs mathematical models of atmospheric chemistry on a supercomputer at NCAR , Boulder , Colorado .
John , Clacks , Scotland I wanted to be an air hostess .
That dream died when I grew no taller than 5 ft .
Such is life I suppose .

In attesa del primo sciopero degli stranieri , è possibile ancora sorridere di fronte al collasso del sistema immigrazione in Italia ?
L’annuncio di ieri a “ Che tempo che fa ” del ministro dell ’ Interno , Roberto Maroni , di concedere protezione agli immigrati feriti a Rosarno , fa scappare una battuta : per essere considerati uomini , donne , lavoratori , cittadini in Italia bisogna avere la sventura di farsi sparare come è successo agli stranieri colpiti nella tre giorni e tre notti di caccia all ’uomo in Calabria ?
Quello del ministro è un provvedimento doveroso .
Ma senza un aggiornamento della legge sull ’immigrazione rimane un’elargizione , un regalo , un tampone alla bomba sociale che la Bossi - Fini prima e il pacchetto sicurezza poi hanno innescato .
Sentite qua .
1 ) Giovedì 14 gennaio , conclusa la trasmissione Annozero , la polizia ha fermato per mezz ’ora tre ospiti che erano intervenuti in diretta .
Non li hanno lasciati nemmeno uscire .
Sono stati bloccati in un corridoio secondario , dentro gli studi della Rai .
Non hanno fermato me ( che sono imputato davanti al Tribunale di Agrigento per aver dichiarato di essere iracheno quando sono stato ripescato dal mare di Lampedusa ) .
Non hanno nemmeno fermato l’onorevole del Pdl Alessandra Mussolini ( è parlamentare , non si può ) anche se potrebbe riconoscere chi si muove nella rete di estrema destra con cui è stata alleata fino a pochi mesi fa .
Hanno fermato gli unici tre ospiti neri .
Il funzionario di polizia voleva verificare che avessero davvero la ricevuta per aver chiesto il permesso di soggiorno .
Deve essere l’originale ( non una fotocopia ) .
Un abuso ?
No .
Da quando l’essere irregolari è reato , i pubblici ufficiali per non finire a loro volta nei guai devono controllare .
I cedolini c’erano .
Se avessero dimenticato a casa gli originali o anche se avessero avuto con sé le fotocopie ( per non perdere gli originali ) i tre ragazzi sarebbero stati rinchiusi nel centro di identificazione di Ponte Galeria e avrebbero rischiato fino a duemila euro di multa e un anno di carcere .
Provate voi a immaginare un italiano condannato a un anno di carcere per aver dimenticato la carta di identità ...
Infatti la legge vale solo per gli stranieri .
L’episodio va letto anche in un altro modo : uno schiavo dell ’agricoltura al Sud o dell ’edilizia al Nord , se non ha il permesso di soggiorno , non può mai più denunciare pubblicamente o alle autorità le sue condizioni di schiavitù .
Perché rischia l’arresto immediato e se non lascia l’Italia , una condanna fino a 4 anni di carcere .
Più del suo caporale , che non rischia nulla , e del datore di lavoro , che spesso non si trova mai .
2 ) Il ministro del Lavoro Maurizio Sacconi è talmente impegnato a scongiurare situazioni di schiavitù come quelle di Rosarno che nel 2009 ha avvallato queste disposizioni , contenute nel Documento di programmazione dell ’attività di vigilanza : meno controlli in tutta Italia , con punte del 50 per cento in Calabria .
La Calabria ha un altro record : secondo uno studio del 2006 dell ’
Agenzia delle entrate gli imprenditori calabresi evadono il 94 per cento dell ’ Irap , l’imposta regionale sulle attività produttive .
Significa che il 94 per cento dell ’economia calabrese è sommersa e resta sommersa grazie anche alla decisione del ministro Sacconi di ridurre i controlli ( e di indirizzarli semmai sulle imprese di proprietà di immigrati ) .
Non è solo una piaga del Sud. La Provincia di Venezia ha scoperto che il 27 per cento degli addetti nelle industrie manifatturiere in Veneto è composto da lavoratori stranieri senza permesso di soggiorno .
Siamo nel Nordest .
3 ) Dopo l’inchiesta de L’espresso a Foggia nel 2006 , Giuliano Amato , ministro dell ’
Interno nel governo Prodi , aveva istituito una commissione composta da prefetti , funzionari di polizia e ufficiali di carabinieri e guardia di finanza .
La commissione aveva suggerito la necessità di istituire il reato di caporalato perché , secondo i commissari , le leggi attuali non sono in grado di reprimere il fenomeno .
Il ministro dell ’Interno successivo , Roberto Maroni , ha istituito il reato di immigrazione clandestina che punisce anche i lavoratori .
Ma non i caporali .
Il progetto della commissione del 2006 è stato ignorato .
4 ) Sempre dopo l’inchiesta de L’espresso a Foggia nel 2006 , il ministro della Solidarietà sociale , Paolo Ferrero , nel governo Prodi , aveva istituito un fondo integrativo da affidare all ’
Inps per gestire con le regioni l’ospitalità , l’assistenza e la tutela dei lavoratori stagionali .
Il ricorso alla Corte costituzionale delle Regioni di centrodestra Lombardia e Veneto ha fatto bocciare il provvedimento .
5 ) Sempre dopo l’inchiesta de L’espresso a Foggia nel 2006 , il governo Prodi aveva proposto di estendere ai lavoratori irregolari la tutela prevista per le vittime della tratta dell ’immigrazione , qualora denunciassero i loro sfruttatori .
La proposta non è passata per l’opposizione di funzionari del ministero dell ’
Interno , perché temevano che la norma avrebbe aggirato i limiti imposti dalle quote annuali ( che sono la causa indiretta del lavoro nero .
L’esempio della Puglia nel 2006 : quote stagionali 1600 , necessità di lavoratori stagionali solo per la provincia di Foggia 5000 - 7000 ) .
6 ) Sempre dopo l’inchiesta de L’espresso a Foggia nel 2006 , il ministro del Lavoro , Cesare Damiano , nel governo Prodi , ha introdotto l’obbligo di registrare i lavoratori entro il giorno prima del loro inizio , per evitare lo sfruttamento e la registrazione postuma solo in caso di controlli o di incidente .
L’attuale governo Berlusconi ha proposto di sopprimere questa norma e il nuovo provvedimento attende l’approvazione della Camera .
7 ) Se un raccoglitore di arance senza documenti in regola avesse denunciato i suoi schiavisti a Rosarno , avrebbe rischiato fino a 4 anni di carcere .
Nessuna norma punisce i parlamentari che hanno contatti con mafia , ‘ ndrangheta e camorra .
8 ) Se uno straniero perde il lavoro e nel frattempo gli scade anche il permesso di soggiorno , entro sei mesi deve trovare un ’altra assunzione o andarsene .
Se resta commette reato , anche se non commette altri reati e si mantiene con i suoi risparmi .
I centri di detenzione per stranieri stanno diventando centri di detenzione per disoccupati .
9 ) Poiché lo Stato ha dimostrato in questi anni di non essere in grado di espellere gli irregolari che hanno commesso reati gravi ( solo il 40 per cento viene rimpatriato secondo dati del ministero dell ’
Interno consegnati a Medici senza frontiere ) , avremo un’ulteriore massa di lavoratori senza nessun diritto .
Se non quello di essere premiati dal ministro dell ’Interno .
Ma solo dopo essersi fatti sparare .
Per questo il primo marzo aderisco al primo Sciopero degli stranieri .

THE NO - SENSE JOBS PLAN ….
Arguably the single most farcical aspect of America ’s political discourse is listening to congressional Republicans talk about economic policy .
We ’re talking about a group of people who ’ve managed to be spectacularly wrong about practically every economic challenge in recent memory , but who are nevertheless convinced of their own self - righteous expertise .
It ’s hard not to cringe .
But yet , they keep talking , blissfully unaware of their track record of uninterrupted failure .
Yesterday , for example , House Minority Whip Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) visited the conservative Heritage Foundation to unveil what he called “ a no-cost jobs plan . ”
Andrew Leonard explained , “ Without adding a single dime to the deficit , the Republican ’s plan will ameliorate the worst unemployment crisis in 30 years .
One wonders how a political party capable of such innovative thinking ever lost its hold of power . ”
To recap : Cut regulations .
Freeze spending .
Cut taxes .
No new taxes .
That ’s the plan .
I would really , really love to have access to an alternative universe in which Cantor ’s plan could have been applied this past year , in parallel with our world , in which the economy was injected with a massive stimulus , so we could compare the efficacy of the two approaches in real time .
What would have happened if instead of spending money , the government had sat on its hands ?
I think about that all the time .
Republicans controlled the levers of power , and the results were nearly catastrophic for the economy .
Democrats were handed the reins , and while the economy is still struggling , we ’re working our way out of the ditch .
If we ’d listened to Cantor & Co. , we ’d still be digging .
As for the “ no - cost jobs plan , ” it ’s hard not to laugh at the stupidity .
We tried it Cantor ’s way .
We ’re still suffering the consequences .
NBC reported on Cantor ’s plan , and explained , “ The challenge for Cantor and Republicans is that these solutions — low taxes , free trade , and fewer regulations — existed during the Bush years , which saw three different economic downturns ( in 2001 , 2003 , and 2008 ) , and which produced the weakest eight - year span for the U.S. economy in decades . ”
It ’s not just Cantor , of course .
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has scheduled an “ economic roundtable ” today , to compete with the White House ’s job summit .
Roll Call reported , “ A spokesman for Boehner said the purpose of the meeting is to give a platform for economists who have a different perspective on how Obama ’s agenda has affected the economy . ”
And who are these experts ?
Apparently , House Republicans have turned to “ former Bush administration and McCain campaign staffers , who have advocated disastrous tax and budget policies . ”
So , to summarize , less than a year from the last administration , congressional Republicans believe it ’s time to re-embrace the Bush / Cheney agenda that did n’t work , and listen to the architects of the Bush / Cheney agenda that did n’t work .
Historically , after a major electoral defeat , the losing side adapts and shifts course .
Congressional Republicans , for reasons that defy comprehension , are doubling down on an agenda that ’s already failed .
Dust off your browncoats , a new collection of original Firefly stories is being put together by Titan Books .
Jane Espenson , the writer of Firefly episode " Shindig , " revealed an upcoming collection of new stories set in the Firefly universe while she was out promoting the Battlestar Galactica prequel series Caprica .
She told ScifiWire : " Titan Books is putting together a collection written by various of the Firefly writers . "
Firefly is a sci- fi television series that gained much of its popularity after a premature cancellation in 2002 .
A feature length movie called Serenity was released to give fans some closure , but not much else has been seen of Firefly other than two comic book mini-series ( and a bunch of eternally continuing fanboy love ) .
All we currently know is that Espenson is penning a very short story for the collection .
She says : " Oh , I just came up with a very clever little short story that involves Kaylee and Wash , two characters that we have n't seen together that much ...
But [ it 's a ] very short story , ... 2,000 words . "
No other writers have been specifically named , nor exactly what they will be putting forward .
The Firefly television show may still be dead for now , but this new anthology could breathe a little more life into the franchise .
I enjoyed the last comic book mini-series , a tale that took place before movie Serenity , which seems similar to what the collection of short stories will be .
If a story can possibly be told that takes place after the movie , I would n't mind seeing that either .
Maybe Joss Whedon can also get involved now that Dollhouse is done for ?

Last week we were reminded that ours is not the only country suffering from severe economic turmoil .
The Greek government is the latest to come close to default on their massive public debt .
Greece has insufficient funds in their treasury to make even the minimum payments that are now coming due .
Their debt level is about 120 percent of their gross domestic product and their public sector absorbs what amounts to 40 percent of GDP .
Any talk of cutting costs and spending is met with violent protests from the many Greeks heavily dependent on government payments .
Mounting fears of default have sent shockwaves through their creditors and all of the eurozone countries .
But there have been statements made by the European Central Bank to calm fears and give assurances that Greece will get the aid it needs .
Details of agreements are not forthcoming .
Is it possible that our Federal Reserve has had some hand in bailing out Greece ?
The fact is , we do n’t know , and current laws exempt agreements between the Fed and foreign central banks from disclosure or audit .
Greece is only the latest in a series of countries that have faced this type of crisis in recent memory .
Not too long ago the same types of fears were mounting about Dubai , and before that , Iceland .
Several other countries ( Spain , Portugal , Ireland , Latvia ) are approaching crisis levels with public debt as well .
Many have strong ties to Goldman Sachs and the case could easily be made that default could have serious implications for big US banking cartels .
Considering the ties between the Fed and these big banks , it is not outlandish to wonder if the US taxpayer is secretly bailing out the entire world , country by country , even as our real unemployment tops 20 percent .
Unless laws are changed to allow a complete and meaningful audit of the Federal Reserve , including its agreements with foreign central banks , we might never know if this is occurring or not .
This global financial crisis is a predictable result of secretive central banking and unsound fiat currency .
Governments are entirely committed to this system of fiat money and fractional reserve banking for obvious reasons : it enables them to do what they love most , namely , spend hoards of money with near impunity .
Without the limitations of sound money , governments will spend without limit .
They will spend money to hire their cronies , pay off special interests , give out favors , create dependence and generally distract from the terrible job they do at their chief mandate , which is to protect the liberties of the people .
Fiat money is a blank check to government , which is very dangerous , and we are witnessing the death throes of the system as the bills come due and the underlying capital is squandered away .
Because of our globe - straddling empire and lingering reserve currency status , perhaps no one has a more vested interest in keeping this system cobbled together than our own government and the Federal Reserve .
The agreements that Iceland and Dubai and Greece have negotiated can amount to little more than kicking the can down the road , as their overall spending habits remain largely intact , fiat currencies are still legal tender and more debt is issued on top of unsustainable debt .
The American people have the right to know if they are going to be the ones holding the bag in the end because the Federal Reserve secretly put them on the hook for it .
This knowledge would be a key factor in peacefully dismantling this immoral and unconstitutional system .
The former Alaskan governor is set to deliver the keynote speech at the National Tea Party convention tonight to a crowd of approximately 1,100 people , though many more will be watching at home — including us .
Here we go !

10:05 pm : So here 's the breakdown : Palin repeatedly noted that the Tea Party did n't need a leader , perhaps intending to sidestep the headlines that would have pegged her as one , though she also repeatedly pledged allegiance to the party and noted that she felt the party was the future of the United States .
The speech was filled with incendiary rhetoric , aimed mostly at President Obama , and though she spoke for 45 minutes , she really did n't say anything important or memorable : in the first 10 minutes , she hit at least 5 of our drinking game words , which is pretty bad news for someone attempting to perhaps position herself as a new type of candidate than the one that was on the Presidential ticket in 2008 .
The speech and Q +
A were filled with contradictions , as well : Palin praised the Constitution and those who adhere to it during her speech , then turned around during the Q+A and noted that we should all consider bringing " divine intervention " back into government , seemingly forgetting the separation of church and state .
She rambled , stumbled , and lost her place several times , seemed quite rusty , and attempted to paint the Tea Party as a source of goodness and kindness in a world controlled by an evil " Professor of Law . "
It was an expected speech , and a slightly terrifying speech , in that Palin said exactly what we expected her to say , which was basically nothing , but will get the headlines in major papers tomorrow , and perhaps begin her march toward the Presidency in 2012 .
( Yes , you can drink again . )
10:03 pm : Neal Boortz on MSNBC notes that Sarah Palin is " not going to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States , " and that if she is , it will mean " another four years of Barack Obama . "
Advertisement
10:00 pm : Palin says she 's " all for the bipartisan work effort that is needed in Washington , D.C. "
But that she wo n't make the promises if they can't be fulfilled .
MSNBC just cut out , C - SPAN is still running — the only thing you 've missed is a goodbye and a thank you from Palin .
" I have to apologize if I had anything to do with any of the controversy that any of the media spun up . "
She 's " happy , honored , proud " to speak to the Tea Partiers and says it 's not about a title or a leadership position , " I will live , I will die for the people of America to help . "
Once again , she notes that the Tea Party is " the future of politics in America . "
Oh , dear .
9:59 pm : " I can think of two words that scare liberals : ' President Palin . ' "
You got that right , dude .
The crowd is now yelling , " Run , Sarah , Run ! "
Feel free to drink .

9:58 pm : Palin says she 'll be endorsing candidates and attending events to support candidates during the primaries , to help " find a challenger for the general . "
9:55 pm : " What 's the Palin plan ? " A : " The Palin Plan ?
It 's quite simple . "
She " gets a kick out of it " when " the elitists " say that she 's simple minded .
She says her plan is to reward those who understand the principles of our country , which is hilarious , because she does n't seem to understand the principles of our country ( see : divine intervention , about 4 minutes ago . )
She is bullshitting .
She has no plan .
She just said " We win , they lose . "
Her plan is the equivalent of the plan of the Hawks coach from The Mighty Ducks , apparently .

9:53 pm : " It 's pretty cool to see some of the blue dog Democrats peeking under the tent . "
Todd Palin is n't a registered Republican , but he's the type of American , Palin says , who represents the voter who does n't want to get into the party system but are believers in the Tea Party movement .
9:53 pm : LOL @ the commenter who asked " Is that Superman 's house behind them ? "
The set is truly lacking .
Advertisement
9:52 pm : " It would be wise for us to be seeking divine intervention again . "
Is n't it hilarious how these people , who base their entire movement on the Constitution , seem to forget the ol ' separation of church and state thing ?
From Andrew Sullivan 's live blog : " There is no question in my mind that Palin is the leader of the opposition in this country .
And there is no question in my mind that she is the leader of the Tea Party movement .
Listening to her completely content - free rehash of every Fox News truism , underlined with the classic claim that Obama is on the side of the terrorists and is incapable of being commander - in - chief .
Cheneyism is behind her . "
Advertisement
9:49 pm : " I want the fresh folks to come out and run for office and start changing the world ! "
This is ... terrifying .
9:48 pm : " The Republican party would be really smart to absorb as much of the Tea Party as possible . "
Palin says the Tea Party is the future of the country .
God help us .
Advertisement
9:47 pm : And now it 's time for the Q & A session !
9:45 pm : " From the bottom of my heart I thank you for being part of the solution .
God bless you Tea Partiers , and God bless the U.S.A . "
Advertisement
9:45 pm : " This movement is about the people .

Sarah Palin Prepares To Address Tea Party Convention [ LATimes ]
Apple Inc. is in discussions with television networks to lower the price of downloaded TV shows when the company begins selling its new iPad tablet computer , people familiar with the talks said .
One of these people said Apple has already been testing a price of 99 cents — half the price of standard - definition TV episodes — for certain shows on its iTunes service and wants to finalize a deal to offer that price more broadly along with the iPad , which is expected to go on sale in ...
HERE is some food for thought from Tyler Cowen :
From the reports I have seen , my tentative conclusion is that the country as a whole is currently below the subsistence level and will remain so for the foreseeable future .
Hundreds of thousands of people have died , the U.N. Mission has collapsed , the government is not working ( was it ever ? ) , and hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of people are living in the streets without reliable food or water supplies .
The hospitals and schools have collapsed .
The airport is shut down .
The port is very badly damaged .
The Haitian Penitentiary has collapsed and the inmates -- tough guys most of them -- are running free for the foreseeable future .
There is no viable police force or army .
In other words , it 's not just a matter of offering extra food aid for two or three years .
Very rapidly , President Obama needs to come to terms with the idea that the country of Haiti , as we knew it , probably does not exist any more .
The earthquake has directly impacted about a third of the nation 's population of 9 million .
Perhaps 2 % of the population has been killed , and a much larger share has been injured .
Much , and maybe most , of the capital city has been destroyed .
Millions may be without homes .
Before the disaster , Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and among the poorest nations on earth .
Infrastructure was barely functional , and it was difficult for the government to govern in the best of circumstances .
Rebuilding will have to take place almost entirely under the direction of outsiders , with resources provided almost entirely by outsiders .
What exactly does that mean for a country ?
One has to suspect that many of the survivors will seek to emigrate , and given the circumstances , many countries may be willing to accept them .
This tragedy will present an interesting challenge to the global community .
Oddly enough , it may be one for which they 'll need the practice .
Within a few decades , there will be other island communities needing to relocate on a wholesale basis .
If there is any positive to be taken away from this disaster , it may be that the world has the opportunity to begin developing the institutions it will need to peacefully manage climate refugees .
Every year , the single largest gathering on the planet is the annual pilgrimage to Mecca : 2.5 million people from 160 countries packed into a small city in Saudi Arabia for five days .
This year , some will be bringing swine flu .
The Saudi authorities , fearing that the hajj could turn their holy city into a petri dish for viral mutations and a hub for spreading a new pandemic wave around the world , are working hard to head that off .
They have asked some worshipers , including pregnant women and the elderly , not to make the trip , which is scheduled for the last week of November .
“ The hajj is a central ritual of Islam , and our country tries to make it easy for everyone to come , ” said Dr. Ziad A. Memish , the country ’s assistant deputy minister for preventive medicine .
“ We ’ve said we wo n’t turn away anyone who arrives at our borders .
But we are recommending to other countries whom they should let come . ”
Although the Saudis have turned to the World Health Organization and other health agencies for help in previous public health threats to the hajj , this year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the American government ’s lead disease - fighting agency , is more deeply involved because it has so much experience with this new flu strain .
Consultants for the centers have gone back and forth to Riyadh , flu experts at American medical schools have been called in and the United States Navy ’s medical laboratory in Cairo is preparing to help with any complex flu testing that is beyond what Saudi laboratories can do .
A speedy NASA spacecraft is halfway to Pluto and on track for a 2015 rendezvous with the distant , icy world .
As of Tuesday , NASA ’s New Horizons spacecraft was currently about 1.527 billion miles ( 2.463 billion km ) from Earth and 1.526 billion miles ( 2.462 billion km ) from the Pluto system , making it closer to the edge of the solar system than to home .
The probe is due to fly by the dwarf planet and its moons on July 14 , 2015 before heading further out into the Kuiper Belt at the outskirts of the solar system .
“ This is the first of several milestones over the next 10 months that mark the halfway points in our journey to the solar system ’s frontier , where Pluto lies , ” said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado .
New Horizons launched toward Pluto in January 2006 on what NASA has touted as its fastest mission through the solar system .
The spacecraft is just a little past the midpoint between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus , and is speeding toward Pluto at a speed of about 750,000 miles ( 1.2 million km ) per day .
New Horizons is currently in hibernation mode , collecting interplanetary dust impact data as it flies .
Stern 's team plan to wake the craft briefly on Jan. 5 for 10 days of light maintenance and tracking activities .
Other milestones await New Horizons in 2010 .
On Feb. 25 , the probe will have covered half of the actual travel distance of its trip to Pluto .
On April 20 , it will be at the midpoint between the sun and its rendezvous point with Pluto .
And on Oct. 17 , the spacecraft will reach the midpoint of its flight time to Pluto , with five more years to go .

Green Dam faces $ 2.2 b lawsuit By Cui Jia and Wang Xing ( China Daily )
Updated : 2010-01-07 07:49
A US - based software producer yesterday filed a $ 2.2 billion lawsuit against the Chinese government , two Chinese software markers and seven major computer manufacturers for their distribution of the Internet filtering software " Green Dam Youth Escort " - which the company claims is pirated from a similar product it makes .
Cybersitter , a family - owned software firm based in Santa Barbara , filed the lawsuit in a Los Angeles federal court , alleging that the two software makers of Green Dam illegally copied over 3,000 lines of code from its award - winning Internet content filtering software .
Zhengzhou Jinhui Computer System Engineering and Beijing Dazheng Human Language Technology Academy co-developed Green Dam - an Internet filtering software designed to block violent and pornographic content on the Internet to protect minors - after winning a 417 - million - yuan ( $ 61 million ) bid from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ( MIIT ) .
But users had repeatedly raised concerns about the security loopholes of Green Dam , which could be exploited by hackers .
Additionally , the complaint alleges that the PC makers - Sony , Lenovo , Toshiba , Acer , ASUSTeK , BenQ and Haier - cooperated with the Chinese government and other software manufacturers to distribute 56 million copies of the software after they were aware that the program 's content filters were possibly stolen from Cybersitter .
The MIIT had required both domestic and overseas PC makers to include the software with their PC packages sold in China by July 1 last year , but the government decided to indefinitely delay the mandatory installation of the software the night before the directive went into force .
The delay came after some PC makers voiced concern about the short notice given to them for the software installation .
" This lawsuit aims to strike a blow against the all - too - common practices of foreign software manufacturers and distributors who believe that they can violate the intellectual property rights of small American companies with impunity without being brought to justice in US courts , " Cybersitter 's attorney Greg Fayer said in a statement sent to China Daily .
The MIIT could not be reached to comment .
A spokeswoman for Lenovo , China 's largest PC maker , told China Daily that the company has not shipped Green Dam with PCs for several months .
" We only include CD - ROMs containing Green Dam with our PCs or save the installation file of the software on the hard drive of the PCs ; it is up to the users whether to install the filter or not , " she added .
" We never pre-installed Green Dam on any computer . "
The other PC makers mentioned by Cybersitter 's attorney could not be reached for comment .
Zhang Chenmin , manager of Zhengzhou Jinhui Computer System Engineering , could also not be reached yesterday .

North Koreans are panicking as all shops were ordered closed during the currency reform period and they can no longer use any money they have saved up .
Foreign diplomats are meeting with North Korean authorities in efforts to persuade them to reverse the reform , the sources added .
The North last week revalued the won at a rate of 100:1 .
The North Korean Army is on standby and ready to quell any protests against last week 's drastic currency reform , Russian business daily Kommersant last Friday quoted diplomatic sources in North Korea as saying .
The sources said authorities had ordered the Army to stand by as outrage grew in cities across the North , with critics describing the reform as daylight robbery .
According to sources in the North , the National Defense Committee has ordered guards on the border with China to shoot at will at anyone who crosses without permission .
This is seen as an attempt to thwart defections by people disgruntled by the currency reform .
The sources said there could be a mass defection of middle - class North Koreans who have suddenly been deprived of their money .
One South Korean intelligence officer said , " We do n't have any information that there 'll be a riot or a mass defection , but since North Koreans have never so far taken collective action , they are more likely to choose defection if the situation gets worse . "
The Ministry of Public Security has been on emergency alert after old 5,000 - won bills carrying the image of Kim Il - sung were found torn or damaged on piles of garbage in Chongjin , North Hamgyong Province , Hamhung , South Hamgyong Province , and Pyongsong , South Pyongan Province .
Graffiti and leaflets criticizing North Korean leader Kim Jong - il have also started to appear , the sources added .
North Koreans are reportedly reluctant to replace old bills with new ones as a gesture of protest against the currency reform .
The authorities have apparently caved in to some extent by raising the maximum amount of old bills that can be exchanged from 100,000 won per household to 150,000 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. - trained Pakistani neuroscientist charged with shooting at her U.S. interrogators in Afghanistan yelled at jurors during the first day of her trial in New York on Tuesday , saying she had been held in a secret prison .
Aafia Siddiqui in a combination image .
REUTERS /FBI / Handout
Aafia Siddiqui , 37 , had to be led out of the courtroom after disrupting the testimony of one of the witnesses .
She is charged with grabbing a U.S. warrant officer ’s rifle while she was detained for questioning in July in Afghanistan ’s Ghazni province and firing it at FBI agents and military personnel .
None of them were injured but Siddiqui , who the U.S. government has accused of links with al Qaeda , was shot .
She is charged with attempted murder , assault and other crimes and faces life in prison if convicted .
The U.S. government has previously linked Siddiqui to al Qaeda but the charges against her do not mention the group and prosecutors did not mention terrorism or al Qaeda during opening statements .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jenna Dabbs told jurors Siddiqui was taken into custody by Afghan police in July because she was carrying containers of unidentified chemicals and notes referring to mass - casualty attacks and New York landmarks such as the Empire State Building , the Statue of Liberty , Wall Street and the Brooklyn Bridge .
Siddiqui , who is charged only with the shooting incident , wore a white veil and sat slumped with her head in her arms throughout most of the proceeding in federal court .
She interrupted and suggested that she had been “ given magazines to copy ” to write the notes .
“ Since I ’ll never get a chance to speak , if you were in a secret prison ... where children were tortured , ” Siddiqui yelled before being led from the courtroom .
“ This is no list of targets against New York .
I was never planning to bomb it . ”
Human rights groups and previous lawyers for Siddiqui have said she may have been secretly held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan during the time leading up to the shooting incident , when her whereabouts were unknown .
Family members in Pakistan have said they believe Siddiqui , who lived in the United States between 1991 and 2002 , was raped and tortured at Bagram .
But there was no mention of secret prisons by Siddiqui ’s defense lawyers on Tuesday .
After Siddiqui ’s arrest by Afghan police , U.S. soldiers were called in to question her .
They were taken into a room that was partitioned by a heavy curtain and were unaware she also was in the room , Dabbs said .
Dabbs said Siddiqui grabbed a rifle when it was put down on the floor by a U.S. warrant officer .
As an interpreter for the U.S. military tackled Siddiqui and sought to restrain her , she called out , “ You will die by my blood ” and “ death to America , ” Dabbs told the court .
In the defense ’s opening statement , attorney Charles Swift offered a different version of events , saying the only bullets and gun residue found on the scene came from the shots fired at Siddiqui and that she had never open fire .
The trial is expected to last several weeks .

Judge Refuses Order of Protection Request , Newlywed Woman Is Murdered by Stalker A judge refused Alissa Blanton 's request for an emergency order of protection .
Feb. 11 , 2010  --
The Florida woman killed by a man who had allegedly stalked her since her Hooters waitressing days had tried to get an order of protection against him , but a judge refused the request .
Alissa Blanton , 23 , of Cocoa , Fla. , was shot and killed Monday in the parking lot near her new job at an AT&T call center in Orange County , Fla .
Police said her killer , 61 - year - old Roger Troy , fatally shot himself immediately afterward .
About a week before she died , Blanton asked a judge for an order of protection against Troy , whom she said had been stalking her for two years .
Despite the evidence she presented -- her petition contained more than 70 pages of harassing e-mails Troy sent to her -- Brevard County Circuit Court Judge Dean Moxley said he did n't have enough information to rule on the petition .
According to ABC News ' Orlando affiliate WFTV , Moxley ordered a hearing for Feb. 16 to gather more information on the request .
Click HERE to learn how to protect yourself from being harassed or stalked .
In an interview with the Orlando Sentinel newspaper , Moxley said he could n't determine if Troy 's actions met the legal definition of stalking based on the information presented by Blanton .
" As a judge you have to follow the law .
You 're not omniscient .
God bless her soul , " he told the newspaper .
A top forensic psychiatrist , Michael Welner , said that while we rely on the court system to protect victims , it is also important to remember that the stalker is fixated on someone else .
" So what is going to happen after a court hearing ?
If he is a predator he is still going to prey .
If he is locked up for a few months , he is still going to target her .
In my professional experience , separation is the best solution , " Welner said on " Good Morning America " this morning .
Welner suggested that if you cannot immediately escape to a location where the stalker can't find you , ask your neighbors and your workplace security to be your eyes and ears .
" Get yourself escorted to the parking lot , or escorted [ into work ] until the courts can make a difference or until laws change to allow civil commitment of people who are a danger to someone in the community .
But the key thing is [ to ] limit your communication .
Be very specific .
Get separation , and until you can get separation , do n't allow yourself to be alone , " Welner said .
Stalker Harassed Woman , Sent Disparaging E-mails
In the court papers she filed , Blanton said she met Troy when she was working at Hooters in Brevard County and he was a customer .
Blanton said she quit the job because Troy began to stalk her , but the harassment continued .
He would drive past her house , visit her at her new job and call her , Blanton said in her court filing .
She reported him to the police in an effort to get him to stop contacting her , she said .
In e-mails Troy sent Blanton , he repeatedly calls her a " tramp " and a " whore " and disparages her apparent weight gain .
He also makes demeaning comment about her marriage in August .
" You are the poster girl for ' beauty is only skin deep , ' " Troy , a Cocoa Beach , Fla. , businessman , wrote in one of the emails that were part of Blanton 's request for an order of protection .
Blanton and her husband , Brent , were co-workers , the Sentinel said .
On Monday they had lunch , returned to work , then headed in separate directions , Alissa Blanton 's mother , Connie Hassell of Festus , Mo. , told the Sentinel .
Moments later , Hassell said , Brent Blanton received a phone call from his wife and she told him Troy was there .
A witness told police that Troy shot Blanton multiple times .
Stalkers Neighbor 's Say He Was a ' Good Friend '
Her husband 's 911 call to authorities reveals his anguish .
" Baby I love you , " Brent Blanton could be heard saying to his bleeding wife .
" Keep breathing .
Oh my God , come on , baby . "
He also told 911 operators , " This guy 's been stalking my wife . "
Blanton 's death has domestic violence advocates questioning the legal system , saying it failed to protect her .
Troy 's friends say they never suspected he was less than the person he appeared to be .
" We had no reason to think there was anything duplicitous about Roger , great sense of humor , " Margo Gould , Troy 's neighbor , told WFTV .
" Sometimes the people that have these problems hide them the best , because he was just a good friend and neighbor to me and my husband . "

trying to board the plane in Amsterdam without a passport .
of Newport , Mich . ,
, talked exclusively with MLive.com and confirmed he was on the flight by sending a picture of his boarding pass .
He and his wife , Lori , were returning from a safari in Uganda when they boarded the NWA flight on Friday .
Update : Dutch counter - terrorism agency : Flight 253 suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had valid Nigerian passport , U.S. visa

Haskell said he and his wife were sitting on the ground near their boarding gate in Amsterdam , which is when they saw
approach the gate with an unidentified man .
Kurt and Lori Haskell are attorneys with
in Taylor .
Their expertise includes bankruptcy , family law and estate planning .
While Mutallab was poorly dressed , his friend was dressed in an expensive suit , Haskell said .
He says the suited man asked ticket agents whether Mutallab could board without a passport .
“ The guy said , ' He 's from Sudan and we do this all the time . ' ”
Mutallab is Nigerian .
Haskell believes the man may have been trying to garner sympathy for Mutallab 's lack of documents by portraying him as a Sudanese refugee .
The ticket agent referred Mutallab and his companion to her manager down the hall , and Haskell did n't see Mutallab again until after he allegedly tried to detonate an explosive on the plane .
Haskell said the flight was mostly unremarkable .
That was until he heard a flight attendant say she smelled smoke , just after the pilot announced the plane would land in Detroit in 10 minutes .
Haskell got out of his seat to view the brewing commotion .
“ I stood up and walked a couple feet ahead to get a closer look , and that 's when I
” said Haskell , who sat about seven rows behind Mutallab .
“ It started to spread pretty quickly .
It went up the wall , all the way to ceiling . ”
Haskell , who described Mutallab as a diminutive man who looks like a teenager , said about 30 seconds passed between the first mention of smoke and when Mutallab was subdued by fellow passengers .
“ He did n't fight back at all .
This was n't a big skirmish , ” Haskell said . “
and hauled him away . ”
The ordeal has Haskell and his wife a little shaken .
Flight attendants were screaming during the fire and the pilot sounded notably nervous when bringing the plane in for a landing , he said .
“ Immediately , the pilot came on and said two words : emergency landing , ” Haskell said .
“ And that was it .
The plane sped up instead of slowing down .
You could tell he floored it . ”
As Mutallab was being led out of the plane in handcuffs , Haskell said he realized that was the same man he saw trying to board the plane in Amsterdam .
Passengers had to wait about 20 minutes before they were allowed to exit the plane .
Haskell said he and other passengers waited about six hours to be interviewed by the FBI .
About an hour after landing , Haskell said he saw another man being taken into custody .
But a spokeswoman from the FBI in Detroit said Mutallab was the only person taken into custody .

Advertisement Veteran British actor Ian Carmichael , seen in films including I'm All Right Jack , has died at the age of 89 .
Carmichael , who also starred on TV as Bertie Wooster in the BBC's World of Wooster , had fallen ill over Christmas .
He died peacefully on Friday at his home in the Esk Valley on the North York Moors .
He made his name in films for the Boulting Brothers including Private 's Progress ( 1956 ) and I'm All Right Jack ( 1959 ) alongside Peter Sellers .
During the 1960s and 1970s , he was successful in parts where he was cast as a loveable buffoon .
On television , his role as Bertie Wooster was particularly popular with audiences .
This was followed by another well - watched role as Lord Peter Wimsey in several of the BBC drama series based on the mystery novels by Dorothy L Sayers .
He had great zest for life , and a lot of style - he belonged to an age of elegance
Actress Anne Reid
In pictures : Ian Carmichael 's career
In more recent times the actor had parts in the BBC serial Wives and Daughters in 1999 and was in The Royal on ITV as recently as last year .
Former sports commentator Neil Durden - Smith , who knew Carmichael well through their work for the Lord 's Taverners cricket - based charity , paid tribute to the actor .
" When I became a trustee in 1976 he had been chairman for two years .
He was a marvellous chairman , very caring , hard working , very responsible .
" It 's quite unusual for a full - time working actor to be chairman of a pretty big charity . "
Asked what made Carmichael popular on screen , Mr Durden - Smith , 76 , said : " He had a twinkle in his eye , a wonderful sense of humour , he was marvellously foppish in a theatrical way .
You used to wonder what he would say next .
" He had that love of life and love of people ; he gathered people around him like other people gather butterflies or postage stamps . "
' Absolute joy ' Actress Anne Reid , a star of TV programmes Dinnerladies and Ladies of Letters , said : " He was a delightful man , I was a huge fan when I was young and he was in the Boulting Brothers films .
Ian Carmichael was awarded an OBE in 2003 " He was the most wonderful comedy actor , things like I'm All Right Jack would make you weep with laughter .
" He had great zest for life , and a lot of style .
He belonged to an age of elegance . "
Carmichael was appointed an OBE in the Queen 's Birthday Honours List in 2003 .
In 1979 , he wrote an autobiography , Will The Real Ian Carmichael .... Novelist Kate Fenton , 55 , is his second wife .
His first wife Pym died in 1983 .
He also leaves two daughters , five grandchildren and four great - grandchildren .
Keith Richardson , executive producer of The Royal , said Carmichael had filmed a couple of episodes last year which would be seen when the programme returned to the screen .
" He was an absolute joy , terrific and full of life , " Mr Richardson added .

A record number of young Americans are now unemployed .
According to a new report based on U.S. Census Bureau data , only 26 percent of American teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 had jobs in late 2009 which represents a record low since statistics began to be kept in 1948 .
So why is this happening ?
Certainly it is much harder to find a job today than it was just 3 or 4 years ago .
But are there other factors involved ?
Even when the economy was still flying high back in the middle of the decade , an increasing number of young people were moving back in with Mom and Dad after they graduated from college .
Is it our fault for raising kids who simply cannot adjust to the real world ?
Is society to blame for all of the young Americans who believe that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter without them having to work for it ?
Or would young Americans be more than willing to step up if there were good opportunities available to them ?
The quality of young adults in America today is a theme that a number of our readers have commented on recently .
In particular , there were four comments that were so exceptional that we thought they deserved special attention and we have reproduced them below .
If there is any hope for the future of America , it will be crucial for the next generation to step up to the plate .
But are they capable of it ?
Please read the following comments left by our readers and then post your own comment and let us know what you think … .

Joyce :
I keep hearing conservatives say we need to get rid of “ Social Security ” and go back to when families took care of family members .
These people have to be “ out of touch with reality ” because the family unit has been broken for years in this country and continues to break down .
Disabled , elderly people , in general , have no family members willing to help them .
Children and grandchildren often have no time for their older parents and grandparents and often feel that older and disabled folk are in the way and only contact them when they themselves need money or wish to check on their possible inheritance from older members of their family .
Many young people think nothing of “ stealing ” from thier parents and elderly grandparents if they think they can get away with it .
Many families with children have only one adult or parent to support and nurture the children and many women , right here in Missoula , Montana , are supporting thier “ boy friends ” and fewer and fewer “ couples ” are getting “ married ” .
A large number of family units are in deep financial trouble as the good paying jobs keep disappearing and the materialistic young people feel they must buy the latest new toy or electronic gadget on the market .
Even these college graduates often leave college with huge debts they incurred in the form of student loans and are often in serious financial trouble .
Where is the “ family ” support and help for the elderly and disabled coming from ???
Many young adults often try to make older folks feel they have outlived thier welcome no matter how hard they worked when they were young to help build the nation these young people feel belongs only to them .

Elldee :
I do know a few individuals in their 20s who are hard workers .
One is my son .
He was going to college full - time , employed part - time , participates in auto racing , and served in the Army Reserves as a staff sergeant .
He was recruited by the race car owner because of his work ethic .
He just graduated from college in December with a degree in mechanical engineering technology , has his resume out there and is waiting to hear back .
In the meantime , he is working full - time in construction and part - time for a company that builds race car engines .
I know I may be accused of being partial because he ’s my son , but he is a good worker , loyal , dedicated , motivated , and engaged in whatever he is doing .

Penny :
I ’m 65 , and came from very creative , old style common sense family .
I know how to do so many things from scratch it would blow your mind .
THAT is what gives me confidence .
SKILLS for life , on all levels .
I can grow , cook , & preserve food .
I can throw together a meal for 6 or more in a hurry out of almost anything .
How many of you can make a noodle , a mainstay of hard times ?
Can you grow a patch of potatoes ?
Repair shoes , make shoes for a small child .
Hand sew ?
Mend or iron .
Hand wash clothes .
Do you know what basic tools are for .
What if the web goes ?
Do you know how to use a library ?
More to the point , can you tell when you ca n’t afford something ?
Can you tell when you need to go back down the technology scale to provide your needs , because that ’s where it ’s cheaper ?
Can you steam rice , mash potatoes ?
Stop a leak ?
Can you figure out the cost of your appliances so you know what to turn off and leave off ?
Can you tell you ca n’t afford to use the dryer ?
Do you know enough about nutrition to know you need to plant a garden ?
Do you know how much effort is needed for basic jobs , or how long it takes ?
Can you make yourself get up and walk to get what you need when you have enough for food and gas , but not both ?
Skills are also nice for barter .
I saw a show on Western kids working in rice fields in Thailand .
What BS .
Supposedly they ’d been there working for 6 weeks .
They still had body fat and a double chin .
Anybody doing day long hard agri work for 6 weeks would be getting lean and mean .
Character is built as you learn skills and come to respect your own efforts ; then you understand the efforts of all .
Morality is n’t a stamp you stick on someone , it ’s innate unless it ’s corrupted .
I do n’t know what ’s happened to our lazy behinds , but it does n’t seem to me we ’ve had enough physical work required of us , so we do n’t have a clue how much we ’ll need to do .. the whines will be heard to the skies , then weeping .. we should start a skill bulletin board and tell each other what we know while we have time .

I work in an ER … .
When the s–t really hits the fan , most Americans ( 90 % ) will totally fall apart …
If they ca n’t handle a paper cut now ( I kid you not ! ) , can you imagine the chaos when things really get rough ?
When the vicodin runs out ?
Some parasites make 2 - 3 visits or more a week to the ER for BS ….. the human devolution is truly mind - boggling …
90 % of americans are totally worthless parasites …
I hired an american to mow my lawn … he got a cell phone call in the middle of it , said he would come back , never did !
I had to finish the half - mowed lawn myself …..
I went thru 8 people mowing my lawn , till I finally found someone reliable , on time , gentle w the equipment , willing to work hard …… me !
Yep , it is that bad …
I hired myself to mow my lawn …
Now I am hiring myself to plant it in wildflowers for the coming days when lawnmowing will become impossible …
One of the 8 failures was a 16 year old native born American kid doing some landscaping for me …
I had to show him how to use a shovel .
He had never picked one up before …
Unbelievable ! …
I told him to slope the dirt away from the house so the water would run down and away from the foundation .
He asked me , “ What is slope ? ” I had to draw him a picture !!
Pitiful …
Down the toilet the american empire falls ….

Symphony vs. Philharmonic
Definition / History
A symphony orchestra is a group of musicians ( orchestra ) that play symphonies .
Would n't a philharmonic orchestra be an orchestra that plays philharmonics ?
Sounds reasonable to me ... except for the small problem that there is no such thing as a philharmonic .
The first use of ' philharmonic ' was in London in 1813 .
An organisation was founded called the Philharmonic Society .
The word ' philharmonic ' translates to ' music lover ' .
The sources I 've found say this was taken from the French ' philharmonoque ' , but I think it is more likely that the word was taken right from the Greek .
Greek is much more fashionable than French - especially if you 're living in London in 1813 * .
Anyway , the first Philharmonic Orchestra was established in London in 1895 .
The current London Philharmonic was established in 1932 , the London Symphony was established in 1940 .
My guess is , whoever got to the name they wanted first - won .
( This avoids having names like " The Other London Symphony Orchestra " . )
I 'm sure if you asked a member of the LSO or the LPO , they could tell you all sorts of jokes on how to distinguish a philharmonic from a symphony orchestra .
But in practical application , there really is no difference .
They both love music , and they both play symphonies .
Remember A symphonic orchestra and a philharmonic orchestra are really the same thing .
Contribute !
Do you know a philharmonic / symphonic joke ?
Please send it to me !
Wendy Noblett writes ...
" Obviously , if you wanted to tell the difference between a philharmonic orchestra and a symphonic orchestra , you would look at their organs . "
* There was a big ancient civilization revival right about then .
People were digging up bits of antiquity from Greek and Roman sites and hauling them home .
France was fashionable then as well , but in a tarnished , scandalous sort of way .
It was not as popular in the sort of upper crusty circles likely to establish an arts society .
England fought with France a bunch ... I do n't recall any English / Ancient Greek battles ...
Post Script !
Your statement that " The first use of ' philharmonic ' was in London in 1813 " is , um , somewhat less than correct .
That might have been the first use in an English context , but in Ljubljana , Slovenia ( which was then known as Laibach and was in the Austrian Empire ) the Academia Philharmonicorum was founded in 1701 .
That translates easily as " academy of music - lovers " ( or at any rate " harmony - lovers " ) , but the original members were all professional musicians , though their by - laws were amended to admit amateurs who were capable of making a contribution , and they gave regular performances .
According to the history on the website of the Slovenian Philharmonic ( http://www.filharmonija.si/), the organization was based on the example of similar societies in Italy , so it would probably make sense to look there for the introduction of the term ( probably filarmonico or something similar ) , into modern usage , whether it was invented or borrowed at that time .
The Academia Philharmonicorum itself petered out during the 18th century , although the active musical life of Ljubljana certainly did n't .
A new Slovenian Philharmonic Society was founded in 1795 , and the orchestra called the Slovenian Philharmonic ( ' filharmonija ' in Slovene , which might come over into English as " Philharmony " ) has existed officially since 1908 .
I think most modern " Philharmonics " are abbreviated forms of longer names ( Philharmonic Orchestra , Philharmonic Society , etc. ) in which ' philharmonic ' still is really an adjective .

Nothing raises our hackles quite like hearing someone say Wonder Woman is lame .
( Hello , Megan Fox . )
For example , one of V ’s friends ( we ’ll call him The Antagonist ) takes great joy in claiming , among other things , that Bobby Drake could kick her ass , and that the princess would “ look real pretty in a pink tutu , carrying a little purse with a little dog . ”
We did not handle that well .
Words were exchanged via Facebook .
It was even worse once we figured out the context .
The Antagonist had already read Blackest Night # 6 , in which Wonder Woman was transformed into a member of the Star Sapphire Corps .
OK , technically the Star Sapphires wield violet light , but the costume ’s color was close enough to pink for it to sting .
Say what you want about Wonder Woman ’s usual getup , but there is a certain dignity ( depending on who is drawing her ) to her red , white and blue uniform and golden breastplate .
The Star Sapphire look is equal parts Dollar Tree and Strip Club .
No offense to Carol Ferris , but only Starfire has a trashier costume — and she ’s an alien , so she gets a pass .
Wonder Woman as a love - powered being ?
That ’s awesome .
But somewhere , The Antagonist is having a good laugh .

Europa ( from Windows on the Universe )
Derek Walcott
The full moon is so fierce that I can count the
coconuts ’ cross -hatched shade on bungalows ,
their white walls raging with insomnia .
The stars leak drop by drop on the tin plates
of the sea almonds , and the jeering clouds
are luminously rumpled as the sheets .
The surf , insatiably promiscuous ,
groans through the walls ; I feel my mind
whiten to moonlight , altering that form
which daylight unambiguously designed ,
from a tree to a girl ’s body bent in foam ;
then , treading close , the black hump of a hill ,
its nostrils softly snorting , nearing the
naked girl splashing her naked breasts with silver .
Both would have kept their proper distance still ,
if the chaste moon had n’t swiftly drawn the drapes
of a dark cloud , coupling their shapes .
She teases with those flashes , yes , but once
you yield to human horniness , you see
through all that moonshine what they really were ,
those gods as seed - bulls , gods as rutting swans
an overheated farmhand ’s literature .
Who ever saw her pale arms hook his horns ,
her thighs clamped tight in their deep - plunging ride ,
watched , in the hiss of the exhausted foam ,
her white flesh constellate to phosphorous
as in salt darkness beast and woman come ?
Nothing is there , just as it always was ,
but the foam ’s wedge to the horizon - light ,
then , wire - thin , the studded armature ,
like drops still quivering on his matted hide ,
the hooves and horn - points anagrammed in stars .
Comment :
In the second stanza , the narrator confesses that after intense sexual experience , he – and by extension , his audience – can understand how myths truly came about .
People ( “ overheated farmhand [s ] ” ) had to watch nature and they let their imaginations get carried away .
The intensity of sexuality reveals itself to be Nothing , and “ constellate , ” “ wire - thin… armature , ” “ drops ” and “ horn - points ” situate us in emptiness .
What has happened is that the second stanza , in emphasizing rationality ( logos ) , has destroyed the myth ( mythos , duh ) , and Nothing is the result .
You ca n’t understand human desire by dismissing it as imaginary , for that is what it literally is ; one has to engage the images .
The poem ends with “ anagrammed in stars , ” using “ anagram ” as if it were a verb meaning “ carved out ” or “ sketched . ” “ Anagram ” means no such thing , of course .
It is a transposition of letters .
What it probably means is that we have to read the letters , the clues , another way , and prepare for the fact that there has been another meaning we have missed entirely the whole time .
Our new beginning : moon , stars , clouds , surf imply a rough descent of light upon the earth .
The distance of the light does not matter , but the intensity does .
Hence , the moon is first in this ordering .
The ferocity of the moon ’s light makes bungalow walls seem like a prison ; cross -hatching is like looking through a thicket of lines .
It is a prison in a way , as our narrator cannot sleep , trapped in a world forming around him .
The light of the stars upon the “ sea almonds ” makes thin branches look like they ’re tin plates , I ’m guessing almost roof - like .
The light is blearing , smearing , almost becoming dew droplets or an ocean .
But there is more than light becoming corporeal .
It is also becoming human as it is covered / covers itself .
The clouds “ jeer , ” the surf is “ promiscuous ” and “ groans . ”
Perhaps this is an illustration of the notion , from Benardete ’s interpretation of the Phaedo , that any account of body is mythological .
We note that not just the bodily , natural phenomena described sensually , but the human mind itself ( light ) is generative in the poem .
The copulation is here :
I feel my mind
whiten to moonlight , altering that form
which daylight unambiguously designed ,
The narrator ’s mind whitens – he uses that light to see – and what does he see ?
For a second , before a change , what daylight “ unambiguously designed . ”
In another light , perhaps , these objects look normal , can be studied .
There is no studying in this moment , though .
Europa gave birth to three who rule in the Underworld .
This is her domain , the darkness .
Logic and form are being incorporated and given preeminence in the mythological understanding , and this is what the second stanza is missing .
What the second stanza gets correct is that the human mind is integral to this process .
But that fact alone tells us nothing – again , why was he imagining this in the first place ?
Because he ’s horny and moonlight does n’t help ?
The vision is right in front of us :
from a tree to a girl ’s body bent in foam ;
then , treading close , the black hump of a hill ,
its nostrils softly snorting , nearing the
naked girl splashing her naked breasts with silver .
Both would have kept their proper distance still ,
if the chaste moon had n’t swiftly drawn the drapes
of a dark cloud , coupling their shapes .
I ’ll be the first to say I do n’t get exactly why “ from a tree ” is there .
I think the point might be that the tree has been darkened out of his field of vision now , that it is impossible to analyze as he would in daylight .
All eyes are on the copulation taking place in the surf , the copulation that is the speaker ’s mind meeting the light .
The outlines of the water splashing create the girl , the bull .
Water against itself , foam , light against itself creates the girl .
Light against itself is implied by the moonlight turning into objects : “ the stars leak drop by drop , ” “ silver ” are key , but the fundamental ideas are the ferocity of the moon and the mind itself whitening .
Water against the backdrop of a landmass far greater than a tree , one that will be there in daylight , creates the bull .
Now it is critical to note is that the vision is n’t done yet .
The speaker interrupts it to emphasize that he has passed a test : he has been horny , and seen farther .
It is not clear he understands the significance of what has actually happened .
He thinks he is getting more distant from the vision , even as he says :
Who ever saw her pale arms hook his horns ,
her thighs clamped tight in their deep - plunging ride ,
watched , in the hiss of the exhausted foam ,
her white flesh constellate to phosphorous
as in salt darkness beast and woman come ?
Our speaker more than likely means this as a rhetorical question , even as he is actually seeing this play out before him .
The culmination of the vision : the naked girl and the bull look most real as they ’re dissolving into each other and into the “ salt darkness ” from which they emerged .
We have our sights set on the interesting question : not that myth is Nothing , or that sexuality reduces to Nothingness , but why is it the moment we are most alive , most ourselves , also the moment we might as well be dead ?
We can say this is just a fleeting mythical vision , but that does n’t do justice to the real logic of the poem .
The speaker saw this , it arose from his feelings about the world around him , and he reported it .
The speaker , in being too reductive ( logical ? ) , is missing the narrative of which he is actually a part .
The speaker ’s regretful tone about eros , his own desire , should make us look at “ seed - bulls ” and “ rutting swans ” a bit closer .
“ Rutting ” only refers to sexuality when we ’re talking about mammals .
In terms of swans , it would probably refer to the monotonous lines they form ( cf. Yeats , “ The Wild Swans at Coole ” ) .
“ Seed - bulls ” are similarly less sexual ; bulls are on a farm for a reason .
Our speaker is aware that he has been aroused , but I think he ’s confused about the real source of eros .
He ’s thinking it ’s him alone , to a degree .
But eros always takes two .
One to desire , one to fulfill .
And once the desire is fulfilled , both vanish .
The myth , then , is at a distance from the ordinary precisely because it is ordinary .
This is the real criss - crossing that ’s occurring : if what constitutes the erotic is everyday , existing and not dissolving in phosphorous , how do we describe that ?
Do we say all of life is longing ?
Maybe , but that ’s a weak answer , since we get what we want on some scale every day .
Our logical accounting of things – that we can do science , that we can categorize our memories and experiences – stands apart from myth , but does n’t stand apart from the eros central to myth .
In other words , this was a revelation every reasonable person will have .
Our speaker ends ambiguously :
Nothing is there , just as it always was ,
but the foam ’s wedge to the horizon - light ,
then , wire - thin , the studded armature ,
like drops still quivering on his matted hide ,
the hooves and horn - points anagrammed in stars .
The problem I ’m citing with our speaker is the “ Nothing is there , just as it always was ” – given that the character of his experiences are about the limits of human reason , this is nihilism .
He ’s asserting there is no eternal ground even worth asking about , to a degree ; I suspect he ’s making the lazy assertion that we are sexual because of death ’s finality , which this pervades everything .
Literally , that ’s true .
But his final image leads us to the critical tension .
The light has receded in a sense , it is n’t illuminating so as to create a girl and the beast .
What are left are points , frameworks , that create a picture of Zeus as the bull , a picture composed of elements of earth and heaven .
We logically wonder about the girl , whether she has been destroyed , and the answer is probably not : Zeus is only revealed in this fuller form because of the consummation .
The problem with logic alone is that the light we see with is not always our possession .
Connected : The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives , by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler ( Little , Brown , 352 pp. , $ 25.99 )
Before Facebook , few of us asked others , explicitly , to be our friends .
We did n’t monitor how many friends we had as an indication of our status or scroll through listings of friends of friends to pad our own list .
Yet the history of humanity is a history of social networking all the same , according to Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler , authors of Connected : The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives .
“ Our connections affect every aspect of our daily lives , ” they write .
“ How we feel , what we know , whom we marry , whether we fall ill , how much money we make , and whether we vote all depend on the ties that bind us . ”
And the burgeoning field of network research is revealing that “ our connections do not end with the people we know . ”
Social networks take on lives of their own , transmitting information , germs , and habits between people who are nearly as tangentially linked as actors in the old parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon .
“ Friends of friends of friends can start chain reactions that eventually reach us , ” the authors argue , “ like waves from distant lands that wash up on our shores . ”
Christakis , a professor at Harvard Medical School , and Fowler , a professor of political science at the University of California , San Diego , gained fame a few years ago for some important research into this new field .
For years , the Framingham Heart Study has tracked the vital stats and psychological states of residents of Framingham , Massachusetts ; researchers have studied this data set for what it says about health habits .
But Christakis and Fowler went further .
In order to follow up with the Framingham subjects over a period of years , it turned out , the original researchers had asked for the names of family and friends and kept detailed notes of these connections .
Christakis and Fowler pieced together these notes to reconstruct the social networks of thousands of connected friends , spouses , neighbors , and siblings .
Crunching the numbers from the Framingham health data and using computer graphics , they observed how traits spread through the social network over time : the modern epidemic of obesity advanced , smoking receded to the peripheries , and both happiness and misery appeared to be contagious .
Controlling for environmental factors and the tendency of birds of a feather to flock together — happy people prefer hanging out with other happy people — Christakis and Fowler found that we really do emulate those we care about , whether we mean to or not .
Being connected to a happy person , for instance , makes you 15 percent more likely to be happy yourself .
“ And the spread of happiness does n’t stop there , ” they note .
It radiates out for three degrees of separation , so that , say , your sister ’s best friend ’s husband ’s mood exerts a greater influence on your personal happiness than an extra $ 10,000 in income would .
If he gains 50 pounds , it will be that much harder for you to stay slim , as the frame of reference for what ’s “ normal ” changes through your network .
Or , on the positive side , if he quits smoking , your chances of kicking the habit improve , too , even if you ’ve never met him .
The authors spend much of the book discussing how social networks might have arisen through evolution , what the rise of the Internet means for social connections , and the implications for both our personal lives and public policy .
For instance , public health workers can more effectively stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases if they know what kind of network they ’re dealing with : a hub and spoke ( e.g. , a prostitute with many clients ) or a more transitive “ ring ” network where people have few partners , but many of these partners overlap ( which could happen at a small high school ) .
On another front , they point out that voting makes little sense for an individual — one vote never decides an election — but is far more rational in a network context .
As with happiness and obesity , the decision to vote has repercussions through three degrees of connections .
When you vote , your spouse , colleagues , and friends , and their spouses , colleagues , and friends and so forth , are more likely to vote as well , and vice versa .
Since liberals and conservatives tend to form their own social networks , this means that your decision to vote can increase the likelihood of hundreds of other people voting for the same candidate .
This explains — at least on an unconscious level — why people stand in line in the rain in November .
The authors view just about everything through a network lens , including religion .
“ God can actually be seen as a part of the social network , ” they write .
Since
God is presumably connected with everyone , believing in him would literally allow you to feel connected to the rest of humankind with just one degree of separation : “ through God everyone is a ‘ friend of a friend ’ ” ( even if he does n’t yet appear to be on Facebook ) .
Connected is a fascinating and , for two academics , surprisingly well - written book .
Christakis and Fowler keep tongues firmly planted in cheek as they describe other studies ; for instance , researchers studying grooming patterns across networks in different species learned that “ the model that best predicted the network structure of U.S. senators was that of social licking among cows . ”
Their book suffers from two main drawbacks , however .
First , though the cover blurb from Stumbling on Happiness author Daniel Gilbert announces that “ Connected could change your life forever , ” the book never explains how .
The authors scrupulously avoid straying into self - help territory that would describe how to become better connected or how to strengthen the ties you already have .
Possibly this is because they view the worth of one ’s network position as dependent on circumstances .
Being on the inside ( that is , well - connected ) is better if you want to find a job , but being on the outside is more advantageous in the midst of a swine flu epidemic .
But I did find myself wondering exactly how I would use this knowledge about “ the surprising power of our social networks and how they shape our lives ” to improve my own life .
Second , the authors raise , but then mostly avoid answering , some profound questions .
“ Embedded in social networks and influenced by others to whom we are tied , we necessarily lose some of our individuality , ” they write .
“ If we unconsciously copy the good deeds of others to whom we are connected , do we deserve credit for those deeds ?
And if we adopt the bad habits or evil thoughts of others to whom we are closely or even loosely tied , do we deserve blame ?
Do they ? ”
This idea that individual actions , from stealing cars to donating organs , may not really be a function of personal choice is disconcerting , to say the least , and deserves more space than a casual discussion on page 305 .
Still , Connected is an important book , a scientific look at the ties that bind us together .
“ The great project of the twenty - first century — understanding how the whole of humanity comes to be greater than the sum of its parts — is just beginning , ” they write .
As a first step in that project , Connected is well worth reading .
American researchers may have revolutionised the field of artificial limbs by adopting a new power source formerly used mainly in torpedoes and rockets .
Prosthetic robot arms have been on something of a technological plateau for a while .
Myo -electrics - in which functions can be controlled by muscle movement in the remaining limb - came in decades ago , but other than that the limbs have stayed relatively primitive .
Now , however , due in part to the substantial numbers of Western troops severely injured in Southwest Asian fighting , fresh ideas are circulating .
New methods of control , perhaps better or more flexible than ordinary myo-electrics , are under consideration , and rather than essentially being a powered claw , much better - articulated limbs are being developed .
Some of these initiatives have been funded by DARPA ( Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ) , the occasionally somewhat foam - lipped US death - boffin outfit .
Only one thing has been lacking - new power sources to drive the more sophisticated limbs under development .
Fit young men - and most military casualties are from this group - expect their arms to be powerful , able to grip and lift 30 pounds or more quite quickly .
But existing battery - powered limbs , if built to this sort of spec , either become unacceptably heavy or run out of juice much too fast .
A proper cyber arm , rocket fuelled and steam driven .
Enter Professor Michael Goldfarb of Vanderbilt University .
" Battery power has been adequate for the current generation of prosthetic arms because their functionality is so limited that people do n't use them much , " Goldfarb says .
" The more functional the prosthesis , the more the person will use it and the more energy it will consume . "
Goldfarb reckoned that current battery tech was never going to offer an arm with decent strength and endurance at a reasonable weight .
He 'd previously run up against these limitations working on a DARPA exoskeleton project , and he reckoned he had the solution : the arm needed to be powered by a small rocket motor .
No , really .
Goldfarb 's design uses high - test hydrogen peroxide fuel , formerly used mainly in rockets and torpedoes .
Concentrated peroxide breaks down in the presence of a catalyst to produce high - pressure steam and oxygen .
In Goldfarb 's arm , the vapour is used to drive pistons , just as in a steam engine : but rather than turning a wheel , the various pistons heave in or let out tension belts against springs so as to bend or straighten the elbow , wrist , fingers , etc .
According to Goldfarb , a small sealed canister of hydrogen peroxide that easily fits in the upper arm can provide enough energy to power the device for 18 hours of normal activity .
There have been a few little problems , though .
The steam comes out of the generator unit at oven - like 230 - degrees - C temperatures , making parts of the arm baking hot .
But Goldfarb and his team have used strategically - placed insulation " to reduce surface temperatures enough so they are safe to touch " .
An initial tendency to hiss and chuff noisily was fixed , too .
Then there was the matter of the arm squirting jets of damp steam exhaust like a old - time locomotive ; but again , Goldfarb figures he 's got this sorted .
Waste steam is disposed of discreetly , " in as natural a fashion as possible : by venting it through a porous cover , where it evaporates like natural perspiration " , according to the Vanderbilt inhouse magazine article ( includes video of the arm operating on compressed air . ) .
" The amount of water involved is about the same as a person would normally sweat from their arm in a warm day , " Goldfarb says .
This does n't seem totally convincing overall .
Many of us have suffered from visibly damp armpits , but actual jets of steam blowing from them might be a tad embarrassing - if perhaps more fragrant than ordinary biological emissions .
At least , as long as the fuel itself does n't leak .
Then there are a few other questions to be asked .
Pressurised high - test peroxide ( HTP ) is n't like the friendly low - concentration bleach beloved of ersatz blondes , safe for handling by hairdressers and the like .
This stuff is corrosive and explosive , and HTP accidents are thought to have sunk submarines and led to various other deadly mishaps .
Furthermore , peroxide - driven machinery usually needs intensive maintenance to remain even vaguely safe - perhaps unsurprisingly , even the working parts being driven by a fairly corrosive and saucy mixture of hot steam and oxygen .
An arm which requires poisonous hazmat fuel and which offers at least some chance of an explosion or violent mechanical failure in use could be seen as going too far in pursuit of decent power and endurance .
Still , the military users DARPA is aiming at are reported to love the Terminator - style look of some new artificial arms .
If they like cyberpunk style , there 's at least a chance they 'll love Goldfarb 's steampunk * offering .
Even so , Goldfarb is apparently a bit worried he might lose his DARPA funding soon due to concerns over how long it could take to get regulatory approval for the HTP - powered steam arm .
But he reckons other backers will step in if DARPA cut him off .
" We have made so much progress and gotten such positive feedback from the research community that I 'm certain we 'll be able to keep going , " he says . ®

The Association of German Retailers ( HDE ) has filed a legal complaint with the nation 's highest court in an attempt to ban the use of flash mob tactics in labor disputes .
The term " flash mob " refers to the sudden assembly of a large group of people who perform an unusual action before quickly dispersing .
Such gatherings are generally organized via mobile phone messages , social media websites like Facebook , or viral emails .
The lawsuit lodged with the Federal Constitutional Court is directed at the Verdi services union , which organized a flash mob at a supermarket where unionized staff members were striking in 2007 .
The flash mob protest saw 40 participants block the store 's checkout area for about an hour by simultaneously purchasing small items worth just a few cents .
They also filled shopping carts with goods and abandoned them in the store for strike - breaking workers to clear away .
Retailers say a clear line should be drawn between traditional protest strikes and flash mobs
Questionable tactics
The latest complaint comes three months after the Federal Labor Court ruled that flash mobs are a legitimate form of industrial action given that they do not constitute a blockade of company facilities .
Judges recommended that store owners counter the spontaneous protests by closing their stores for a short time or banning participants from entering the premises .
But the HDE says that decision is both impractical and unfair .
" The people who suffer are customers who are not involved in the dispute , " HDE labor expert Heribert Joeris told the Associated Press .
Joeris warned that the term ' labor dispute ' would become disreputable if flash mobs were permitted to make a nuisance of themselves in retail outlets , or if store workers could only clear protesters from their premises by using physical force .
" That would be a legal situation that we retailers cannot and will not accept , " he said .

For some reason I never got around to seeing Jill Tarter 's talk at TED last year on SETI until today , and after having watched it I can say that it 's absolutely excellent .
The video is over 20 minutes in length , and part of what makes the presentation so powerful ( besides the presentation itself and her excellent speaking voice , which I can only describe as one with a kind of rhythmically stumbly but fluid and ever forward - moving kind of lilt to it ) is her use of analogy to explain some of the vastness of the universe , something I attempt to do so here from time to time such as :
- this post on the distance from here to Alpha Centauri ,
- this one on visualizing the surface area ( not just the diameter ) of planets and asteroids , and
- this one showing the difference between the distance from the Earth to the Moon compared to the Earth to Mars .
Since numbers involved in space are so immense it 's very important that we are able to put them into a picture that is easy to understand .
This post showing the difference between military funding vs. national space programs is also very important , as whenever the subject of funding comes up ( e.g. " there 's enough funding to do X " vs. " there 's not enough funding to do Y " ) we need to remember that this is only based on the assumption that we are using but a sliver of our total potential to explore space .
NASA for example only receives 0.55 % of the total US federal budget .
The average household in the US makes $ 50,000 a year so 0.55 % would work out to $ 23 there , or taking the family out to dinner at McDonalds once a month .
And countries like Canada spend even less .
In spite of having budget surpluses throughout the 1990s and up until about two years ago , the Canadian Space Agency only received $ 375 million a year , or 0.14 % of the total budget .
That 's the equivalent of $ 6 a month for an average household , or one fancy cup of coffee at Starbucks .
The Canadian Space Agency was formed in 1989 with a $ 300 million budget , and since then has pretty much drifted with budget increases pegged to inflation .
It certainly has made contributions in niche areas , but Canada could easily have tripled the budget a decade ago and barely noticed .
In addition to comparing numbers in this way , imagery is also effective .
Jill Tarter mentions the Kepler space telescope ( back then it had n't been launched yet ; now it's in the middle of its mission and has already detected five extrasolar planets ) in her talk but it's also good to remember just how small an area even this impressive telescope is currently surveying .
Here is how much of the galaxy we 're able to see with it :
Now add to that another 200- 400 billion other galaxies or so , and we have the entire known universe .
So with some of that in mind , enjoy the talk if you 've never gotten around to seeing it either .
Subtitles are available in Russian , Korean , Polish , Portuguese , and Spanish if that 's your mother tongue or you are studying one of them .

Despite its February 9th launch looming on the surface , the creator of the original Bioshock has only ‘ seen a few minutes ’ of the sequel .
In a recent interview with Joystiq , Ken Levine exposited on his relationship with the project , and on recent changes in the 2 K family .
“ I do n’t have … except for being the studio that created the world and the franchise .
You know : Andrew Ryan , Big Daddies and Little Sisters and all those things .
We do n’t have a connection with BioShock 2 .
I have n’t really seen it , ” he continued .
“ I ’m waiting for it to be done .
I want to play it as a fan .
If I ’m going to work on something … either I work on something or I do n’t work on something , ” he said .
“ I ’m in for a penny , I ’m in for a pound .
If I ’m not going to work on it , I just want to play what ’s there as a fan .
I do n’t play betas .
Except for stuff I ’m actually working on , I hate playing betas because I just want to play it when it ’s done .
We started with them , we were working on BioShock 2 , then I just said well , ‘ I ’ll play it as a fan when it comes out . ' ”

You can turn it off if you want to — at your own peril — but as Gmail Engineering Director Sam Schillace said :
" Using https helps protect data from being snooped by third parties , such as in public wifi hotspots .
We initially left the choice of using it up to you because there 's a downside : https can make your mail slower since encrypted data does n't travel across the web as quickly as unencrypted data .
" Over the last few months , we 've been researching the security / latency tradeoff and decided that turning https on for everyone was the right thing to do . "

As a result , they said , old - fashioned restaurants like the Capri  think iceberg lettuce , not arugula  had become especially appealing because they offered consistent value , and it was not just the early bird ’s filet mignon for $ 12.95 .
It was also the respectful treatment  the waiters in ties , the greetings of “ Mr. ” and “ Mrs. , ” the effort to remember the orders of regulars , and letting everyone stay as long as they wanted .
“ When you go out now , you have to have a plan , ” said Gary Green , 34 , who married into the family after leaving Jamaica .
At the Capri , he said , “ there ’s less risk . ”
Katherine Slater , the restaurant ’s only diner with a nose stud and dyed red hair , said she had only recently begun to understand what her elders saw in such places .
“ When I was young , 18 , I was like , why would I want to go out to dinner there with my parents and my grandparents ? ” she said .
“ Now I ’m 21 . I appreciate it . ”
Nearly everyone in the state feels a little poorer these days  with unemployment at its highest rate since 1975 and real estate values continuing to drop .
That insecurity has reshaped the local mindset , say many Floridians under 55 , and taken the shame out of scrimping .
For instance , Cassandra Eriser , 35 , an aesthetician with cover girl looks who works giving facials at a South Beach spa , is not what most people imagine when they think early bird .
But there she was at Cafe Prima Pasta on a recent Sunday at 5:30 p.m. , finishing up a meal of tilapia with her boyfriend , a musician with a shaved head .
With wine and tip , the couple spent less than $ 25 each .
“ It ’s a great way to try a new restaurant without forking over a lot of money , ” Ms. Eriser said .
The University of Minnesota 's beloved mascot , Goldy Gopher , has been on the run since making fun of a Penn State player who was praying before the start of Saturday 's game .
Here 's a video showing Goldy mimicking Penn State defensive end Jerome Hayes as the athlete prays in the end zone :
Hayes did n't seem to have a problem with it , pretty much acting as if the big - headed mascot did n't even exist .
However , some folks out in State College , Pa. , are plenty mad about the whole thing , prompting Minnesota to issue an apology .
Goldy 's actions were " plainly a mistake , " said Minnesota spokesman Dan Wolter .
I 'll say .
Penn State ended up winning , 20 - 0 .
That 'll teach the Gophers to mess with a higher authority .
Goldy should just stick to tried and tested sideline antics .
You know , something like this :

With the recent success of New Super Mario Bros Wii ( in a red box ) outselling Super Mario Galaxy in just a few sort months , Nintendo decided to follow the same marketing strategy and change their box colors on unfavorable Teen + ( compared to E 10 + ) games to attract more hardcore gamers .
Nintendo is testing this marketing strategy first in Japan on the soon to be released title Zangeki no Reginleiv , the first CERO D ( 17 + ) rated wii game in Japan .
Nintendo has also stated that the black boxes are also meant to warn parents of mature content .
Abdoulaye Wade said Haitians could " return to their origin " Senegal 's president says he will offer free land and " repatriation " to people affected by the earthquake in Haiti .
President Abdoulaye Wade said Haitians were sons and daughters of Africa since Haiti was founded by slaves , including some thought to be from Senegal .
" The president is offering voluntary repatriation to any Haitian that wants to return to their origin , " said Mr Wade 's spokesman , Mamadou Bemba Ndiaye .
Tuesday 's earthquake killed tens of thousands and left many more homeless .
AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY Africa should contribute to our Haitian brothers and sisters .
In our sometime dire situation , a significant number of Africans find some money to have a drink or buy credit for our mobile phones Lawrence Barchue , London Buildings have been reduced to rubble , the distribution of aid is slow , and people have been flooding out of the devastated capital , Port - au - Prince .
" Senegal is ready to offer them parcels of land - even an entire region .
It all depends on how many Haitians come , " Mr Bemba Ndiaye said .
" If it 's just a few individuals , then we will likely offer them housing or small pieces of land .
If they come en masse we are ready to give them a region . "
The spokesman emphasised that if a region was given , it would be in a fertile part of the country rather than in its parched deserts , the Associated Press news agency reported .

- video encodings still in process -
Although over - priced , delayed time and time again , and the subject of numerous lawsuits , it seems like a pretty cool rifle .
This sort of rifle is the future of small arms in the United States Military .
The Bushmaster Adaptive Combat Rifle ( ACR ) is the production name for an updated version of the Masada Adaptive Combat Weapon System .
In late January 2008 , Bushmaster entered into a licensing agreement with Magpul whereby Bushmaster would take over production , future development and sales of the Masada .
It is a patent pending self - loading rifle platform designed by Magpul Industries of Erie , Colorado .
The rifle was initially developed over a period of four months , completely independent of government funding .
Prototypes were displayed at the 2007 SHOT Show in Orlando , Florida .
Originally scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2008 , Bushmaster announced on May 16 , 2008 , that the consumer release would be delayed until Q1 2009 , due to a focus on military projects .
On November 18 , 2008 , Bushmaster released a statement saying , " The ACR is being redesigned to be a superior offering to compete for the next generation US Army infantry carbine and subcompact weapon requirement and will be available to select customers in 2009 . "
The ACR was one of the weapons displayed to U.S. Army officials during an invitation - only Industry Day on November 13 , 2008 .
The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 Carbine .
The original Magpul Masada design represents an amalgamation of several recent rifle designs , incorporating what is considered by its designers to be the best features of each in a single , lightweight , modular rifle platform . [ 7 ]
Design features from the Armalite AR - 18 ( short - stroke gas system ) , the FN SCAR ( upper receiver , charging handle location ) , the Heckler & Koch G36 / XM8 ( liberal use of polymer components ) , the M16 / AR15 ( trigger pack ) , and the M16 ( barrel , fire control group ) are clearly prevalent .
The rifle also includes several features developed by Magpul , such as a quick - change barrel / trunnion system , adjustable gas regulator , non-reciprocating charging handle , and storage compartments located in the stock and grip .
Just prior to the deal with Bushmaster , Magpul made additional changes to their design — the most obvious of these is the relocation of the ambidextrous operating handle to a forward position ( somewhat similar to the Heckler & Koch G3 and Heckler & Koch MP5 series of weapons ) .
Experts from Magpul Industries have on several occasions mentioned that depending on the barrel length of the weapon , the rate of fire is estimated to be in the range of 600 - 800 rpm ( this is an estimate ; specifics have not yet been verified ) .
Bushmaster Firearms , with the help of Remington Arms ( a sister company in the Freedom Group , Inc portfolio that includes Bushmaster , Remington , Marlin , and DPMS Panther Arms brands ) has also made some design changes based on extensive environmental and functional testing specifically to meet the emerging requirements of the US military in both the carbine and subcompact weapon versions of the ACR family .
It is expected that the rifle will be offered to military customers in 5.56 mm NATO , 6.8 mm Remington SPC , and 6.5 Grendel with the same lower and the user just having to switch out the barrel , bolt face , and magazine to change calibers .
It is also expected that the ACR will have barrel length options of 10.5 ″ , 12.5 & Prime , 14.5 ″ , 16 ″ ( commercial ) , and 18 ″ .
The official name of the rifle for military use will be the Remington ACR .
The magazine conceived for the 5.56 mm version of the ACR rifle is called the PMag , a high - impact , 30 - round polymer magazine claimed by Magpul to be significantly more resistant to wear , shock , and harsh environments than other counterparts on the market .
The PMag is STANAG 4179 - compatible , as it will readily fit any STANAG magazine firearm , including the M16 rifle family .
The Bushmaster ACR 's modular construction even allows the user to fire the 7.62x39 mm round with an alternate barrel and lower receiver .
The ACR is currently stated to be available in 2nd Quarter 2010 for military , government and commercial customers .
The ACR will be available in greater quantity ( tens of thousands ) in the commercial marketplace in 2010 .
According to an official press release from Bushmaster , the rifle will have suggested retail price between $ 2,685 - $ 3,061.00 - twice as much as early price quotes of " around $ 1500 , " causing public outcry and dismissal of the rifle from a large portion of the firearms fraternity and potential end -users .
Semi-automatic versions will be available to the commercial market from Bushmaster , and selective - fire versions available for military and law enforcement under the Remington name .
As of October 2009 , Bushmaster has announced that several consumer versions of the ACR would be available in the first half of 2010 .
The rifle was originally named after the Siege of Masada .
Magpul company literature about the rifle states that , " Magpul Industries is not Jewish owned or Israeli backed , however Magpul has always found the story of the Masada as a bold example of defiance . "
When production rights were signed with Bushmaster , the Masada name was dropped from the product .
A PATH TO PASSING HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION A PATH TO PASSING HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION President Obama suggested last week at the health care summit that he and congressional Democrats are prepared to use a legislative tactic , known as reconciliation , allowing a simple majority to pass his $ 950 billion legislation .
USA TODAY 's David Jackson looks at the tactic and its previous uses .
What is it ?
Congress created a legislative process , known as reconciliation , in 1974 to make it easier to align tax cuts and spending levels with the budget resolutions that they pass .
How does it work ?
In the House , special rules are adopted to limit the length of the debate and number of amendments that can be offered .
The Senate limits debate to 20 hours with no opportunity for the minority party to block the bill .
Under this tactic in the Senate , it takes only 51 votes to pass a bill instead of the usual 60 votes that are required to prevent a filibuster by the minority .
The Byrd rule Sen. Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , a master of the Senate 's rules and procedures , pushed Congress in the mid-1980s to adopt a rule saying any amendments offered during the reconciliation process must pertain to budget issues .
Disagreements are resolved by the Senate parliamentarian , who is appointed by the majority .
Using the tactic
It has been used 22 times , including 16 in which Republicans controlled at least one chamber of Congress .
Three efforts were vetoed by President Clinton .
Some notable uses of this legislative tactic : 1982 : To pass a law opening health maintenance organizations to Medicare recipients .
1986 : To create a health insurance program , known as COBRA , that allows employees to buy coverage for up to 18 months after they leave a company .
The acronym stands for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. 1993 : To pass Clinton 's first budget , which was approved by only one vote in the House and Senate .
1996 : To overhaul the way the federal government provides welfare benefits and to put more people to work .
1997 : To pass an agreement between Clinton and a GOP - led Congress to balance the federal budget .
1997 : To create the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , known as S - CHIP , and the Medicare Advantage program , which provides seniors with additional benefits such as vision , dental and hearing coverage and helps coordinate health care for those with chronic conditions .
2001 : To enact President Bush 's $ 1.35 trillion tax cut package , including cuts on individual tax rates and estate taxes and provide a $ 1,000 - per- child tax credit .
2003 : To enact more tax cuts proposed by Bush , including a cut in the top capital gains rate to 15 % and a cut in the top rate on dividends to 15 % .

The White House 's top health care adviser on Sunday repeated a call by President Obama for " an up or down vote " on health care legislation as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to rally Democrats around a final bill .
Nancy - Ann DeParle , director of the White House Office on Health Reform , said Obama is ready , if necessary , to move his $ 950 billion health care bill using a legislative tactic in the Senate that would require only 51 votes for passage .
" All the president is talking about is do we need to address this problem and does it make sense to have a simple up or down vote on whether or not we want to fix these problems , " DeParle said on NBC'sMeet the Press .
The White House has said Obama 's health care plan , unveiled last week before a bipartisan summit , would extend coverage to 31 million people and change insurance industry regulations .
It would include a mandate that almost everyone obtain insurance or pay a fine and provide financial aid to those who cannot afford to buy it now .
Obama would pay for such a proposal by taxing the unearned income of the wealthy .
OBAMA : President ' fit for duty ' into 2012 , doctor says ON POLITICS : Pelosi's job to pass health care gets tougher THE OVAL : Obama announces ' way forward ' next week TIMELINE :
The road to health care legislation Pelosi , D - Calif. , appearing on ABC's This Week , said that " time is up " for Congress to pass a health care bill .
She said her House members , including many who face difficult re-election campaigns in November , will need to see what the Senate wants to do before deciding how they will vote .
Pelosi called on lawmakers to draw on the same courage that previous lawmakers drew upon to pass the bills that created the federal safety - net programs of Social Security and Medicare .
" We 're not here just to self - perpetuate our service in Congress , " she said .
" We 're here to do the job for the American people . "
In the House , Democrats currently have a 255 - 178 edge over Republicans .
There are two vacancies .
Rep. Eric Cantor , R - Va. , the minority whip , made it clear Republicans see a Democrats - only bill as an election - year issue .
" If Speaker Pelosi rams through this bill , through the House … they will lose their majority in Congress in November , " he said Sunday on Meet the Press .
Sen. Lamar Alexander , R - Tenn. , objected to using the legislative tactic , known as reconciliation , on a health care bill .
" There 's never been anything of this size and magnitude and complexity run through the Senate in this way , " he said on ABC's This Week .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , said on CBS '
Face the Nation that Democratic congressional leaders will take the next couple of weeks to further shape Obama 's proposal and to start counting votes .
Obama will announce his ideas for moving legislation forward in the next few days , spokesman Robert Gibbs said .

President Obama Calls Station , Shuttle Crews
The 11 astronauts aboard the International Space Station and Space Shuttle Endeavour chatted with President Barack Obama Wednesday at 5:14 p.m. EST -- along with Maryland Democratic Congressional member Dutch Ruppersberger and 12 middle school students from Michigan , Florida , North Carolina and Nebraska .
Calling from the Roosevelt Room in the White House , the President congratulated the two crews on their continuing successful mission , saying the work on board is a testimony to why exploration is so important and that his commitment to NASA is unwavering .
Endeavour and its crew launched Feb. 8 on the STS - 130 mission to the space station .
During the mission , astronauts installed the Tranquility node and a cupola with seven windows that provide a panoramic view of Earth , celestial objects and visiting spacecraft .
Tranquility and its cupola are the final major U.S. portions of the station .
President Obama also told the crew that his administration is “ very excited about putting research dollars into the technologies ” that will get humans to Mars and beyond .
The President also asked the crew about the experiments being performed on the space station saying that some of the experiments are in line with where his administration wants to see NASA go .
At the conclusion of the event , the President repeated that he is proud and excited about the work being done on the space station and told the crew that he is committed to continuing human space exploration and complimented the crew on being “ great role models .
”
“ Be sure and tell your families that we appreciate them letting you float up in space like this , ” said Obama .
The students participating in the event were in Washington D.C. as part of 39 teams competing for the “ Future City ” engineering competition hosted by National Engineers Week that builds on the President ’s " Educate to Innovate " campaign that emphasizes inspiring students to pursue excellence in science , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) .
The schools represented were Birney Middle School in Detroit , Elkhorn Middle School in Omaha , Neb. , St. Thomas the Apostle in Miami , and Davidson IB Middle School in Davidson , N.C. The North Carolina team was the overall winner of the competition .
My Predictions for The New Year
It is the end of the year , and time to make predictions for 2010
Jeron Criswell — The Amazing Criswell — was a psychic , famous for making wildly inaccurate predictions .
He was a guest on talk shows of 1960 ’s , such the Jack Parr show , where he made many of his predictions .
Today I want to make my own predictions for 2010 .
I doubt that I will be as accurate as The Amazing Criswell , but I will try .
Here is a famous introduction he did for an Ed Wood movie :
One example of his predictions is , according to Wikipedia :
Denver would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of rubber , leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks .
Pretty tough to top his predictions , but let ’s try .
0⇂0 ᄅ ɹoɟ uoıʇɔıpǝɹd ʎɯ
Here are my predictions — they all are for the year 2010 .
A problem on Stephen Smale ’s list of open problems will be solved .
No circuit lower bound of or better will be proved for SAT .
A quantum computer will solve a non-trivial problem .
A Computer Scientist will win a Nobel Prize .
The Goldbach Conjecture will finally be solved — negatively .
The number
will be shown not to be the sum of two primes .
I will have a paper rejected by a conference .
Spam will grow to be 100.001 % of all e-mail .
The 0.001 is due to sampling error .
Someone will discover a polynomial time factoring algorithm — but will not tell anyone .
On April over 3 billion people will type “ google ” into the Google search box , then precisely at 12:00 GMT they will all hit the enter key .
This will cause the Internet to crash , and it will be down for 17 hours and 12 minutes .
At least one of my predictions will be wrong , but not all of them .
Open Problems
What are your best predictions ?
I further predict that someone will make a better prediction , than any I have made .
Happy New Year .
THEY served pineapple upside - down cake for dessert that snowy evening at Camp David , the last weekend of President George W. Bush ’s first year in office .
I remember thinking it seemed fitting .
“ What a year , ” President Bush said during dinner .
“ Sometimes it seems like seven , ” replied Condoleezza Rice , his national security advisor .
But no one else said much .
The emotions had been too raw , too intense .
The sudden horror of Sept. 11 had changed the course of the presidency , making America ’s national security the president ’s relentless focus .
“ Continued vigilance ” were the watchwords , as we fully expected additional attacks .
We had seen the president ’s strong leadership as he rallied the country , Congress and each of us to confront the threat .
“ Let me tell you how to do your job today , ” I remember him saying to me early one morning , directing me to plan an announcement .
We had watched Mr. Bush make the most profound decision a commander in chief can make , committing American lives to battle in Afghanistan .
We had witnessed the fall of the Taliban and worked to calm the panic of anthrax attacks .

As President Obama is learning , the first year of a presidency is one in which the rhetoric of campaigning collides with the hard reality of governing .
As President Bush took office , the economy was falling into recession ; we passed tax cuts to try to stimulate jobs .
We had celebrated moments of great achievement : overwhelming bipartisan approval for education reforms .
We had wrestled with the profound moral ramifications of stem cell research .
And we had experienced the thrills of the presidency : the drama of the first meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia ; the visit by Mexico ’s president , Vicente Fox , which involved a fireworks display so spectacular that Condi Rice joked we could be “ testing the missile defense system . ”
For most of 2009 , the Democrats have treated Republicans as second - class members of Congress .
That 's all good and well - to a large extent , the Republicans tried to turn the wealthy and corporations into an oppressed minority .
And with all the money spent on astroturf , they nearly managed to pull it off .
Well - funded " Tea Party " groups got plenty of TV time .
Sarah Palin wrote a book and went on tour .
Even RNC chair Michael Steele got into the act with his promises of fried chicken to recruit more African - Americans into the GOP .
Democrats have , for the most part , treated the Republicans and their ideas with contempt and disdain .
But this has only served to strengthen the Republican tribe , both at the grassroots and in the media echo chamber .
Glenn Beck called Obama a racist against white people .
Rush Limbaugh took his $ 36 million salary and used it to announce his victimhood at the hands of the White House communications staff .
And Scott Brown successfully convinced enough residents of Massachusetts that his pickup truck and his underdog status were good enough reasons to make him a United States Senator , because it was " him versus the machine " .
Democrats have a solid majority in both chambers of Congress , but they 've failed to translate that into victories on healthcare reform , carbon caps , or financial regulations .
I 've defended Senate Democrats as much as anyone here on the Big Orange , recognizing that Joe Lieberman plus 40 Republicans is enough to stop anything from happening .
But the fact remains that Democrats have failed in the messaging wars because they 've been too busy trying to whip one another into compliance .
As a result of our focus on enforcing party discipline , we 've missed a golden opportunity to expand the field and build our base .
The truth is , the Republicans have very few good ideas and virtually no compelling reasons to trust in their ability to bring about change .
The Congressional GOP remains , for the most part , a set of holdovers from the Bush - Rove years , along with some " Contract with America " veterans and even a handful of Reaganites .
But the GOP 's decision to engage in a purity campaign in 2009 opened the door for the Democrats to further expand .
The big news in early 2009 was not the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia , or the Senate race in Massachusetts .
It was n't about Ted Kennedy 's death or Al Franken 's delayed entry to the Senate .
The big news in early 2009 was the defection of Arlen Specter , who became the 59th Democratic senator and created the possibility of 60 if Franken was seated .
The Republican Party has continued to alienate moderates , who have left the party and become independents .
At the same time , the " movement " conservatives have left the GOP and protested the failures of the GOP to control government expansion or cut deficits .
Like a group of reformed alcoholics , Republicans who supported torture , rendition , and the invasion of Iraq now pledged to stand up against the expansion of government , even as they continued to allow corporations and lobbyists to write their bills and fund their campaigns .
But the Democrats got caught napping , nationally .
We made the " Public Option " the only focus in healthcare reform , and lost the opportunity to address other key components of reform .
We took the bait from the corporate - funded media and the Republican attack machine , engaging in political cannibalism instead of putting the nails in the coffin of a nearly - extinct Republican ideology .
We spent too much time holding Obama " accountable " and attacking his lack of support for the public option , instead of explaining clearly to our Republican neighbors why we should n't consider a public option a " government takeover " .
President Obama showed what we have known all along - the Republican 's ideology can't hold up under close scrutiny and they are engaging in a self - created drama of victimhood instead of working with Democrats in Congress .
And we 've spent too much high - fiving each other instead of getting the job done on organizing and mobilizing to bring in new voices and new ideas .
Yesterday 's display was more than just a one - man show - although it was impressive to see one man up against 140 members of Congress and making them look like students in front of an expert teacher .
Yesterday was a careful deconstruction of the entire Republican party narrative , and an opportunity for Democrats to seize back the narrative in their favor .
The first Islamic Solidarity Games were held in Jeddah in 2005 The Islamic Solidarity Games , due to be held in Iran in April , have been called off because of a dispute with Arab countries over what to call the Gulf .
The games federation in Saudi Arabia said the Iranian organisers had failed to address its concerns , particularly about the planned logo and medals .
These bear the words " Persian Gulf " , but Arab countries , who call it the Arabian Gulf , reject the term .
The games had been postponed in October in the hope of striking a deal .
The Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation ( ISSF ) in Riyadh said , after an emergency board meeting , Iran 's local organising committee " unilaterally took some decisions without asking the federation by writing some slogans on the medals and pamphlets of the games " .
Iran " did not abide by the rules of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation " and " did not follow the decisions taken by the general assembly of the federation at a previous meeting in Riyadh " , it said in a statement .
But Iran 's committee for the games disputed the decision .
" In spite of convincing arguments made to the ISSF executive committee , regrettably and without presenting any logical reasons , the ISSF committee decided not to hold the games with Iran as the host , " it said .
The games - which are meant to strengthen ties among Islamic countries - were first held in the Saudi city of Jeddah in 2005 .
Iran has campaigned to ensure the body of water between Iran and the Arabian peninsula is known as the Persian , not the Arabian , Gulf .

Elliot Morley , David Chaytor , Jim Devine and Lord Hanningfield face charges
The Conservative and Lib Dem leaders have urged MPs facing charges over expense claims not to use Parliamentary privilege to avoid court proceedings .
David Cameron said he was " disgusted " by the prospect and Nick Clegg said the public would be outraged .
Lawyers for Labour MPs Elliot Morley , David Chaytor and Jim Devine have all raised the issue of privilege , which usually protects MPs from civil action .
The three MPs all deny charges which they face under the Theft Act .
So does a fourth politician who faces charges - the Tory peer Lord Hanningfield .
The politicians face charges of false accounting under section 17 of the Theft Act 1968 .
If found guilty they face a maximum sentence of seven years ' imprisonment .
Privilege defence
In a joint statement , the three Labour MPs , who have been barred from standing as Labour candidates in the general election , said : " We totally refute any charges that we have committed an offence and we will defend our position robustly .
Already they ( the public ) feel cynicism about politicians - saying there 's one law for MPs and one law for the rest of us
Paul Flynn MP
Q&A : Parliamentary privilege Devine ' devastated ' by charges Charged leader of council resigns " We maintain that this is an issue that should be resolved by the parliamentary commissioner who is there to enforce any breach of the rules . "
Mr Cameron will say more on the issue in a speech on reforming the political system in London on Monday .
It is understood the MPs lawyers might claim their expenses are covered by Parliamentary privilege , which traditionally protects them from being sued for what they say in the Commons .
Announcing the decision to press charges on Friday , the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer addressed the issue of Parliamentary privilege .
" Lawyers representing those who have been charged have raised with us the question of Parliamentary privilege , " he said .
CPS CHARGES LAID
Elliot Morley - two charges over £ 30,000 of mortgage interest claims
David Chaytor - accused of dishonestly claiming £ 1,950 for IT services and also £ 18,000 in rent
Jim Devine - accused of claiming £ 3,240 for cleaning services and £ 5,505 for stationery
Lord Hanningfield - faces six charges of dishonestly submitting expense claims
CPS charges in full Profile :
The four facing charges " We have considered that question and concluded that the applicability and extent of any Parliamentary privilege claimed should be tested in court . "
Mr Clegg said the public would be " appalled " if the MPs invoked a right going back to 1689 .
" Lawmakers should not be above the law , " he added .
Paul Flynn , Labour MP for Newport West , appealed to his three colleagues to ignore the lawyers ' argument about Parliamentary privilege .
He said it was never intended to give politicians " impunity " from criminal charges and if used it would " deepen and prolong " the expenses scandal which had gripped Westminster .
" There may be a technical argument about this but it is one that will be treated with contempt by the majority of the people of the country , " he told the BBC .
" Already they feel cynicism about politicians - saying there 's one law for MPs and one law for the rest of us . "
The Hansard Society , a leading political research and education charity , said any attempts to use parliamentary privilege in these circumstances would be a " deeply damaging " strategy .
Dr Ruth Fox , from the charity , said : " If it is a defence against almost any action that an MP takes in parliament , in any relationship with their work , then I think that is going to be deeply damaging for the public .
" They will see that it is putting MPs above the public , giving them enhanced powers , making them essentially above the laws that they themselves make . "
' Vigorous ' defence
The charges were announced by Mr Starmer following a nine - month police investigation , which was triggered after details of all MPs ' expenses claims were leaked to a national newspaper .
Another case remains under investigation but police said in a sixth case - that of Labour peer Lord Clarke - there was " insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction " .
Keir Starmer said defence lawyers had raised parliamentary privilege
The four men will not be arrested but will be sent a summons to turn up on 11 March at City of Westminster magistrates court , a short walk from the Houses of Parliament .
Former minister Elliot Morley , MP for Scunthorpe , faces charges relating to a total of £ 30,000 of mortgage claims which , it is alleged , were " in excess of that to which he was entitled " and covered a period when there was no mortgage on the property .
David Chaytor , MP for Bury North , is accused of " dishonestly claiming " £ 1,950 for IT services and further sums of £ 12 , 925 and £ 5,425 relating to rent on properties which he and his mother allegedly owned .
Livingston MP
Jim Devine is accused of " dishonestly claiming " money for cleaning services and for stationery using false invoices .
Paul White - the Conservative peer Lord Hanningfield and leader of Essex County Council - is accused of dishonestly submitting claims " for expenses to which he knew he was not entitled " - including overnight stays in London .
He stepped down as council leader on Friday and as a Tory frontbench spokesman .
He denies the charges and says he will " vigorously " defend himself .
Another fall - out from the expenses scandal was announced on Thursday when 372 MPs were asked to pay back £ 1.1 m as a result of an audit of their claims by Sir Thomas Legg .

Dec. 29 , 2009  -- A Nevada couple who was rescued after three days stuck in their car on an unplowed road said it was GPS directions that led them deep into an Oregon forest .
John Rhoads , 65 , and his wife , Starry Bush - Rhoads , 67 , were heading home to Reno on Christmas Day from a trip to Oregon , using the GPS in their SUV as a guide for the 500 - mile drive .
But the GPS -- which makes travel so much easier for millions of Americans -- turned their trip home into a chilling lesson about relying on technology .
After following the directions onto a remote road , John Rhoads realized they were in trouble " when we noticed that the snow was getting deep and we were over 30 miles into this road .
We thought we did n't have much farther to go . "
The Rhoads ' four - wheel - drive Toyota Sequoia became stuck in the snow in Winema - Fremont National Forest .
" We started to dig it out to get it so we could move on .
We were successful in digging it out and moving farther down the road and we got stuck again , " John Rhoads told " Good Morning America . "
They then attempted to turn the car around and head back the way they came , but the car refused to budge .
With their cell phones not picking up a signal , the couple sat in their SUV for three days .
As the hours ticked away , the temperature dropped below freezing .
They saw no other living creature , except for a chipmunk .
They put on clothing packed from their trip and turned on the SUV 's heater every few hours .
" We had plenty of food , but neither of us were very hungry , " Starry Bush - Rhoads said , ticking off a list of snacks including lunch meat , salami and nuts .
" We had to force each other to eat . "
On Sunday , weather conditions apparently changed enough for their GPS - enabled cell phone to get a weak signal and relay coordinates to a dispatcher , Klamath County Sheriff Tim Evinger said .
Experts : Never Rely Solely on GPS
" GPS almost did them in and GPS saved them , " Evinger said .
" It will give you options to pick the shortest route .
You certainly get the shortest route .
But it may not be a safe route . "
Garmin , the manufacturer of the couple 's GPS , issued a statement that read in part , " drivers must always remember that GPS provide route suggestions .
They do not cause drivers to make driving decisions . "
Evinger said a Lake County deputy found the couple in the forest outside the small town of Silver Lake on Sunday afternoon and pulled their Toyota out of the snow with a winch .
That deputy , Tom Roark , said the Rhoads were lucky .
" Who knows what would have happened if they would have been up there for a few more days . " he said .
Being stranded in an Oregon winter can be deadly .
In 2006 , the Kim family missed a turn , got lost in a remote section of Oregon and was snowbound for 10 days .
James
Kim died while he was walking to get help .
Experts at American Automobile Association say a GPS device should never be the only navigational tool in the car .
" You need a paper map as a backup , which is sort of going back to basics , " AAA spokeswoman Yolanda Cole told " Good Morning America . "

Researchers at Yale School of Medicine have developed a simple urine test to rapidly predict and diagnose preeclampsia , a common , but serious hypertensive complication of pregnancy .
Dubbed the " Congo Red Dot Test " by the research team , the test accurately predicted preeclampsia in a study of 347 pregnant women , allowing health care providers to offer better preventive care to pregnant women .
The research will be presented February 4 at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine ( SMFM ) in Chicago .
The World Health Organization estimates that about 63,000 pregnant women die each year because of severe preeclampsia , as well as a related condition called eclampsia , which can cause sudden , convulsive seizures .
" There is a critical need in the developing world for low - cost diagnostics for preeclampsia , " said lead researcher Irina Buhimschi , M.D. , associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine .
" This test will help identify high - risk patients that should be transported from remote settings to facilities where there is access to specialized care for preeclampsia , such as magnesium sulfate therapy . "
Buhimschi said that despite its effectiveness in preventing eclamptic seizures , magnesium sulfate is underutilized in developing countries .
This is due in part to the lack of consistent and low - cost ways to identify preeclampsia patients who are in need of intervention , which the test could provide .
She said that the test could also identify women who needed to deliver their babies immediately , in turn reducing the incidence of unnecessary early birth , because delivery is the only effective treatment for preeclampsia .
The team also found that the Congo Red Dot Test could be used as a marker for assessing misfolded proteins .
The test is based on a common red dye , originally used to stain textiles , that sticks to misfolded proteins .
Previous studies by Buhimschi and her team have found that preeclampsia is a pregnancy - specific protein misfolding disease .
" In this new work , we have seen a link between preeclampsia and other disorders caused by misfolded proteins such as Alzheimer 's or prion disease , " said Buhimschi .
" This may provide the foundation for new therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of this disorder . "
Other Yale School of Medicine authors on the study included Edmund Funai , Guomao Zhao , Antonette Dulay , Sarah Lee , Christina Han , Erika Werner , Stephen Thung and Catalin Buhimschi .
The research was funded by a McKern Award for Perinatal Research .
A victory for Scott Brown could erode moderate Democrats ' support for health reform , effectively dealing a fatal blow to the legislation .
No easy rescue plan for health care
Ever since health care reform flamed out in the 1990s , Democrats thought lots of things might derail their longtime dream this time around .
Losing a Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts was not on the list .
But that is the harsh reality sinking in among Democrats — that a Republican victory Tuesday could spell the end of health reform because there is no good option to rescue the plan from this latest brush with political death .

Publicly , the White House and top Democrats held firm to their stance that health care reform will pass this year .
And Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) said Monday that Democrats will need to figure out a way to proceed if Republican Scott Brown wins , “ but that does n’t mean we wo n’t have a health care bill . ”
“ Let ’s remove all doubt that we will have health care one way or another , ” Pelosi told reporters in San Francisco .
But privately , Democrats are getting cold feet about pushing ahead full bore on health care .
Moderate Democrats who have long been skeptical of the administration ’s focus on the issue could begin to peel away in the face of a convincing loss for Democrat Martha Coakley , dealing a fatal blow to legislation that had no room for error in either chamber .
Democrats have options to salvage reform following a Brown victory , but all have serious deficiencies .
One idea that looked promising a week ago — passing a bill through the House and Senate before Brown was seated — has dropped down the list of alternatives , as Democrats fear it would look like a partisan power play that ignored the will of Massachusetts voters .
The White House - favored option is to ask the House to adopt the Senate bill , with a promise to make additional changes later through the budget reconciliation process .
But House Democratic liberals , as well as some conservatives , do n’t like key parts of the Senate bill and do n’t want to make it their own .
Ron Pollack , a longtime health care insider and executive director of Families USA , has floated a variation on this theme with the administration and congressional aides : a two - step process that would reassure House members their wishes would be met in the bill .
Under Pollack ’s proposal , the House would take up the Senate bill only after the White House and congressional leaders struck a deal on key issues , such as taxes and the subsidies to purchase insurance .
They would incorporate those changes into a separate budget reconciliation bill .
The House would pass both the Senate bill and the reconciliation bill , possibly on the same day .
The Senate would then take up the reconciliation bill , which would require only 51 votes for passage .
“ It is eminently doable — and quickly , ” Pollack said Monday .
“ It is the combination of two things that would n’t work separately but , when done in tandem , make a lot of sense . ”
This approach , however , would prevent any fixes that did not have a direct impact on the federal budget , such as changes to language on abortion and immigration and , possibly , even the insurance exchanges .
The exchange question could be particularly problematic for House Democrats who have sacrificed the public option in return for the national insurance exchanges under the House bill .
“ Progressives and conservatives in the caucus wo n’t go for it , ” one aide predicted Monday .
But they may not have a choice .
Another aide acknowledged a Brown win would force party leaders to recalibrate and said that Obama and Pelosi would have to convince a skeptical rank and file that this was the only course of action .
Democrats also could reopen negotiations with Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , who supported the Senate Finance Committee bill but has opposed key elements of the latest Senate bill , such as expanding the Medicare payroll tax .
Any product of those talks very likely would alienate progressive Democrats .
If they decide to push forward on any front , Obama and congressional leaders will need to argue again , as they have all year , that failure to pass a bill is more perilous than passing a bill .
Liberal House Democrats have vigorously opposed pillars of the Senate bill .
Last week , the White House cut a deal with organized labor to soften the impact of a Senate tax on high - end health care plans , in large part to quell unrest among Democrats in the House .
Congressional negotiators are expected to announce additional compromises as early as this week , after sending large parts of the bill to the Congressional Budget Office for review .
The prospect of a Coakley loss threatens to upend those internecine negotiations , angering House Democrats who have been on the short end of just about every development in the health care fight .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , along with multiple Senate and House offices contacted Monday , declined to comment on the way forward .
“ We ’re focused on two things : ironing out the differences in the bills , which you know the president has spent a lot of time working on over the past few days ; and we think Martha Coakley is going to win this race , ” Gibbs said .
Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) predicted a Coakley win but said Monday that a loss in Massachusetts would n’t end the Democratic push for health care .
“ I ’m sure there are other vehicles if the options are different and we do n’t have 60 votes for some reason ; I ’m sure there are other vehicles that could be used to achieve the health care reform we want , ” Menendez told POLITICO .
The debate could be moot for any number of reasons by 8 p.m. Tuesday .
Coakley could pull out what would now be viewed as an upset , winning the seat after most political pundits declared her campaign dead .
But a double - digit Republican win , which a Suffolk University pollster predicted Monday on MSNBC , could drastically alter the will among Democrats to push ahead with health reform .
Whatever fallback plan the Democrats come up with , it may be important for them to show that they have learned something from voters in Massachusetts .
Simply finding a way around the 60 - vote hurdle in the Senate may not be enough .
A Republican close to the Brown campaign told POLITICO that this is not just about health care but about a sense among voters that “ they ’re just not listening to us . ”
This helps explain the title of a Republican press release Monday on health care : “ Plan B-ecause We Do n’t Care What You Think . ”
“ This is the unanticipated glitch , ” said Jim Kessler , a former longtime Senate aide who is vice president of policy at Third Way , a centrist Democratic think tank .
“ You have a combination of a bad candidate for the Democrats and a very good candidate for the Republicans , a low - turnout election and , essentially , a sour mood in the country and a candidate who was caught unawares .
You would never expect this to happen in Massachusetts . ”

BALTIMORE — In a remarkably sharp face - to - face confrontation , President Barack Obama chastised Republican lawmakers Friday for opposing him on taxes , health care and the economic stimulus , while they accused him in turn of brushing off their ideas and driving up the national debt .
The president and GOP House members took turns questioning and sometimes lecturing each other for more than an hour at a Republican gathering in Baltimore .
The Republicans agreed to let TV cameras inside , resulting in an extended , point - by - point interchange that was almost unprecedented in U.S. politics , except perhaps during presidential debates .
With voters angry about partisanship and legislative logjams , both sides were eager to demonstrate they were ready to cooperate , resulting in the GOP invitation and Obama 's acceptance .
After polite introductions , however , Friday 's exchange showed that Obama and the Republicans remain far apart on key issues , and neither side could resist the chance to challenge and even scold the other .
Obama said Republican lawmakers have attacked his health care overhaul so fiercely , " you 'd think that this thing was some Bolshevik plot . "
His proposals are mainstream , widely supported ideas , he said , and they deserve some GOP votes in Congress .
" I am not an ideologue , " the president declared .
But Rep. Tom Price , R - Ga. , pointedly asked Obama : " What should we tell our constituents who know that Republicans have offered positive solutions " for health care , " and yet continue to hear out of the administration that we 've offered nothing ? "
Obama showed little sympathy , disputing Price 's claim that a Republican plan would insure nearly all Americans without raising taxes .
" That 's just not true , " said Obama .
He called such claims " boilerplate " meant to score political points .
At times it seemed more like Britain 's " question time " -- when lawmakers in the House of Commons trade barbs with the prime minister -- than a meeting between a U.S. president and members of Congress .
Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana defended Price on the health care proposals .
He said a GOP agenda booklet given to Obama at the start of the session " is backed up by precisely the kind of detailed legislation that Speaker ( Nancy ) Pelosi and your administration have been busy ignoring for 12 months . "
Obama shot back that he had read the Republican proposals and that they promise solutions that can't be realized .
In another barbed exchange , the president said some Republican lawmakers in the audience had attended ribbon - cutting ceremonies for projects in their districts funded by the 2009 stimulus package that they voted against .
Pence said Obama was trying to defend " a so - called stimulus that was a piecemeal list of projects and boutique tax cuts . "
Obama replied , " When you say they were boutique tax cuts , Mike , 95 percent of working Americans got tax cuts . "
More than 20 Republican senators wrote a letter to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE on Friday objecting to the administration ’s decision to try terror suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in civilian courts .
The GOP senators want the 23 - year - old Nigerian accused of trying to bomb a Northwest Airlines jet tried in military courts and declared an enemy combatant .
By bringing Abdulmutallab before a judge and allowing him to face charges , critics say , the administration is missing an opportunity to interrogate him more thoroughly .

The letter was still circulating among Senate offices for signatures Friday .
Initial signers included senior Republicans on the Senate Judiciary , Intelligence and Armed Services committees , according to a GOP Senate aide .
Critical questions , the senators argue , remain unanswered , such as whether Abdulmutallab obtained money for the operation , and if so , from whom ; the identities of all the people who assisted him ; and how he trained for the attempted bombing .
The Republicans penned the letter the same day Abdulmutallab pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Detroit .
A U.S. grand jury on Wednesday indicted him on six counts in the alleged plot , including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , which carries a penalty of up to life in prison , attempted murder , and willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft .
His next appearance in court was not set Friday .
Abdulmutallab allegedly attempted to detonate a bomb made from explosives PETN and TATP as Northwest Flight 253 was descending into Detroit en route from Amsterdam .
There were 279 passengers and 11 crew members on board .
The flight landed safely after passengers and crew subdued him .
President Obama ’s plan to announce a spending freeze for some domestic programs during his State of the Union address tomorrow is drawing fire from pro-labor and progressive activists and economists .
The president is expected to call upon Congress to keep overall spending at $ 447 billion a year for agencies other than those charged with national security and mandatory - spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare .
The freeze would take effect with the 2011 fiscal year starting Oct. 1 , and would n’t affect the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan already being implemented , administration officials say .
It also would n’t include a $ 154 billion jobs plan pending before Congress .
“ The long - term budget problem , ” said Mark Thoma , writing in the “ Economist View , ” is “ due to primarily one thing , rising health care costs .
Everything else is dwarfed by that problem .
If we solve the health care cost problem , the rest is easy .
Instead we get cheap political tricks that are likely to backfire . ”
Concern about how a freeze would effect needed job creation is also evident .
“ A spending freeze will make it even harder to get jobs back because government is the last spender around , ” declared former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich .
“ Consumers have pulled back , investors wo n’t do much until they know consumers are out there , and exports are miniscule . ”
The Huffington Post responded by flagging a 2008 campaign video of Obama criticizing McCain ’s support at that time for a spending freeze .
In the video Obama said “ an across - the - board spending freeze is a hatchet when what we need is a scalpel . ”
“ This is not a blunt , across - the - board freeze , ” the White House said in a rebuttal .
“ Some agencies will go up , others will go down ; but in aggregate for those non-security agencies the total will remain intact . ”
White House economist Jared Bernstein defended the plan on MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow Show last night .
“ There ’s also a bunch of emergency spending that ’s outside of this freeze .
The Recovery Act will continue to create employment .
New jobs initiatives that the president will be outlining in the State of the Union will also be accommodated under this program . ”
Remaining skeptical , Maddow shot back : “ Not only are you not talking about a second stimulus , you ’re talking about trying to cut $ 250 billion out of the budget .
I have to tell you it sounds completely , completely insane . ”
Some say the military budget would be a better place to look for areas in which wasteful spending can be eliminated and are looking forward to what the president has to say in the area of foreign policy tomorrow night .
Some see the freeze proposal as a political gambit that results in insignificant cuts but gives the president a talking point and a toe hold with which to co-opt his moderate antagonists .
“ But how does the president move from this to an important policy goal ? , ” asks “ The Economist , ” in an editorial .
“ What room does this leave him to deal with either the jobless recovery of the long - term budget deficit ? ”
The Republican leadership , of course , shows little inclination to change course as a result of moves by the administration to appease congressional moderates .
“ Given Washington Democrats ’ unprecedented spending binge , this is like announcing you ’re going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest , ” said House Minority Leader John Boehner . ”
Ezra Klein , the pro-labor Washington
Post columnist , fears that there are dangers inherent in any type of “ freeze ” on domestic spending .
“ The way this works is simple , ” Klein said .
“ The administration will target worthless programs , like agricultural subsidies , in order to preserve good programs .
But the reason worthless programs live in budget after budget is they have powerful backers .
Now you ’ve removed some of the cuts , but you still want to hit the overall target .
So the cuts get reapportioned to hit programs that lack powerful constituencies .
Many of those programs help the poor . ”
The administration has also announced , in a separate move to allay the concerns of the “ budget hawks , ” that it is supporting formation of a deficit commission proposed by Sens.
Kent Conrad , D-ND , and Judd Gregg , R - NH .
The Senate is expected today to reject the measure which aims to create a commission that would draft deficit - cutting steps that Congress would have to vote on .
Both the administration and centrist Democrats are expected then to go for creation of the commission by executive order , a move the president might announce during his speech on Wednesday .
SAN FRANCISCO 
An American computer security researcher has found what he says he believes is strong evidence of the digital fingerprints of Chinese authors in the software programs used in attacks against Google .
The search engine giant announced last Tuesday that it had experienced a series of Internet break - ins it believed were of Chinese origin .
The company ’s executives did not , however , detail the evidence leading them to the conclusion that the Chinese government was behind the attacks , beyond stating that e-mail accounts of several Chinese human rights activists had been compromised .
In the week since the announcement , several computer security companies have made claims supporting Google ’s suspicions , but the evidence has remained circumstantial .
Now , by analyzing the software used in the break - ins against Google and dozens of other companies , Joe Stewart , a malware specialist with SecureWorks , a computer security company based in Atlanta , said he determined the main program used in the attack contained a module based on an unusual algorithm from a Chinese technical paper that has been published exclusively on Chinese - language Web sites .

Most unfortunately for Charles Babbage , I just so happen to be such a person .
On to The Organist Part 2
Nooooooootes !!
So , Charles Babbage , he hated musicians .
Man , I have so many primary documents to attest to this important historical fact , I do n’t even know where to start .
I could demonstrate its ubiquity in popular culture , with a page from a random novel in which a Babbage - vs - organ - grinder skirmish comes with the stock report as a typical Times news story .
I could verify this with a “ Babbage ” search of the Times archive between 1855 and 1870 ( you ’ll have do DIY search , no permalink I ’m afraid ) .
Or maybe you ’d like your notes in the form of dramatic verse ?
Or if you ’re hardcore you could read the anti-street - music pamphlet by the most aptly named Mr MegaBass , “ Street Music in the Metropolis ” , featuring the immortal lines :
“ … we could scarcely vote for inflicting on [ Mr Babbage ] the smallest punishment , if he were with his own hands to hang a street musician every day . ”
Although that might be going a little far , basically the problem with street music could be summed up by this :
Fear not , upcoming episodes will feature extensive documentation of the legal , parliamentary , and popular - press coverage of Charles Babbage vs the street musicians .
.
The Encouragers of Street Music , and the Rude Patois by the way can be found , of course , in Babbage ’s autobiography .
The wires visible in the establishing shots are from Babbage ’s vision of messaging zip - lines as described in his Economy of Machines and Manufactures :
“ Perhaps if the steeples of churches , properly selected , were made use of , connecting them by a few intermediate stations with some great central building , as , for instance , with the top of St Paul’s ; and if a similar apparatus were placed on the top of each steeple , with a man to work it during the day , it might be possible to diminish the expense of the two - penny post , and make deliveries every half hour over the greater part of the metropolis . ”

On to The Organist Part 2
In the conclusion section of the article examining piracy of TweakGuides , the author puts forth his basic explanation on why Piracy happens and it basically boils down to “ People are immoral cheapskates ” which as far as the rest of his analysis goes is a strikingly shallow and one - sided explanation that simply reeks of his personal bias against piracy .
This is based on his frankly shallow correlation that because piracy still exists , even though things like Steam , demos , DRM and whatnot have tried to fight it , people pirate simply because they can .
If you are currently scratching your head on how on earth this follows from the premises , it does n’t .
The author does n’t even make the effort to explain why the persistence of piracy means that it ’s done because of people being cheapskates and not because the available options do not satisfy the demand as the piracy option does .
To this end , I ’m going to present a few reasons why piracy still persists and seemingly increases .
Starting with the mean reason of course which as you ’d expect is …
People Pirate because they can’t afford the games .
It ’s really not difficult to grasp the concept that there ’s poor people in the world .
It ’s also not difficult to grasp that because PCs are becoming increasingly necessary or useful during one ’s daily tasks , that one will be available for many middle and lower - middle class families .
Take places like India or China which have a very very large lower - class populace and yet their PC and internet use is increasing .
There ’s a lot of people with capacity to play games who ca n’t really afford them .
When one takes into account the price gouging that also happens between countries in the gaming market it ’s not difficult to understand how legal gaming is outside the budget of those capable of it .
So all those people , who ca n’t afford the games will still want to play them due to the extensive marketing campaigns around them .
And piracy provides this option .
Where piracy not an option , these would not become customers .
They would turn to something else .
This is like the most obvious realization one should be able to make about people who do not have a lot of disposable income really .
It is a fallacy of a monumental scale to claim that just because someone got the game for free , they would be willing to buy it if they could n’t .
The reason is simple , people try to find the games that are of the highest quality and within their capacity to buy them .
Let me repeat this :
People try to find games that are of the highest quality and within their capacity to buy them .
This means something very specific .
If one ’s highest quality game is prohibited due to price , they are simply going to go for the next best option .
If it ends up that the highest quality game they can afford is an indie game , they ’ll play that .
if it turns out that it ’s a free browser game , they ’ll play that instead .
At no point will their inability to pirate a game increase their capacity to buy them .
This means that even if piracy where to disappear overnight , the sales of PC games is unlikely to increase to any significant degree .
The end result ( companies not making as much profit as they think they deserve ) will really not change .
Are these people cheapskates if they get to enjoy something they would n’t be able to afford anyway ?
Are they cheapskates because they did n’t prioritize games over food , rent or necessary socializing ( eg going out for a beer with their friends ) ?
Only by the very tortured reasoning of very privileged people .
It ’s the kind of reasoning which assumes that everyone ’s situation is similar to one ’s own .
That everyone has similar opportunities as a middle - class US American .
That everyone certainly has enough money to buy their games but are just too cheap to do it .
It ’s simply ridiculous when you then see this reasoning used with a straight face to make an statement like this :
The purely self - serving nature of the arguments people use to justify piracy has become quite galling , and frankly is an insult to the collective intelligence of all internet users .
Whether you pirate games or not is ultimately none of my business , but at least have the decency to be honest with yourself and everyone else about the real reasons why you ’re doing it .
It almost sounds like a Theist who ’s confidently declaring that the only reason some people are Atheists is because they ’re angry at God .
And is as convincing .
People pirate because it ’s more convenient
If we move to those people who can afford to purchase some their games , it ’s quite common to discover that many still pirate because Piracy is still the better option .
Whereas a normal buy would require the whole issue of trekking to the shop , buying the game , wrangling with restrictive DRMs and whatnot .
Pirating can be done from the comfort of one ’s own house , usually within hours for the most popular games .
And if it ’s not obvious already , people value their comfort as well , especially when it ’s about a hobby .
This whole thing can easily be seen in many different ways .
Take Steam first of all .
In regards to the wealthier pirates , it is the primary reason for them becoming legitimate customers by giving them actual reasons to buy and making their service far more useful than a torrent download .
Automatic updates , free re-downloads ( at fast speeds ) , community / social networking services etc .
All of these make buying from Steam a higher convenience than simply getting it for free , and basically smashes the pathetic people - are - cheapskates argument of the author .
If people are willing to shell money for Steam even though there ’s a free alternative just around the corner , does n’t that make you rethink that argument ?
Or are those in Steam only the noble ones ?
Do n’t like the Steam example ?
Take good ol ’ CD Piracy which is still extremely popular in the poorer nations .
Why does this still exist when so people now have the capacity to either download the files directly or find someone who can ?
Even in the most of the poor areas of the world , you usually find internet stations with high - speed connections which can easily be used for people to download what they like .
How can CD / DVD
Piracy still be a million , if not billion - dollar industry ?
The answer again is convenience .
Amongst those who do not have a lot of money to spend on gaming , paying something like 4 $ is low enough of a price for avoiding tedious download periods , shady cracks and possibly non-working copies .
CD / DVD pirates know this and thus provide copies that are generally working out of the box pretty well , which is especially important in a word - of - mouth kind of job they work in .
Piracy is working so well against normal purchases because it provides some very good advantages other than price .
It allows people without credit cards to get their games online .
It provides quicker service ( not have to wait for weeks or even months to get the game in your own country ) .
It avoids having to mess with physical items or DRMs .
Services that wish to compete with Piracy for the people that can afford to purchase legally need to also hit on these points as well or alternatively provide other advantages to give people a reason to buy instead .
Services like Steam and Impulse understand this and the fact that they also drop their prices temporarily to grab all those without a big gaming budget as well does not harm either .
People pirate to avoid unnecessary restrictions or delays
Compared to the previous two reasons , this is a relatively minor cause and most often than not , it does not change the number of people who buy ( i.e. those who pirate for such a reason are likely to have already bought the game as well ) .
Still it does increase the number of perceived downloaded copies which is used by people like the Author to boost their anti-piracy arguments .
These are the people who download a game in order to be able to play it in an uncensored version ( with blood .
With sex etc ) .
If you consider how many countries , even rich ones like Germany , have ridiculously restrictive policies on this , it ’s not hard to understand how it matters .
I ’ve done it quite a few times on games I have legally bought , just because I hate having to play a lobotomized game because some politician listened to the puritan lobby .
Then there ’s those who ca n’t wait until companies get off their restrictive butts and release worldwide when the capacity exists .
Some ca n’t wait until the game is translated or censored first and just want to play with their friends ASAP .
Some know that the game is never going to be brought to their country because of ridiculous laws ( coughAustraliacough )
Most often than not , they end up buying the game when possible in order to get all the legal features as well .
People pirate on principle
While the author is quick to dismiss and belittle this attitude , it is not only true but getting stronger the more annoying the anti-piracy measures and lobby becomes .
People pirate to teach companies a lesson .
You see , price does not give a complete signal to the companies , when the number of copies sold for a particular game are low , the company has no idea what the reason was .
Perhaps the game was too bad .
Perhaps people did n’t have money in that period .
Perhaps it is because everyone ’s a cheapskate pirate .
And because companies do n’t know why the game did n’t sell as much as they expected ( or as much as they wished ) they cannot fix the issues with it .
However , when their customers explicitly and in very clear terms point out before - hand that they will refuse to buy the game if their favourite features are taken away ( dedicated servers , lan play etc ) or restrictive measures enforced ( eg heavy - handed DRM ) and the companies still go ahead and do it , how can they act surprised that their piracy rates skyrocket ?
If you notice the top pirated games of the last years , you notice the same trends .
Spore at the top of 2008 with its heavy DRM .
CoD:MW2 at 2009 with its lack of dedicated server support .
It ’s not difficult to imagine that many of those pirated copies were done as a punishment for the companies from people who refused to buy .
The more companies insist on going against their customer ’s wishes , the more those customers will refuse to deal with them and will go to the next best alternative .
And this is good .
Consumers have very small bargaining power compared to the megapublishers of games .
Thus by refusing to play the games at all , they punish themselves just as much .
Piracy provides the alternative which makes only the companies feel the pain of their bad management and provides a miniscule advantage ( in the grand scale of things ) back to the consumer .
And even that is usually not enough as hardcore gamers are enough of an addict to shell their money even when they swore they would n’t .
Thus the amazing success of MW2 , even with a severely lacking multiplayer and a hostile PC community .
Piracy , much like union funds or other social nets , provide a needed counterbalance to corporate power .
In Conclusion
Speaking from myself , as someone who wholeheartedly supports the existence of piracy while currently doing very little of it myself , I can easily fit in all of the reasons I provided above .
I was a heavy pirate when I was younger , poorer and without a job and this helped me actually develop a far better personality than I would have without it .
Once I started having some more money , I used cut down on piracy heavily , unless it was more convenient to do so and with the advent of Steam , even that was basically reduced to zero and any times I do it now , it ’s because I ’m trying to get around restrictive bullshit laws of the country I ’m in , for games I generally buy anyway .
I could probably list or expand on the reasons for piracy if I wanted to , but my main point was to show how amazingly short - sighted and downright insulting is the author ’s analysis for the motives of pirates .
It ’s an extremely black &white view of the issue of piracy which is a handy way to ignore the real reasons why it happens .
It ’s far easier to decide there ’s a good side and an evil side and those you do not like belong in the evil side .
It ’s like tribalism 101 .

Airline customers can face sizeable card - handling fees Budget airline Ryanair has been accused of being " puerile and childish " over its payment policy by business watchdog the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) .
OFT chief executive John Fingleton attacked the company for fees that Ryanair adds when customers use all but one type of credit card to pay online .
He told the Independent newspaper that the firm used a legal loophole to justify charging the extra fee .
Ryanair said their payment policy model allowed passengers " to avoid costs " .
The law says that if an airline offers at least one free payment method , it is allowed to advertise cheap fares that do not include extra credit card charges .
Mr Fingleton said Ryanair had chosen a rare payment method to get around the rules .
Currently , the airline only offers a free booking service to customers who pay for tickets with a Mastercard prepaid card .
According to Ryanair , compulsory fees and charges are included in all the airline 's advertised prices .
But Ryanair argues that payment handling fees are discretionary .
' Taunting consumers ' According to a BBC Money Box report in November , Ryanair charges £ 5 per person per flight , even if all the passengers are paid for on the one card , in a single transaction .
Mr Fingleton told the Independent newspaper : " Ryanair has this funny game where they have found some very low frequency payment mechanism and say : ' Well because you can pay with that ' .
" It 's almost like taunting consumers and pointing out : ' Oh well , we know this is completely outside the spirit of the law , but we think it 's within the narrow letter of the law ' . "
Ryanair is not for the overpaid John Fingletons of this world but for the everyday Joe Bloggs
Stephen McNamara , Ryanair
He added : " On some level it 's quite puerile - it 's almost childish . "
Mr Fingleton also questioned the automatic addition of insurance to flights by airlines such as Ryanair , unless customers opted out .
Ryanair disputes this claim , saying in a statement that its insurance services are purchased by customers on an opt - in not opt - out basis .
Ryanair Head of Communications Stephen McNamara said : " Ryanair is not for the overpaid John Fingletons of this world but for the everyday Joe Bloggs who opt for Ryanair 's guaranteed lowest fares because we give them the opportunity to fly across 26 European countries for free , £ 5 and £ 10 .
" What the OFT must realise is that passengers prefer Ryanair 's model as it allows them to avoid costs , such as baggage charges , which are still included in the high fares of high cost , fuel surcharging , strike - threatened airlines such as BA . "
According to the Money Box report , the UK Cards Association estimates for credit cards , banks charge airlines between 1.5 % to 2.5 % of a payment in transaction fees .
It believes it is significantly less than £ 1 to process a debit card transaction .
That means a family of four on a return journey paying on one debit card should pay about 30 p , if they were just covering the airline 's costs , but would be charged £ 40 by Ryanair .

Howard Zinn , historian and shipyard worker , civil rights activist and World War II bombardier , and author of “ A People ’s History of the United States , ” a best seller that inspired a generation of high school and college students to rethink American history , died Wednesday in Santa Monica , Calif .
He was 87 and lived in Auburndale , Mass .
The cause was a heart attack , which he had while swimming , his family said .
Proudly , unabashedly radical , with a mop of white hair and bushy eyebrows and an impish smile , Mr. Zinn , who retired from the history faculty at Boston University two decades ago , delighted in debating ideological foes , not the least his own college president , and in lancing what he considered platitudes , not the least that American history was a heroic march toward democracy .
Almost an oddity at first , with a printing of just 4,000 in 1980 , “ A People ’s History of the United States ” has sold nearly two million copies .
To describe it as a revisionist account is to risk understatement .
A conventional historical account held no allure ; he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of Christopher Columbus , the blood lust of Theodore Roosevelt and the racial failings of Abraham Lincoln .
He also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers , feminists , laborers and resisters of slavery and war .
Such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today ; they were not at the time .
“ Our nation had gone through an awful lot  the Vietnam War , civil rights , Watergate  yet the textbooks offered the same fundamental nationalist glorification of country , ” Mr. Zinn recalled in a recent interview with The New York Times .
“ I got the sense that people were hungry for a different , more honest take . ”
Criticising GM crops may land you in jail
expressbuzz.com | Feb 26 , 2010
by Imran Khan
BANGALORE : Criticising Genetically Modified ( GM ) products could land you in jail — if the draconian draft Biotechnology Regulatory Authority Bill ( BRAB ) of 2009 , which will be tabled in the current session of the parliament by the UPA government , is passed .
In an unprecedented muzzle on the right to freedom of speech of the citizen , Chapter 13 section 63 of the draft bill says , “ Whoever , without any evidence or scientific record misleads the public about the safety of the organisms and products … shall be punished with imprisonment for a term that shall not be less than six months but which may extend to one year and with fine which may extend to two lakh rupees or with both . ”
The BRAI Bill drafted by the department of bio-technology under the Ministry of Science and Technology comes on the heels of a moratorium on Bt Brinjal announced by the Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh .
“ What they are doing is much worse than what Hitler or Mussolini did .
Through this bill , they want to take absolute authority .
They are behaving like a vendor instead of a regulator , ” Pushpa M Bhargava , a member of the Supreme Court appointed Genetic Engineering Approval Committee ( GEAC ) said .
There are also other provisions in this bill which are disconcerting .
Article 27 ( 1 ) of the bill seeks to keep the information related to the research , approval and science of the GM Products out of the purview of the Right to Information ( RTI ) Act .
In other words , farmers , NGO ’s and Environmental groups that have been on the forefront of the campaign against BT Brinjal and other genetically modified crops , can longer obtain information about it .
Not only that , the three member experts of the Department of Biotechnology will override any existing legislation about GM technology in the states .
The draft bill also states that the BRAI will set up its own appellate tribunal which will have the jurisdiction to hear arguments on the issues concerning biotechnology .
In case of any disputes , petitioners can only approach the Supreme Court of India .
“ The BRAI bill is more draconian than what the nation faced during the Emergency ‘’ says Devinder Sharma , writer and Food Policy Analyst .
“ If the Bill was already in force , I would have been in jail .
Jairam Ramesh too would have been in jail for challenging the health and environmental claims of the company developing Bt Brinjal , ” he said .
The bill demonstrates the extraordinary hold the multinational companies have over the UPA government , he added .
Kavitha Kurugunti of Kheti Virasat Mission said that this bill is just a way to silence the voices who are opposed to GM technology .
Addiction of paleoclimate reconstructions to particular proxies has been a longstanding concern at Climate Audit .
One of the battleground issues has been the addiction to Briffa ’s Yamal tree ring series , while the nearby update of Polar Urals ( with a pronounced MWP ) was disappeared .
( See CA category . )
Just before Climategate , we raised questions about the Yamal reconstruction – noticing first that , contrary to prior belief , it was not “ highly replicated ” , having far fewer modern trees than is standard for an RCS reconstruction , and that the reconstruction was highly sensitive to inclusion of a nearby Schweingruber site ( Khadyta River , Yamal ) .
Briffa did not deny the validity of this criticism , instead attempting to salvage the reconstruction by adding in cores from some nearby sites ( but notably not Polar Urals . )
The elephant in the room remained the disposition of the Polar Urals site .
A 1995 Briffa reconstruction from this site purported to show that 1032 was the “ coldest ” year in the millennium .
Updated data had shown elevated ring widths in the MWP .
However , Briffa had n’t reported this .
( Schweingruber had archived the updated measurement data at the ITRDB , but no journal article had reported the results .
The Climategate Letters have a teaser here .
On April 28 , 2006 ( almost exactly the same date as I was being stonewalled about Yamal , Taymir and Tornetrask measurement data ) , Osborn emailed Philip Brohan of the UK Met Office :
To : philip.brohan@xxxxxxxxx.xxx
From : Tim Osborn
Subject : Re : Standardisation uncertainty for tree - ring series
Cc : Keith Briffa , simon.tett@xxxxxxxxx.xxx
Hi Philip ,
we have three “ groups ” of trees :
“ SCAND ” ( which includes the Tornetrask and Finland multi- millennial chronologies , but also some shorter chronologies from the same region ) .
… “ URALS ” ( which includes the Yamal and Polar Urals long chronologies , plus other shorter ones ) .
These fall mainly within these 3 boxes :
52.5E , 67.5N
62.5E , 62.5N ( note this is the only one not at 67.5N )
67.5E , 67.5N “ TAIMYR ” ( which includes the Taimyr long chronology , plus other shorter ones ) .
These fall mainly within these 4 boxes :
87.5E , 67.5N
102.5E , 67.5N
112.5E , 67.5N
122.5E , 67.5N
We do some analysis at the group scale , and for this we take the JJA temperatures from each box and average to the group scale to obtain a single series from each of SCAND ,
URALS and TAIMY .
We do some analysis at the overall scale , and for this we take these three group temperature series and average them to get an overall NW Eurasia temperature for boxes
with tree chronologies in them …
So on this occasion , the long Polar Urals chronology , together with other “ shorter ” chronologies ( presumably the Schweingruber chronologies that Gavin Schmidt condemned ) were included in a larger regional RCS reconstruction – something that Rob Wilson would have been interested in seeing .
But the subsequent Briffa et al ( 2008 Phil Trans B ) only includes the very small Yamal data – without the long Polar Urals chronology or the shorter chronologies .
Wonder why ?
Echangeurs , lotissements , zones commerciales , alignements de ronds - points …
Depuis les années 60 , la ville s’est mise à dévorer la campagne .
Une fatalité ?
Non : le résultat de choix politiques et économiques .
Historique illustré de ces métastases pé­riurbaines .
Un gros bourg et des fermes perdues dans le bocage , des murs de granit , des toits d'ardoise , des tas de foin , des vaches ...
Et pour rejoindre Brest , à quelques kilomètres au sud , une bonne route départementale goudronnée .
C'était ça , Gouesnou , pendant des décennies , un paysage quasi immuable .
Jean - Marc voit le jour dans la ferme de ses parents en 1963 .
Il a 5 ans lorsqu'un gars de Brest , Jean Cam , a l'idée bizarre d'installer en plein champ un drôle de magasin en parpaing et en tôle qu'il appelle Rallye .
Quatre ans plus tard , les élus créent un peu plus au nord , à Kergaradec , un proto­­type , une ZAC , « zone d'aménagement concerté » : les hangars y poussent un par un .
Un hypermarché Leclerc s'installe au bout de la nouvelle voie express qui se cons­truit par tronçons entre Brest et Rennes .
Puis viennent La Hutte , Conforama et les meubles Jean Richou ... 300 hectares de terre fertile disparaissent sous le bitume des parkings et des rocades .
Quelques maisons se retrouvent enclavées çà et là .
La départementale devient une belle quatre - voies sur laquelle filent à vive allure R16 , 504 et Ami 8 .
Un quartier chic voit le jour , toujours en pleine nature , qui porte un nom de rêve : la Vallée verte ...
C'est à ce moment - là que ça s'est compliqué pour les parents de Jean - Marc .
Avec l'élargissement de la départementale , ils sont expropriés d'un bon bout de terrain et ne peuvent plus emmener leurs vaches de l'autre côté de la quatre - voies .
Ils s'adaptent tant bien que mal , confectionnent des produits laitiers pour le centre Leclerc , avant de se reconvertir : la jolie ferme Quentel est au­jourd ' hui une des salles de réception les plus courues de Bretagne .
Les fermes voisines deviennent gîte rural ou centre équestre .
La Vallée verte , elle , se retrouve cernée de rangées de pavillons moins chics : « Nous , on a eu de la chance , grâce à la proximité de l'aéroport , les terres tout autour de la ferme sont restées inconstructibles .
» Aujourd 'hui , quand il quitte son bout de verdure préservé pour aller à Brest , Jean - Marc contourne juste la zone de Kergaradec , tellement il trouve ça moche : « C'est à qui fera le plus grand panneau , rajoutera le plus de fanions .
Comme si tout le monde hurlait en même temps ses messages publicitaires . »

Ça s'est passé près de chez Jean - Marc , à Brest , mais aussi près de chez nous , près de chez vous , à Marseille , Toulouse , Lyon , Metz ou Lille , puis aux abords des villes moyennes , et désormais des plus petites .
Avec un formidable coup d'accélérateur depuis les années 1982 - 1983 et les lois de décentralisation Defferre .
Partout , la même trilogie – infrastructures routières , zones commerciales , lotissements – concourt à l'étalement urbain le plus spectaculaire d'Europe : tous les dix ans , l'équivalent d'un département français disparaît sous le béton , le bitume , les panneaux , la tôle .
Il n'y a rien à comprendre , a - t - on jugé pendant des années , juste à prendre acte de la modernité à l'œuvre , une sorte de chaos naturel et spontané , prix à payer pour la « croissance » de notre bien - être matériel .
Les élites intellectuelles de ce pays oscillent entre répulsion ( « c'est moche , les entrées de ville » ) , fascination ( « vive le chaos , ça fait Wim Wenders ! ») et indifférence : elles habitent en centre - ville ...
Rien à comprendre , vraiment ?
En 2003 , l'architecte urbaniste David Man­gin prend le temps d'y réfléchir quelques mois et sort un an plus tard son formidable bouquin , La Ville franchisée , qui reste l'analyse la plus pertinente des métastases pé­riurbaines .
Il faut en finir , dit Mangin , avec l'idée que ce « chaos sort de terre tout seul » .
Il résulte au contraire « de rapports de forces politiques , de visions idéologiques , de cultures techniques ».
Lorsque apparaissent les premiers supermarchés , au début des années 60 , la France ne compte que 200 kilomètres d'autoroutes , un morceau de périphérique parisien , aucune autre rocade , pas le moin­dre rond - point ... et un architecte - urbaniste visionnaire , Le Corbusier !
Celui - ci a compris très tôt l'hégémonie à venir de la voiture , à laquelle il est favorable .
Dès 1933 , avec des confrères qu'il a réunis à Athènes , il a imaginé de découper les villes de fa­çon rationnelle , en quatre zones cor­respondant à quatre « fonctions » : la vie , le travail , les loisirs et les infrastructures routières .
L'Etat s'empare de l'idée , on entre dans l'ère des « zones » , ZUP , ZAC , etc. ( 1 ) Et puis il faut « rattraper » l 'Allemagne et son insolent réseau d'autoroutes !
Du pain bénit pour notre illustre corps d'ingénieurs des Ponts et Chaussées .
La France inscrit dans la loi ( loi Pasqua , 1998 ) que tout citoyen doit se trouver à moins de quarante - cinq minutes d'une entrée ou d'une sortie d'autoroute !
Des itinéraires de contournement des villes sont construits , le territoire se couvre d'échangeurs , de bre­telles et de rocades .
Vingt ans plus tard , les enfilades de ronds - points à l'anglaise , trop nombreux et trop grands , parachèvent le travail : ils jouent , constate Mangin , « le rôle de diffuseurs de l'étalement dans le nouveau Meccano urbain qui se met en place » .

L’empire du hangar
Ceux qui ont vite compris le potentiel que leur of frait ce quadrillage de bitume – foncier pas cher et abondant , accessibilité et visibilité formidables – , ce sont les nouveaux opérateurs du commerce .
Ils s'appellent Leclerc en Bretagne , Auchan dans le Nord , Casino dans la région stéphanoise .
Leur stratégie : se faire connaître sur leur terroir d'origine , saturer un territoire pour étouffer la concurrence , puis s'étendre à d'autres régions .
« Localisations et accès sont repérés et négociés en amont , explique Mangin , auprès des propriétaires privés , des élus , des aménageurs de ZAC et des directions départemen­tales de l'Equipement .
» Conçus à l'américaine – « no parking , no business » – , les hypermarchés raisonnent en termes de « flux » de voitures et de « zones de chalandise » : ils com­mencent par aspirer les consommateurs des centres - villes en attendant que les lotissements viennent boucher les trous du maillage routier ...
Aujourd 'hui , la France , championne mondiale de la grande distribution – elle exporte son glorieux modèle jusqu 'en Chine – compte 1 400 hypermarchés ( de plus de 2 500 mètres carrés ) et 8 000 supermarchés ...
Et pour quel bilan !
«
En cassant les prix sur quelques rares mais symbo­liques produits , les grandes surfaces se sont enrichies en ruinant les pompes à essence , les commerces de bouche , les drogueries , les quincailleries , des milliers de commerces indépendants spécialisés ou de proximité , des milliers d'artisans , et même des milliers de producteurs et fournisseurs .
Les résultats sont objectivement inacceptables .
Avec , en plus , des prix supérieurs à ceux de nos voisins eu­ropéens ! »
Ce n'est pas un dangereux contestataire qui dresse ce constat , mais Jean - Paul Charié , député UMP du Loiret ( hélas décédé en novembre dernier ) , dans un rapport sur l'urbanisme commercial rédigé en mars 2009 .
La logique des grandes surfaces a vidé les centres - villes de leurs commerces , a favorisé la malbouffe , contraint de nombreuses entrepri­ses à délocaliser .
Elle a fabriqué des emplois précaires et des chômeurs .
C'est une spécificité très française – 70 % du chiffre d'affaires commercial est réalisé en périphérie des villes , contre 30 % en Allemagne .
L'homme le plus riche de France ?
Gérard Mulliez , fondateur du groupe familial Auchan .
Une nébuleuse d'entreprises dont le poids estimé en fait le premier annonceur publicitaire et le troisième employeur du pays .
Difficile de résister à son influence , ou à celle des Leclerc , Carrefour , Intermarché , aménageurs en chef de l'Hexagone .
Jusqu'à la loi de modernisation de l'économie votée en 2008 , l'implantation des grandes surfaces n'était d'ailleurs pas soumise au droit de l'urbanisme , mais au seul droit commercial .
Aucune règle n'était édictée quant à la forme ou à l'aspect des bâtiments , seule la surface comptait , donnant lieu à des marchandages peu re­luisants avec les élus : laisse - moi construire mon supermarché , je financerai ton club sportif ...
« L'aménagement du territoire soumis aux puissances financières débouche toujours sur des effets pervers , poursuit le rapport Charié .
Comment un élu peut - il facilement refuser un projet parasite si c'est par ailleurs une source de financement pour le budget communal ? »
A fortiori s'il est maire d'une petite ville , désormais en première ligne .
Car l'hypermarché de première génération s'est « fractionné ».
Decathlon , Norauto , Leroy - Merlin , Kiabi , Cultura ... c'est aussi le groupe Auchan !
Autant de MSS ( moyennes surfaces spécialisées ) qui investissent de nouvelles petites ZAC , où McDonald 's côtoie désormais Biocoop ...
Pas un bourg qui n'accueille le visiteur par un bazar bariolé : «
C'est partout le même alignement de cubes et de parallélé­pipèdes en tôle ondulée , le même pullulement de pancartes et d'enseignes » , se désole Jean - Pierre Sueur , sénateur socialiste du même Loiret , qui a déposé une proposition de loi à l'automne dernier .
Son objectif : que « tous les documents d'urbanisme assurent la qualité urbaine , architecturale et paysagère des entrées de ville » .
Plein de bonnes idées , le texte a été adopté il y a deux mois par la majorité sénatoriale UMP , qui l'a vidé de sa substance – plus aucune mesure contraignante .

Le rêve pavillonnaire
Tandis que nos compatriotes s'accoutumaient à naviguer le week - end d'un parking à l'autre , les quartiers pavillonnaires ont fleuri .
Il faut dire qu'ils n'ont pas vraiment eu d'autre choix , les Français , face à une crise du logement qui sévit depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale .
Alors que la population du pays était stable depuis le milieu du XIXe siècle – 40 millions d'habitants – , le baby - boom , l'accélération de l'exode rural , le recours à l'immigration puis l'arrivée des rapatriés d'Algérie changent la donne : il faut construire , vite , pour éradiquer les taudis urbains .
Ce sera , pendant vingt ans , la politique des grands ensembles , à laquelle la circulaire Guichard de 1973 met brutalement fin .
Place au rêve pavillonnaire !
Certes , dans les années 20 , les débuts de l'exode rural avaient donné naissance aux premiers lotissements – les fameux pavillons Loucheur des faubourgs parisiens .
Mais cette fois , on change d'échelle .
Rêve de tous les Français , le pavillon ?
C'est ce que serinent , depuis Valéry Giscard d'Estaing , tous les gouvernements , qui appuient leur politique sur le rejet des grands ensembles et sur « notre mémoire rurale » – souvenons - nous de l'affiche bucolique de François Mitterrand en 1981 , la force tranquille du clocher .
« Pourtant , le pavillon , c'est avant tout un choix contraint » , constate David Mangin .
Les centres - villes étant devenus inabordables , les familles pas très riches – elles sont la grande majorité – sont condamnées à l'exil périurbain .
Et elles le resteront tant que manquera une bonne offre résidentielle collective .
Alors , comme l'a observé l'urbaniste Bruno Fortier , « on tartine du lotissement au kilomètre » , c'est facile et pas cher .
Conçue par un promoteur - constructeur , la maison est un « produit » , à commander sur catalogue .
Où que l'on aille , le marché ne sait fournir que des lotissements avec des rues « en raquette » , des parcelles de même taille , des maisons posées sur leur sous - sol de béton ; tant pis pour le raccord visuel avec la ville ancienne .
Les plantes des jardins sont achetées en promotion à la jardinerie du coin ; tant pis pour la flore locale et le paysage .
La puissance publique y met du sien : incapable d'assurer la con­tinuité urbaine , elle croit compenser en imposant les règles draconiennes des Plans locaux d'urbanisme ( PLU ) .
Les Directions départementales de l'Equipement ( DDE ) imposent leurs normes , et les architectes des Bâtiments de France ( ABF ) homogénéisent à coups de pastiches régionalistes .
Allez essayer de construire une maison en bois ou un peu personnalisée dans un lotissement !
«
Les gens qui essaient se font flinguer , dit David Mangin .
Ils doivent s'expliquer avec le maire , déposer trois permis , il y a des recours ...
Ils sont découragés . »

Les dégâts de la décentralisation
« Pendant très longtemps l'urbanisme a été une affaire d'Etat en France » , rappelle Thierry Paquot , philosophe de l'urbain et éditeur de la revue Urbanisme .
Mais , à partir des années 80 , les gouvernements , de droite ou de gauche , ont délégué à d'autres la fabrication de la ville .
L'Etat s'est mis au service du privé : «
Le meilleur exemple , c'est Laurent Fabius , qui " offre " à Eurodisney une ligne de RER que les habitants de Marne - la - Vallée réclamaient sans succès depuis des années ! »
En 1983 , les lois de décentralisation donnent tout pouvoir aux maires en matière de permis de construire « et la catastrophe commence , estime Thierry Paquot .
La plupart des élus sont totalement incompétents en matière d'urbanisme , et de plus ont un goût exécrable » .
Ils se reposent sur les promoteurs pour produire du clés en main .
« L'habitat se banalise et conduit à cette
France moche qui nie totalement l'esprit des lieux . »
Frédéric Bonnet , architecte - conseil de l'Etat en Haute - Vienne , confirme : «
Dans un rayon de 40 kilomètres autour de Limoges , tous les villages ont construit dix , quinze , vingt maisons pour des habitants qui ne se rendent jamais dans le centre - bourg , puisqu'ils travaillent tous ... à Limoges . »
Le mécanisme est simple : pour lutter contre l'exode rural , pour éviter la fermeture de l'école , la commune fait construire un lotissement , qui amène de nouveaux arrivants .
Mais les enfants scolarisés grandissent et s'en vont .
Il faut créer un second lotissement pour attirer de nouvelles familles .
C'est la fuite en avant .
Le mitage du paysage est renforcé par la spéculation foncière .
Difficile pour le maire d'une petite commune de refuser à des voisins agri­culteurs la constructibilité sachant que le prix du terrain à lotir est alors multiplié par dix ou vingt .
Et voilà comment la France consomme pour son « urbanisation » deux fois plus de terres agricoles que l'Allemagne : «
Il faut en finir avec la politique urbaine coordonnée au niveau de la commune , ce n'est pas la bonne échelle » , conclut Frédéric Bonnet .
Un développement pas durable
L'urbanisme raconte ce que nous sommes .
Le Moyen
Age a eu ses villes fortifiées et ses cathédrales , le XIXe siècle ses boulevards et ses lycées .
Nous avons nos hangars commerciaux et nos lotissements .
Les pare - brise de nos voitures sont des écrans de télévision , et nos villes ressemblent à une soirée sur TF1 : un long tunnel de publicité ( la zone commerciale et ses pancartes ) suivi d'une émission guimauve ( le centre muséifié ) .
Cette périurbanisation vorace s'opère en silence – les revues d'architecture l'ignorent .
Elle a été peu visitée par le roman , le documentaire ou la fiction .
Aux Etats - Unis , des films comme American Beauty , la série Desperate Housewives ont raconté l'ennui qui suinte des quartiers pavillonnaires .
En France , il manque un Balzac contemporain pour décrire la comédie urbaine .
« La ville n'est pas objet de débat , analyse Annie Fourcaut , historienne de la vie citadine .
On débat de l'école , pas de la ville , sans voir que la secon­de conditionne la première .
Peut - être parce que les Français ne sont pas un peuple urbain .
Il a fallu attendre 1931 pour que la population des villes égale celle des campagnes , des décennies après les Anglais et les Allemands . »
Alors , il n'y aurait pas d'autre modèle de vie que celui qui consiste à prendre sa voiture tous les matins pour faire des kilomètres jusqu'à son travail , par des routes saturées et des ronds - points engorgés , pour revenir le soir dans sa maison après être allé faire le plein chez Carrefour ?
« L'inflexion , sur le plan des idées , a commencé , se réjouit Bruno Fortier .
Depuis trois ou quatre ans , tout le monde dit : on arrête les conneries , on se calme , on redensi­fie , on réurbanise intelligemment , on cesse de dévorer les terrains agri­coles ...
Mais fabriquer un urbanisme plus évolué , avec un rapport à la nature plus riche , comme ce que l'on voit aux Pays - Bas , au Danemark ou en Allemagne , ça va coûter un peu plus cher ! »

L'impératif écologique supplantera -t - il l'impéritie politique ?
Durant l'été 2008 , quand le prix de l'essence s'est envolé , le chiffre d'affaires de certaines zones commerciales s'est effondré .
Affolés , les habitants des lotissements ont réclamé des lignes de bus à leur maire .
« Depuis la fin des grands ensembles , la France n'avait plus de projet urbain collectif , rappelle Annie Fourcaut .
Le développement durable pourrait en cons­tituer un . »
Alors rêvons un instant à ce que pourrait être une « ville passante » , comme l'appelle David Mangin , une ville désintoxiquée de la voiture , désenclavée , oublieuse des artères qui segmentent et des zones privatisées et sécurisées , une ville de faubourgs dont les fonctions – habitat , travail , commerce , loisirs – seraient à nouveau mélangées , une ville hybride , métissée , où chacun mettrait un peu du sien ...
Trop tard ?
WHISTLER , British Columbia —
Just as he was about to descend into history , Steven Holcomb did his signature shuffle - and - step move called the “ Holcy Dance . ”
A little more than a mile later the dance looked golden .
On a foggy Saturday at the Whistler Sliding Centre , Holcomb and his three - man crew ended a 62 - year drought for American bobsledders , winning the gold medal by a whopping 0.38 of a second over German legend Andre Lange .
The 240 - pound pilot who looks like a character in a “ Saturday Night Live ” skit when squeezing into his skintight racing suit delivered on expectations in the sled nicknamed “ The Night Train . ”
The victory helped assure the United States of setting the record for the most medals won by a nation at a Winter Olympics .
“ It took me five Olympics just to get a bronze , ” said U.S. coach Brian Shimer , who once had Holcomb as a pusher .
“ And here he is in his second to get a gold . ”
Crewman Steve Mesler from Buffalo , N.Y. , sounded emotionally wrought when it ended .
While zooming through the final of four runs at a track that has had safety issues , Mesler was aware of his surroundings .
“ I actually heard the crowd for the first time in years , ” he said .
“ It ’s the first time I ’ve heard cow bells in the middle of the track .
Just thinking about the last 20 years of my life and not even grasping the fact that this is going to happen when we cross that line . ”
The man who drove across the line has had one of the most emotional journeys to get there .
Holcomb did n’t expect to be in this position in 2000 after contracting keratoconus , an eye disease that causes blurred vision .
In 2008 , he had a contact lens inserted behind his iris .
He saw the track clearly in his four runs this weekend .
And he never flinched .
Holcomb , 29 , sounded relaxed throughout , saying Lange had all the pressure in his final Olympics .
“ I still think Andre was the hunted , ” said Holcomb , the defending world champion .
“ He wanted to win double gold again .
He wanted to go out with a bang .
After his two - man showing , he was on fire . ”
Lange lost his first Olympics race after winning four gold medals .
Lange ’s final heat was fast enough to slip past Canada ’s Lyndon Rush by 0.01 of a second , leading to a German celebration at the finish line .
They knew as much as anyone that a day of warm , rainy weather that made the track slow was Holcomb’s .
The last U.S. bobsled four - man gold came in 1948 , when Patrick Henry Martin drove to victory in St Moritz .
Holcomb was quick to explain that the gold medal was a culmination of the right equipment , teammates and coaching .
The United States has developed some of the world ’s best sleds through the Bo- Dyn Project , which started in 1992 when NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine learned that U.S. bobsledders competed with European - made sleds .
The NASCAR technology drove U.S. bobsledding ’s gradual success .
But just as important for Holcomb were teammates Justin Olsen , Curt Tomasevicz and Mesler .
“ You ca n’t do it alone , ” Shimer said .
All the Americans , however , pointed to Holcomb as the difference in Whistler .
Shimer , his coach and former teammate , recalled talking to Holcomb about almost quitting the sport because of his eyes .
“ Early on and not even knowing what he was going through , he had to learn to drive by feel , ” Shimer said .
“ That ’s carried on through .
It ’s brought a huge talent out in a bobsledder that I thought could happen .
“ He gets into survival mode .
He feels his way through it and does it quickly . ”
Holcomb wasted just as little time talking about the 2014 Olympics in Sochi , Russia .
“ I ’m a lifer , ” he said .
“ I do n’t plan on going anywhere .
Hopefully I ’ll be up there with Andre Lange , 37 , 38 , years old , doing this .
“ How can I give it up ? ”
Pretty tough when you ’re on top of the world .

" This is part of trying to grow and pay fighters more .
To be able to put on bigger events , sign new fighters . "
- Reed Haris
I spoke yesterday with WEC General Manager Reed Harris about his organization 's first scheduled PPV event .
I wanted to know why the timing was made for April , how the decision to move forward was calculated , what the WEC feels are compelling reasons to make WEC 48 a PPV card , why the price point was made at $ 44.95 and more .
Here are the early details :
1 . The date was selected in part to nail down the Sacramento venue .
With their most financially lucrative star in Urijah Faber headlining for a title in the main event , it only makes sense to ensure the crowd will be as loud , thick and MMA - savvy as possible .
Sacramento has historically shown to be hugely favorable territory for the WEC .
2. According to Harris , their planning of an April 24th show did not take into account any potential Strikeforce plans to also host a Fedor Emelianenko - headlined fight in April .
3 . The decision to move forward with a PPV was done by WEC brass in conjunction with UFC President Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta .
The logic , as it was explained to me , was that with two title fights and a card filled with highly - ranked , pound - for - pound greats , the card merited moving in that direction .
" With five fights and two titles on the line , they feel upstairs that we are the same caliber and quality as UFC events , " said Harris .
4 . As for the price point , the decision to place the cost at $ 44.95 " was made corporately " .
Harris insists extensive research was done into PPV watching and purchasing habits .
He argues the internal data they received gives them the confidence to move forward with the PPV effort , but did not elaborate beyond that .
He also insisted given what the event offered , it was worth the cost of a UFC PPV .
5 . Here 's a clever twist : the event will be known as " UFC Presents ... WEC 48 : Aldo vs. Faber " .
When asked about the extent to which the UFC would use their marketing and PR muscle to assist the WEC , assurances were made that both organizations would work together to properly promote and cross promote the effort .
No specific details were offered as to promotional events , branding , event signage or other items at the time of the call .
6 . As for initial goals about what kind of buyrate they 're expecting , Harris acknowledged the WEC internally has benchmarks in mind , but would not disclose those figures .
7. Harris reminded me that the free shows on Versus would not be going away , but that " We've [ the WEC ] been providing free shows for ten years now " .
8 . Just like normal UFC PPVs , provided there is time permitting , under card fights will be shown on the main broadcast .
Again , the key takeaway for me from my conversation with Harris was less about whether the MMA or PPV market was cluttered ( although I 'm sure it was factored in ) and more about an internal look at what the WEC needed to do to make the next step in its evolution .
The first foray into PPV is never going to be without issues or challenges , but the WEC believes there is enough going in its favor with the availability of talent , the sellability of the card given the talent , the location of a suitable venue and the meaningfulness of two title fights to warrant the leap .
Harris also made a point to put the ball in the court of MMA fans .
" We hear a lot of people talk about how they want the sport to grow , " said Harris .
" If the fans support this , there could be a second company producing events as we are .
It could really allow the sport to grow . "
While the MMA community has often wandered into discussions about Zuffa or UFC revenue sharing percentages relative to other sports leagues , the WEC 's clear contention is that for purses and WEC visibility to increase - remember : " This is part of trying to grow and pay fighters more , to be able to put on bigger events , sign new fighters " - the fans have something of a responsibility to support this effort .
The WEC clearly believes it 's offering a valuable product and is n't drawing a line in the sand inasmuch as they are issuing a call to action .

EFRAT , West Bank 
The Israeli police made their first arrests on Wednesday as part of the state ’s effort to enforce a temporary construction freeze in Jewish settlements in the West Bank , briefly detaining the mayor of a settler council and at least two Jewish protesters .
Both sides are trying hard to show how determined they are  the state in enforcing the moratorium , and the settlers in thwarting the state ’s plans .
The recent decision by the Israeli government to prohibit new housing starts in the settlements for 10 months was meant to help the Obama administration ’s efforts to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations .
So far , it has succeeded only in pitting the settlers against the state .
The Palestinians have refused to return to the talks , saying the building moratorium is insufficient because it does not include East Jerusalem , which they hope will be the capital of a future state , and because it allows for the completion of settler homes where construction has already begun .
The settlers , however , view the pause as a grave threat .
Scuffles have broken out in the past two days at numerous settlements as residents have tried to block inspectors sent by the Israeli Defense Ministry from reaching construction sites and handing out stop - work orders .
The top members of the settler leadership gathered Wednesday in the settlement of Efrat , in the Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem , and poured concrete foundations for a new synagogue in defiance of the ban .
TOKYO - It ’s been a humbling few days for Japan .
Toyota , the nation ’s largest company , announced vehicle recalls on three continents and shut down five assembly plants in the United States , and its president told the world , “ We ’re extremely sorry . ’’
Standard & Poor ’s threatened to downgrade the Japanese government ’s credit rating because Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama is moving too slowly to reduce the debt .
And China overtook Japan as the largest maker of cars , according to an announcement from the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association .
The triple whammy of manufacturing and fiscal problems is a harbinger of what Japan faces in the coming years as its listless economy slips into an era of reckoning and national loss of face .
Within a year , Japan will probably lose to China its longtime status as the world ’s second - largest economy .
It is also expected to descend into the uncharted waters of public indebtedness as government debt swells to double the size of the country ’s gross domestic product .
Although the alarming headlines grabbed the public ’s attention , Japan ’s most fundamental economic ills have not .
Like distant melting glaciers , they have not alarmed voters , mobilized lawmakers , or triggered a national emergency response .
“ I do think the current situation is quite doomed , but Japan does not yet have a sense of crisis , ’’ said Hiroko Ogiwara , an economic commentator and author of popular money management books .
The building blocks of Japan ’s future are collapsing , in the view of many economists .
Japan has fewer children and more senior citizens as a percentage of its population than any country in recorded history , but the government does little to encourage childbirth or enable immigration .
Even as the working - age population shrinks , only a third of Japanese women stay on in the workforce after having a child , compared with about two - thirds of women in the United States .
“ The current direction is clearly unsustainable , and something has to be done , ’’ said Takatoshi Ito , a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo .

How much are we willing to give up to get security ?
After the terror attacks on 9/11 the term coined to describe how life had changed for Americans , and indeed the world , was “ The New Normal ” .
This new paradigm brought us a dramatically expanded FISA and The Patriot Act that forever changed how we see the world and even how we interpret our own Constitution .
Recent terrorist attacks by Al Queda , both successful and unsuccessful , on U.S. interests have prompted a renewal of calls for tighter security measures and “ profiling ” of the traveling public as well as demands to halt the GITMO base closure .
Is this just an overreaction to recent events meant to mollify the public ?
“ Too little too late ” measures from a balky Federal bureaucracy ?
Are the inmates ( terrorists ) one step ahead of the wardens ?
Is this the beginning of the “ New ” New normal ?
We need to be in on this discussion and not just casual observors .
So what ’s ahead , and are we willing to yield more of our civil liberties to help bolster our security ?
Get ready , because we ’re going to see more and more stories like these in the days to come and this issue is not going away :
Watch list grows as extra airline screening begins
Jan 4 –WASHINGTON
( AP ) —
The names of dozens more people have been added to the government ’s terrorist watch list and no-fly list after a failed terrorist attack on Christmas prompted U.S. officials to closely scrutinize a large database of suspected terrorists , an intelligence official said Monday .
People on the watch list get additional checking before they are allowed to enter this country ; those on the no-fly list are barred from boarding aircraft in or headed for the United States .

For most people , conserving energy means turning off lights in empty rooms .
But for the researchers at Bell Labs , the massive energy savings lurk in the 1's and 0's of the code that regulates the Internet .
Based on a new study from the lab , communications networks could use 99 percent less energy with only a few simple code changes .
Bell Labs also estimates that those savings would prevent the emission of 300 million tons of carbon .
MOSCOW — Even in Russia , the recent blizzards that have hit Washington have been noticed .
Though not always sympathetically .
Were Congress and other powerful institutions really closed , not to mention the schools ?
Did panicked residents actually strip stores of food , making the bare shelves resemble something from the Soviet era ?
All because of the snow ?
Russia , mindful that it trails the United States in many measures , tends to leap at any chance to promote its supremacy , and when it comes to wintry hardiness , there is , of course , no contest .
This is one cold war that Russia wins .
In their reports sent home , Russian journalists in Washington seemed to have a hard time suppressing their grins .
Mikhail Solodovnikov of Russian state television did his segment wandering outside the Capitol without a hat , as if to demonstrate how positively temperate the place was .
( It is practically against the law in Moscow to venture outside hatless in February . )
“ Political life is dead , ” Mr. Solodovnikov told his viewers .
“ News about the weather totally displaces news about anything else happening in the world .
As if this is a tornado or a hurricane , and not just simply snow . ”

In December , Facebook made a series of bold and controversial changes regarding the nature of its users ' privacy on the social networking site .
The company once known for protecting privacy to the point of exclusivity ( it began its days as a network for college kids only - no one else even had access ) , now seemingly wants to compete with more open social networks like the microblogging media darling Twitter .
Those of you who edited your privacy settings prior to December 's change have nothing to worry about - that is , assuming you elected to keep your personalized settings when prompted by Facebook 's " transition tool . "
The tool , a dialog box explaining the changes , appeared at the top of Facebook homepages this past month with its own selection of recommended settings .
Unfortunately , most Facebook users likely opted for the recommended settings without really understanding what they were agreeing to .
If you did so , you may now be surprised to find that you inadvertently gave Facebook the right to publicize your private information including status updates , photos , and shared links .
Want to change things back ?
Read on to find out how .
1. Who Can See The Things You Share ( Status Updates , Photo , Videos , etc. )
Probably the most critical of the " privacy " changes ( yes , we mean those quotes sarcastically ) was the change made to status updates .
Although there 's now a button beneath the status update field that lets you select who can view any particular update , the new Facebook default for this setting is " Everyone . "
And by everyone , they mean everyone .
If you accepted the new recommended settings then you voluntarily gave Facebook the right to share the information about the items you post with any user or application on the site .
Depending on your search settings , you may have also given Facebook the right to share that information with search engines , too .
To change this setting back to something of a more private nature , do the following :
From your Profile page , hover your mouse over the Settings menu at the top right and click " Privacy Settings " from the list that appears .
Click " Profile Information " from the list of choices on the next page .
Scroll down to the setting " Posts by Me . "
This encompasses anything you post , including status updates , links , notes , photos , and videos .
Change this setting using the drop - down box on the right .
We recommend the " Only Friends " setting to ensure that only those people you 've specifically added as a friend on the network can see the things you post .
2. Who Can See Your Personal Info
Facebook has a section of your profile called " personal info , " but it only includes your interests , activities , and favorites .
Other arguably more personal information is not encompassed by the " personal info " setting on Facebook 's Privacy Settings page .
That other information includes things like your birthday , your religious and political views , and your relationship status .
After last month 's privacy changes , Facebook set the new defaults for this other information to viewable by either " Everyone " ( for family and relationships , aka relationship status ) or to " Friends of Friends " ( birthday , religious and political views ) .
Depending on your own preferences , you can update each of these fields as you see fit .
However , we would bet that many will want to set these to " Only Friends " as well .
To do so :
From your Profile page , hover your mouse over the Settings menu at the top right and click " Privacy Settings " from the list that appears .
Click " Profile Information " from the list of choices on the next page .
The third , fourth , and fifth item listed on this page are as follows : " birthday , " " religious and political views , " and " family and relationship . "
Locking down birthday to " Only Friends " is wise here , especially considering information such as this is often used in identity theft .
Depending on your own personal preferences , you may or may not feel comfortable sharing your relationship status and religious and political views with complete strangers .
And keep in mind , any setting besides " Only Friends " is just that - a stranger .
While " Friends of Friends " sounds innocuous enough , it refers to everyone your friends have added as friends , a large group containing hundreds if not thousands of people you do n't know .
All it takes is one less - than - selective friend in your network to give an unsavory person access to this information .
3. What Google Can See - Keep Your Data Off the Search Engines
When you visit Facebook 's Search Settings page , a warning message pops up .
Apparently , Facebook wants to clear the air about what info is being indexed by Google .
The message reads :
There have been misleading rumors recently about Facebook indexing all your information on Google .
This is not true .
Facebook created public search listings in 2007 to enable people to search for your name and see a link to your Facebook profile .
They will still only see a basic set of information .
While that may be true to a point , the second setting listed on this Search Settings page refers to exactly what you 're allowing Google to index .
If the box next to " Allow " is checked , you 're giving search engines the ability to access and index any information you 've marked as visible by " Everyone . "
As you can see from the settings discussed above , if you had not made some changes to certain fields , you would be sharing quite a bit with the search engines ... probably more information than you were comfortable with .
To keep your data private and out of the search engines , do the following :
From your Profile page , hover your mouse over the Settings menu at the top right and click " Privacy Settings " from the list that appears .
Click " Search " from the list of choices on the next page .
Click " Close " on the pop -up message that appears .
On this page , uncheck the box labeled " Allow " next to the second setting " Public Search Results . "
That keeps all your publicly shared information ( items set to viewable by " Everyone " ) out of the search engines .
If you want to see what the end result looks like , click the " see preview " link in blue underneath this setting .
Take 5 Minutes to Protect Your Privacy
While these three settings are , in our opinion , the most critical , they 're by no means the only privacy settings worth a look .
In a previous article ( written prior to December 's changes , so now out - of - date ) , we also looked at things like who can find you via Facebook 's own search , application security , and more .
While you may think these sorts of items are n't worth your time now , the next time you lose out on a job because the HR manager viewed your questionable Facebook photos or saw something inappropriate a friend posted on your wall , you may have second thoughts .
But why wait until something bad happens before you address the issue ?
Considering that Facebook itself is no longer looking out for you , it 's time to be proactive about things and look out for yourself instead .
Taking a few minutes to run through all the available privacy settings and educating yourself on what they mean could mean the world of difference to you at some later point ... That is , unless you agree with Facebook in thinking that the world is becoming more open and therefore you should too .
Vitamin D in the prevention of heart disease
( NaturalNews ) Vitamin D is best known for its anti-cancer effects , but suddenly , following a flurry of recent research , it 's becoming increasingly recognized for its ability to prevent diseases like diabetes and depression .
Nowis also emerging as a chronic health condition that vitamin D can help prevent .
Here , we 've assembled a collection of relevant research quotations on vitamin D and heart disease from authors like Phyllis Balch , Dr. James Dowd , Dr. Joel Fuhrman and many more .
Enjoy this unique collection !
Diabetes , both type - 1 and type - 2 , are profoundly linked to low vitamin D levels .
Obesity , heart disease , hypertension and stroke are inversely related to sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels .
Psoriasis , eczema , and periodontal disease are lessened by sunlight exposure and high serum vitamin D. Fertility is positively influenced by sunlight exposure and high vitamin D levels .
Sunlight enhances immune system function by producing vitamin D. Dozens of disorders other than those mentioned in this summary are related to vitamin D deficiency .
Vitamin D supplements are likely to be useful in preventing diabetes in areas where vitamin D deficiency is common .
In a 1997 study looking at the links between environmental factors and Type II diabetes , vitamin D levels were assessed in 142 Dutch men aged from 70 to 88 years of age .
Thirty - nine per cent were found to have low vitamin D levels and tests showed that low vitamin D levels increased the risk of glucose intolerance .
Heart disease : Low vitamin D levels may also increase the risk of atherosclerosis .
Osteoporosis is closely correlated to heart disease .
Vitamin D deficiency could certainly be a factor in both , because there is a strong inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and artery calcification ; the more D in the blood , the less the calcification .
Artery cells have vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) , which when stimulated by vitamin D , inhibit the incursion of calcium .
" I think vitamin D is an important ingredient in the longevity recipe , " he said enthusiastically , as if just struck by an epiphany .
" Your skin manufactures vitamin D when it comes into contact with the sun .
Without that vitamin D , we increase our risk for nearly all age - related diseases including many types of cancer , high blood pressure , diabetes and even autoimmune diseases like MS ( multiple sclerosis ) . "
Insufficient vitamin D markedly accelerates heart disease in kidney patients .
Based on the evidence from these studies , there is no reason to take vitamin D or calcium , ever .
You can get all the vitamin D you need by taking a walk in the sunshine , especially in winter , since sunlight stimulates natural formation of vitamin D. However , if you want to take vitamin D there is no risk .
To ensure adequate supplies of vitamin D , get at least twenty minutes of sun exposure on the face and hands each day .
If that is not possible , take 400 to at most 1,000 milligrams of vitamin D supplements daily .
Do not take more than 1,000 milligrams of vitamin D daily or take the supplement for more than six months ; excessive use of vitamin D is associated with atherosclerosis and heart disease .
Vitamin D is needed for calcium to enter bones , and a deficiency of this vitamin is a major risk factor for both osteoporosis and bone fracture .
In addition , people who receive adequate sunlight exposure do not need as much vitamin D in their diet as do people who receive minimal sunlight exposure .
Vitamin D increases both calcium and phosphorus absorption .
Vitamin D has also been reported to increase absorption of aluminum .
Increased blood levels of calcium ( which can be a marker for vitamin D status ) have been linked to heart disease .
Some , but not all research suggests that vitamin D may slightly raise blood levels of cholesterol in humans .
Low vitamin D levels may also increase the risk of atherosclerosis .
Research suggests that a low level of vitamin D increases the risk of calcium build - up in atherosclerotic plaques , and that higher levels reduce the risk of build - up .
Researchers at UCLA School of Medicine measured the vitamin D levels in the blood of 173 men and women at risk of heart disease and also measured the build - up of calcium in coronary arteries ( a common finding in coronary artery disease ) .
The results suggest that calcium may regulate calcium deposition in the arteries as well as in the bone .
UVB light is available in Florida essentially year round for the production of vitamin D .
This is significant today - even more than historically - because vitamin D and a healthy diet represent a real Fountain of Youth .
The most prevalent health problems of old age are arthritis , osteoporosis , heart disease , cancer , and dementia , and all of these respond favorably to normalization of vitamin D levels and diet .
The Vitamin D Cure goes beyond the mythical Fountain of Youth for seniors because it's a Fountain for Youth , too .
Vitamin D - reduces heart disease risk in women .
It was reported at the 42nd annual conference on Cardiovascular Disease and Epidemiology Prevention that women who take vitamin D supplements lowered their risk of death from heart disease by one - third .
The finding was an unexpected dividend extracted from an osteoporosis trial to determine the incidence of bone fracture in nearly 10,000 older women .
From the trial participants , 4200 women reported taking vitamin D supplements at the onset of the study ; another 733 reported a prior history of supplementation .
Without enough vitamin D , adults are prone to osteoporosis and children are prone to a disease called rickets that results in improper bone growth and deformity .
Vitamin D deficiencies have also been shown to play a role in the development of dozens of diseases - everything from many different cancers to diabetes , heart disease , arthritis , psoriasis , and mental illness .
Once the link between vitamin D and rickets was established early in the twentieth century , American milk was fortified with vitamin D , all but eliminating the disease in America .
Another study assessed vitamin D levels in colorectal cancer patients and compared them to the risk of patient death over eleven years .
Those with the highest levels of vitamin D had a 48 % reduced risk of dying compared to those with the lowest levels .
A similar scientific investigation showed that among those with heart disease , death from any cause over seven years was doubled among those whose vitamin D levels were lowest compared to those whose levels were highest .
Another investigation showed that vitamin D reduces a major predictor of aging .
Low calcium and vitamin D intake has been linked to stroke .
Researchers compared the diets of thirty - five women who have had strokes accompanied by no history of high blood pressure or heart disease , with the diets of women who have never had strokes .
Results indicate that the healthy women 's diets contained 38 percent more vitamin D and 17 percent more calcium than those of the stroke victims .
It also is important to make sure vitamin D intake is adequate .
Those not getting sufficient sunshine to meet their vitamin D needs should take a supplement .
Vitamin D deficiency is epidemic in America , and it contributes not only to the development of osteoporosis but to increased cancer and heart disease as well .
The diet and supplementation plan recommended in this book is designed to assure nutritional completeness and to help you achieve your maximal health potential .
It is rich in calcium and iron from green vegetables , contains adequate protein , and is extremely nutrient dense .
If you are over 50 years of age , a 400 IU of vitamin D is recommended daily , especially if it is not included in your daily supplement and you do not spend much time outdoors .
If you are over 60 years of age , make sure your supplement contains 25 mcg of vitamin B12 - if not , consider taking a supplement .
If you are 70 years of age or older , take 600 IU of vitamin D daily .
CAUTION : If you currently have or are at risk for heart disease , or if you are a male , make sure that your multivitamin does not contain iron .
Because of the lack of sunlight , you do n't have enough active vitamin D , so your body pumps up your cholesterol in the hope of converting as much as possible to active vitamin D .
This serves as another example of an evolutionary trade - off between procreation and longevity .
To protect us from deficiencies of vitamin D , we 've evolved to have higher levels of cholesterol .
So now we survive to mate and to be able to stand up strong and look good , only to be felled by high LDL cholesterol and consequent heart disease and stroke .
Poor vitamin D status has been linked to increased risk of breast , prostate and colon cancers , osteoporosis and other bone disorders , Type 1 diabetes , arthritis , infertility , PMS , chronic fatigue and depression , Seasonal Affective Disorder , multiple sclerosis , musculoskeletal pain , and heart disease .
Ironically , the few foods that contain vitamin D are mostly items that have fallen out of favor thanks to orthodoxy 's fanatical anti-fat and cholesterol campaign , such as cod liver oil , butter , whole milk , liver and egg yolks .
In laboratory experiments the biologically active form of vitamin D has been shown to inhibit the growth of malignant melanoma and other cancer cells .
Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in a number of cancers and other major diseases .
The action of sunlight on the skin is the natural way of producing vitamin D .
So it is entirely plausible that the number of people who die each year of cancer of the breast , colon and prostate together with those who die from coronary heart disease , stroke and broken hips could be reduced by the adoption of regular , moderate sunbathing .
Men who are deficient in vitamin D were found to have more than double the normal risk of suffering a heart attack or dying even after all other possible risk factors such as hypertension , obesity and high levels of blood fat were excluded .
Populations in northern countries ( with less intense sunlight and lower levels of vitamin D ) have higher numbers of heart disease than sun-filled southern countries .
In additon , more heart attacks occur in the winter months , when sunlight is scarce .
NEW DELHI — U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said al Qaeda is working with an array of local militant groups to destabilize South Asia and trigger a war between India and Pakistan , an indication of growing U.S. fears about new terror attacks throughout the volatile region .
Mr. Gates said al Qaeda had formed alliances with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban as well as with Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistani - based group that carried out the attacks in Mumbai in 2008 that left more than 160 dead .

There are many great love stories in science fiction and fantasy .
From Robin Hood and Maid Marian to Han Solo and Princess Leia , we all love the stories that end with some variation of " and they lived happily ever after . "
But what about the great love stories that do n't end happily ?
Because loss is just as universal a part of the human experience as love is , the combination of the two in one story is often that much more poignant .
Here , then , are the top 10 best tragic love stories from geek fiction :
10 . Anakin Skywalker & Padmé Amidala Skywalker – Yes , we know ; we 've seen Star Wars : The Trilogy We 'd Like to Forget , too .
We know there 's about as much chemistry between the actors as between oil and water , so consider how the characters interact in the current Clone Wars TV series , where they ( frighteningly enough ) work much better together .
And consider the underlying story : Anakin loves Padmé so much he 's willing to rebel against everything else he holds dear because he believes it 's the only way to save her .
Regardless of how hopelessly naive he is , he does what he does out of love , and the fact that his actions ultimately kill her makes their story as tragic as they come .
9 . The Doctor ( as John Smith ) & Joan Redfern – In one of the most heartbreaking episodes of David Tennant 's run on Doctor Who , titled " Human Nature , " the Doctor is forced to forget himself and become fully human in order to hide from aliens seeking to steal his Time Lord powers .
After adopting the guise of a teacher named John Smith in England a year before the start of WWI , he falls in love with the school nurse , Joan Redfern .
But the aliens ultimately catch up with him , and ( in the next episode ) to save her and everyone else , the Doctor is forced to restore his true nature and memories , and leave behind the love he had found .
[ Thanks to GeekDad Editor Ken Denmead for writing most of this entry , as he is far more knowledgeable about all things Doctor Who than I . ]
8. Scott Summers & Jean Grey – Forget about the X - Men movies , because James Marsden gives the character of Scott Summers / Cyclops about as much personality as deck furniture .
Now , granted , the character was never written terribly appealingly in the comic books , but you could at least believe that he and Jean were in love .
We know that the whole Phoenix story got retconned such that Jean was n't really Phoenix , and therefore was neither responsible for genocide nor dead , and that she " died " again , but for our money give us the original plot line .
For us , Jean Grey was Marvel Girl , and Phoenix , and Dark Phoenix , and died on the moon in X - Men # 137 .
The story as a whole , and particularly the love story , seems much more powerful that way .
7. Lee " Apollo " Adama & Kara " Starbuck " Thrace – If you watched the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica ( the reboot , of course ) , you saw that Apollo and Starbuck were , obviously to everyone but them , madly in love with each other .
Which of course meant that , when each of them married someone else , you knew what was coming .
To the writers ' and actors ' credit , you did n't necessarily want them to get together , because they both treated their spouses ( and , to a certain extent , each other ) like dirt while they carried on their affair , but you could see that it was inevitable .
Then Starbuck went and died , and something Starbuck - like inexplicably came back from the dead .
And you knew they still loved each other , even though you were n't sure ( and , if you 're like us , you still are n't ) what Starbuck was when she came back .
And then , in the final episode , just when it looked like they were going to live happily ever after , she vanished without a trace .
That was probably the only time during the series we really felt bad for Apollo .
6. Buffy Summers & Angel – Could a love story get much more tragic than that between a vampire and a vampire slayer ?
It could in this case , with the vampire having a soul that he is cursed to lose if he experiences true happiness .
Buffy ends up not only having to deal with Angel turning back to the evil Angelus , but on top of that has to kill him herself !
When he ends up returning from hell , they continue their love story chastely , both knowing that it has no future .
5. Sarah Connor & Kyle Reese – Call it what you will : a love that was predestined to occur ; a thinly veiled allegory of the story of Jesus ( right down to the savior 's initials ) ; or a classic example of a time - travel paradox – it 's still a great love story .
Kyle saves Sarah 's life from the Terminator over and over again , and the way they fall in love with each other as they fight to stave off the killing machine is much more believable than in most sci- fi films or action thrillers .
You can sense from early in the film that Kyle is going to die before it ends , and that he knows it , which makes the story that much more tragic .
4. Sir Lancelot & Guinevere –
As long as we 're talking about tragic love stories , why not go really , really old school ?
It may seem strange to include an adulterous affair on this list , but in most versions of the Arthur legends , it is Lancelot that Guinevere truly loves , and not Arthur .
One must assume that their love was very powerful , as they surely knew the consequences of being found out , and surely knew that their affair could not continue undiscovered for long .
Ultimately ( again , in most versions ) , it is Arthur who ends up dead as an indirect result of the wars that stem from their affair , and they meet one last time at Arthur 's tomb , before Guinevere goes off to join a convent .
3. Dr. Horrible ( aka Billy ) & Penny – We Joss Whedon fans knew what we were getting into when we started watching Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog online in 2008 .
We knew his proclivity for getting us to love a character , then killing that character without warning .
So we should n't have been surprised by Penny 's death in Act Three , but damn it if he did n't do it to us again .
Once Dr. Horrible had exposed Captain Hammer for the self - important jackass he was , we really wanted to see him and Penny end up together , only to have her die in Dr. Horrible ( Billy ) 's arms , accidentally killed by the weapon he 'd devised .
Now , we may have to revisit this one after the sequel comes out , because all reports are that Felicia Day will be in it .
Will she be reanimated by the good evil doctor ?
Only time will tell .
2. Captain James T. Kirk & Edith Keeler / Rayna Kapec – Jim Kirk , as you may have heard , was generally given to sleeping with anything that was recognizably female and attractive .
But even he fell in love , at least twice that we 're sure of , and both times tragically .
The first time , in the great episode " The City on the Edge of Forever , " Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler , a woman from 1930s New York .
Time - travel romances rarely end well , but in this case it ends far worse than usual , as Kirk not only has to let the woman he loves die but actually must stop Dr. McCoy from saving her , all to ensure that the Allies will have won World War II as they were supposed to .
Then , in " Requiem for Methuselah , " Kirk encounters the beautiful Rayna Kapec , the ward of a man named Flint who , it turns out , had at one time been Leonardo da Vinci , Mozart and lots of other brilliant men in Earth 's history .
Kirk falls in love with Rayna quickly and deeply , and she with him – which proves unfortunate , as she turns out to be a sophisticated android who , unable to handle her brand - new emotions and the choice between Flint and Kirk , dies .
As the episode ends , in a rare display of compassion , Spock uses a mind - meld on Kirk to enable him to forget Rayna .
1. Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy – Regardless of what the Spider - Man movies would have you believe , it was Gwen Stacy who was Peter Parker 's first true love .
Gwen was pretty , but also smart and geeky like Peter , and we 're sure to readers at the time it seemed inevitable that they would eventually get married .
But it was not to be , with their relationship torn asunder first by Spider - Man 's involvement in her father 's death , and then , most tragically , by Gwen 's murder at the hands of the Green Goblin .
Her death was a watershed moment in comic book history as a whole , too , as it was the first time a hero had so completely failed to save his beloved .
So , what did we miss that should 've made the top 10 ?

Chavez issued stern warnings to businesses not to raise prices
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez has seized control of a foreign supermarket chain , Exito , after he accused the company of hiking its prices .
The joint French - Colombian supermarket chain was guilty of breaking Venezuelan law on price controls and would now pass into state hands , Mr Chavez said .
He said any other company increasing prices also risked nationalisation .
Exito was among more than 200 stores accused of raising prices during the country 's recent currency devaluation .
The supermarket chain had already passed under temporary government control after the devaluation .
But now President Chavez has taken it a step further .
Accusing the Exito group of " violating numerous Venezuelan laws " , Mr Chavez said he had ordered the expropriation of the supermarket chain .
' Socialist ' supermarkets
" How much longer are we going to allow transnational companies to come here to speculate with our prices ? " the Venezuelan leader asked viewers of his weekly TV programme , Alo Presidente .
He went on to say that fines and temporary closures were not sufficient to prevent such alleged abuses and that the country 's commerce minister , Eduardo Saman , should consider expropriating more frequently as a deterrent .
So far there has been no comment on the move from the Exito supermarket chain , which is a joint French and Colombian - owned company .
It comes as Venezuela 's trade relations with Colombia are particularly poor following a dispute over Colombia 's decision to grant the US access to seven military bases on its soil , something Mr Chavez strongly opposes .
Mr Chavez suggested that Exito 's hypermarkets in Venezuela could become part of a newly announced " Corporation of Socialist Markets " which is intended to provide everything from restaurants to car dealerships at heavily subsidised prices .

Johnson ( left ) is introduced by Nick Gillespie on Tuesday night .

The Tuesday night meet - and - greet with former Gov. Gary Johnson ( R - N.M. ) was supposed to draw a bigger crowd .
More than 10 people who ’d RSVP ’d for the event at Reason magazine ’s Washington , D.C. offices had begged off , on account of the fresh snow that had started to build on the drifts piled high for nearly a week .
That gave the few dozen attendees time to shake off the snow and sample the Whole Foods catering and open bar as they chatted with the affable Johnson .
It also gave Nick Gillespie , the editor of Reason.com , an opening for a joke .
“ Just so you know , Gary is already having an effect , ” said Gillespie , bringing a microphone to members of the crowd who were asking questions .
“ The federal government has announced it ’s closing tomorrow .
So if you stay here all week , we might balance the budget . ”
[ GOP1 ] Johnson , dressed in a blue business suit and standing behind a logo - less podium , chuckled at the gallows humor .
The crowd of libertarian activists and a few journalists laughed along .
Johnson ’s fans included staffers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , the libertarian think tank that ’s planning lawsuits against NASA over global warming science , and the Marijuana Policy Project , whose 15th anniversary gala Johnson had spoken at last month .
His short presentation and Q&A , a variation of a presentation he ’s giving all over the country , rolled out the new three - point economic plan of his Our America organization : deep spending cuts ( including cuts to entitlement programs ) , a flat tax , and less federal regulation of business and immigration .
But what could Johnson do that Tea Party groups and D.C. conservatives were n’t doing already ?
“ Obviously , he ’s going to run for president in a couple years , ” said Jeffrey Miron , a Harvard economics professor who ’s helping out Our America and who came to D.C. to participate in the Q&A .
“ So that ’s one thing that differentiates this from some of the groups that are just putting out statements . ”
Since launching Our America late last year , Johnson has been admirably blunt about his intentions .
He wo n’t announce anything yet , but he ’s seen what it takes to mount a libertarian - leaning Republican presidential bid , and he ’s laying the groundwork to do so .
He ’s “ showing up to speak to whoever asks me , ” he says , which means he ’s spending much of the most snowy week in 111 years of Washington , D.C. ’s history doing media interviews and talking to libertarian groups .
In two weeks , he ’ll be back to speak at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference .
And on paper , Johnson is a more spotlight - ready libertarian hero than Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) , famous more for his personal lobbying for marijuana legalization ( it ’s one of Our America ’s agenda items ) than for a return to the gold standard .
“ Right now , we ’re where we ’d thought I ’d be a year from now , ” said Johnson in the Q&A .
“ On the one hand , that ’s bad , because it tells you what a state this country is in .
Things are worse than we ’d thought they ’d be .
But you ’ve also got an energy out there and a desire for something new . ”
The effect of the sped - up schedule was on display Tuesday night .
Johnson knocked some questions out of the park , arguing that he ’d helped change the way voters in New Mexico thought about marijuana after he controversially came out for legalizing and taxing the drug .
“ When I announced that , my approval rating fell from 58 percent to 28 percent , ” he said .
“ I went all over the state explaining my position .
When I left office , my approval rating was 58 percent . ”
But he responded more generally to other questions , letting Miron flesh out some of his answers .
When Reason senior editor Katherine Mangu - Ward asked what Johnson thought of Rep. Paul Ryan ’s ( R - Wisc. ) alternative budget , a flashpoint for debate among D.C. ’s liberals and conservatives , the governor threw up his hands .
“ Actually , ” said Johnson .
“ I ’m not familiar with it at all . ”
“ Do you think that it ’ll pass , then ? ” joked Gillespie .
In other answers , Johnson revealed economic policy stances in line with the most conservative elements of the Republican Party , but social stances more popular with the left .
He told reporters that he supported the repeal of “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” and supported “ gay unions , ” but not gay marriage .
He ’s pro-choice “ up to the point of viability . ”
On a day that Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) and other conservatives joked that the heavy snow was disproving global warming , Johnson only cricitized environmentalists for being heavy - handed .
“ For argument ’s sake , ” said Johnson , “ global warming is happening , it ’s man-caused .
That given , I think the effects of it are grossly exaggerated and I think the amount of money we ’re looking to spend on it is grossly , grossly misguided . ”
Our America is a 501 ( c ) 3 non-profit group , not a PAC like the ones chaired by Mitt Romney or Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - Minn . ) , and not a 527 like Newt Gingrich ’s American Solutions , even though it shares office space with Johnson ’s political strategist ’s firm .
So far , it ’s a vehicle for Johnson to tour the country and put his ideas in one place , rather than a way to build his national standing by giving money to Republican candidates .
That did n’t prevent him from taking a swipe at the people he might debate if he entered the 2012 race .
“ Without exception , ” Johnson told TWI , “ the current presidential candidates — if you took the 10 or so likely candidates — if you put a piece of cardboard up over their likenesses , if you disguised their voices , you would n’t know which is which . ”
He poured some cold water on the idea that the GOP had proven itself ready to run the country again , knocking the party for opposing Medicare cuts as a tactic in the debate over health care reform .
“ It would be a mistake to take Scott Brown ’s election for a mandate for Republicans , ” he told TWI .
“ I think people are so angry at everyone in office that they ’re willing to vote anyone out . ”
And he criticized Republicans for supporting the continued wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ( “ I do n’t think any of them could explain why we ’re there ” ) and not coming out against torture .
Nonetheless , he ruled out a third - party bid .
“ I ’m a Republican and I ’m going to stay a Republican , ” he told TWI .
Johnson also criticized Gov. Bill Richardson ( D - N.M. ) , his successor back home , on the grounds that he ’d added more than 4500 jobs to the state payroll after Johnson cut 1000 .
“ I ’d argue that there ’s no area of government that ’s improved because of these 4500 stones he threw into the machine , ” said Johnson .
“ And that ’s just the ‘ E . ’
I can go A to Z if you .
He bought himself a jet — that ’s the ‘ J . ’
He bought himself a train from Albuquerque to Santa Fe — that ’s the ‘ T . ’ ”
That sort of political point - scoring was a factor missing from Ron Paul ’s 2008 presidential bid , a long - shot effort that most libertarians supported — many with reservations — despite being frustrated by the candidate ’s lack of commitment to a grueling campaign schedule .
Paul had blanched at skipping work in Congress , leading him to schedule fewer campaign events .
That ’s a problem that the independently wealthy Johnson — he sold his construction company 11 years ago — does n’t have .
His job , he explained , is “ getting out there . ”
“ I talked to the staff of Ron Paul ’s New Hampshire operation , ” said Ronald Nielson , the president and CEO of NSON Opinion Research , who worked on Johnson ’s 1994 bid for governor and has returned to help him work on Our America .
“ He did n’t really go there .
You know , he ’d go once in a while , but it was n’t a really organized effort .
They told me that they ’d organize events , and he ’d cancel .
They ’d organize trips , and he ’d cancel .
They ’d organize four events and he ’d show up for one of them .
I do n’t know what that was about , but that ’s not what we ’re doing . ”
As the Reason event wound down , Johnson ’s listeners moved closer to the open bar and assessed his performance .
He needed some polish on economic issues .
He needed to transfer the passion he had on ending the war on drugs to other topics .
How , they wondered , would he compete with other Republicans ?
Talking with TWI , Johnson suggested that he was on his way .
“ The support that I ’ve found surprising is sitting down with what would be described as right - wing Christian Republicans and finding support , ” said Johnson .
“ That ’s been a surprise . ”
Predictions about the appeal of cloud computing were on the money .
We increasingly share , communicate , socialize and entertain ourselves with software and media on remote servers rather than on our own computers .
But a big catch prevents more of us from investing much time or money in ephemeral digital media or constantly - changing online services :
It can be difficult , if not impossible , to grab your stuff and split .
Say you do n’t like the latest redesign of Kodak Gallery , formerly Ofoto .
Some complain that the site now uploads photos in the wrong order — by size instead of date , as customer service confirmed — while others do n’t like the “ buy one thing per year or lose your photos ” feature the site unveiled last year .
There ’s no easy way for disgruntled customers to migrate their photos back to their own computers or to another service , although clever hacks exist .
If you want your photos back , Kodak Gallery advises you to mouse over each photo and click to download them one - by - one .
Who has 60 or 70 hours to spare for downloading their own photos ?
Nobody we know .
Those who have been burnt by this sort of thing are less likely to trust another online service with memories , music , documents , books or anything else of import .
Keeping media and other data locked up not only riles consumers , but could slow the growth of all sorts of online services .
Data portability is a rapidly growing movement among cloud - computing supporters .
The idea that the online services we ’ve herded ourselves into should let us at least pass from one pen to the next is key , although the nuts and bolts of how open standards will work are still being hammered out .
Here ’s how a few of the major ones currently stack up in terms of data portability :
Bulk export ?
Media affected Google Gmail
Yes
E-mail Google Docs
Yes
Office documents Google Picasa
Yes
Photos Google YouTube
No ( single files only )
Videos , music Kodak Gallery / Ofoto
No ( single files only )
Photos Facebook
No ( can only delete account )
Text , contacts , photos , videos Rhapsody
No
Music subscriptions Amazon Kindle
No ( single files only , Kindle format )
E-books Amazon MP3
N/ A
Music downloads Apple iTunes
Yes in most cases ( bulk export to MP3 , but not for older DRM - ed files )
Music downloads
Out of this selection of prominent services , Google did particularly well .
Only its
YouTube site lacks a bulk - export option , and Google asks its users to vote on whether they want that feature added on DataLiberation.org , a Google website dedicated entirely to the data - portability issue .
“ As people switch to ‘ the cloud , ' ” explained Google spokeswoman Sara Jew - Lim , “ we want to make sure they never feel like their data is locked into the web services they use , in some proprietary format or in some service they ca n’t extract it from ( or that they have to pay to remove ) . ”
For the user , the benefits of cloud computing outweigh the costs of administering one ’s own services , which is why Tripod , the old DIY webpage - building site , is dead , while Facebook ’s turnkey solution to creating an online presence continues to thrive .
However , Facebook receives poor marks for data portability .
E-mails to Facebook ’s press address were repeatedly referred to an on-vacation spokesman , so we could n’t get an official response .
But it offers no way to batch - download the photos , text or videos one has uploaded to the site , and it has a storied history of squelching users ’ attempts to download their contacts .
We understand that complicated data , such as relationships to friends and likes and dislikes , are difficult to share between competing social networks ( although open standards embraced by Google Buzz and others , such as Activity Streams , Atom , MediaRSS and PubSubHubbub , can help with that ) .
At the very least , you should be able to grab your own photos , videos and text .
Like Google , Facebook is a member of the Data Portability Project , a consortium of companies whose aim is to enable data to pass more easily between platforms , so perhaps it will loosen these restrictions .
Hopefully , for everyone ’s sake , Facebook and other companies make these changes sooner rather than later .
Online service providers would like us to migrate our lives into the cloud because when we do stuff there we can encounter advertisements .
In addition , plenty of ways exist to get people to pay for premium versions of free services once they become power users ( free e-mail accounts reach their space limits , photo services offer printing , online music sales and subscriptions , and so on ) .
Services and customers alike stand to gain from data portability , and the answer could be as simple as a big red button on free and paid online services that says “ Give me all my data now . ”
Some of the companies peddling these services would balk at the notion of making it easier for customers to leave .
But if people knew they were n’t going to be locked in , they ’d be more likely to pay or make the substantial time investments that lead to paying .
In other words , if online services love their customers , they should set them free .

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh claimed that Obama ’s declaration of 9/11 as a day of service is really nothing more than Obama recruiting people to support him .
He said , “ There are endless and countless examples of subtle and not so subtle efforts by this White House to recruit and organize Americans . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Limbaugh said , “ This White House politicized 9/11 .
What do you mean Rush ?
What do you mean ?
Let me remind you , the White House politicized 9/11 when it made it a day of service .
Remember that ?
9/11 should be a day of service , which is a left wing political belief .
It politicized art and artists .
The White House in a conference call with selected artists who were rounded up by the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in paid political art to help support administration policies .
This has been exposed by Andrew Breitbart at Biggovernment.com ”
He continued , “ There are endless and countless examples of subtle and not so subtle efforts by this White House to recruit and organize Americans for the political benefit of one Barack Obama .
You know it and I know it .
The White House website has been used to recruit union members to disrupt the tea parties and town halls last August . ”
The idea that community service is some how a way to support Obama , just wo n’t die in right wing circles , like all conspiracy theories , this one makes no sense .
The White House is supposed to spreading propaganda through art .
Is this 1905 ?
If any White House was really out to spread propaganda , they would do what the Bush administration did .
They would pay writers and pundits to support their policies in the media .
Propaganda through art is a very effective strategy in 2010 .
Right wingers have always hated the NEA , so it is an old favorite of all their conspiracy theories .
Does anyone else see the irony of Limbaugh complaining that the White House organized people to disrupt the right wingers who were organized to disrupt the town halls ?
By the way , the White House never organized unions though the official website .
This is a bizarre conspiracy theory that is nothing more than Limbaugh trying to take a page of Glenn Beck ’s book of paranoia .
The right wingers are engrossed in paranoia right now , and like any good showman Limbaugh is giving his audience what they want , even if each word takes him one step farther away from sanity .
Israeli warplanes carried out air strikes against targets across the Gaza Strip Sunday morning , just one day after Hamas announced it had reached an agreement with all Gaza - based militant factions to halt rocket fire into the Jewish state .
The early morning Israeli raids – which injured eight Palestinians ( three at metal workshops in northern and central Gaza , as well as five at smuggling tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah , according to Palestinian health officials ) – were the most comprehensive in a single night of operations since Israel ended its three - week war on Gaza in January .
An Israeli military spokesman said the strikes Sunday targeted two weapons - manufacturing facilities and a smuggling tunnel .
The attacks were in response to a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel on Saturday , causing no damage or injuries .
The border between Israel and Gaza has been relatively quiet since last winter 's assault that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis , with just sporadic rocket fire and Israeli retaliatory attacks focused almost entirely on striking the smuggling tunnels under the Gaza - Egypt border .
Some 270 rockets have been launched from Gaza into Israel in 2009 , compared with over 3,300 in 2008 prior to the war , according to Israeli military figures .
Signs of escalation ?
But despite Hamas ' Saturday announcement that the rocket attacks will temporarily stop , locals fear this morning 's attacks and the more recent tit - for - tat violence may be reaching last year 's pre-war levels .
In September , the Israeli military carried out its first targeted assassination since the war when an unmanned drone struck a vehicle carrying Islamic Jihad militants near Gaza 's eastern border .
The Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on the Erez crossing with Israel on Wednesday , the same day a rocket fired from Gaza by a smaller , Al - Qaeda - style militant group prompted further Israeli air strikes on the Rafah tunnels Thursday morning .
Hamas political adviser Ahmed Yusuf says his movement , which rules the Gaza Strip , is serious about their unilateral cease - fire , but called Israel 's Sunday raids " an invitation to escalate the conflict . "
" We have been adhering to our cease - fire for almost a year now , " says Mr. Yusuf .
" We , and other groups in the Gaza Strip , have made it a priority to keep things calm .
Why now this provocation ? "
Following Sunday 's bombings , the armed wings of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) and Islamic Jihad denied they made any such agreement to stop firing rockets into Israel , according to the London - based Arabic - language daily , Al Quds Al Arabi .
Yusuf says Palestinian militants have " no interest " in engaging with Israel militarily .
Hamas wants to focus on reconstruction , but he adds that the cease - fire does mean that they will prevent " responses to Israeli aggression . "
" If the Israelis target us , people will react , " says Yusuf .
" It 's a normal thing .
And we [ Hamas ] can't stop anyone from fighting back against Israeli attacks . "
Earlier this month , Israel 's military intelligence chief , Major - General Amos Yadlin , announced Hamas had obtained and successfully tested a rocket that can reach Tel Aviv , Israel 's largest metropolitan city .
BusinessWeek asks Google VP Marissa
Mayer how she runs the insane number of meetings she attends ( over 70 per week . )
Turns out a ticking clock , strict agenda and thorough notes are all ways she keeps meetings focused and productive :
A Google meeting features a lot of displays .
On one wall , a projector displays the presentation , while right next to it , another projector shows the transcription of the meeting .
( Yet another displays a 4 - foot image of a ticking stopwatch . )
Google executives are big believers in capturing an official set of notes , so inaccuracies and inconsistencies can be caught immediately .

How to Run a Meeting Like Google [ BusinessWeek via Strategize ]
George Galloway was today deported from Egypt after plainclothes police officers refused him re-entry into the Gaza Strip and bundled him on to a plane for London .
The Respect MP Galloway , declared " persona non grata " by the Egyptian foreign ministry , arrived back in the UK at around 1 pm .
He had spent the past month travelling from London to deliver 198 truckloads of aid and supplies to Gaza in a challenge to Israel 's economic blockade of the territory .
The supplies made it through to Rafah , but when Galloway and Ron McKay , his aide , arrived at the crossing from Gaza to Egypt , they were confronted by police officers .
On arriving at Heathrow airport , Galloway told the al - Jazeera television channel : " It 's always been a badge of honour to be deported by a tinpot dictator , and that 's what happened this morning .
" Having crossed the border from Gaza into Egypt , my friend and I were bundled into a car ... 25 officers , accepting no dissuasion , drove us straight to the airport , basically forced us on to the plane . "
Galloway has in the past called for the overthrow of the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , accusing him of being complicit in Israel 's Gaza offensive , which began at the end of 2008 , and calling him a " criminal " .
He was also vocal in his criticism of Mubarak for the country 's initial refusal to allow the convoy through the Rafah crossing on Tuesday , which prompted clashes in which an Egyptian border guard was killed .
Zuber Hatia , a member of the convoy , said the Egyptian authorities could have been angered by a speech Galloway made to the Palestinian legislative council yesterday , in which he said Egypt deserved a leader like the Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
Mckay said none of the Egyptians who had detained the pair spoke any English , so they did not know they were police officers and had initially feared they were being kidnapped .
They eventually clarified the situation after using their mobile phones to contact friends who spoke Arabic and could communicate with the officers .
An hour into the journey from the border to Cairo , they asked to return to the border after hearing reports that seven members of the Viva Palestina convoy had been arrested following Tuesday ' sclashes .
However , they were refused permission and McKay said that , when they reached Cairo airport , plain clothes officers " followed us everywhere – to the toilet , airside , to the BA lounge " .
He added : " Finally , after we queued to get on the plane , the first person to speak English to us identified himself as being from the Foreign Office and said : ' You are being deported . ' "
The Egyptian foreign ministry said : " George Galloway is considered persona non grata and will not be allowed to enter into Egypt again . "
A police officer , speaking on condition of anonymity , claimed the Respect MP had been escorted away for his own protection .
" It was to protect him from the Egyptian people 's anger , " he said .
" He was told that he is a troublemaker and his behaviour is undermining Egyptian security . "
The seven members of the convoy reported to have been arrested were believed to be the same individuals detained in the aftermath of Tuesday 's clashes on the Gaza border but then supposed to have been released after a " peace deal " negotiated by Galloway and Turkish MPs with the Egyptian authorities .
" They reneged : the words were n't worth the paper they were written on , " McKay said .
Fifteen Palestinians were also injured in the violence after the convoy was delayed entering the strip .
The convoy , consisting of 550 people from 17 countries , blamed the trouble on " heavy - handed policing " .
Viva Palestina said 55 of its members had been injured .

This has now been corrected .
Think about the people missing from your life , and how you feel about them .
What we remember — and what we forget — may reveal more about ourselves than about them .
We have photos , letters , souvenirs , and fragments of memory , but our powerful imagination takes over from there :
We color in the blanks .
And that ’s OK .
Retouching old loves is a way of understanding what we want .
It helps us find our way to new ones .
It ’s impossible to know whether the experiences below are about infatuation , true love , lust , or something else entirely .
But we can be sure that each of these contributors learned about life and themselves in the process .
A Memory Card That Will Never Be Too Full to Take Photos ' Endless Memory ' feature From Eye - Fi auto deletes images once uploaded .
LAS VEGAS , Jan. 6 , 2010  --
Have you ever been on the verge of capturing the perfect picture only to learn that you can't -- because your camera 's memory card is full ?
Eye - Fi's so - called " endless memory " aims to make that situation obsolete .
Eye - Fi Pro X2 is the company 's latest Wi -Fi enabled memory card .
It automatically deletes images and video once they 've been wirelessly uploaded to your computer .
You can even see the images in the corner of your computer screen as they upload .
The Eye - Fi also makes it easy to share pictures and video via Web sites like Flickr , Facebook , Picassa and YouTube .
It costs $ 149.99 and is available for pre-order on the company 's Web site .
The Eye - Fi has been a CES favorite before , winning innovation awards multiple years in a row .
Maybe this new product will make it a winner again .
If you 're stealing a car these days , there 's a good chance you 're not bothering to actually pick the locks , but if you are , your job is about to get a little easier .
A device called the Electronic Key Impressioner is inserted into a car door and scans the position of the tumblers inside .
It feeds information back to a PC over USB which then , when told the car 's model , can provide the necessary information to cut the perfect key on the first attempt .
Right now it only works on Fords with simple metal keys ( like , say , a 1967 Shelby GT500 ) , but the hope is to expand the device to support other manufacturers and , possibly , electronic keys in the future .
It will be available to locksmiths and authorized security professionals in 2010 .

The Monday appearance of former Seahawks coach Jim Mora on KJR radio in Seattle was captured both in audio and video form .
And the video of Mora ’s remarks includes a moment during which Mora mouthed something to host Hugh Millen and / or host Dave “ Softy ” Mahler .
Discussing the fact that he was bounced for Pete Carroll , Mora discusses his philosophy regarding doing things the right way — and doing things the wrong way .
“ If you ’re a person that does not have integrity , that does n’t play by the rules , that does n’t put other people first , that cheats … that does n’t necessarily play by the rules , then I think at the end of the day , you ’re gonna struggle emotionally , ” Mora said .
The interesting part comes after Mora says the phrase “ that cheats . ”
At that point , he seems to say silently , “ Pete Carroll cheats . ”
But watch it for yourself .
The key moment comes at the 7:00 mark of the video pasted below .
And let us know , lip readers , what you think Mora is saying .
In the throes of an economic downturn , with unemployment rates mounting , the very idea of a robot chef might seem indulgent at best  at worst , downright offensive .
But these robots are n’t likely to be running the grill stations or bringing you chowder anytime soon  and the bad economy might be part of the reason .
At $ 100,000 a pair , Mr. Nagaya said , the cost of his robots is “ too high to make bowls of ramen . ”
But they may be worth the cost at Mr. Nagaya ’s other workplace , the robotics company Aisei in Nagoya , where he is the president .
“ I have made and programmed industrial robots at our company so long , and I was thinking to set up a place to promote our business , ” he said .
“ I love ramen a lot , and ramen restaurants are always featured in magazines and on television in Japan , so I thought opening a ramen shop with robots would have a huge impact on promoting our business . ”
Mikio Shimizu , the president of Squse , a company in Kyoto , Japan , that is responsible for the sushi- grabbing hand , said that his ultimate goal is to become the world ’s largest maker of functional prosthetic hands .
Narito Hosomi , the president of Toyo Riki , a company in Osaka , Japan , that programs the robots responsible for the octopus balls and savory pancakes , said that the final destination for the robots , which cost $ 200,000 each , was more likely a factory than a kitchen .
But “ it ’s not interesting to watch robots welding , ” Dr. Hosomi said .
“ If you see robots do the same work as you do in everyday life with the tools you use , it would be easier to understand the functional capability of robots .
The okonomiyaki robot is a medium for that purpose .
We say a robot can make okonomiyaki , takoyaki  well , what would you like a robot to do for you ? ”
While cooking is certainly a more universal way to showcase a robot ’s abilities than , say , laser - welding , it is also unique in its ability to tackle something deeper : namely , the public ’s collective “ Terminator ” - fueled angst over a future populated by vengeful hominoid machines .
Dr. Heather Knight , a roboticist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , said that the industry is trying to change “ the perception of robots . ”
Haver Analytics gives us this chart / data :
Military should be the first in line for budget slashing , but the opposite is taking place .
While “ defense ” spending does boost GDP , and preserve ( politically important ) jobs , it ’s still a huge drag on the real economy .
America ’s military is bloated , and much like the FIRE sector , it needs shrinking .
Both are incredibly inefficient ways to grow / stimulate an economy .
In their current state , both are a drain on American resources .
And with their armies of lobbyists , this is n’t likely to change soon .
America faces a funding crisis like we have never seen .
The U.S. remains the world ’s lone superpower .
That would still be the case if we cut military spending 30 % .
Reducing the budget and shifting those jobs to more productive areas , like energy and manufacturing , would have immensely positive effects on the economy .
The question is – do our political leaders have the courage to cut spending before things get out of control ?
Based on what we ’ve seen so far – the answer is clearly no .
SAN FRANCISCO — A unanimous California Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a law that sought to impose limits on the amount of marijuana a medical patient can legally possess .
The California Supreme Court ruled that state lawmakers were wrong to change provisions of the voter - approved Proposition 215 .

Update 2010 - 01 - 25 :
We will be meeting outside the Theater at 8:30 am ( Wednesday 27th ) , and will go until at least 10:30 am .
Stay tuned to http://identi.ca/dbd for updates and coordination .
This coming Wednesday , January 27th , Apple has invited members of the media to San Francisco 's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater to " Come see our latest creation . "
There has been much speculation about what Apple will be announcing , with most of it revolving around a possible tablet PC -- basically an oversized iPhone .
But no matter the form factor , it 's all but certain given the direction Apple has been going that any new product will be DRM - infected and restricted by proprietary software .

The company who once announced to the world that they opposed DRM on music has been pushing DRM in every other area of their business .
Apple 's iPhone goes out of its way to apply DRM on every piece of software on the device , saying it is illegal for users to install software that comes from anywhere other than the official Application Store .
Can you imagine a world where this same restriction is applied to your laptop or tablet PC ?
That could very well be Apple 's announcement on Wednesday -- their latest restriction .
As in the past , they did n't invite us to the event , but we thought we would go anyway , and bring some friends .
We 'll be there to warn the public and the media outside the event about Apple 's support for DRM and proprietary software .
Come help create the counter story in the media -- take photos , talk to the press , and have fun with a little bit of theater to show that Apple is not the force for creative expression they claim to be .
We got through to Steve Jobs before on music DRM , and convinced iTunes to drop it .
We know we can have success here .
But we need to repeat that effort and show that DRM on Apple computers means that people who are actually interested in creativity and freedom will go elsewhere .
Press coverage of Apple events usually falls all over itself to praise the style and sleekness of their devices .
It 's vital that we be there to unmask the new product for what it undoubtedly will be -- another seamless case and pretty screen hiding a new set of restrictions and threats to the public 's digital freedom .
We 'll post the precise time and meeting location for our group here next week -- since Apple 's event starts at 10 am , attendees will be showing up at 9 am , and we will want to be ready and outside the Theater by then to hand out flyers and talk to people .
I 'll be there representing the FSF and coordinating the action .
Please join us , and bring friends .
Let us know you 're coming at info@defectivebydesign.org .
We 'll meet at 8:30 am outside the Theater .

Born in 1965 , Mr. Selmanovic was raised in a secular Muslim home in Croatia .
It had , he writes , its own religion , with two doctrines , “ Thou shalt enjoy life ”  which meant food , family and friendships  and “ Thou shalt not be a jerk ”  which meant generosity , honesty and hard work .
The family feasted on spitfire - roasted lamb at the end of Ramadan , without ever having fasted .
They had a Christmas tree and Easter dinner , without ever going to church .
For young Samir , “ life was complete , ” he recalls in his book .
“ Until I became a Christian , and it all fell apart . ”
Mr. Selmanovic ’s clandestine conversion to Seventh - day Adventism while doing his obligatory military service in the Yugoslav army led to two years of banishment from his family and a rift that could not be healed for many years .
It led to theological studies in the United States and to leadership of two swiftly growing churches , first in Manhattan and then in Redlands , Calif .
It also led to spiritual crisis , a reaction against believers , including himself , tempted to feel that they had exclusive possession of God .
In 2007 he returned to New York City and founded Faith House , which brings together Christians , Muslims , Jews , atheists and others to learn from one another .
He also directs a small Christian community called Citylights .
Mr. Selmanovic ’s thesis in “ It ’s All About God ” is that when religions turn into “ God Management Systems ” pretending to own God , they turn into idolatry .
The quest to find God beyond the boundaries of one ’s faith , he argues , has to be moved from occasional conferences resembling interfaith prom parties ( “ That was really nice .
Let ’s interfaith again next year . ” ) to something central .
“ Other religions can challenge ( or at least help us see ) the idols we create because they expand the whole territory of knowing , ” Mr. Selmanovic writes .
“ They pose difficult questions we do n’t want to ask , make assumptions we do n’t want to acknowledge or examine , create meaningful arguments against us we do n’t want to consider , and expose harmful practices we do n’t want to stop . ”
Iran 's Election Protesters Threatened with " Homelessness "
12/05/09
Source : Radio Zamaneh
Ayatollah Jannati
Tehran Friday 's prayer was a throng of warnings to elections protesters who have used every opportunity to demonstrate and express their protest to Ahmadinejad 's government which they believe stands on the shoulders of a fraudulently elected president .
Ayatollah Janati , a staunch hardliner led Tehran 's Friday prayers reminding the crowd of what became of the members of People 's Mojahedin of Iran , the opposition group which was heavily suppressed in the first years of the Islamic Republic in Iran and went on to continue their struggles against the Islamic Republic from within Iraq during the Iran - Iraq war .
Ayatollah Janati warned protesters that " fighting the system " will " cost them heavily " and result in their " homelessness . "
A considerable group of People 's Mojahedin ended up staying on in Iraq and living in a camp which used to be under US jurisdiction .
The camp is now under threats from the current Iraqi government that wants to deport the inhabitants to Iran .
Millions of Iranians have rallied and protested in Tehran and other cities since the June presidential elections .

Human Mutations are seen as birth defects that a person has to live throughout their life with .
Some are very visible to the eye while others can be hidden .
There are some that can be so bad that as the person ’s age increases the mutation gets worse .
Some can even cause a person to die before their time .
Then , there are those mutations that fascinate the world .
Stories will be posted about these mutations and cameras will interfere with that person ’s life .
But , yet , the world still wants to know and in today ’s society I am surprised that the people with some of these mutations do n’t have a reality TV series .
1 .
Cyclopia
This birth defect does n’t allow the orbits of the eyes to separate into two cavities .
These occurrences happen in every 1 in 250 babies .
The face will be missing or the nose will be non-functioning and that nose will either be above the eye or on the back of the head .
Most babies will not make it to birth or they are still born .
There are two cases of children with Down Syndrome that have been born with one eye .
This is often caused by genetic problems or toxins ingested by the mother .

2 .
Tree Man
This man has hands and feet that look like contorted tree branches .
For 20 years , he has lived like this .
He has warts all over his body that look like the moss that forms on trees out in the forest .
The growths on his body make up over twelve pounds of his weight and he only weighs 100 pounds .
After only a few steps he would become tired because of the density of the growths .
It is believed that this defect was caused by an HPV virus .
There are two types of HPV .
The first one can cause cervical cancer and the other can cause warts on the skin .
This is what the doctor ’s feel he has .
The warts started to appear after he received a cut on his skin as a teenager .
It has become out of control since then .
The skin has infections happening and bugs living in his skin .
He has a weak immune system and the virus took over because of it .

3 .
Mermaid Syndrome
This is when a child is born with his or her legs fused together and it gives the impression of a mermaid ’s tail .
One out of every 100,000 births are said to have this birth defect .
The babies born with this defect will die within a day or two because of complications in the development of their bladders and kidneys .
There are only a handful of births that did not have the complications that came along with this condition .
Three of the most well know cases are Milagros Cerron , Tiffany Yorks and Shiloh Pepin .
Link
4 .
Werewolf Syndrome
This birth defect or genetic mutation has to do with the hair on the person ’s body growing to a substantial amount over every inch .
This can be seen at birth , when the child is born covered in hair .
If the infant is tested and does not suffer from hypertrichosis , then the hair will be shed over the next few years .
The acquired type of gene forms over the years and can refer to extra hair growing in places that hair has n’t grown before .
The congenital form of this disease is more commonly used as the werewolf syndrome because of thickness and the amount of hair formed over the person ’s body .
These are the type of people that get used in the circuses as sideshow “ freaks ” as the wolf - man .

In a partnership that may inspire some to put their tinfoil hats on , Google has reportedly turned to the National Security Agency for help in improving the company 's security infrastructure .
The new partnership is still being finalized , but will be aimed at preventing future attacks like the one that hit Google in December , according to The Washington Post .
This is not the first time the NSA has been tapped to help a U.S. corporation with cyber security , but the purported partnership would certainly be unique since Google 's servers house such a vast collection of user data including search histories , e-mail , and personal documents .
It 's Not About You , Sources Say
News that Google is working with one of the government 's top spy agencies may sound discomforting , but anonymous sources speaking with the Post said the deal would be focused on protecting data and not violating the privacy of individual Google users .
" The deal does not mean the NSA will be viewing users ' searches or e-mail accounts or that Google will be sharing proprietary data , " the Post reported .
Google is reportedly hoping that the NSA will be able to help Google understand how its infrastructure was compromised , and develop methods to prevent similar intrusions .
The NSA and Corporate America
Although best known for its roles in operations like the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping program and collecting telephone records , the NSA has worked with other corporations on security matters in the past .
In 2007 , the NSA helped Microsoft develop parts of the Vista operating system to meet U.S. Department of Defense requirements for security and interoperability with other government software .
In 2009 , the NSA worked with over 30 other cyber security organizations and companies including Symantec and Microsoft to write a report outlining the twenty - five most dangerous programming errors developers often make .
The list was designed to help software makers avoid these security holes before bringing their products to market .
In December , Google disclosed that it and 20 other U.S. companies were the victims of cyber attacks that originated in China .
Google has said some of its intellectual property was stolen during the attacks , and the company is considering pulling its operations out of China over the attacks .

Yesterday we saw Ferrari banging the drum for three - car teams once again .
But our debate around their now - infamous rant led us to a very different idea – why not let teams run a single car if they choose to ?
I decided it ’s time to put the question to a vote among F1 Fanatic readers :
How many cars should F1 teams be allowed to enter ?
Two ( the current rule ) ( 47 % )
One or two ( 15 % )
Two or three ( 18 % )
One , two or three ( 13 % )
Any number ( 6 % ) Total Voters : 4,593

In the past , teams could enter any number of cars they liked in any race .
But this created the problem of fluctuating grid sizes .
Typically the European rounds would be very well - attended but only a handful of cars made it to the ‘ flyaway ’ rounds .
Requiring teams to enter the same number of cars at each race is definitely the correct approach .
But how many cars should that be ?
At the moment every team has to enter two cars at every round .
In other series where teams have to build their own cars it ’s typical to see teams of more than two cars : like endurance racing , for example .
Ferrari wants to be able to enter a third car in F1 which , as discussed before , would boost grid sizes but could make it easer for one team to dominate and squeeze out their smaller rivals .
On the other hand I think there ’s something to be said for letting teams enter just one car instead of two if they choose .
It could help new teams get started in F1 by running a cheaper one - car effort in their first season but requiring them to run a full two - car squad after that .
Should F1 follow Ferrari ’s repeated demands to be allowed to run a third car ?
Should one - car teams be allowed again ?
Or are we best off not tampering with the two - car system ?
Cast your vote above and have your say in the comments .

Could there ever be conditions under which the equilibrium ( real ) prices for some assets are infinite ?
What would happen to an economy as it approached those conditions ?
Would those prices keep climbing to the skies heavens , then collapsing in waves of fear and panic ?
I 'm trying to figure it out .
Start with an economy with technology and total factor productivity growing at rate g.
Assume everything else ( population , capital , etc. ) is constant over time , so the growth rate of output , income , and consumption is also g .
Assume intertemporal consumption preferences such that the equilibrium real rate of interest , r , is the same as g .
So far very standard .
Now add in an asset in fixed supply .
Ocean - front land , maybe .
There is a demand to rent ocean - front land .
Assume that rental demand has a price elasticity , and income elasticity , both equal to one .
That means total annual rents on ocean - front land are a constant fraction of real income .
Given the fixed supply , that means rents per acre ( or per metre of ocean - front ) must be rising in real terms at rate g .
The present value of the rents on one metre of ocean - front are therefore equal to ( today 's rent ) / ( r - g ) , which is infinite .
If investors are rational , and there are no bubbles , either positive or negative , so prices reflect fundamental values , the equilibrium price of ocean - front land should equal the present value of the rents .
So the equilibrium price should be infinite .
And if we assume instead that the income elasticity of demand exceeds one , rents per metre will be rising faster than g , and faster than r .
So the equilibrium price of ocean - front land should exceed infinity ( yes , I know ) .
Those assumptions about elasticities , interest rates , growth rates , do n't seem totally implausible .
What have I got wrong ?

Valerie Moliere , 15 , describes the scene in Haiti in the wake of an earthquake .
The tremor hit at 1653 ( 2153 GMT ) , about 15 km ( 10 m ) south - west of Port - au - Prince .

After five years of research and experiments , scientists working on an earthquake early warning system say they should soon be able to alert Bay Area residents as much as a minute before a distant quake reaches them .
A major quake on the northern end of the San Andreas Fault could be detected in time to sound an alarm in San Francisco a full 60 seconds before the shaking starts .
A closer quake might mean only a few seconds of warning , but could still be enough for people to take shelter - possibly saving lives , the UC Berkeley scientists say .
Whether such a system might have helped in Haiti , where an estimated 200,000 people have died and 1.5 million are homeless , is doubtful because the 7.0 temblor 's epicenter was very close to the capital and population center of Port - au - Prince .
But the potential of such warnings is so great that the U.S. Geological Survey plans to funnel $ 10 million in federal stimulus funds into the work , said Richard Allen , associate director of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory and leader of the project .
" Early warning networks are already operating in other countries where earthquakes are common , and we know that in a densely populated region like the Bay Area , even a few seconds of warning could save many lives when a big one hits , " Allen said .
In the Bay Area , the system was recently tested in conjunction with BART , whose engineers were instantly able to stop all trains when a warning was transmitted based on simulated quakes .
The system also detected the 5.6 magnitude Alum Rock quake that hit the Calaveras fault two years ago .
A signal reached San Francisco several seconds before the city started shaking .
Advanced system
The highly advanced warning system is based on complicated computer algorithms known as ElarmS , short for Earthquake Alarms Systems .
Whenever an earthquake happens , the sudden jolt sends several types of seismic waves coursing through the Earth for thousands of miles at various speeds .
By detecting and analyzing the slower but most damaging shock waves known as shear waves , seismometers equipped with the ElarmS computer program would instantly detect the earthquake 's magnitude and location , predict where its ground - shaking shock waves would be strongest , and immediately transmit warnings to areas in danger .
Eventually the alarm system could tell dispatchers to halt trains , alert fire stations and ambulances , send warnings to home computers and trigger warning tones to every individual mobile phone in the area , Allen said .
Scientists at the Berkeley laboratory , together with colleagues at the Geological Survey in Menlo Park , have been developing and testing two networks of an early warning system for five years , and the new phase is being greatly helped by the stimulus funds , Allen said .
The ElarmS system now connects about 300 seismometers in Northern California .
The $ 10 million in stimulus funds will help the Berkeley group to upgrade those seismometers and push other work expanding the system and testing it .
Other funds will soon add 100 more seismic detectors and the entire array will eventually number 500 throughout Northern California .
The entire system could be in place and ready to operate in about three years , Allen said .
' Banker 's bonus '
The California Seismic Safety Commission has asked him for a cost estimate of a full statewide early warning system covering every known active fault with upgraded seismographs .
The total would come to $ 80 million , Allen said - " about the cost of a banker 's bonus . "
" Only a couple of seconds warning , " Allen said , " could give everyone time to duck and cover under protection like a sturdy table . "
The worst earthquakes being tested with the early warning systems are similar to the 1906 quake that hit San Francisco with an estimated 7.9 magnitude .
In Southern California , if a similar quake were to strike at the southern end of the San Andreas fault just east of the Salton Sea , Los Angeles would also have a full minute 's warning , Allen said .
Japan already has a fully effective warning system that can alert every school in the country , where pupils are regularly trained to sit under their desks when the alert sounds , Allen said .
The United States , including quake - prone California , is lagging behind many other nations where early warning systems are already operating .
In addition to Japan , those countries include Mexico , Italy , Greece , Turkey , India , Romania , Switzerland , Iceland , Egypt , India and Taiwan .
The New York State Attorney General 's office announced last week that it was issuing subpoenas to 22 popular online retailers , including GameStop , as part of an investigation into how the sites may share credit card information with other companies .

A news release from the office of New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo explains what is described as a practice that " deceptively link [s ] unsuspecting consumers to fee - based membership programs that charge unauthorized feeds under the guise of discount offers . "
The AG 's office describes in fuller detail :
Cuomo's investigation has found that when consumers shop online from familiar retailers , they are often presented with a discount or cash - back incentive offer as they complete their purchase .
When consumers click on the discount or incentive banner , they are unknowingly directed to a membership program seller 's
Web page that is separate from the online retailer 's site .
The consumer is then instructed through large , colorful print and voice prompts to accept the discount or incentive .
Information about joining the membership program and its ramifications , including the fact that the consumer is agreeing to transfer his or her credit or debit card account information , is buried in fine print and cluttered text .
Small and recurring charges then begin to appear on consumers ' credit or debit card bills from unfamiliar companies .
Because of the low dollar amount , the charges may go unnoticed for some time .

The three discount companies in question are Webloyalty , Affinion / Trilegiant and Vertrue .
The AG 's office has issued subponeas to 22 " well - known merchants " that deal with them , including GameStop , FTD.com , Orbitz.com , Travelocity and more .
Cuomo's office reports that it already got movie ticket seller Fandango to agree to change its linking practices .
MSNBC reports :
The company will now warn customers if they are about to be leave the Fandango Web site .
It will also warn customers when an incentive is offered for joining a membership club from a separate company .
Fandango has agreed to pay $ 400,000 in restitution to customers .

Reached for comment this afternoon , GameStop vice president Chris Olivera said the company is working with the AG 's office .
" I can confirm that we were subpoenaed , " Olivera said .
" We are still reviewing the matter but do intend to work fully with the New York AG 's office .
Beyond that , I would not be able to provide any additional comment . "

CUOMO INVESTIGATING 22 POPULAR ONLINE RETAILERS FOR LINKING CONSUMERS TO DISCOUNT CLUBS THAT CHARGE HIDDEN FEES [ press release from New York State Attorney General 's office ]
The American public has not been informed by the US news media about highly newsworthy statements made by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday February 12 .
He said the era of nuclear weapons is over , suggesting Iran has no plans to build “ inhumane ” A - bombs .
Ahmadinejad called for a world free of nuclear arms in an interview with Russia ’s NTV channel .

“ We believe that not only the Middle East but also the whole world should be free of nuclear weapons because we see such weapons as inhumane , ” he said .
“ Today , no one can use a nuclear weapon and we believe that the US is taking a wrong move by stockpiling nuclear weapons , ” he added .
“ Those who claim that they are against nuclear weapons should dismantle their nuclear weapons first to prove that they are honest . ”
So far , the libertarian - leaning Antiwar.com has been the only American media outlet to cover his statements .
Considering Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s calls for sanctions over Iran ’s nuclear program , and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s position that new sanctions should be “ crippling , ” one might think the US media would pay attention to Ahmadinejad ’s statements .
Instead , the media ’s Sarah Palin obsession means that more Americans heard repeated calls to start a new war with Iran in the past week .
ADVERTISEMENT
Iran has continually denied it plans to build nuclear weapons .
The country ’s high - profile stance is that enriched uranium will be used for Tehran ’s medical reactor .
The interview Friday was given to Russian channel NTV , once critical of all - powerful Vladimir Putin , but now controlled by the state - owned Gazprom conglomerate .
CNN published a timeline of the changes to the station nine years ago .

Even those who know the area best wo n't step far off the narrow , muddy road that runs through the center of the desolate toxic dump at Utah 's Deseret Chemical Depot .
It 's been more than 30 years since the U.S. Army used this vast scrubland , known as the East Demilitarization Area , to dispose of a deadly arsenal of chemical and conventional munitions -- but the military still has n't figured out how to clean up its mess .
The Defense Department does acknowledge the disaster , just as it has belatedly admitted having tested a gamut of chemical and biological weapons on military members in Utah 's vast west desert during the Cold War .
But the U.S. government insists that the tests have contributed to long - term illnesses in only a handful of exposed service members .
And that has led the Department of Veterans Affairs to deny almost all claims for care and compensation made by those who believe they got sick as a result of the tests .
Although the Cold War was fought mainly by proxy and politicians , it was not without its casualties :
Many died while waiting on the military to so much as acknowledge its secret programs .
Now , Dwight Bunn fears he might also slip away before the government takes responsibility for its actions .
The former soldier is sick .
And he wants to know why .
--
' Do n't worry , this stuff wo n't hurt you . '
Bunn was 21 years old when he arrived at Dugway Proving Ground , just over the snow - dusted hills from the Deseret demilitarization dump , in Tooele County .
The official mission of his unit , the 45th Chemical Company , was to create smoke screens for infantry assaults .
But in the early 1960s , at the height of the Cold War , the Army had other uses for the group .
Among the company 's secretive duties :
Helping to dispose of the carcasses of animals used in chemical weapons tests .
Starting in the 1940s and continuing through the 1970s , the Army tested and disposed of thousands of tons of chemical and biological agents in sparsely populated Utah , including munitions loaded with sarin , VX , mustard , tabun and various hallucinogens .
Bunn , whose tour of duty in Utah began as the U.S. was beginning to build up its forces in Vietnam , also believes members of his unit were exposed to Agent Orange .
" They told us , ' Do n't worry , this stuff wo n't hurt you .
It 's a defoliant and so it will kill the trees , but you 'll be fine , " he said .
Bunn said military officials have told him they can find no record of Utah tests involving the toxic herbicide , which has been linked to dozens of medical conditions .
But for the Washington state man , the government 's denials are less than convincing .
After all , the military spent years disavowing the tests altogether .
The denials ended in the late 1990s , but the government has offered medical care and compensation only to those who can establish , by a preponderance of evidence , their illnesses were the result of exposure .
As of 2008 , just 39 of 614 benefit claims filed by veterans in relation to tests nationwide had been approved .
Bunn , who suffers from restrictive lung disease , has asked the VA for care and compensation for his condition , in which tissue surrounding the lungs hardens and makes it difficult to exhale .
But the 65 - year - old veteran 's claim has been denied .
And he 's infuriated by a government that kept the program secret for decades , and now expects him and others to be able to offer proof that the tests made them sick .
" I 've been exposed to a hell of a lot of stuff , " he said .
" Can I say definitively what did this to me ?
No I can't .
But I 've never lied about it .
The military -- it conducted tests on humans and did n't acknowledge it .
That 's not right . "
--
' Blow it up and burn it . '
Long rows of wooden pallets , stacked with bomb casings and ragged pieces of shrapnel , memorialize the Army 's last attempt to clean up the Deseret demilitarization dump .
The inefficient bomb - by - bomb effort was abandoned in the 1980s when military leaders realized it was too dangerous to continue .
" They just walked away , " said Troy Johnson , Deseret 's environmental program manager .
It 's hard to understand why they even started .
Just to the south of Deseret 's colossal , modern weapons incinerator , the charred shells of nearly 60,000 mortars form an artificial bluff hundreds of feet across .
Some of the bombs are believed to be filled with the hardened remnants of mustard agent .
Not far away , ditches the size of swimming pools are filled with paint cans , fire extinguishers , oil drums , tear gas canisters and cluster bombs .
Unexploded ordnance litters the ground .
When a lightning fire blazed through Deseret in 1999 , explosions sent white smoke into the air as long - discarded phosphorus grenades were ignited .
In some areas , the soil has a green hue ; military environmental experts believe that 's where napalm was dumped .
The toxic disaster area covers thousands of acres .
" It was perfectly acceptable , back then , to just take this stuff out here , blow it up and burn it , " Johnson said .
" Today , when we discard of these weapons , we have to be 99.999 -- and then some more nines -- percent clean .
Back then , out here , they simply lit a match . "

' You 're supposed to be obedient '
David Davidson can't say definitively that he was sickened by his exposure to mass destruction munitions at Dugway -- but he can't say he was n't either .
" The question is : Who knows ? " said Davidson , who suffers from several types of cancer , kidney failure and heart disease and undergoes 12 hours of dialysis each week .
" All I know is that I have a list of things wrong with me , but I 've never been given a list of the things I was exposed to . "
The VA has denied the 73 - year - old veteran 's requests for care .
The Army asserts it tested biological and chemical agents on " volunteer human subjects . "
But Davidson -- who arrived at Dugway in 1961 -- takes issue with the notion that the tests were in any way voluntary .
" I was a PFC -- a private first class , " Davidson said .
" You know what that means ?
That means I did anything they told me to do . "
Once , Davidson recalled , he and other soldiers were packed into the back of an M35 cargo truck and driven into the desert , where a grid had been set up with stakes and string .
" They stood us all out there , each at a different distance from where they were going to set off an explosion and told us to stick it out as the gas went off .
Then we were supposed to come back and tell them how it affected us . "
Davidson does n't know what the gas was , but it created " a big fog " and sent him to his knees , gasping for breath .
" It 's interesting that they would do such a thing , " he said .
" But when you 're in the military , you 're supposed to be obedient , and I did what I was told . "
--
' They said this never happened . '
For decades , military leaders remained silent about " Project 112 , " a slew of tests overseen by the Army 's Deseret Test Center in Salt Lake City .
Beginning in the 1960s , the program tested chemical and biological agents , including VX , sarin and e. Coli , on unknowing military personnel .
When the tests were finally acknowledged , the Defense Department agreed to help the VA track down those who were exposed .
But in a report issued in 2008 , the General Accountability Office scolded the military for its lackluster effort .
According to the report , the military arbitrarily ended its attempts to find victims in 2003 -- even as some veteran advocates were finding hundreds of others whose illnesses might have been caused or aggravated by their exposure .
The GAO report did n't surprise Douglas Rosinski , a Washington , D.C. , attorney who represented a group of veterans that helped force an end to years of Pentagon silence about the tests .
" For 40 years , they said this never happened , " Rosinski said .
" I would be surprised if the government was still being anything other than absolutely reluctant . "
Michael Kilpatrick , director of strategic communications for the Military Health System , said a renewed effort to locate service members exposed to chemical and biological testing will likely conclude in 2011 .
More than 60 years after the testing began , Kilpatrick said , the government is still investigating " what exposures each individual may have had and to evaluate each individual 's current health . "
In the meantime , he said , " these individuals are eligible for an evaluation by the VA . "
And , for most , that 's all they 'll get .
Meanwhile , veterans who were exposed to the tests are fading into history .
Bunn , the former soldier who was assigned to pick up animal carcasses , knows of just one other man from his unit who is still alive .
" And the last time I spoke with him , he was having trouble remembering much about what happened out there . "
Ultimately , Bunn said , the human evidence of the tests will be gone .
" All that will be left is the desert we used to stomp around in , " he said .
OSLO — Candidates for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize include a Russian human rights group , a Chinese dissident and an inanimate object : the Internet , people who made the nominations said Tuesday .
As the submission deadline for the coveted award closed , the Nobel Committee maintained its tradition of giving no hints -- the contenders are kept secret for 50 years .
But some nominations were announced by those who made them .
Those with nomination rights include former peace laureates , members of national governments and legislatures , selected university professors and others .
Erna Solberg , the head of Norway 's Conservative Party , put forth Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and Memorial , a prominent rights group she works with .
Gannushkina heads the Civic Assistance Committee , which works under the auspices of Memorial primarily for the rights of migrant workers .
Memorial , a frequent critic of the Kremlin , says the high - profile murder of Memorial rights activist Natalya Estemirova in July 2009 and the December 2008 raid of its St. Petersburg office by Russian authorities are among the many injustices it 's faced because of its dogged activism .
" These are people who are at the forefront of human rights and are putting their lives at risk for their work , " Solberg told The Associated Press .
Gannushkina told the AP in Moscow she felt " embarrassed " to be mentioned in the same breath as other great rights activists .
As for Memorial , " this is the acknowledgment of Russia 's human rights workers , and this is well deserved , " she said .
Kwame Anthony Appiah , president of the PEN American Center and a Princeton philosophy professor , said in a statement that he had nominated Liu Xiaobo , a recently jailed Chinese dissident , for his " distinguished and principled leadership in the area of human and political rights and freedom of expression . "
The Chinese government urged the jury to disregard the submission .
" It would be completely wrong for the Nobel Prize committee to award the prize to such a person , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Tuesday when asked about Liu's nomination in Beijing .
Former Illinois Governor George Ryan -- now imprisoned after being convicted of federal corruption charges -- was nominated by Francis A. Boyle , a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign , for his campaign to abolish the death penalty .
The Internet was proposed by the Italian version of Wired magazine , which cited its use as a tool to advance " dialogue , debate and consensus through communication " and to promote democracy .
Organizers said signatories to its petition backing the nomination include 2003 peace laureate and exiled Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi -- which would make it a legitimate entry .

For example , after holding thousands of listening sessions around the world , the U.S. has expanded exchange programs and online opportunities , forged a global recovery effort to create jobs in all regions of the world , launched a Global Technology and Innovation Fund to invest in technological development in the Middle East , Africa , and Asia , worked with Saudi officials to address H1N1 to prepare for Hajj , and partnered with the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) to eradicate polio .
At home , senior officials across the Administration – including Attorney General Holder , Secretary Napolitano , and Secretary Locke – have engaged Muslim communities around the country , and today , John Brennan , the President ’s top counter - terrorism advisor , will hold a town hall dialogue at the Islamic Center of New York University with students and community leaders from around the country .
As part of his commitment to continue to seek a new beginning with Muslim communities around the world , and to expand upon the partnerships he outlined in Cairo , I am honored and humbled that the President has asked me to serve as his Special Envoy to the OIC .
President Obama has emphasized that progress will be judged not by our words , but our actions , and I am committed to deepening the partnerships that he outlined in his visionary address last summer .
I look forward to updating you on the Administration 's efforts in these areas over the coming months .
Today 's remarks by President Obama in Doha are below :
Assalaamu alaykum .
And on behalf of the American people — including Muslim communities across America — greetings as you gather for the 7th U.S. - Islamic World Forum in Doha .
I want to thank all those whose support has made this Forum possible , especially the Amir of Qatar , the government of Qatar and the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution .
It is fitting that you gather again in Doha — a place where our countries come together to forge innovative partnerships in education and medicine , science and technology .
Thank you all for being here .
As leaders in government , academia , media , business , faith organizations and civil society , you understand that we are all bound together by common aspirations — to live with dignity , to get an education , to enjoy healthy lives , to live in peace and security , and to give our children a better future .
Yet you also know that the United States and Muslims around the world have often slipped into a cycle of misunderstanding and mistrust that can lead to conflict rather than cooperation .
That is why in Cairo last year I called for a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world , one based on mutual interest and mutual respect .
I laid out a vision where we all embrace our responsibilities to build a world that is more peaceful and secure .
It has only been eight months since Cairo , and much remains to be done .
But I believe we ’ve laid the groundwork to turn those pledges into action .
The United States is responsibly ending the war in Iraq ; we are removing all our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of August , and we will partner with the Iraqi people on behalf of their long - term security and prosperity .
In Afghanistan and beyond , we are forging partnerships to isolate violent extremists , reduce corruption and to promote good governance and development that improves lives .
We remain unyielding in pursuit of a two - state solution that recognizes the rights and security of Israelis and Palestinians .
And the United States will continue to stand for the human rights and dignity of people around the world .
And while the United States will never waver in these efforts , I also pledged in Cairo to seek new partnerships in Muslim communities around the world — not just with governments , but with people , to address the issues that matter most in our daily lives .
Since then , my administration has made a sustained effort to listen .
We ’ve held thousands of events and town halls — with students , civil society groups , faith leaders and entrepreneurs — in the United States and around the world , including Secretary Clinton ’s landmark visit to Pakistan .
And I look forward to continuing the dialogue during my visit to Indonesia next month .
This dialogue has helped us turn many of the initiatives I outlined in Cairo into action .
We ’re partnering to promote education .
We ’re expanding exchange programs and pursuing new opportunities for online learning , connecting students in America with those in Qatar and other Muslim communities .
Because knowledge is the currency of the 21st century , and countries that educate their children — including their daughters — are more likely to prosper .
We ’re partnering to broaden economic development .
We ’re working to ensure that the global economic recovery creates jobs and prosperity in all regions of the world .
And to help foster innovation and job - creation , I ’ll host a Summit on Entrepreneurship in April with business leaders and entrepreneurs from Muslim communities around the world .
We ’re partnering to increase collaboration on science and technology .
We ’ve launched a Global Technology and Innovation Fund that will invest in technological development across the Middle East , Africa and Asia .
And the first of our distinguished Science Envoys have begun visiting countries to deepen science and technology cooperation over the long - term .
And we ’re partnering to promote global health .
We worked together to address H1N1 , which was a concern of many Muslims during the hajj .
We ’ve joined with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio .
And as part of our increased commitment to foreign assistance , we ’ve launched major initiatives to promote global health and food security around the world .
To deepen these partnerships , and to develop others , I ’m proud to announce today that I am appointing my Special Envoy to the OIC — Rashad Hussain .
As an accomplished lawyer and a close and trusted member of my White House staff , Rashad has played a key role in developing the partnerships I called for in Cairo .
And as a hafiz of the Qur’an , he is a respected member of the American Muslim community , and I thank him for carrying forward this important work .
None of this will be easy .
Fully realizing the new beginning we envision will take a long - term commitment .
But we have begun .
Now , it falls to us all , governments and individuals , to do the hard work that must be done — turning words into deeds and “ Writing the Next Chapter ” in the ties between us , with faith in each other , on the basis of mutual respect .
Thank you coming to Doha in that spirit .
Thank you for your work to advance the principles we share — justice and progress , tolerance and the dignity of all human beings .
Let us succeed together .
And may God ’s peace be upon you .
Rashad Hussain is Special Envoy to the OIC
When Tila Tequila first popped onto the scene , she was the harmless , if ugly , face of fame 's grim seduction .
In the wake of " fiancée " Casey Johnson 's death , she now represents everything wrong with our modern era .
Casually tossing words like " worst " around is one of the unfortunate clichés of the current talky - head , bloggy media culture .
But Tila Tequila , through her desperate attempts to latch onto and enable an heiress who was dealing with some serious addiction and psychological problems , has done enough for her to secure legitimate claim to the title in some category .
Internet creation ?
Famewhore ?
Person in the World ?
The final straw in a career 's worth of despicable behavior came , fittingly via Twitter posts about meeting Johnson 's family , and her extraordinary display of causing a ruckus while Johnson 's long - time friends came to rescue her animals are obvious attempts to capitalize on the publicity surrounding the death of a person she has known only since early December .
Tila is either extraordinarily unwell herself or the most desperate attention - starved slug that the Celebrity Industrial Complex has ever spewed forth from its cogs .
By the time she and Johnson took up together and announced their " engagement " on December 7 , the only reason we cared was because it was so obviously desperate and sad .
Tila had latched onto the only person that would have her and the only person she could exploit for her own ends .
Once being a busty , stupid thing on MySpace was enough , but now she was a gold - digging enabler whose only " shot at love " was a drug - addicted socialite cut off from her fortune .
It was like Grey Gardens with a love connection , WiFi , and a webcam .
Now that Johnson is gone , the flurry of press coverage has been a boon for Tequila in her own mind , and a blight for the rest of us .
Like a case of herpes , she keeps coming back to torture us just when we think we 're cured .
For instance , here is what she had to say recently about the Johnson family .
A few days ago , Tequila 's Twitter ramblings got to the point where Jasmine Lennard , the British model who had Johnson arrested for grand theft , felt the need to issue a response over her own Twitter account :
You NEVER even knew her .
You have known her for a total of one month you took advantage of someone in her weakest moment .
You enabled her death and prevented her getting the help she SO DESPERATELY needed for YOUR OWN selfish purposes .
She was a classy woman who would NEVER have had ANYTHING to do with you had she been in her right mind .
You took advantage of a sick girl and YOU killed her .
Shut your mouth back the fuck off and have some respect .
Let her pass with dignity now not attached to ur smutty name .
Stop taking drugs and clean you act up .
Disgusting little girl .
Though Tila Tequila ( nee Tila Nguyen ) had been kicking around as a Playboy ( rather Playboy.com ) model and reality show contestant early in the millennium , she came to national attention in 2006 as the queen of MySpace when it was in its prime .
At the time she had 1.5 million friends on the doomed social networking site and her profile had been gawked at a record 50 million times .
Tila was truly the epitome of internet - based fame : young , scrappy , self - made , more than a little bit tawdry , and something that our parents would never understand .
We all giggled at her silly songs and aspirations to be a serious musician , but we were in on the joke .
Having Tila as one of your MySpace friends , even ironically , showed that you understood the power of the digital age .
With online notoriety came the trappings of real fame , like a book deal and a reality show .
In 2007 MTV launched A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila , her entry into the online dating show genre which differentiated itself by having both men and women compete for bisexual Tila 's heart .
The winner was doomed to fail , because her heart was set only on one thing : attention .
Season two winner Kristy Morgan must have recognized this , because she turned down her " shot at love " when it was offered to her .
Through this whole ordeal , we played along with the Tila persona , gasping at the insane antics she instigated on television , but after two seasons , we were already sick of playing this game .
Like everything on the internet , Tila learned that her trashy variety of fame — one that had no talent to back it up — was fleeting indeed .
This is when things really started to get desperate .
Instead of being cool for being gross , Tequila just became gross .
Instead of the treasure that you pulled out of the dumpster and made presentable , she was just the dumpster with all of its stench and ooze .
The hosting gig on Shot of Love was given to a pair of bisexual twins , the latest hottentots to come down the pike .
Say what you want about Tila , but she has always been easily replaceable .
When all that was gone , Tila used the only thing she had left , whoring her body out to the tabloids with a series of high - profile connections .
She took up with Courtney Semel the Yahoo heiress and self - appointed " lesbian Don Juan " who also has a romantic history with Casey Johnson .
That was good for a few rounds in the gossip news cycle .
Then she went out with Billy Corgan .
She later started dating NFL star Shawne Merriman , and when that turned sour she had him arrested for allegedly choking her .
The San Diego DA dropped the charges because they could not be substantiated .
At this point , the collective unconscious tried to expel Tila like a pesky hair caught in its mouth , but , like that hair , Ms. Tequila was n't going to be extracted easily .
She injected herself with a fresh dose of internet life blood , making strange and shocking videos on her website in the modern day version of jumping up and down and waving her arms while screaming " Look at me !
Look at me ! "
We were no longer amused .
There seems to be no way out of this .
Is it possible to ignore a celebrity — internet - created or otherwise — to death ?
It looks like Tila is about to find out .
No one wants to like her anymore , ironically or otherwise , now that she has proven herself to be both a liar and depraved conwoman .
For those same reasons , no one will hire her .
She has few skills or assets to fall back on , other than her notoriety , and that will only be marketable if she continues to ratchet up the drama .
However , at this point , no one is going to believe her self - created psychodramas , so even that will quickly lose its currency .
Face it , Tila , the world has logged out .
It 's time to sign off and get your life together , and please do it quietly and privately .
Tila Tequila is the world 's worst person .
She actually warrants the title .

Steve Coogan stars as Hades , God of the Underworld , in the film Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief which is based on a series of children 's books written by Rick Riordan .
He spoke to Sophie van Brugen about acting , awards , and why his comedy character Alan Partridge will make a comeback in the near future .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's announcement of a new U.S. policy on global Internet Freedom included a bold new statement about the responsibilities of American technology companies :
... We are urging U.S. media companies to take a proactive role in challenging foreign governments ' demands for censorship and surveillance .
The private sector has a shared responsibility to help safeguard free expression .
And when their business dealings threaten to undermine this freedom , they need to consider what ’s right , not simply what ’s a quick profit .
We could n't agree more .
While Clinton focuses on media companies — meaning Internet media companies like Google , Yahoo ! and Microsoft — there are plenty of other companies deserving scrutiny .
Specfically , many U.S. ( and multinational ) technology companies may be knowingly selling Chinese authorities the surveillance equipment used to commit or facilitate human rights abuses .
We think it 's high time to pay attention to them as well .
The " Corporations of Interest "
Drawing from published news articles , EFF has compiled a list of seven corporations that are reportedly selling surveillance technology to the Chinese government and related entities .
We 're designating them " corporations of interest " .
Of course , news articles alone are not absolute evidence that these companies are indeed fostering repression in China .
But it 's clear that China uses technology to employ rampant censorship , invasive data collection and intimidation .
Learning exactly what is going on , especially in the Chinese environment of state secrecy and propaganda , is difficult .
But news reports , especially those that include admissions of some level of involvement from company officials , are a sufficient basis to begin asking further questions .
Cisco : Cisco 's deep involvement in the building of China 's Golden Shield Project has been admitted by the company .
Cisco 's involvement has even already been raised before Congress , including the fact that Cisco engineers gave a presentation acknowledging the repressive uses for their technology that quoted their Chinese government buyers as saying that Cisco 's products could be used to " combat ' Falun Gong ' evil religion and other hostiles . "
The UK's Guardian reports that Cisco provides over 60 % of all routers , switches , and network gear to China and estimates that Cisco makes $ 500 million annually from China .
Nortel : Rolling Stone [ mirror ] and The Guardian report that Nortel has sold hardware to aid the Golden Shield Project for surveillance and censorship purposes , including working with Tsinghua University to develop speech recognition software to monitor telephone conversations .
Oracle : Business
Week reports that Oracle has sold software to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security for criminal and ideological investigations .
Oracle admits that one - third of its business in China is with the government .
Motorola : Business
Week also reports that Motorola sold the Chinese authorities handheld devices for street cops to tap into " sophisticated data repositories " on Chinese citizens .
EMC : Business
Week also reports that EMC sold " sophisticated data repositories " to the Chinese public security authorities .
The top EMC executive in Beijing is quoted as saying , " We can expect big revenue from public security agencies " in China .
Sybase : Business
Week also reports that Sybase sells database programs to the Shanghai police .
L - 1 Identity Solutions : Rolling Stone reports that this Connecticut - based biometrics company sold software to Chinese companies that aids government officials in identifying individuals for purposes of criminal investigations .
The question of which companies have assisted in Chinese surveillance is just a small piece of a very large puzzle and we 're quite confident that there are more than just these seven .
And obviously many countries other than China are engaged in Internet surveillance — from Iran 's infamous repression of political dissent , to censorship efforts across the globe , to the USA 's own domestic surveillance architecture .
Corporate complicity in these efforts is equally deserving of scrutiny .
It 's also worth keeping in mind that surveillance is only part of the equation .
Other technologies created or sold by companies may also be misused by the Chinese authorities .
For instance , Internet censorship systems curtail civil liberties almost as severely as Internet surveillance systems .
Research by the OpenNet Initiative has shown that censorship systems in many repressive countries have been outsourced to U.S. corporations .
The Solution
What comes next ?
Again , there 's simply not enough publicly available information to be absolutely certain about the extent of any one company 's active involvement or complicity .
So , a good first step would be for the companies in question to clear the air and come clean with the public about their behavior .
There are six steps we'd like to see them take :
Clarify their actual relationships with the Chinese authorities engaged in surveillance and censorship of the Chinese people .
Publicly disclose what sorts of products and services they are selling to the Chinese government .
Publicly disclose whether they have been doing " customization " or otherwise facilitating targeting of human rights activists or other vulnerable groups in China .
Publicly disclose whether they have learned that their products and services are being used for repression .
Publicly disclose how much money they make selling products and services to the Chinese government .
Publicly disclose the steps they can take to prevent their products and services being used to violate human rights .
EFF ( and presumably the State Department ) will be watching closely to see whether these and other corporations selling surveillance technologies to the Chinese authorities take these steps .
And if they do n't ?
Then it may be time for Secretary Clinton , or her allies in Congress and the Administration , to pressure them to do so .
Today 's latest report from the Congressional Oversight Panel makes it very clear that while things may feel relative lty stable right now on the commercial real estate front , the real bomb hits in 2011 .
Banks could lose $ 200 - $ 300 billion , and ' every American ' could be affected :
The full force of the commercial real estate problem will be felt over the next three years and beyond , according to the panel 's February assessment , which means it starts to get worse starting today .

Wrap-up
As a phone , the Nexus One is n't dramatically different than most GSM devices you 've probably used .
In terms of earpiece quality and volume , it 's certainly on par with its contemporaries , providing a loud , reasonably clean talking experience , though it does n't touch the Droid in terms of call clarity and evenness .
The loudspeaker , on the other hand , seemed extremely tinny to our ears , making for a pretty unpleasant companion for conference calls , with the midrange cutting through in a way that could be painful at times .
We'd be inclined to blame that issue on the extremely thin housing here , but it 's hard to say what the real culprit is .
As far as connections and 3G pickup , the Nexus fared as well as our iPhone did when traveling , but -- surprise , surprise -- neither of these could touch Verizon .
For instance , at JFK airport , we had no trouble placing calls on the Droid , but both the Nexus One and iPhone were completely incommunicado .
When we hit the ground in Las Vegas however ( you know , for a little event called CES 2010 ) , 3G seemed to function as we might have hoped .
In a few cases , T - Mobile did seem to be hanging onto a signal a bit better than AT&T was , and in a browser test between the two , even though the iPhone ended up with a slightly faster load time , the Nexus One pulled down initial content considerably quicker .
In all , we averaged download speeds of around 559 Kbps on the phone -- about where we expected things to be .
Now , the big story with the Nexus One ( besides how it 's being sold -- we 'll get to that in a minute ) has been the rumored alterations or updates Google has made with Android 2.1 .
There 's been talk that this is somehow the " real Android , " a suggestion that other , earlier versions were n't true to Google 's mold .
There 's been talk that the Nexus One is worth the hype , and will blow people away when they see what this version of Android can do .
Mostly , there 's been a lot of talk .
So , what 's really the story here ?
Well the real story is that Android 2.1 is in no way dramatically different than the iteration of the OS which is currently running on the Motorola Droid ( 2.0.1 ) .
In fact , there is so little that 's different in the software here , we were actually surprised .
Of the notable changes , many are cosmetic -- if there are major underlying differences between this OS and the one on the Droid , we can't see what they are .
Still , there ARE changes , so here 's a peek at just what Google has cooked up for the new phone .
Firstly , the place where Google really seems to have put a lot of its energies has been in the look and feel of homescreen navigation .
Obviously the feedback the company has gotten is shaping the next steps on Android 's path , and as anyone who has used Android will tell you , the homescreen situation was kind of a mess .
In 2.1 , Google has jettisoned key chunks of the established Android paradigm for how to get around its device .
Most noticeably , the company has killed the sliding drawer which used to house all of your application icons -- the tab is replaced with a handy " home " icon which zooms in your icons over top of whatever homescreen you 're on .
You can scroll up and down through those icons , which is now accompanied by a cute 3D animation where the items slide over the top and bottom edge , like wrapping a piece of paper around the side of a table .
It 's nice , but not necessarily functional in any way .
Google has also added a little bounce to the menu , in keeping with its contemporaries ' love of physics .
Additionally Google has expanded the number of homescreens accessible from three to five ( following a precedent set by skins like Sense and BLUR ) , adding a combo of webOS and iPhone style dots to help you keep track of where you 're situated .
If you long press on those dots , you get a kind of " card " view of all your homescreens which you can use for quick jumps .
All of the homescreen improvements are just that -- improvements -- and it's nice to see Google thinking about a user 's first impression of this device .
Not only do these additions bolster the look and feel of the UI , but they 're actually sensible and helpful solutions to problems which Google had heretofore approached in an obtuse way .
Elsewhere , there are nips and tucks that are welcome , such as the improved Gallery application we mentioned previously , which seems to be one of the few areas actually tapping into the Snapdragon 's horsepower .
But Google stumbles as well ; the dated and always - underwhelming music player has undergone almost zero change , and the soft keyboard -- while better than previous models -- can still be inaccurate .
Of course , Google wants to provide another option for text input that we have n't seen before the Nexus One .
Now included when the keyboard pops up is an option to use the company 's speech - to - text engine , which will ( attempt ) to translate your words into onscreen text .
Our experiments with the technology were marginally successful , but we do n't see this being a big part of our communications game until the audio recognition gets a little more robust .
It might work for an occasional SMS where use of the Queen 's English is n't a priority .
One other thing .
As we mentioned in our impressions post , there 's no multitouch on the Nexus One .
Now , we can live with a browser or Google Maps with no pinch - to - zoom , but not having a hardware keyboard hamstrings this device in other ways .
For instance , gaming on the phone is pretty much abysmal save for a few accelerometer - based titles .
And some of our favorite software , such as Nesoid ( an NES emulator ) is a total dead .
For a phone which uses touch input as its main vehicle for navigation , relegating that experience to a single digit is really kind of bogus .
There were plenty of times when using the Nexus One ( and this does happen with other Android devices as well , but it 's pronounced here ) where we felt not just bummed that you could only use one point of contact , but actually a little angry .
Why wo n't Google open this up ?
Why have they kept what has become a normal and quite useful manner of interaction away from their devices ?
Only Eric Schmidt knows for sure .
What it made us realize , however , is that an Android phone is really better off with a keyboard , and we were longing to get back to the Droid a number of times while using this device .
We have n't had a lot of time to spend with the phone just yet ( you may have heard , it 's been a bit hard to get ahold of ) , but from what we 've seen , the battery performs admirably .
Thus far we have n't had any major shockers when it came to power drain , and that AMOLED screen seems to go easy on things even when cranked up to a pretty stark setting .
That said , we did see a dip when taking long calls , which indicates that this might not be a charge - free device day to day if you 've got some serious gossip to dish .
We 're going to be running some more tests this week to see how the phone performs over a lengthier stretch of time , and we 'll let you guys know how it fares .
As of this writing , all we have on the Nexus One in terms of pricing and sales plans comes to us in the form of leaked documents and tipster screenshots .
That said , if everything falls into line the way we think it should , the sale of the phone wo n't be the kind of barnstorming industry shakeup that many predicted -- rather , it 's business as usual , with one small difference .
While the phone is manufactured by HTC and destined for use on T - Mobile 's network , Google will be the one doing the selling of the device .
By all appearances , the company will have a new phone portal where buyers can pick between an unsubsidized , unlocked Nexus One for $ 529.99 , or sign up for a two - year agreement with T - Mobile and purchase the phone for $ 179.99 .
This should n't seem strange or exciting to anyone who 's recently bought a smartphone -- it 's pretty much the lay of the land right now .
Previous to the documents we 'd seen , the hope was that Google had found some ingenious ad - supported way to get this phone into consumer 's hands for a low , seemingly subsidized price but without the shackles of a contract or specific carrier -- but those plans seem have been either invented , or somehow dashed .
Never mind the Nexus One itself for a moment -- there 's a bigger picture here , and it might spell a fundamental change for the direction of Android as a platform .
Whereas Google had originally positioned itself as a sort of patron saint for Android -- sending it off into the cold world to be nourished and advanced in a totally transparent way by the widely - supported Open Handset Alliance -- it has instead taken a deeply active role and has elected to maintain some semblance of secrecy as it moves from pastry - themed version to version .
In general , that approach is n't necessarily a bad thing for device variety , functionality , and availability , but the way Android 's evolution in particular has gone down certainly seems like a bait - and - switch from an outsider 's view .
Take Motorola and Verizon , for example : what had seemed like a deep , tight partnership literally just weeks ago with the announcement of Eclair and the selection of the Droid / Milestone as 2.0's launch platform has taken a distant back seat just as quickly as it rose to the top .
In a word , Google is plunging head - first into the dangerous game Microsoft has adamantly sought to avoid all these years on WinMo : competing head - to - head with its valued ( well , supposedly valued ) partners .
Whether Android risks losing support over manufacturers and carriers being treated like pieces of meat remains to be seen , but realistically , Motorola ( which has very publicly gone all - in with Mountain View over the past year ) and others are likely to grin and bear it as long as the platform pays the bills -- no matter how awkward competing with the company that writes your kernel and huge swaths of your shell might be .
Industry politics aside , though , the Nexus One is at its core just another Android smartphone .
It 's a particularly good one , do n't get us wrong -- certainly up there with the best of its breed -- but it's not in any way the Earth - shattering , paradigm - skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be .
It 's a good Android phone , but not the last word -- in fact , if we had to choose between this phone or the Droid right now , we would lean towards the latter .
Of course , if Google 's goal is to spread Android more wide than deep , maybe this is precisely the right phone at the right time : class - leading processor , vibrant display , sexy shell , and just a sprinkling of geekiness that only Google could pull off this effortlessly .
Then again , we suspect Motorola , Samsung , Verizon , and countless other partners might disagree .

In what is being touted as a first - of - its - kind case , an 18 year - old Swiss woman has been hit with a fine and a two year suspended jail sentence after being caught file - sharing thousands of songs and hundreds of movies by music group , IFPI .
Failure to pay her fine will lead to 30 days in jail .
Following police raids in 2004 , it eventually took 4 years to find Christian Riesen , the admin of eDonkey site ShareReactor , guilty of copyright infringement .
After all that time and effort , he was ordered to pay a fine of just $ 4,200 .
Up until now , Swiss citizens – perhaps using sites such as that operated by Riesen – have had a fairly easy ride since it is considered legal for Internet users in the country to download copyright material without the permission of rights holders .
Uploading , on the other hand , is a different story .
Although Swiss law allows the sharing of copyright works between friends and family in a closed network , sharing the same on an open and public peer - to - peer network such as BitTorrent , eD2 K or Gnutella is pushing it too far .
In recent years , many file - sharers have received the well - known ‘ pay up or else ’ letters , asking for payment of a few francs per track in order to avoid court .
But now , in what is being touted as a groundbreaking case , an 18 year - old from Locarno , the largely Italian speaking area in the Swiss canton of Ticino , has not been so lucky .
According to Swiss news reports , the unnamed woman was tracked by the Swiss branch of IFPI , while sharing and making available 4,200 songs and 270 movies .
The music group then forwarded the complaint to the public prosecutor in Ticino who took up the case .
The woman , who did not appeal , received an unspecified fine and a 2 year suspended jail sentence .
If she does not pay the fine , it will convert to a 30 day jail sentence .
As in another recent case in Sweden , it seems likely that the woman was using a ‘ shared folder ’ - style file - sharing program , such as Direct Connect or LimeWire , probably sharing her entire collection at once and making her a prime target to be made an example of .
According to the Berne - based Foundation for Consumer Protection , a group working for the last 44 years to promote consumer rights , the action taken by IFPI is excessive .
The best method to prevent infringements , they say , is via awareness and prevention , rather than oppression .
WASHINGTON  Republican Congressional leaders on Tuesday rejected President Obama ’s challenge to come up with a single comprehensive proposal to achieve his goal of guaranteeing health insurance for nearly all Americans .
But they said they would attend a televised forum to discuss the issue with Mr. Obama on Thursday , even as they voiced doubt that he and Congressional Democrats were acting in good faith .
The Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , and the House Republican leader , John A. Boehner of Ohio , made clear that they had extremely low expectations for the six - hour session .
“ We will be at the meeting on Thursday and anxious to participate in the discussion , ” Mr. McConnell said .
“ But it appears as if the administration has already made up their mind . ”
“ This idea that medicine can be used in the wake of a trauma to diminish the risk of developing a significant psychiatric disorder is incredibly important , ” said an expert who was not connected with the study , Dr. Glenn Saxe , a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Refugee Trauma and Resilience at Children ’s Hospital Boston who conducted the studies on burn patients .
“ If the findings hold up , ” he said , “ the implications are huge and go well beyond the military ”  for example , to civilian hospitals , where victims of rape and other terrifying ordeals may benefit .
Dr. Saxe and other experts cautioned that any benefit must be stacked up against the drugs ’ risks : they are habit - forming with repeated use , and can blur memories of events that can be life - changing .
In the new study , researchers at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego reviewed detailed medical records of 696 troops who had been wounded in Iraq between 2004 and 2006 , determining whether and when morphine was used in treatment .
Military doctors used the drug for most serious injuries  generally in the first two hours after the injury  but sometimes administered others , like anti-anxiety medications .
The study found that 243 of the servicemen and women were given a diagnosis of post - traumatic stress within two years of their injury .
When the severity of the wounds was taken into account , researchers calculated that the diagnosis was half as common in those who had received morphine as in those who had not .
Age , sex and the cause of injury did not significantly alter the findings , said Troy Lisa Holbrook , the study ’s lead author .

Body count , lawlessness rise in quake - ravaged Haiti
PORT -AU - PRINCE  Conditions in earthquake - ravaged Haiti grew worse Sunday as thousands of survivors begged for food and water , bulldozers dumped bodies into mass graves , and lawlessness increased .
Bulldozer after bulldozer dumped buckets full of corpses mixed with debris into a mass grave at a cemetery in downtown Port - au - Prince , the capital .
Arms and legs of victims dangled from the side of one bulldozer 's bucket as it prepared to dump bodies into a trench full of rotting , bloated bodies .
Just outside the cemetery gates , a young man who had been shot three times lay in a pool of blood on the sidewalk .
Residents said police had suspected the man and three others of stealing .
COMPLETE COVERAGE : The Haiti earthquake
" They lined up all four and shot them , " said Clifford Cadet , 15 , who explained that he'd seen the developments from the opposite sidewalk .
" This one took three shots , " Cadet said of the man lying on the ground .
There were signs of death everywhere .
The stench of rotting flesh filled the atmosphere around a collapsed T - shirt factory in the Carrefour section of Port - au - Prince .
The body of a woman poked out from the rubble , her dust - covered hair visible .
The screaming from the pile of rubble that once was Katherine Flon High School , also in Carrefour , stopped two days ago .
The four - story private Catholic institution swung to the side in the earthquake and hit a neighboring building before collapsing .
Rescuers removed 116 dead children , said school security guard Fritz Pierre .
Of the 26 who were still alive , four have since died , he said .
" There are still children in the rubble , " Pierre said .
Ivan Cruz , part of a search team from Puerto Rico , said responding to this earthquake was more difficult than searching the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
" There , we were looking for people in just one block .
Here , it 's everywhere , " Cruz said .
Outside the gates of the T - shirt factory sat Evans Brice .
The body of his girlfriend , Fiona Jean , 21 , was visible in the debris .
He has visited her daily .
" I can't help it , " said Brice , 21 , opening his wallet to show her photos .
" I love her . "
As conditions grew more challenging in the Caribbean nation , where a magnitude - 7 earthquake struck last Tuesday , the man who led recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina said Sunday that it would make more sense to have the military run relief operations in Haiti , not USAID and not bureaucrats in Washington .
" The military should have the lead as opposed to the USAID having the lead , " retired lieutenant general Russell Honore , commander of Joint Task Force - Katrina and a CNN contributor , said in a telephone interview .
" I think we need to move faster and to use every military capability we 've got . "
U.S. military units are capable of parachuting people and equipment onto a roadway near the capital and turning it into a landing strip fit for a cargo plane in a day , Honore said .
He recommended creating multiple airstrips this way .
Honore said concerns about security that have come with conducting food drops should not take precedence over getting supplies to people quickly .
" I say , when you have people dying , getting food and water on the ground should end any talk of security , " Honore said .
The military expert said Haitians could be hired to help distribute supplies , and he urged that rules that dictate that Haitians need visas to enter the USA should be broken .
" If we do n't break some of the rules , more people will die , " he said .
In spite of the growing mayhem in Haiti , there were moments of light and hope .
Earlier Sunday , rescuers pulled a dehydrated but otherwise uninjured woman from the ruins of a luxury hotel in the Haitian capital .
The incident drew applause from onlookers who have seen little reason to cheer in the past several days .
" It 's a little miracle , " the woman 's husband , Reinhard Riedl , said .
" She 's one tough cookie .
She is indestructible . "
For many , help can't come soon enough .
In the days since the disaster , food , water and medical care have trickled all too slowly out of the overwhelmed airport .
The biggest obstacle to getting relief supplies into Haiti has been a bottleneck at the airport , where aircraft have been barred from landing if they do not have adequate fuel on board to take off , said Maj .
George Hood , Salvation Army chief of communication and development .
" There 's a lack of airplane fuel once you get there , " Hood said in an interview given from his cellphone .
" You have to fly in with enough fuel to get out . "
The roads in the Dominican Republic , which shares an island with Haiti , also have proved to be an obstacle .
Dominican authorities , fearing an influx of refugees , have clamped down on border crossings .
Only two roads are passable between the Haitian capital and Haiti 's neighbor .
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki Moon arrived on a charter Boeing 737 and was met by Edmond Mulet , the acting chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission .
Ban 's first stop is going to be the five - story U.N. headquarters that collapsed in the quake , burying U.N. mission chief Hedi Annabi and many others .
Annabi's body was found Saturday .
The secretary - general says that he is " very touched and grateful " for the outpouring of international aid to help Haiti and that donors " should not waste even a single item , a dollar . "
Also Sunday , former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton rejected what some characterized as attempts to make the government 's response to the Haiti earthquake about politics .
Bush told NBC's
Meet the Press that he does n't know what critics are talking about when they claim President Obama is trying to score political points with a broad response to Haiti 's crisis .
Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has said he would n't trust that money donated to Haiti through the White House website would go to relief efforts .
Nobody knows how many died in Tuesday 's quake .
Haiti's government alone has recovered 20,000 bodies — not counting those recovered by independent agencies or relatives themselves , Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive said .
The Pan American Health Organization says 50,000 to 100,000 people perished in the quake .
Bellerive said 100,000 would " seem to be the minimum . "
Tragedy continues to play out .
At the quake - damaged Port - au - Prince Municipal Hospice , a mile from the airport , there is no food or water for 80 elderly people , administrator Jean Emmanuel said .
One man has died , " and if no help arrives , others wo n't live until tonight , " he said .
Movement around the city is difficult .
Trips that would normally take 35 minutes take two hours or more .
There are no police or security officials directing traffic .
" There 's a pressure building in the city right now , " said Steve Matthews , a spokesman from the Christian charity organization World Vision .
The United Nations said the agency is feeding 40,000 and hopes to feed 2 million within a month .
Florence Louis , seven months pregnant with two children , was one of thousands of Haitians who gathered at a gate at the Cite Soleil slum , where U.N. World Food Program workers handed out high - energy biscuits for the first time since Tuesday 's quake .
" It is enough because I did n't have anything at all , " said Louis , 29 , clutching four packets of biscuits .
The Haitian government has established 14 distribution points for food and other supplies , and U.S. Army helicopters scouted locations for more .
Aid groups opened five emergency health centers .
Vital gear , such as water - purification units , arrived from abroad .
World Vision has begun delivering crackers , bottles of water and bags of shoes and clothing for women and children .
It delivered to two makeshift camps that serve a total of 750 .
One , on empty property , was home to 457 people , said Mozard Mackensrn , 28 .
The families slept on the grass and under blankets held up by metal poles or other objects .
The delivery , which included three bottles of water per person , was the first aid the people had received since the earthquake in Haiti .
" This is the first time we 're getting food and water , " he said .
" It 's good for us . "

Elisabeth Badinter has a reputation in France for radical thinking A leading French feminist , Elisabeth Badinter , has accused green politicians of neglecting European women 's needs in a new book .
Attacking the green movement 's support for washable reusable nappies , she told French media the disposable nappy was an aspect of women 's liberation .
Women , she argued , were also being pressured into breastfeeding when for some the practice was hateful .
" We are not baboons , all doing the same thing , " she said .
Detecting a creeping return to conservative values , Mrs Badinter said a lot of European women were not prepared to accept this " regression " .
The author of The Woman and Mother Conflict pointed out that in Germany more than a quarter of women stayed without children .
' Tied to the hearth '
If women in France did not agree to breastfeed , she told the Ouest - France newspaper , they were made to feel guilty by being told : " So you do not want the best for your child ? "
" I am sorry but there are two categories of woman , " said Mrs Badinter , who is a mother of three .
" Those who like to return to the state of breastfeeding and those who hate it . "
She argued against politicians like French Green Party leader Cecile Duflot who advocate the use of washable nappies because of the plastic and chemical waste created by the disposable variety .
The feminist solution , said Mrs Badinter , was to manufacture biodegradable disposable nappies .
In September 2008 , France 's conservative government mooted a new " picnic tax " on throwaway items such as plastic cutlery but also disposable nappies .
" I am not waging war on motherhood , " said Mrs Badinter .
" I am warning young women about the return of a back - to - nature ideology , of the danger of choosing to become wives tied to the hearth .
" Let them not forget that every second or third couple breaks up and that there is nothing worse than finding yourself jobless and alone with a child . "

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Dubai is hunting for at least 26 people over the killing of a Hamas commander in a Dubai hotel in a suspected Israeli operation that has caused a diplomatic furor .
A man identified by Dubai authorities as Chester Halvey of Ireland is seen in this handout picture released by Dubai police February 24 , 2010 .
Dubai has identified 15 new suspects in the assassination of a Hamas official at a Dubai luxury hotel , bringing the total number of people believed involved in the death to 26 , the government said on Wednesday .
Israeli media reported on Wednesday the new list could involve further cases of identity theft .
Dubai authorities last week released the identities of 11 people whom they said travelled on fraudulent British , Irish , French and German passports to kill Hamas militant , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
REUTERS / Dubai Police / Handout
Hamas military commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was killed last month in his hotel room in what Dubai police say they are near certain was a hit by Israel ’s Mossad spy agency .
Dubai police added 15 new names on Wednesday to a list of suspects wanted over the killing .
Six carried British passports , three held Irish documents , three were Australian , and three French , the Dubai government said in a statement .
Israeli media reported on Wednesday the new list could involve further cases of identity theft .
Dubai authorities had earlier named 11 suspects , who they said travelled on fraudulent British , Irish , French and German passports to kill Mabhouh .
Six were Britons living in Israel who deny involvement and say their identities were stolen .
“ Dubai investigators are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of other people in the murder , ” the statement said .
The suspected killers ’ use of passports from countries including Britain and France has drawn criticism from the European Union .
Some of the governments involved have summoned their Israeli ambassadors .
“ We will not be silent on this matter .
It is a matter of deep concern .
It really goes to the integrity and fabric of the use of state documents , which passports are , for other purposes , ” Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said , as his government summoned Israel ’s ambassador .
The Dubai statement said : “ Friendly governments ( which ) have been assisting in this investigation have indicated to the police in Dubai that the passports were issued in an illegal and fraudulent manner . ”
It said pictures on the passports did not correspond to their original owners .
In a statement on Monday that European diplomats said was intended as a rebuke to Israel , EU foreign ministers said that the assassination was “ profoundly disturbing . ”
Israel has not denied or confirmed it played any role but its foreign minister said there was nothing to link it to the killing .
The United States , Israel ’s main ally , has kept silent about the affair .
VIDEO FOOTAGE
Mabhouh , born in the Gaza Strip , had lived in Syria since 1989 and Israeli and Palestinian sources have said he played a key role in smuggling Iranian - funded arms to militants in Gaza .
A Hamas official and Israel have also said he masterminded the capture and killing of two Israeli soldiers during a Palestinian uprising in the 1980s .
Like last week , Dubai police released passport photos and closed - circuit television footage of the new suspects , who police said arrived from cities including Zurich , Paris , Rome , Milan and Hong Kong .
“ This was to take the camouflage and deception to its utmost level and to guarantee the avoidance of any security supervision or observation of their movements , ” the statement said .

Once their part in the operation was completed , the suspects again dispersed to different parts of the world , with two suspects leaving Dubai by boat for Iran , it said .
Dubai police also released credit card details of some of the suspects .
At least 13 credit cards used to book hotel rooms and pay for air travel were issued by the same small U.S. lender , MetaBank .
The bank declined comment .
“ MetaBank is declining comment pending a factual review of this matter , ” it said in a statement emailed to Reuters .
Israel ’s
Ynet news website said it had tracked down a person with the same name as one of the suspects living in Tel Aviv .
“ I am in shock from what I just heard .
This is an identity theft .
I cannot believe it , ” Adam Marcus Korman , an Australian - born Israeli , told the website .
Several other names listed as suspects by Dubai police were similar to those of people listed in the Israeli telephone directory , including two named as British passport holders .
Reuters was not immediately able to contact any of those people .
Two Palestinians suspected of providing logistical support were in detention and Dubai ’s police chief has said he believes the operation could not have been carried out without information from inside Hamas on Mabhouh ’s travel details .
An official from the movement was quoted as saying last week that Hamas had launched an investigation to try to discover “ how the Mossad was able to carry out the operation .
Mossad is believed to have stepped up covert missions against Hamas and Lebanon ’s Hezbollah militia as well as Iran ’s nuclear project .
Mabhouh ’s killing was the third high profile murder in less than two years in trade and tourism hub Dubai , one of seven emirates in the UAE federation , where violent crime is rare .

So let us name them and shame them , these dangerous , complacent , self - righteous , wishy - washy liberals who threaten our national security , our vital national interests , and the personal safety of our citizens .
Here are the guilty men : Lord Judge , the lord chief justice of England and Wales ; Lord Neuberger , the master of the rolls ; Sir Anthony May , the president of the Queen 's Bench Division ; Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones .
Do n't they realise there 's a war on ?
Do n't they understand that their glib judgments hinder the efforts of the security services to save us from an ever - present threat , imperil our vital intelligence - sharing with the United States , and give comfort to our enemies ?
Who on earth do these people think they are ?
Now let us consider their fearless critics : Kim Howells MP , chairman of the Commons intelligence and security committee , who will hear not a word said against the services he is supposed to scrutinise , and wonders aloud " what the master of the rolls is doing or playing at " ; the foreign secretary and the home secretary , whose swords leap from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatens the secret services with insult ; the director general of MI5 , Jonathan Evans , who takes the almost unprecedented step of jumping into print to defend his spotless service from such mere " allegations " ; Charles Moore of the Daily Telegraph , who attacks " our snug , smug judges " for the way they " undermine " an MI5 officer ( witness B ) , accused of having put verbal pressure on Binyam Mohamed in Pakistan while knowing he had been – and might again be – tortured , " and his service [ ie MI5 ] , who take such risks on our behalf " ; Nick Cohen of the Observer ( " the judges are not alone in their desire for an easy life " ) ; and Bruce Anderson , whose extraordinary defence of torture in the Independent is headlined : " We not only have a right to use torture .
We have a duty " .
So that 's MPs , spies and ­journalists : three groups whose reputation for ­integrity , transparency , fairness and accuracy has , of course , never stood higher with the British public .
Who in their right mind could prefer , against the considered , scrupulous and nuanced verdicts of these towering moral ­authorities of our nation , the judgments of mere judges ?
Let me be clear .
We should never underestimate the terrorist threats we face , and the difficulty of detecting them in advance .
There is still too much muddle - headed appeasement of radical Islamists , some of it perpetrated and funded by other parts of the British government .
And there is no reason why judges , any more than politicians , spies and journalists , should be above criticism .
But , in this case , the criticism of the judges is entirely unwarranted .
Far from " undermining " , they are upholding what is most vital to the future of Britain : the combination of security and liberty under law .
To preserve that , in changed circumstances , requires the most careful balancing acts .
Take , for example , the judgment on appeal earlier this month which allowed the publication of a lower court 's earlier brief summary of information from US intelligence sources indicating that Mohamed had been tortured .
This begins with the clearest possible acknowledgement from the lord chief justice that " terrorism is a constant threat both here and abroad " , and it recognises " the inestimable contribution made to public safety by the longstanding co-operation between the intelligence services of this country and those of the USA " , which , it pertinently adds , " is not one - way traffic " .
It goes on to describe how the evidence that MI5 knew Mohamed had been tortured was dragged from the claws of secretive governments in London and Washington , and to weigh the balance of risk in releasing what is now already so widely known here and in the US .
We still await the court 's decision about publishing one paragraph of this recent judgment , apparently suggesting that MI5 deliberately misled Howells '
Commons oversight committee on its knowledge of this horrible business ; a paragraph which the Master of the Rolls withdrew under government pressure – itself a highly dubious procedure .
Critics accuse these judges , and the NGOs and media organisations that have pressed for openness in this affair – including the Guardian , the Times , the Independent and the BBC , for the journalistic voices I have cited are not representative of the profession as a whole – of a dogmatic " liberal " commitment to broadly defined human rights über alles .
Actually , the way these judges argue is often profoundly conservative .
The bedrock , for them , is precedents in English common law and , by extension , in British history .
Thus , for example , the recent judgment quotes Queen Elizabeth I 's secretary of state , Sir Thomas Smith : " The nature of our nation is free , stoute , haulte prodigall of life and bloud ; but contumelie , beatings , servitude and servile torment and punishment it will not abide . "
The heart of a true British Conservative such as Dominic Grieve , the shadow justice minister , should thrill to this muscular antique prose .
Only the neoconservative , that is , the illiberal radical , will spit gall at the taste of such old English spirit .
Even when the final court judgment has been delivered in this convoluted sequence , important questions will remain about the conduct of Britain 's secret services in the more than seven years of George W Bush 's " war on terror " .
Making a fresh start after the election , our new government should put the boot on the other foot .
Instead of the head of MI5 laying down the law to the judges , a judge should be commissioned to investigate the past conduct of MI5 ( and MI6 ) .
A judicial inquiry , for which the Lib Dems , the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith , and the former Conservative home secretary David Davis have already called , would have all the advantages that come with a first - rate judge : independent , rigorous , fair , responsible and discreet .
Equipped with sufficient tools for investigation , and the licence to use them , he or she should look into detailed issues raised by the Mohamed case but also broader ones .
What , at each stage , were the secret services ' rules about torture , about passing on to the US questions for those they suspected were being tortured , and about using information thus obtained ?
Who , beside " witness B " , knew what when ?
How about his superiors , including Evans himself , then head of international counter - terrorism ?
What requests for policy guidance , if any , were passed to the Home Office , Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street , and what formal or informal green , amber or red lights flashed back ?
The court says the value of intelligence - sharing with the US is " inestimable " , but perhaps it is estimateable ?
Might the inquiring judge be given , in strictest confidence , some specific examples of how it had concretely helped to make us safer ?
Why did the Commons ' committee not learn what it should have in a timely fashion ?
What lessons can be learned for the future ?
The object of all this is not to have us ruled by judges .
Quite the reverse .
It is to create the proper mechanisms of efficient , accountable , law - abiding government , even in the secret services in testing times , and of democratic oversight by a British parliament again worthy of that name , so that no one will need to have recourse to the courts .
Meanwhile , thank God – or more accurately , thank history – that we still have such judges .
Disgusted Americans who vote for politicians that talk peace yet , once elected , support wars , need to get active in between elections .
Just voting every four years wo n't hack it .
As MIT activist philosopher Noam Chomsky points out in his book " Failed States " ( Metropolitan ) , " Opportunities for education and organizing abound .
As in the past , rights are not likely to be granted by benevolent authorities , or won by intermittent actions -- attending a few demonstrations or pushing a lever in the personalized quadrennial extravaganzas that are depicted as " democratic politics '
" These tasks require dedicated day - by - day engagement " "
Failure to grasp these opportunities " is likely to have ominous repercussions : for the country , for the world , and for future generations . "
The major goal , as Chalmers Johnson writes in " The Sorrows of Empire " ( Henry Holt ) , is for Americans to " retake control of Congress , reform it along with the corrupted election laws that have made it into a forum for special interests , turn it into a genuine assembly of democratic representatives , and cut off the supply of money to the Pentagon and the secret intelligence agencies . "
He 's right , of course America today is a warfare state , the most powerful ever , and its leaders lie when they claim that small countries half way around the world with $ 5 billion annual military budgets represent a threat to Washington , which spends roughly $ 800 billion a year for war .
That 's more , by the way , than the $ 780 billion all 50 state governments combined collected in 2008 to run the country .
In his book , " House of War( Houghton Mifflin ) , James Carroll points out the Pentagon " exceeding agency and intention , has mutated into the great white whale of anarchy and destruction . "
One way to reform Congress is to stop elected officials from accepting donations , ( i.e. , bribes , ) and instead to conduct their business exclusively with public funds .
In " Free Lunch " ( Portfolio ) , Pulitzer Prize - winner David Cay Johnston writes , " Let each member of Congress spend however much he or she deems necessary to do his or her job .
If we can imbue representatives and senators with the power to make laws , surely we can give them the authority to manage their own expense accounts . "
Johnston explains , " This would come at a price :
No more free trips , no more free meals , and no more gifts .
Senator , if you need to inspect the cleanliness of the sink behind the bar at a resort in Tahiti , go right ahead , just give us the receipts with an explanation of the costs .
We will collect the receipts from every elected representative monthly and post it all on the Internet in a format that makes for easy analysis . "
Johnston urges , " Every dollar , and every meeting , must be disclosed .
And we will pay for it all , subject only to the usual penalties for embezzling , the punishments accorded by the full House or Senate because of their exclusive right to judge the fitness of members , or the decision by voters to oust a spendthrift . "
Boyle explains that under the First Amendment , civil - resistance protesters are exercising their right " peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . "
He writes that amendment " does not require their assembly to be " lawful ' in a positivist technical sense , only that it be peaceable .
Certainly ongoing criminal activity committed by officials of the U.S. government itself is the type of grievance the American people should have a right to petition for the redress of by means of civil resistance . "
David Swanson , author of " Daybreak , " ( Seven Stories ) suggests , " Work on what moves you , what would make a difference in your life and your family 's life .
Mobilize your community , your school , your clubs and organizations . "
Hundreds of peace - seeking organizations are listed at http://afterdowningstreet.org/coalition, he says .
He warns , " As the Obama presidency advances , and the ones after it as well , we will see each abuse and distortion of power that has gone uncorrected further entrenched and established and quite possibly abused and expanded upon , unless we act . "
Chomsky in " Imperial Ambitions " ( Metropolitan ) writes that labor unions " are one of the few mechanisms by which ordinary people can get together and compensate for the concentration of capital and power .
That 's why the United States has a very violent labor history , with repeated efforts to destroy unions anytime they make any progress . "
Action required ?
Organize , for better wages and for peace .
Another way to strengthen " people power " is to re-enfranchise the 5.3 million citizens " still barred from the polling stations because of some prior conviction , " writes Greg Palast in " Armed Madhouse " ( Plume ) .
" The Right to Vote campaign is fighting this Soviet - style loss of citizenship .
Notably , lifetime loss of citizenship is imposed by only seven states of the Old Confederacy under laws originally created at the behest of the Ku Klux Klan . "
Palast also urges citizens to check their voter registration .
" Check online with your Secretary of State 's office or call your County Board of Elections .
Then register your girlfriend , your wife , your mailman , and your mommy .
Contact Operation PUSH , the League of Women Voters , and your local party organization , and commit to a couple of days of door - to - door registration , especially in minority neighborhoods or at social service agency offices . "

A First Course in Complex Analysis
Matthias Beck , Gerald Marchesi , Dennis Pixton , and Lucas Sabalka
A First Course in Complex Analysis was written for a one - semester undergraduate course developed at Binghamton University ( SUNY ) and San Francisco State University , and has been adopted at several other institutions .
For many of our students , Complex Analysis is their first rigorous analysis ( if not mathematics ) class they take , and this book reflect this very much .
We tried to rely on as few concepts from real analysis as possible .
In particular , series and sequences are treated from scratch , which has the ( maybe disadvantageous ) consequence that power series are introduced late in the course .
The goal our book works toward is the Residue Theorem , including some nontraditional applications from both continuous and discrete mathematics .
A First Course in Complex Analysis is an open textbook available in two pdf versions and in paperback printed by Orthogonal Publishing ( also available from your favorite online bookseller ; make sure you order the current version 1.54 ) .
The pdf versions are identical in terms of content but have different pagination :
Instructors can request a partial solutions manual by email .
Our book is featured in the Open Textbook Initiative by the American Institute of Mathematics .
We would be happy to hear from anyone who has adopted our book for their course , as well as suggestions , corrections , or other comments .

A First Guide to PostScript
This is the fifth edition of the First Guide to PostScript .
It differs from the previous editions in that a number of errors which people have brought to my attention have been fixed and a number of common reader questions have been addressed .
I have also added some information on how to work with colors and raster graphics .
It is my hope that this document is now stable and reasonably error - free .
If you find an error , please send me e-mail and let me know .
I ca n’t promise that I ’ll fix it right away , but I will at least add it to my list of things to do .
My sincere thanks goes out to everyone who has sent me e-mail concerning the guide .
Whether you were asking a question , or offering me a correction , I sincerely appreciate it .
My only regret is that I have not been able to be as responsive to questions and corrections as I would like .
I left Indiana University quite a long time ago ( nearly ten years as of the time of this writing ) , and while I still have write access to my old account space I can not be sure that I always will have access .
I will maintain the original copy at Indiana University while I have access , but from now on the official copy will be maintained at my personal website , where you can also find out a little more about me , if you are so inclined .
This is meant to be a simple introduction to programming in the PostScript page description language from Adobe .
This document is not meant to be a comprehensive reference manual ( although it does contain an index of some of PostScript ’s standard operators and a list of various errors ) .
There are far better reference books , if this is what you need .
Instead , this is meant as an easily accessible on - line tutorial .
It was written with the assumption that you have some experience programming and are familiar with concepts like arrays and variables .
The scope of this document is fairly limited .
I cover only a subset of PostScript Level 1 ( the earliest version ) .
Since I started this guide , Adobe brought out two revisions to the language : called Level 2 and Level 3 .
This document was never meant to cover these versions of PostScript ( although the code I present here should run just fine on a Level 2 or Level 3 capable printer ) .
Likewise , I do not cover any advanced printing concepts like color separations or halftone screens ( this is mainly due to ignorance on my part , I am an engineer ... not a printer or graphic designer ... although I do admire good graphic design when I see it ) .
I have created this document because I have noticed that many people on the Internet have been asking for some online document to get them started .
I decided that this was a good opportunity .
I have benefited from the free and open nature of the Internet ( most of the software I use is freeware or shareware ) .
This is my opportunity to give something back to the community and to try to perpetuate something of the original community atmosphere that existed when I first started using it .

David Sullivan and David Gold have completed their takeover of West Ham United , buying 50 % of the club with an option to acquire the remaining 50 % .
They will have operational and commercial control of the club with immediate effect and the duo , who sold Birmingham City to Carson Yeung this season , said Gianfranco Zola will definitely stay on as the club 's manager .
The deal values West Ham at £ 105 m .
" We will spell out the book we are taking over , " Sullivan said on BBC 5 Live .
" The imbalance in the squad and the crazy wages the Icelandics were paying that brought the club to its knees . "
Sullivan confirmed that Karren Brady , who was managing director at Birmingham , will become vice - chairman at Upton Park .
He told Sky Sports that the club was in a " serious mess " .
" I do n't think we would have bought West Ham if we were n't fans .
It is a serious mess there but we are West Ham fans and it is nice to see that we beat off two foreign investors .
" Zola is absolutely staying .
I can say that categorically .
West Ham United need stability after all the recent upheavals .
We appointed four managers and parted company with two at Birmingham in 16 years .
We believe in our managers and give them the time and support they need , " he added , revealing that he wants to take West Ham into the Champions League in the next decade .
" We have a seven - year plan to get them into the Champions League .
" We are deeply and passionately involved in West Ham .
It is where I have wanted to be for 20 years .
We have done [ what we have done ] in a way that is good for Birmingham and we have got the club we wanted .
Over the next seven years we will spend a lot of money . "
Sullivan said part of their plan for the future of West Ham is to move from Upton Park to the Olympic Stadium .
" It is the natural home for West Ham , " he said .
" We hope to persuade the government to let us move into the new Olympic Stadium and I believe the people of east London would support that move . "
Sullivan and Gold became the favourites to buy the east London club after their rival Tony Fernandes , chief executive of AirAsia and team principal of the new Lotus F1 team , pulled out of the race .
Sullivan added : " West Ham is a bigger club than Birmingham with bigger aspirations and I appreciate that we have to achieve a lot more .
It will be an immense privilege to lead this great football club and more importantly its supporters .
Our first priority has to be securing the Premier League status of West Ham .
I believe the players at this club have shown great commitment in trying circumstances and the new board and I will get behind them in every way we can . "

In honor of African American History Month , the third article in our series on the Communist Party ’s 90th Anniversary surveys a few documents written by leading African American party members in the struggle against racism .
( See first and second articles in the series . )
This article limits its focus to one document in each of the following decades – the 1940s , ’50s , ’60s and ’70s .
The first document is a 1943 pamphlet , “ The Negro People and the Communists , ” by Doxey A. Wilkerson .
At this time , Wilkerson was the educational director for the Maryland Communist Party and lecturer at the Jefferson School for Social Sciences .
Before joining the Communist Party , Wilkerson served as chairman of the Department of Secondary Education at Virginia State College ; associate professor of education and summer school director at Howard University ; research associate of the President ’s Advisory Committee on Education ; editorial staff member of the Journal of Negro Education ; member of the National Advisory Committee on WPA Education Programs ; and vice president for both the American Federation of Teachers and the International Labor Defense .
In his pamphlet , Wilkerson wrote , “ Communists have always understood this need for Negro - white unity better than any other group in society .
It was Karl Marx , father of scientific socialism , who during the Civil War pronounced the famous dictum : Labor with a white skin cannot emancipate itself where labor with a black skin is branded . ”
He continued , “ In its struggle for the working class of our country , the Communist Party has always understood that the achievement of Negro rights is fundamental to the welfare of the people as a whole . ”
Wilkerson clearly understood that the struggle for African American equality and working class solidarity in general are connected ; we can not have one without the other .
He wrote , “ The Communist Party has deeply influenced the thinking of hundreds of thousands of white Americans , especially in the ranks of organized labor .
It has won increasing numbers of allies for the Negro people . ”
Undoubtedly , the Communist Party did ( and continues to ) place unique emphasis on the role of white workers in the struggle against racism .
The second document , from 1951 , titled “ We Demand Freedom ! ” reprints two speeches given by Communist Party leader William L. Patterson , who also served as national executive secretary of the Civil Rights Congress , a broad - based civil rights organization that many credit with laying the groundwork , building the infrastructure and training the cadre that would lead to the civil rights movement .
Like dozens of other Communist Party leaders , in the early 1950s Patterson was indicted under the infamous Smith Act , which in effect attempted to outlaw the Communist Party .
During this period , communists were being rounded up in every state , jailed and denied their constitutional rights .
Patterson ’s pamphlet reflects the fear and also optimism of the times .
“ We face what must become the greatest American crisis in the fight to defend our constitutional liberties and human rights , ” Patterson wrote in response to the conviction of the first 11 Communist Party leaders imprisoned under the Smith Act .
He went on to write , “ The continued existence of the Smith Act as an organic part of the law of the land spells the death knell of the democratic principles for which we have fought and bled .
It must go in the name of democracy . ”
However difficult the struggle for democracy was , Patterson was optimistic , and his optimism was based on one fundamental idea , championed by the Communist Party : unity .
“ The fight to restore the Bill of Rights can and must be mounted , ” he wrote .
“ The American people are not indifferent to the needs of the moment .
Unity in struggle is the guarantee of victory .
White men , women and youth must understand that the key to the unity of progressive America lies in the unity of black and white . ”
In 1951 , Patterson was 60 years old .
He had committed his life to the struggle for workers ’ rights , equality and socialism ; he had served as the national secretary of the International Labor Defense , where he led a worldwide struggle to defend the nine innocent Scottsboro Youth ; he had helped save the Trenton Six - African American New Jersey youth wrongfully charged with murder ; he led the defense of the Martinsville Seven in Virginia - black youth charged with the rape of a white women – andheaded the defense of Willie McGee ; he presented the landmark study “ We Charge Genocide ” to the United Nations General Assembly , charging the United States with genocide of the African American people ; during the 1960s he defended Angela Davis ( who later became a member of the Communist Party ) and other members of the Black Panther Party .
The third document is a1967 pamphlet , “ Black Power and Liberation : A Communist View , ” by Claude Lightfoot .
Lightfoot was a prominent Chicago party leader who ran for the Illinois Legislature in 1932 on the Communist Party ticket ( receiving over 33,000 votes ) , served in the armed forces during World War II , was indicted under the Smith Act , and served as secretary of the Communist Party ’s National Committee in charge of the Department of Negro Affairs .
“ Black Power and Liberation : A Communist View , ” provides a glimpse of the realities of the mid-1960s people ’s movement .
“ The present moment can be characterized as one charged with great economic , political and social turbulence , ” Lightfoot wrote .
He continued , “ In every aspect of American life there is an unprecedented degree of dissatisfaction .
The people are striking back .
Sometimes they strike according to plan .
Sometimes they erupt spontaneously .
And sometimes they hit out blindly .
But whatever the form they take , these are all struggles by the people against a system that hurts so many of them . ”
“ Basically , this growing strife arises from a capitalist system in decay , ” he added .
On black - white unity Lightfoot wrote , “ The struggle for Negro and white unity must go forward today in new forms .
Yesterday ’s approach is too mild to meet the problems of this stormy period .
The question is no longer one of just talking about black and white unity ; the problem is how to forge such unity on the basis of complete equality for black people . ”
The forth document , “ Black Liberation : A Draft Resolution , ” by Jarvis Tyner , is n’t dated .
It was first drafted in late 1969 and discussed in early 1970 , around the time of the founding convention of the Young Workers Liberation League .
It was a draft policy statement circulated by the National Organizing Committee for a New Marxist - Leninist Youth Organization – representing Communists , DuBois Club members and independent youth .
Tyner currently serves as executive vice chair of the Communist Party USA .
He started his activist career in 1959 fighting against discrimination in employment , housing and social services in his native Philadelphia .
Throughout the years he has served as national chair of the DuBois Clubs of America , leader of the Young Workers Liberation League and founding member of the Black Radical Congress , .
In “ Black Liberation ” Tyner wrote , “ A multi-racial Marxist - Leninist youth organization that is weak and / or ineffective in its Black Liberation program , considering the centrality of this question to the United States , will find itself severely crippled in projecting its program in all other areas as well .
Moreover , there is a need and tremendous potential for such a youth organization functioning within today ’s Black Liberation movement , giving added ideological strength and a stable , lasting , consistent quality to that movement . ”
Tyner continued , “ It is the continued maintenance of second - class citizenship for the Afro- American that prevents the nation as a whole from achieving even the basic democratic rights .
Racism is the chief ruling class weapon that divides and controls the U.S. working class and prevents it from propelling itself into the class struggle with sufficient vigor , militancy and unity .
This holds everything back . ”
As Wilkerson , Patterson and Lightfoot argued in the 1940s , ’50s and ’60s , Tyner also argued that democracy cannot be achieved without the participation of the entire working class in the struggle against racism .
Tyner noted that there are three aspects to the oppression of African Americans .
First , he wrote , “ there is national oppression .
This basically identifies the all - class national character of Black oppression , meaning Black people as a national group have a common history ( slavery specifically ) , are all victims of social ostracism and humiliation , economic discrimination , political inequality and racial segregation , regardless of station in life .
There is , therefore , a basis for a broad unity of all Black people extending across class lines . ”
Second ,
Tyner added , “ there is class oppression .
As workers Black people are not just exploited but are super - exploited and a source of massive super - profits for the capitalists . ”
“ The third aspect of Black oppression – racial oppression – refers specifically to racism and the physical features of Black people as a means by which they can be identified and singled out , ” Tyner concluded .
Throughout its 90 years , the Communist Party has placed special emphasis on the struggle against racism .
While the forms of struggle have looked quite different from one decade to the next , the substance has remained the same .
We find a consistency to the party ’s approach to the struggle against racism that transcends time and place ; we find a focus , a determination , unequaled in U.S. history .
While the specifics of struggle changed dramatically – be it World War II and the defeat of fascism and the right to full participation in the war effort by African American soldiers , or the broad - based unity built during the McCarthy era that eventually led to the demise of the witchhunts , or the 1960s - era civil rights struggles and antiwar movements – one thing remained constant : the party ’s commitment to black , brown and white unity as the only way to build a more just , more democratic society .

Back in 2007 , I wrote an article on free games for Linux and thought it was time to write a bit more on the subject .
Actually , I had a lot of fun doing the research for this article and telling my sons that I really was " working . "
I do n't really play that many games , so when I do , there are a few things that I look for .
Since there are so many very good games out there , I do n't waste my time on games that run poorly , or are n't aesthetically appealing .
I also do n't have time to read reams of documentation in order to get started , though I will make an exception now and then if a game is particularly intriguing .
I have a reasonably beefy machine to work and play on .
I use an AMD64 Dual Core 4200 + with 1 Gb of RAM and a GeForce FX 5200 video card .
Most game players have much better hardware , but this is primarily a work machine .
You can use these specs to get an idea of how well a given game will run on your system .
One of the responses to my previous article referred to a game that I had seemingly neglected ; I 'd like to remedy that situation now .
When I first saw Tremulous , ( Figure 1 ) I thought it was just another FPS , which does n't score many points with me , personally .
It did n't take more than 5 minutes of playing the game online to see why it was unique .
In Tremulous , there are two different types of players , Humans and Aliens , that battle against each other .
On one hand , Humans are able to carry weapons and wage war from a distance .
On the other hand , the Aliens do n't carry weapons , but are able to crawl on walls and move faster , so they tend to take a more " in your face " approach to fragging their enemy .
When a player enters a game of Tremulous , they are given the choice of joining the Human or Alien team , depending on a player 's preferred style of play .
This Alien vs. Human aspect of the game is unique enough , but then I saw what really sets Tremulous apart from most other FPS's ; I watched a Human player construct a machine gun turret during the game , and then watched the machine gun automatically target and shoot an approaching enemy !
Tremulous allows players to assume two different roles , builder or soldier .
We all understand what the soldier does in a FPS .
But the builder role is unique .
Builders are able to build and repair various structures during the game .
For example , Human builders can build automated defenses , medi-stations and tele - nodes .
Medi-stations allow soldiers to recover from injuries while tele - nodes are where players respawn when they are killed .
In fact , the object of the game is to destroy all of the other team 's tele - nodes , thus preventing them from re-entering the game .
In addition to these unique features , Tremulous provides everything else you expect in a FPS , that is , if you expect blood , guts , and bullet holes .
Falcon 's Eye ( Figure 2 ) is a modern remake of the old Net Hack game we used to play on our 80x25 terminals .
Falcon 's
Eye does a great job of preserving , and improving , what made Net Hack so unique .
With Falcon 's Eye , we have the same type of maze that we had with Net Hack , only now it 's from a 3D isometric perspective .
The objects and enemies in the game are no longer represented by sometimes cryptic ASCII characters , but now have actual graphical representations .
For better or worse , Falcon 's Eye even preserves the pet dog from Net Hack .
One of the things that made Net Hack so unique was the concept of having zero initial knowledge of the maze .
When the games starts , the player can only see what is in his immediate vicinity .
He only learns about other parts of the maze , or dungeon , as he explores it .
In Falcon 's Eye , parts of the dungeon reveal themselves as they come into the players view .
Thus , the player has to explore the dungeon before he even knows what it looks like .
Like Net Hack , Falcon 's Eye has a plethora of different enemies to fight and a seemingly endless number of dungeon levels .
One area where Falcon 's Eye improves upon Net Hack is in game control .
In Net Hack , the player had to press arrow keys , or vi editing keys , in order to move around the dungeon .
Thankfully in Falcon 's Eye , the player can use the mouse to point to where they want to go and the player 's character , and dog , faithfully move there , if they can .
In Falcon 's Eye , the dungeons are still randomly generated , and the previously explored levels are still lost forever , as in Net Hack .
I always thought it would be neat if these games would save the dungeon levels and allow you to move up and down between levels .
Oh well , if you enjoyed playing Net Hack , I think you 'll love playing Falcon 's Eye .
Glest is a real - time strategy game set in a world inhabited by humans and magical beings .
( Figure 3 . )
Up to four human or computer - controlled clans are in the game and the game supports setting up alliances between the various clans .
The human clans are made up of various soldiers and mechanical weapons while the magical clans are composed of mages and conjured beings .
Each member of the player 's clan can be issued orders such as " go here , " or " build this . "
The object of the game is to build an army , build and maintain the necessary supporting infrastructure , and defeat the enemy clans in battle .
As each member of a clan winds battles , or performs other tasks , they gain experience and gain additional , more powerful capabilities .
Glest features a single - player mode with up to 4 clans , or an on - line mode .
Once you have mastered one scenario , there are 5 more included in the game , and even more are available for download .
The graphics and sound in this game are engrossing with various types of terrain , detailed structures and monuments , night and day cycles , weather conditions , and well animated characters .
Finally , I 've found that the computer - controlled AI is quite a formidable enemy , which makes this game challenging , as well as fun .
When I first started playing UFO : Alien Invasion , ( Figure 4 . ) I was n't quite sure what to expect , but I sure did n't expect the level of detail that this games provides .
Here we have a real - time strategy game set on Earth in the distant future when all of the Earth is united and is threatened with invasion from aliens .
It 's the player 's job to manage resources , devise strategy , and fight battles to prevent this invasion .
At the beginning of the game , the player is presented with a description of the geopolitical situation on Earth , a detailed mission briefing , and various research proposals , all very interesting reading , actually .
Next , the player chooses a location for their first base .
Then things get detailed .
The next task for the player is to actually equip the base camp and hire workers , scientists , soldiers , and medics .
The player is presented with a list of prospective employees to choose from , complete with a full name , picture , and various statistics about the applicant .
Once hiring is done , and before any missions , the soldiers can each be equipped with various weapons and supplies .
I underestimated how important this was until I lost my entire squad in my first mission .
Once a mission has commenced , UFO becomes a turn - based strategy game where you control your units in order to complete their mission , such as neutralizing the unknown number of aliens that have terrorized a city .
The graphics and sound in this game are stunning , and once again , the AI is sophisticated .
The aliens seem to use attack - and - evade tactics that make them difficult to defeat .
Based on the fact that the base camp has many different types of buildings , an alien containment center , for example , and each one has a status report available , I tend to believe that I 've only scratched the surface of the complexity of this game .
Finally , what could possibly be better than strolling around in an Algerian villa ... with a large caliber assault riffle ?
Urban Terror quickly became my all - time favorite FPS .
In fact , this article was delayed while I " researched " this game more thoroughly .
( Figure 5 ) Unlike most FPS's , which are a bit too Gothic for my taste , Urban Terror is set in various cities and villages , mostly outdoors .
This game really gives you an idea of what it must be like to fight in the streets .
As with most FPS's , you have a wide selection of realistic weapons and equipment .
However , what often disappoints me with other " modern warfare " FPS's is that it 's often possible to find an unassailable position and just sit there sniping other players .
I also do n't like the " jump and run " game play that 's so common with this type of game .
Urban Terror does n't seem to have these issues ; it 's just a very real , very intense game .
If you enjoy FPS's , Urban Terror is a must - have .
Well there you have it , five more free games that I think are some of the best available for Linux .
If you have other suggestions , please let me know about them .

H&M got in trouble late last year for destroying unused clothing instead of giving it away to charity ; now the clothing giant is under fire again for selling certified organic cotton clothing that is n’t actually organic .
The Swedish company is n’t the only retailer being accused of fraud–European companies C&A and Tchibo are also being accused of selling organic cotton tainted with GMO cotton from India .
The most troubling part : none of the companies involved knew that the organic cotton was n’t pure .
According to independent testing laboratory Impetus in Bremerhaven , 30 % of tested organic cotton from the stores in question contained genetically modified material .
The fraud is probably bigger than just these three brands–all of the tested cotton came from India , which produced 61 % of all organic cotton last year .
It ’s hard to say what should be done to prevent organic cotton fraud from continuing .
Ecotextile News writes :
There has been a strong suggestion in the sustainable textile industry that all has not been well in certain sections of the Indian organic cotton sector for some time .
Reports from reliable , trusted organisations and producer groups about fraud within the Indian sector of the organic cotton industry have been common - place .
The industry now needs to establish firmer rules of governance over organic cotton production , while brands need to invest more in improved supply chain transparency and more thorough testing .
Fair enough , but supply chain transparency and testing does n’t come cheap –without serious pushback from customers , what incentive do chains like H&M have to prevent GMO cotton from slipping into their clothing ?

Of Labor Notes and Time Stores Share This :
One way in which communities tried to forge an economic network was through issuing private currency ; Josiah Warren 's experiment with Labor Notes and a Time Store is a prime example .
I was reminded of it today while reading an article in MSN's Money entitled
Last year , two Detroit tavern owners were sitting at the bar , sampling their beverages and bemoaning the local economy -- no one in the city had cash , and when they did , they spent it in the suburbs .
Then the pair hit on a solution : Print their own money .
It is , after all , perfectly legal for anyone to issue currency , as long as it does n't look too much like a U.S. dollar .
Thus was born the Detroit cheer , a local scrip accepted by a handful of city businesses , including a pizzeria , an electrician and a doggy day care center ....
The western Massachusetts berkshare is accepted by an estimated 400 businesses and has circulated to the tune of $ 2.5 million -- not bad for a region with 20,000 residents .
The hours currency , issued in Ithaca , N.Y. , is so entrenched that the local transit system is planning to accept it .
Still , University of Southern Maine sociologist Ed Collum says his study of 82 local currencies revealed a disheartening 20 % survival rate .
Collum favors an increasingly popular twist on local currencies : the time bank , which has residents swapping labor hours rather than cash .
This newer solution lets the unemployed participate without spending money .
I 've always been fond of Warren 's Labor Notes even though I believe the economic principles they reflect are fundamentally flawed .
It is similar to the positive predisposition I have toward Mennonite communities or other peaceful ways of organizing that buck the trend and express a different worldview .
Warren is a particularly interesting figure in the history of utopian movements because he was intimately involved with several communities .
He was both a radical individualist and a communitarian to his core ; he spent most of his life trying to integrate those two ideals .
Warren confronted the problem of how to achieve the social advantages of community without sacrificing individual rights and choice .
His quest for a just society had started in February 1826 when he became one of the original settlers of the famous Owenite community of New Harmony .
Other experimental communities had followed through which Warren had observed how social theories operated when they were put to the test of functioning in the real world .
For better or worse , Warren adopted the economic doctrine of cooperation that was expressed through the formula of â€œlabor for labor.â€ 
But Warren realized that just having each man claim his own labor and its products would not lead to an advanced society .
There had to be a medium of exchange : that is , society needed some form of currency that would enable it to rise above the level of brute barter or the need of each person to provide for his own needs .
Warren believed that part of the answer lay making labor the basis of a circulating currency that he called â€œlabor notes.â€ 
In using cost as the limit of price , Warren was specifically objecting to the use of value as a standard of measurement .
If subjective value were the limit of price , he believed that a good would rise to whatever level the seller was able to charge .
Price would be determined by the desperation of the buyer .
For example , a loaf of bread might cost ten thousand dollars to a starving man , or a bottle of medicine might cost twenty thousand to a mother who needed it for her child .
To Warren , this seemed unjust .
Thus , instead of subjective measure setting the price , Warren wanted cost to be the objective measure and the limit .
For a loaf of bread , a baker should charge only what it had cost him to make , including such costs as the labor expended , the â€œrentâ€ of his oven and other tools , taxes , etc .
Cumulatively , these factors constituted the entire cost of the bread , which was its price .
To Warren , this made price into an objective , scientific matter .
And , as always , Warren sought to test his theory in a real community .
On May 18 , 1827 , in Cincinnati , Warren opened what he called a Time Store .
The libertarian historian James J. Martin has dubbed it â€ œthe first scientific experiment in cooperative economy in modern history .
â€
Warrenâ€™s store worked on the basis of exchanging staple commodities , such as flour , priced at his own cost for the labor notes of customers .
Upon opening his Time Store , with three hundred dollars worth of staple goods within , Warren posted a bill for public view , stating what each good had cost him and adding a 7 percent fee for overhead expenses such as shipping .
This posted bill constituted the cost of the goods .
In exchange , Warren received a labor note from the pur-chaser , which represented an equitable amount of the purchaserâ€™s time .
One of the advantages of the system was that people were far less inclined to bargain at length over prices because they were paying for the shopkeeperâ€™s time .
Warren explained the process : â€ œA clock was in plain sight to measure the time of the tender in delivering the goods which was considered one - half of the labor , and purchasing , etc. the other half.â€ 
The exchange was more sophisticated than a mere hour for hour basis , however .
Warren exchanged what he called â€œequivalent labor.â€ 
He wrote , â€ œI have placed emphasis on the idea of equivalent labor , because it appears that we must discriminate between different kinds of labor , some being more disagreeable , more repugnant , requiring a more COSTLY draft upon our ease or health than others .
The idea of cost extends to and em-braces this difference .â€ 
Interestingly , this led Warren to the conclusion that the most disagreeable work , such as cleaning sewers , should be among the highest paid in society .
Of course , factors such as â€œrepugnanceâ€ were subjective mattersâ€ ” embodying the same subjectivity that Warren objected to in value as the measure of price .
This meant that each individual must set the price for his own labor because each person is best able to estimate his own costs .
Warren uses the example of coat making .
Two coat makers with different levels of skill and working habits would probably set entirely different prices for a new coat .
A fast working coat maker who produced a mediocre product might charge twenty hours of labor for a new garment .
A slower coat maker who produced an exceptional garment might charge forty hours .
Warren also seems to have considered the problem of opportunity costs regarding interest : namely , if someone loans out money to another , he is thereby foregoing other investment opportunities for that same capital .
â€ œIf you sacrifice twenty dollars ( to which you are equitably entitled ) in lending me a hundred , then . . . twenty dollars , or twenty per cent together with pay for your labor would be your proper compensation .â€ 
Despite such problems , Warren believed that labor notesâ€ ” and Cost the Limit of Price in generalâ€ ” would guarantee both equitable reward for the laborer and a harmonious society .
â€ œCosts being the limit of price , everyone becomes interested to reduce cost , â€ ” to lighten each otherâ€™s burdens !
Then , every manâ€™s hand acts with instead of against every man , and HUMAN INTERESTS ARE HARMONIZED!â€ 
Warren closed the Time Store after three years , convinced ( along with many others ) that â€œlabor for laborâ€ and Cost the Limit of Price had proven to be a viable economic arrangement .

When Warren began publication of The Peaceful Revolutionist ( 1833 ) -- the first Individualist - Anarchist periodical to appear in America -- it called for a voluntary society that was based on individual autonomy and that operated in accord with the labor theory of value .
The latter sounds odds to the ears of modern libertarians but the labor theory of value was commonly accepted economic theory among the 19th century crowd .
The specific expression was called " Cost the Limit of Price " ; this was a version of the labor theory of value , which Warren believed was a necessary prerequisite to ensure an equitable reward for labor to the laborer .
For better or worse , Warren adopted the economic doctrine of cooperation that was expressed through the formula of â€œlabor for labor.â€ 
But Warren realized that just having each man claim his own labor and its products would not lead to an advanced society .

The utopian communities in 19th century America provide some fascinating lessons as to how and why human beings come together to form a society .
The communities organized around divergent principles from religious purity to socialistic zeal ... and ideals of radical individualism .
( The echoes of libertarian ones can be felt today in structured efforts like the Free State Project in New Hampshire to less official ones like Doug Casey 's libertarian oasis in Argentina . )
Generally speaking , the communities shared similar problems -- e.g. how do you deal with " the other " in your midst ? -- and many of them evolved similar solutions .
The value of examining these solutions is often independent of whether or not they ' succeeded ' ; just as in life , sometimes you learn the most from your mistakes .
One way in which communities tried to forge an economic network was through issuing private currency ; Josiah Warren 's experiment with Labor Notes and a Time Store is a prime example .
I was reminded of it today while reading an article in MSN's Money entitled " Struggling towns printing their own cash . "
It opened , I 've always been fond of Warren 's Labor Notes even though I believe the economic principles they reflect are fundamentally flawed .
It is similar to the positive predisposition I have toward Mennonite communities or other peaceful ways of organizing that buck the trend and express a different worldview .
Warren is a particularly interesting figure in the history of utopian movements because he was intimately involved with several communities .
He was both a radical individualist and a communitarian to his core ; he spent most of his life trying to integrate those two ideals .
Warren confronted the problem of how to achieve the social advantages of community without sacrificing individual rights and choice .
His quest for a just society had started in February 1826 when he became one of the original settlers of the famous Owenite community of New Harmony .
Other experimental communities had followed through which Warren had observed how social theories operated when they were put to the test of functioning in the real world .
KASHGAR , China –
What 's going on in Kashgar ?
The bulldozers have gone silent and demolition dust settled in Kashgar ’s Old City district in recent months , leaving the fate of the 2,000 - year - old enclave uncertain and offering a sliver of hope that it might survive .
Yet a public relations campaign boasting the benefits of tearing down the ancient Silk Road hub to replace it with a jazzier , new version of itself is underway , evidenced by a billboard affixed to a mud brick wall in town .
The sign hints that demolition of Kashgar ’s Old City — a controversial government undertaking facing international criticism from heritage and human rights groups – has the backing of Unesco , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization .
The colorful sign focuses on the June meeting between city officials and Beatrice Kaldun , Unesco ’s cultural specialist in Beijing .
It insinuates Kaldun praised demolition plans for the Old City — a swath of traditional Islamic architecture so well - preserved and authentic it was used as the backdrop for the “ Kite Runner , ” a film set in 1970s Afghanistan .
A billboard claiming the " renovation " deserves " international admiration . "
( Sharron Lovell / GlobalPost )
The sign goes further , saying Kaldun and others agreed of the project : “ We do consider it an action deserving of admiration internationally . ”
Kaldun said the sign is just wrong .
“ I ’m very concerned about this billboard , ” said Kaldun .
She did visit Kashgar in June , met with officials and reviewed the plans .
Then , she told them the project needs to respect local people and customs , and made it clear wide - scale demolition would damage hope of adding Kashgar to a World Heritage preservation list .
China has not proposed that , but Kaldun thinks the carrot might work .
“ My second point was that as Unesco , we are concerned about preserving heritage , ” said Kaldun .
In the sign , “ they cut off this part . ”
It remains unclear how much of the Kashgar ’s Old City China will keep , and the situation has grown murkier since the region exploded in ethnic turmoil last summer .
About 1,000 families were reportedly moved from the Old City to new apartment blocks in the first half of last year , with dozens of homes and businesses torn down as the plan moved forward as scheduled .
But after ethnic riots seized Xinjiang ’s capital Urumqi in July , locals say , demolition slowed then stopped , with 5 to 10 percent of the Old City now flattened .
About 1,000 of 50,000 families in the Old City have been relocated .
Local speculation holds that continuing destruction would fan flames of discontent among Uighurs , who make up the town ’s overwhelming majority .
Cold fall and winter weather added to the slowdown .
For Uighurs , a Muslim ethnic group closely related to Turks , destruction of Kashgar ’s Old City is deeply personal .
Critics argue the rebuilding is not about earthquake safety , as Chinese officials have said , but about cultural assimilation of a problematic ethnic group .
“ Kashgar Old City is as important to the Uighurs as Jerusalem is to Christians , Jews and Muslims , ” said Henryk Szadziewski of the Washington , D.C. , - based Uyghur Human Rights Project .
“ It is a physical embodiment of the Uighur identity , signifying its past present and future . ”
Kashgar ’s Old City is also an anomaly in modern China : A well - preserved , relatively untouched section of ancient but living architecture .
Most of China ’s cities have undergone sweeping facelifts amid the country ’s economic boom , but the Old City of Kashgar , a small piece of the larger city of more than 3 million residents , is set off from modern city by a river and hills , distinctly unique and almost out - of - place .
Kashgar ’s foreign affairs office did not return phone calls seeking comment on the billboard , but Kaldun says a letter she sent the city objecting to the sign has brought results .
Unesco has been promised the sign will be replaced with one containing text the U.N. body approves .
But the flawed billboard remains , leading locals to believe the international community supports plans to tear down the Old City .
In Kaldun ’s opinion , the apparent delay in demolition and possible new attention on Kashgar ’s Old City could be a gift .
There is , she said , still a chance to convince officials to preserve more .
“ We are concerned about cultural heritage and it ’s a whole cultural heritage that ’s being destroyed , ” said Kaldun .
“ It ’s more than just buildings . ”
Google has publicly announced that that it will cease censorship of its Chinese language , Google.cn website , and is reviewing the feasibility of its entire operation in that country .
This follows its detection of malicious attacks on the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists and what Google calls an " attack on their corporate infrastructure originating from China . "
When Google first launched a filtered search engine in China , EFF was one of the first to criticize it ; we'd now like to be one of the first to commend Google for its brave and forthright declaration to provide only an uncensored Chinese language version of its search engine .
Our hope is that other tech companies will follow Google 's lead .
Too many of them have been willing to comply with Chinese demands that they check their values at the border .
Of course , whatever the reaction from Chinese authorities , this does n't mean that Google will vanish from the Chinese Internet .
There continue to be many ready means for circumventing China 's censorship schemes , and we hope Google will continue to provide an uncensored Chinese language search engine , from servers outside China if need be .
We recognize that there may be short - term economic and political consequences for the company : but if it stands firm in its commitment to provide Chinese citizens with an uncensored view of the Net , we feel sure there will be opportunities and benefits not just for Chinese citizens , but for Google and companies that follow its lead .
The Internet is global , but it relies on a physical infrastructure that is vulnerable to national policies and clumsy attempts to block and censor .
The Chinese authorities will no doubt continue to try to censor the Internet as seen by their own citizens , and malicious attacks will continue against those who seek to use uncensored services and secure communications in the exercise of human rights .
Google has stepped up to this challenge : now it 's up to technologists and policymakers to build the tools and to apply the political , economic and cultural pressure to allow citizens in repressive regimes to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through an uncensored Net and maintain their access to the collective knowledge of humanity that it makes possible .
In the original text of this commentary , we stated that Google " restored " an uncensored Chinese language version of its search engine , which is inaccurate .
As well as the filtered google .cn , Google has always provided an uncensored Chinese index on its google .com site .

The Copland Crisis By August , Apple 's new executive VP , R& D and chief technology officer , Ellen M. Hancock , recognized Copland for the bloated piece of inferior vaporware that it was ( it did n't adequately address the Internet and lacked memory protection ) and froze all aspects of its development not directly related to the Harmony and Tempo releases .
The developer community , which had invested years of effort working on Copland and had stuck by Apple through tough times , freaked .
Amelio promised to announce Apple 's revised OS strategy at the upcoming Macworld Expo in San Francisco on January 7 , 1997 .
Apple executives began a frantic scramble to locate a technology partner .
One of the first places they turned to was Be ( www .be com , a small Menlo Park , California , company started by Jean - Louis Gassée after he resigned as president of Apple Products on September 30 , 1990 .
Gassée had tried to sell Be to Apple 's then - CEO Michael Spindler in 1995 .
" I told Mike that Copland might develop a flat tire on the road to greatness and they might want to buy some insurance , " claims Gassée .
As predicted , Copland started bogging down , and the nimble Be began generating very favorable press .
On October 3 , 1995 , Be introduced the BeBox , a computer powered by two 66MHz PowerPC 603 processors and up to 256MB of RAM .
It boasted a SCSI II bus , 16 - bit CD - quality sound , three PCI slots , four MIDI , four serial ports , and five ISA slots .
The BeBox ran a multithreaded , memory - protected , object - oriented , preemptively multitasking operating system .
A bare - bones box cost only $ 1,600 , and a moderately configured model would set you back just $ 3,000 .
No doubt , the system was impressive , but analysts wondered if Be was n't making the same mistakes as Steve Jobs ' NeXT , which had failed to find a market for its own advanced , proprietary OS and hardware .
Gassée begged Red Herring , " For God 's sake , do n't compare us to NeXT .
We want to be a better tool for developers , not to be tasteful .
We do n't cost $ 10,000 .
We have a floppy drive .
We do not defecate on developers . "
It was speculated that Gassée never really wanted to be in the hardware business and had always hoped to one day sell the BeOS back to Apple for a tidy profit .
Now it looked like that dream might become a reality .
In August 1996 , Gassée presented Apple with seven different ways of using Be 's technology .
During her stint at IBM , Hancock saw the effect that Microsoft 's OS licensing agreements had on Big Blue and insisted that Apple was only interested in buying
Be outright , not licensing any of its technology .
If Apple wanted to buy Be , that was fine by Gassée , but he overplayed his hand .
In October , Gassée flew to Kauai , Hawaii , for a two - hour meeting with Amelio , who was giving a speech to Apple 's Asia - Pacific sales force .
Gassée proposed returning to Apple with his 50 - person
Be team .
He would report to Hancock but wanted to oversee work on all future operating systems .
While Gassée offered to work for one dollar a year , his backers demanded 15 percent of Apple and a seat on Apple 's board of directors .
Apple 's due diligence placed the value of Be at about $ 50 million and in early November it responded with a cash bid " well south of $ 100 million , " according to Gassée .
Be felt that Apple desperately needed its technology and Gassée 's expertise .
Apple noted that only $ 20 million had been invested in Be so far , and its offer represented a windfall , especially in light of the fact that the BeOS still needed three years of additional expensive development before it could ship ( it did n't have any printer drivers , did n't support file sharing , was n't available in languages other than English , and did n't run existing Mac applications ) .
Direct talks between Amelio and Gassée broke down over price just after the Fall Comdex trade show , when Apple offered $ 125 million .
Be 's investors were said to be holding out for no less than $ 200 million , a figure Amelio considered " outrageous . "
Although the BeOS excelled at many things , Apple felt it was missing several crucial features and would require considerable work to bring it up to Apple 's standards .
Apple was committed to revealing its OS strategy in January 1997 , so Gassée knew Apple did n't have the luxury of time .
One person close to the negotiations claims that Gassée quipped , " A man in the desert does n't bargain on the price of water . "
To increase the pressure on Apple , Be signed up the preeminent Mac clone maker Power Computing as a licensee for its BeOS , and Gassée intentionally leaked progress of the negotiations to the press , which infuriated Apple executives .
With
Be playing hard to get , Apple decided to play hardball and began investigating other options .
Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows NT , Sun Microsystems ' Solaris , and even the ill - fated Taligent , which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995 .
Hancock was partial to Unix - based Solaris , while COO Marco Landi preferred cutting a deal for Windows NT .
To hedge her bets and assuage egos , on November 15 , Hancock authorized Copland engineers to devise a plan to salvage their work by releasing a less - ambitious version .
Just before Thanksgiving , Steve Jobs called Amelio to discuss Apple 's OS strategy , offer his advice , and urge him to steer clear of Be ; he thought its software was wrong for Apple .
On November 25 , a mid-level manager at NeXT , Garrett L. Rice , contacted Hancock to discuss licensing the company 's OPENSTEP operating system .
Two days later , a couple of Apple engineers and a manager were meeting with some NeXT managers to see what they had to offer .
OPENSTEP was technically elegant but had failed to make much of a dent in the market .
Jobs had hired Goldman , Sachs & Company to take NeXT public earlier in the year , but the IPO never got off the ground since the firm 's only profit came in 1994 when it earned $ 1.03 million on revenues of $ 49.6 million .
Now it looked like maybe he could sell NeXT after all , to none other than the company he founded 20 years prior .
On December 2 , Jobs met with Amelio , Hancock , and Douglas S. Solomon ( senior VP of strategic planning and corporate development ) , in an eigth floor conference room next door to Amelio 's office .
It was the first time he had set foot on Apple 's Cupertino campus since leaving in 1985 .
Jobs pitched NeXT as Apple 's only hope at getting its OS back on track .
It was a radical departure from the Copland project , but OPENSTEP was a proven technology , unlike BeOS .
Apparently Jobs ' reality distortion field was set to stun that day , because two days later Hancock informed Apple 's board that they were seriously considering buying NeXT .
On December 9 and 10 , teams from NeXT and Be separately conferred with eight of Apple 's senior managers , including Amelio , in a technology shootout at the upstairs meeting room of the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto .
Avadis " Avie " Tevanian Jr. , Ph. D , NeXT 's VP of engineering , gave the OPENSTEP demonstration , and Jobs boasted that their OS was still five to seven years ahead of its time and perfectly suited to Internet and multimedia creation , two of the Mac 's few remaining strongholds .
He turned over NeXT 's financial papers , which showed that NeXT suffered net losses of nearly $ 50 million from 1993 through mid-1996 , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Privately , Jobs asked Amelio if he could be on the board of directors , but the board voted down that idea and Amelio instead asked him to stay on as an advisor .
Gassée miscalculated , thinking that Be had the deal already wrapped up and that this meeting was a mere formality .
He had nothing new to present to the Apple contingent , and they resented it .
On December 20 , Apple announced its intention to purchase NeXT Software in a friendly acquisition .
When the deal went through on February 4 , 1997 , the total purchase price , including the fair value of the net liabilities assumed , was $ 427 million , which comprised $ 319 million in cash , 1.5 million shares of Apple stock ( valued at $ 25 million ) , options on 1.9 million shares ( valued at $ 16 million ) , cash payments of $ 56 million to the NeXT debtholders , cash payments of $ 9 million for closing and related costs , and $ 2 million of net liabilities assumed .
As the largest shareholder of NeXT ( he owned 45 percent ) , Jobs personally pocketed $ 100 million in cash and all 1.5 million shares of Apple stock , which he agreed not to sell for at least six months .
All NeXT products , services , and technology research became part of Apple .
Amelio now admits that Apple overpaid for NeXT , but it had little choice given the dire straits the company was in at the time .
Jobs assured Apple that , although his OPENSTEP had been on the market for years and had failed to gain widespread acceptance , it was still ahead of its time Amelio told the world , " The next chapter in Apple 's history begins today " with the merger of Apple and NeXT .
In explaining the choice , Amelio wrote , " As we looked at various partners for our operating system development , we discovered that Apple and NeXT had surprisingly complementary products , technologies , and services .
In fact , the more we looked at the two companies , the more we realized that we each were strong where the other faced challenges , and in many ways we filled in the blanks in each other 's strategies .
For example , Apple needed a truly modern operating system and NeXT had an exceptional operating system with modern services and APIs .
At the same time , NeXT needed a high - volume installed base and Appleß one of the world 's largest personal computer manufacturersß has sold more than 26 million Macintosh systems . "
In a statement released the night Apple purchased NeXT , Jobs wrote , " Much of the industry has lived off the Macintosh for over ten years now , slowly copying the Mac 's revolutionary user interface .
Now the time has come for new innovation , and where better than Apple for this to spring from ?
Who else has consistently led this industryß first with the Apple II , then the Macintosh and LaserWriter ?
With this merger , the advanced software from NeXT will be married with Apple 's very high - volume hardware platforms and marketing channels to create another breakthrough , leapfrogging existing platforms , and fueling Apple and the industry copy cats for the next ten years and beyond .
I still have very deep feelings for Apple , and it gives me great joy to play a role in architecting Apple 's future . "
After the fanfare surrounding the acquisition of NeXT , Apple was surprisingly quiet about its plans for Rhapsody , the name it gave to its new NeXT - based high - end operating system .
Instead of betting everything on Rhapsody , the plan called for a dual - OS strategy , with the venerable Mac OS aimed at the consumer desktop market and Rhapsody targeted at servers and enterprises , just as Microsoft has segmented the markets for Windows 98 and NT .
Apple successfully released several Mac OS upgrades containing technologies originally developed for Copland , such as the multithreaded Finder and Appearance Manager that shipped in Mac OS 8 .
Apple was following a plan to continue improving the old warhorse as long as possible , using the periodic upgrades to fuel cash flow .
" It 's not like wine ; it does n't age very well . " - Apple CEO Gil Amelio , on Copland Like NeXT ,
Be started off making its own proprietary hardware , but the real value of both firms was in their operating systems
Be CEO Jean - Louis Gassée knew he had Apple in a tight spot , but he asked for too much " I 've got them by the balls , and I 'm going to squeeze until it hurts . "
-
Be CEO Jean - Louis Gassée , describing his negotiating tactics Steve Jobs says he initially contacted Apple simply to warn it against buying Be , but he soon had Apple interested in NeXT
In the late 1980s , Hancock 's former employer , IBM , paid NeXT a reported $ 50 million for access to its technology but ultimately did nothing with it .
" The reality is that we live with System 7 .
Despite it being tarred and feathered , it will be around in some form for 10 years . "
- Gil Amelio , in a San Francisco Chronicle interview conducted just days before Apple bought NeXT " We choose Plan A instead of Plan Be . "

Bikini - clad Bianca Gasciogne and ex-Wag Charlotte Mears buddy up for a beach side break
By Daily Mail Reporter
Charlotte Mears and Bianca Gascoigne have decided to ditch the footballer boyfriends teaming up for a girls only break in the footballer ’s favourite resort Marbella .
The two women frolicked on the beach , with Bianca , 21 , even treating onlookers to an impromptu pole - dancing session .
And amazingly , their seaside adventure was captured in all its glory by a conveniently located photographer .
The perfectly groomed girls clearly had no problem being spotted by the cameras , who appeared to hang around for quite some time to catch their adventures on film .
Best buddies : Bianca Gascoigne and model Charlotte Mears enjoy the sun and surf in sunny Marbella
Following her intense training for Celebrity Gladiators , Bianca Gascoigne shows off her stunning new shape with fellow model Charlotte Mears in Marbella
Help at hand : Bianca rubs some essential suntan oil on her friend Charlotte
It was her bikini - clad appearances on show Love Island which first brought curvy Bianca Gascoigne to the attention of the public .
And clearly her love of the skimpy outfit has n’t waned as she wore a carousel of colourful two - pieces , and a toned figure , fresh from her stint on Celebrity Gladiators .
Following her intense training for celebrity version of the show which recently returned to television on Sky One , Bianca proudly showed off her newly honed shape in a bubblegum pink number , and black boho embroidered number .
While Charlotte , 22 , wore a yellow and white striped number and a flamenco red frilly two - piece .
Beach babes : Bianca and Charlotte 's bikinis were made for beach - walking
Bianca previously spoke about her curvy figure , professing to be unhappy with it .
She told OK : " My feet are too big , my thighs wobble and my bum is n't toned .
I would n't be happy unless I looked like Angelina Jolie . "
She has since worked hard on toning her figure , and on her 21st birthday she had breast implants to increase her bust size to a 34DD .
Charlotte has a smile on her face following her traumatic break - up with Portsmouth striker Jermain Defoe .
Jermain , 25 , broke their engagement off in November and moved straight onto model Danielle Lloyd .

Public pole - dancer : Bianca Gascoigne demonstrates her skills on the pole
Charlotte admitted she was so devastated she needed therapy to recover and is investing in £ 4,000 worth of new boobs .
She said : ‘ I did n’t want them to be much bigger , just fuller , so I went from a 32C to a 32D .
They ’re a better shape now and I definitely feel sexier because of them . ’
Bianca , who was born in 1987 , was five when her mother Sheryl met England footballer , Gascoigne .
She was 10 - years - old when they married .
She has one brother , Mason , and half brother , Regan , whose is Paul Gascoigne ’s son .
She spoke out recently about Gazza 's well - documented troubles saying the family were " powerless " to help him recover from alcoholism and depression .
Last year she wept after being given a 17 - month driving ban for drink - driving after she crashed her new £ 35,000 Mercedes while drunk and admitted to being almost twice the legal limit .

Can battlefield robots take the place of soldiers ?
By Chris Bowlby
Robo Wars , BBC Radio 4
Can battlefield land - robots be made to obey the rules of war ?
Can war be fought by lots of well - behaved machines , making it " safer for humans " ?
That is the seductive vision , and hope , of those manufacturing and researching the future of military robotics .
With 8,000 robots already in use , they believe they can bring about a military revolution .
Most of the robots currently deployed on land deal with non-combat tasks such as bomb disposal - unlike lethal aerial drones .
But Bob Quinn , who works for the US subsidiary of the British robot manufacturer QinetiQ , says the future promises more armed robots on the battlefield , including driverless vehicles .
" The closer you are to being shot , the more you understand the value of having a remote weapons capability , " he says .
LISTEN TO THE PROGRAMME Robo Wars is on Radio 4 on Monday 8 February at 2000 GMT
Or listen via the BBC iPlayer Anyone who has seen the Terminator films may find this vision scary .
Quinn admits that , even among senior military figures , " science fiction movies caused a great deal of angst " .
He stresses the need to make sure " that the weaponised robots only operate under the control of the soldier and never independently " .
But the speed of modern warfare can make direct human control difficult , says Peter Singer , author of Wired for War .
Take the automated counter - artillery system deployed in Afghanistan .
" The human reaction time when there 's an incoming canon shell is basically we can get to mid-curse word [ This ] system reacts and shoots it down in mid-air .
We are in the loop .
We can turn the system off , we can turn it on , but our power really is n't true decision - making power .
It 's veto power now , " Singer says .
Vegetarian vehicles
But if automated systems are taking decisions , how can we be sure they are hitting the right targets and obeying the laws of war ?
US academic Patrick Lin was recently commissioned by the US military to study robot ethics .
QinetiQ's Talon robots are used to counter improvised explosive devices " When you talk about autonomous robots , " he argues , " a natural response might be to programme them to be ethical .
Is n't that what we do with our computers ? "
A striking example of a robot in need of careful programming is a driverless vehicle developed by the Pentagon , called the EATR .
It can refuel itself on long journeys by scavenging for organic material - which raises the haunting spectre of a machine consuming corpses on the battlefield .
Its inventor , Dr Robert Finkelstein of Robotic Technology Inc , insists it will consume " organic material but mostly vegetarian . "
" The robot can only do what it 's programmed to do , it has a menu , " he adds .
But all this worries sceptics like Professor Noel Sharkey , co-founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control .
If there 's an area of fighting that 's so intense that you can assume that anyone there is a combatant , then unleash the robots
Dr Patrick Lin , California Polytechnic
" You could train it all you want , give it all the ethical rules in the world .
If the input to it is n't correct , it 's no good whatsoever , " he says .
" Humans can be held accountable , machines can't . "
If you cannot rely on a robot knowing what to target or distinguishing between enemy forces and innocent non-combatants , Patrick Lin suggests another solution .
" If there 's an area of fighting that 's so intense that you can assume that anyone there is a combatant , " he argues , " then unleash the robots in that kind of scenario .
Some people call that a kill box .
Any target [ in a kill box ] is assumed to be a legitimate target . "
No emotions
Other researchers suggest robots may avoid the faults of human soldiers .
" Robots that are programmed properly are less likely to make errors and kill non-combatants , innocent people , because they 're not emotional , they wo n't be afraid , act irresponsibly in some situations , " says Robert Finkelstein .
But Christopher Coker of the London School of Economics , an observer of wars past and present , disagrees .
Let 's keep our guys safe , and kill the enemy
Bob Quinn
" We should put our trust in the human factor , " he says .
" Unfortunately the military in their reports often see the human factor as what they call the weakest link .
I do n't think it 's the weakest link .
I think it 's the strongest link . "
Computers will never be able to simulate the " warrior ethos " , the mindset and ethical outlook of the professional soldier , he says .
The military revolution in robotics has already advanced rapidly in the air , where remotely piloted drone aircraft are now central to conflicts such as Afghanistan .
On the ground , use of robots has so far been more limited .
Yet given the political and popular concern about casualties among Nato forces , robot manufacturer Bob Quinn 's sales pitch is likely to be persuasive .
" Let 's keep our guys safe , and kill the enemy .
Unfortunately , in warfare that 's the situation you 're in . "

Treo earns PDSA 's Dickin medal for saving lives in Afghanistan by locating explosives concealed by Taliban
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Like his colleagues who have been similarly honoured before him , the latest member of the British military to receive a medal may have woken this morning with a sense that today would not be a normal day .
Unlike other service personnel , the hero of the hour then lapped up water from a bowl on the floor and thrust his face into a dish of dog food .
The actions of Treo , a black labrador trained by the army as an arms and explosives search dog , are to be formally recognised today when he is awarded " the animals ' Victoria Cross " .
The eight - year - old was deployed to Afghanistan in March 2008 , tasked with searching for weapons and munitions concealed by the Taliban .
On 15 August 2008 , while working in the town of Sangin , he located a daisy chain IED – two or more explosives wired together to maximise casualties .
A month later , Treo found a second daisy chain , saving a platoon from injury .
Recommending him for the award to PDSA , the army said Treo 's actions had saved soldiers and civilians from death and serious injury .
The black labrador , accompanied by his handler of five years , Sergeant Dave Heyhoe , will be presented with the PDSA Dickin medal by Princess Alexandra at the Imperial War Museum in London .
The bronze medallion , bearing the words " For Gallantry " and " We Also Serve " within a laurel wreath , is named after Maria Dickin , founder of the PDSA .
Dickin introduced the honour to acknowledge " outstanding acts of bravery displayed by animals serving with the armed forces or civil defence units in any theatre of war , worldwide . "
Including Treo 's award , the Dickin medal has been presented to 63 animals since its introduction in 1943 – 27 dogs , 32 messenger pigeons in the second world war , three horses and one cat .
It was last awarded in February 2007 , when Lucky , a German shepherd , was posthumously honoured for his service in the Malaya campaign from 1949 to 1952 , while Sadie , a labrador , received the award for her work in Afghanistan in 2005 .
" We look forward to honouring Treo with the Dickin medal , " said the PDSA director general , Jan McLoughlin .
" The medal is recognised throughout the world as the animals ' Victoria Cross and is the highest award any animal can receive for bravery in the line of duty .
Treo is , without doubt , a worthy recipient . "
Rep. Barney Frank said he would oppose a troop increase in Afghanistan because people in his district face greater threats than al Qaeda .
Frank ( D - Mass . ) , the House Financial Services Committee chairman , said that the federal government needs to spend its funds on domestic priorities rather than on foreign wars in light of the nation 's record $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit .
Frank said that domestic problems , such as crime and global warming , pose a greater " threat " to citizens in his district than al Qaeda does .

" There are cops in my districts who have been laid off .
And there are people in my district who need more protection from criminals than they need from al Qaeda , " Frank said during an appearance at Cornell University on Sunday .
" That 's just a fact of life . "
Frank continued that " they need protection [ inaudible ] from urban areas where there have been foreclosures on the fire department .
And they need more protection from bridges falling down when they drive over them .
And from pollution in the water , et cetera . "
In opposing additional troops be sent to Afghanistan , he also cited the human cost of war .
" I sat in a church where they buried a kid who was killed in a war I voted for .
That 's a very serious responsibility .
A very tough one , " he said .
The Obama administration since September has been developing a new strategy in Afghanistan .
The administration began the strategic review following a report issued by commanding Gen. Stanley McChrystal that called for the military to deploy 40,000 additional troops to the war - torn nation .
The process has been delayed by several roadblocks , including reports of widespread fraud in the reelection of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Frank said that if he were the president , he would consider adding more troops in Afghanistan only if the government can pay for it by withdrawing soldiers from Iraq in six months , as opposed to the 18 - month process initiated by the military earlier this year .
Regardless ,
Frank said the eight - year - long war has taken too high a toll on the country .
" We are doing an enormous harm to the quality of life in American society , " he said .

Inequalities begin long before children arrive at school Children from the poorest homes are almost a year behind middle class pupils by the time they start school , research suggests .
But good parenting , such as reading to children and having fixed bed times , can significantly reduce this gap , the study for the Sutton Trust says .
The educational charity urged the government to fund parenting classes , especially in deprived areas .
The government said the gap was closing fast but that there was more to do .
The Sutton Trust study looked at the results of a series of vocabulary tests carried out by 12,500 British children at the age of five .
It found those from the poorest homes were nearly a year behind in their results .
It also looked at the factors common to poorer children that might influence their development .
It found that just under half of those from the poorest fifth of families were born to younger mothers under 25 .
We now have sound evidence about policies and programmes that raise achievement

And just under two - thirds did not live with both biological parents , it said .
It also isolated some factors that boosted children 's development on both the poorest and the richest homes .
These included " sensitive parental behaviour " , such as ensuring regular bedtimes and reading daily to the child .
Regular bed times between the ages of three and five led to development gains of two - and - a - half months , researchers said .
Daily reading at the age of three boosted vocabulary development by nearly two months .
And children whose parents arranged monthly library visits were two - and - a - half months ahead of an equivalent child at the age of five who had not made similar trips .
According to the study , better parenting could reduce the achievement gap between middle - income and poor families by up to nine months .
However , just under half of children from the poorest homes were read to every day at the age of three , compared to 78 % of children from the richest fifth of home .
More help
The authors noted that the UK had invested 4.3 % of GDP on early years education in 2006 .
But they called for a more effective early years strategy that would prevent greater numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds " falling behind their more fortunate peers before school has even begun " .
Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the findings were both shocking and encouraging - revealing the stark educational disadvantage experienced by children from poorer homes before they reached school .
But it also showed the potential for good parenting to overcome some of the negative impacts that poverty could have on children 's early development , he said .
Study author Professor Jane Waldfogel , visiting professor at London School of Economics , said : " We now have sound evidence about policies and programmes that raise achievement for low - income children and help reduce gaps in early childhood .
" We also know that the best of these investments will yield returns well in excess of their costs . "
' Focus on disadvantaged '
The report also called for more support for families from health professionals and early learning experts and special outreach projects to improve contact with vulnerable families .
Expansion of free nursery education should be focused on the 15 % most disadvantaged families , it added .
Children 's Minister Delyth Morgan said the government 's rules on what is covered in childcare settings were ensuring that toddlers were learning through play and getting proper stimulation .
" The childcare entitlement means even low - income families can benefit from high quality childcare that prepares toddlers for school .
" But let 's be clear , whilst there is much more to do , the gap between rich and poor in early years is closing , with the lowest - achieving children not only keeping pace but improving faster than the rest .
" We will continue to focus extra resources on the most disadvantaged children , " she added .
Chris Keates , general secretary of the Nasuwt teaching union , said : " An essential component of all early years ' provision , public or private , is the employment of qualified teachers as part of the team around the child . "

Representative Edolphus Towns , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee plans a Subpoena to probe Geithner 's AIG decisions .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner came under increased scrutiny Tuesday when a key congressman said he would subpoena the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about bailout decisions made on Geithner 's watch .
Rep. Edolphus Towns , D - N.Y. , said Tuesday he will subpoena the New York Fed for documents related to the bailout of failed insurer American International Group Inc .
Towns chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The committee is investigating deals that diverted billions of AIG bailout dollars to banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
The committee has been investigating e-mails from New York Fed lawyers telling AIG not to disclose details about the deal .
The e-mails were released last week by California Rep. Darrell Issa. , the committee 's top Republican .
Issa asked Towns to subpoena the New York Fed after the Fed blocked a separate request for documents .
In a statement Tuesday , Towns said the subpoena will " shed light on how and why taxpayer dollars were used for a backdoor bailout . "
The " backdoor bailout " refers to money being funneled to banks including Goldman , Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank .
Geithner 's Got To Go
The latest revelations about the New York Fed 's actions in the AIG bailout make one thing clear : Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner must go .
Geithner must go not just because of the emails showing that his New York Fed ordered AIG to keep details of the bailout secret , but because of many other decisions and policies he has championed in the past two years .
These decisions and policies have consistently put the interests of Wall Street ahead of the interests of the taxpayer , and they have undermined the public 's confidence in the government at a time when the country needs it the most .
Tim Geithner 's defense of his actions continues to be , in effect , " We had to do it or the world would have ended . "
This is n't good enough .
It is also , at the very least , debatable .
....
Contrary to the revisionist history now being promulgated , these [ Geithner 's ] actions were not the only way out .
They were grossly unfair to taxpayers , and they have undermined public confidence in the government -- and our current President -- at a time when the country needs it most .

we had no choice
I am not a crook
When the president does it that means that it is not illegal .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Drivers of commercial trucks and buses are prohibited from texting under federal guidelines that U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Tuesday .
" We want the drivers of big rigs and buses and those who share the roads with them to be safe , " LaHood said in a statement .
" This is an important safety step , and we will be taking more to eliminate the threat of distracted driving . "
The prohibition is effective immediately .
Truck and bus drivers who text while driving commercial vehicles may be subject to civil or criminal penalties of up to $ 2,750 , the Department of Transportation said in a news release .
The release did not offer specifics on how the prohibition will be enforced .
One of the nation 's largest groups representing professional truck drivers -- the Owner - Operator Independent Drivers Association -- expressed support for the goal but dismay at its implementation .
" We support where they are going , but not how they got there , " said Todd Spencer , the group 's executive vice president .
" Making their action effective immediately bypasses normal regulatory rulemaking processes .
Those processes allow actions to be vetted for unintended consequences as well as potential implementation and enforcement problems .
" We very much share in their goal , but their legal justification for taking immediate action raises many concerns . "
Cracking down on distracted drivers has been a focus of LaHood 's since he took office last year .
In September , he convened a two - day summit on the issue in Washington .
The Transportation Department recently launched the Web site distraction.gov to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving .
And this month , LaHood and National Safety Council President Janet Froetscher announced the creation of the advocacy group FocusDriven , a nonprofit that supports the families of distracted driving victims , modeled after Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , drivers take their eyes off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds out of every six seconds while texting .
This research shows drivers who text are more than 20 times more likely to get in an accident than nondistracted drivers .
Nineteen states , plus the District of Columbia and Guam , have passed laws banning texting while driving .
Six states , plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands , ban the use of handheld devices while driving .
President Obama also signed an executive order requiring federal employees not to text while driving government - owned vehicles or with government - owned equipment , and were ordered to comply with the move December 30 .
Nearly 6,000 people died in 2008 in crashes involving a distracted or inattentive driver , and more than 500,000 were injured , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Eighty percent of crashes are related to driver inattention , according to a Virginia Tech study , and drivers who use handheld devices are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves , the National Safety Council reports .
The focus on texting while driving comes after a few high - profile accidents .
In September 2008 , a California commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend , leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people , according to federal investigators .
A mass - transit accident in Boston , Massachusetts , injured 62 people in May .
The operator of a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority trolley later was charged with gross negligence after admitting he had been texting seconds before the collision with another trolley , according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official .

Proton blasts off with Russian military payload
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : January 27 , 2010
A Proton rocket launched overnight Thursday with a Russian defense ministry satellite to relay communications between troops and military commanders .
The silver launcher blasted off at 0018 GMT Thursday ( 7:18 p.m. EST Wednesday ) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan , kicking off a nine - hour mission that included multiple burns of the Breeze M upper stage .

The Proton thundered into crystal clear skies and shed its first stage about two minutes after liftoff as planned .
The second and third stages completed their roles in the launch 9 minutes into the flight , before giving way to the Breeze M upper stage .
The Breeze M deployed the military satellite around 0919 GMT ( 4:19 a.m. EST ) Thursday , and Russia declared the launch successful .
The payload is believed to be a modernized Raduga , or Globus , communications satellite designed to link Russian troops and senior military commanders .
The spacecraft can relay messages through small mobile terminals deployed on the battlefield , Russian defense officials said .
The Raduga fleet is stationed in geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above Earth .
Raduga satellites are built by NPO PM and are also used by high - level government officials to communicate across Russia .
The Proton flight marked Russia 's first space launch of 2010 , and it was the second launch to reach orbit so far this year .
Another Proton mission is on tap for Feb. 12 with the Intelsat 16 commercial communications satellite .
That launch will be conducted under the management of International Launch Services .
Lesson to Verizon : Neon - spandexed globe - trotting hip - hop-ish superstars like M.I.A. should not be subjected to three - hour tech support calls , because her resulting song " I'm Down Like Your Internet Connection " is bound to become the new " shake it like a Polaroid picture . "

The best part about " I'm Down Like Your Internet Connection , " which is due to appear on her forthcoming followup to Kala this summer , is that she actually got Filipino Verizon workers to sing the hook .
Says M.I.A. :
I was having issues with my cable and wireless , and I was on the phone [ with tech support ] for three hours , and I thought , ‘ Maybe this needs to be part of my music , could you just learn these lyrics and sing it down the phone to me ? '
Ten phone calls later , I have Internet that sticks and a song .

That 's the sad thing , because they are just as good . "
Like to check e-mail or surf the internet while traveling ?
You may want to take the Megabus rather than JetBlue , says a study .
The availability of free Wi-Fi and power outlets in inter-city buses and trains , coupled with increased security around air travel , is spurring more people to take the longer road home .
" Technology is changing how people approach travel , " says Joe Schwieterman , a professor at DePaul University who worked on the study .
" For many travelers , the ability to seamlessly use portable technology offsets the disadvantages of longer travel times . "
Schwieterman and his colleagues collected information from 7,000 passengers on intercity bus , train and airline trips in 14 states .
They found that at randomly selected points during trips , nearly 40 percent of passengers on buses were using some form of portable technology such as a laptop or a phone .
It is two percentage points more than on conventional Amtrak trains and more than twice that on commercial flights and Greyhound .
That 's translated into growth for bus and some train services .
Intercity bus networks grew 5.1 percent in 2009 , a rate of growth higher than all other major modes for the third straight year , says the study .
It also marks the end of Americans ' love affair with the car , says Schweiterman .
" Earlier people would get into the car , drive have their cellphones with them and listen to their music systems , " he says .
" But now you can't text while driving , ca n't surf the net so for young people , driving is no longer an attractive idea . "
Buses have been quick to give in to the consumer desire to stay connected most of the time .
The DC2NY Bus , a service that runs between Washington , D.C. , and New York started offering free on - board Wi-Fi in 2007 .
Other services such as BoltBus and Megabus did the same .
Even the " Chinatown buses " –lines that link the Chinatown districts of major cities–spent an estimated $ 5,000 per vehicle to equip their buses with Wi -Fi , says the report .
Airlines are trying to fight back .
Wi - fi is now being offered on a number of most major long - distance flights in the U.S .
Still with ever - changing security restrictions including the recent temporary restrictions on the use of electronics in flight means the Accela looks like a better option than ever .
" The hassles of flying and limits on technology use has made people move away from flights for short distance trips like New York to Washington D.C. or Chicago to Detroit .

There 's something to be said about the perfect mixture .
Silver Creek , Miss .'s Gerald Brent has being mixing and stirring for four years , and if his product comes out right , there may be something to say about him as well .
The retired Georgia - Pacific hand has kept the dirt under his fingernails rich over the past 48 months , mixing different forms of agricultural and industrial waste in search of what he believes will be a near - perfect fertilizer .
Brent hopes to begin producing a 90 - day accelerated compost for the gardening market next year , and he 's combined personal investment with professional advice , sound chemistry and hard , dirty work to make it happen .
" You ca n't go ' if 'ing ' when you go into the market - if I 'd done this or if I 'd done that .
You 've got to know , " Mr. Brent says .
Brent 's mix is actually rather simple – a load of chicken litter , a load of fly ash , a touch of lime .
He purchases the chicken litter on contract with local chicken farmers , and he trucks in the fly ash – the burned residue from solid fuels like wood and coal - from nearby Georgia - Pacific .
The ingredients act on each other to balance the acidity level while generating fertile soil .
Chicken litter on its own is powerful fertilizer , Brent says , but the black , powdery fly ash is the key .
Whereas the top few inches of chicken litter will seal over in the rain , the fly ash makes the mixture permeable , allowing the bacteria that break down the mixture to stay warm , wet and working rapidly at 140 degrees .
Though a normal compost pile may take a year to break down into good soil , Brent 's accelerated compost is designed to go from mixing pot to application in 90 days .
" That 's the key factor , being able to turn out as much as you want in 90 days , " he says .
Brent stumbled upon the fly ash years ago while working at Georgia - Pacific , and the stuff 's fertilizing power came as no surprise .
He recalled walking past the mill 's fly ash pond daily and seeing how the dumped waste material made nearby vegetation thrive .
" Around that fly ash pond , common Bermuda grass was that deep , " he says , spacing his hands to recreate the size .
" You could look and see it was working , but we did n't know how . "
Brent says he spent more than $ 1,000 sending samples of his mixture to Mississippi State University for analysis to nail down the fly ash's key ingredient before finally determining it advanced the cation exchange capacity of the soil .
In the exchange , positive and negative charged elements of the mixture react together to break down the mixture and release nutrients into the soil .
Brent says his accelerated compost will release more plant nutrients , especially nitrogen , than traditional commercial fertilizer .
" There 's enough nitrogen in the soil , but certain things keep the plan from using it , " Brent says .
" Whenever this come out , I can assure you there will be a higher amount of nutrients in it . "
The fly ash also accomplishes another major fertilizer feat – it kills the odor of the chicken litter completely .
Brent says the bad smell of chicken litter is often its primary drawback for commercial use .
So far , Brent 's ducks are in a row .
He is testing his mixture on fields in Silver Creek with a permit from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality .
The results so far are noticeable , but more stringent testing will be required before his compost goes commercial .
Dr. Larry Oldham , an MSU Extension professor and soil expert who Brent has called for advice many times , says Brent 's accelerated compost would have to be validated in controlled scientific tests .
He did say , however , that Brent might be onto something , and other , larger entities are trying to get to the finish line , too .
" The Southern Company has been doing a lot of work with fly ash , including in this state , over the past few years , " Dr. Oldham says .
" There 's a lot of research going on .
There 's been a lot of work with fly ash , I 'm just not real sure if it 's been combined with poultry litter . "
Brent is hoping his labor will produce fruit next year .
He 's already formed Silver Creek Processing LLC and hopes to begin bagging free samples of his accelerated compost for gardeners to try next spring .
He says his mixture will likely be too expensive for large - scale agricultural use , but he hopes to make an impact on the gardening market and leave a successful company behind for his grandchildren .
" My father did better than his father , and I feel like I may have had a higher standard of living than he did , " Brent says .
" But the way this country is headed , and with the millions of jobs we 've sent overseas , I wonder if my grandson will be able to have as high a standard of living as I did . "

The number of African American and Mexican American students admitted to law schools has decreased in the last 15 years , according to a recent study by a Columbia Law School professor .
During that period overall law schools have added about 3,000 seats for first - year students , yet the total number of Blacks and Mexican Americans entering law school dropped from 4,142 in 1993 to 4,060 in 2008 .
Such estimates translate into a 7.5 percent and 11.7 percent decrease of African American and Mexican American first - year law students , respectively .
These numbers are troubling says Conrad Johnson , the professor who oversees Columbia Law School ’s Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic .
At the same time both groups have improved their college grade - point averages and their Law School Admission
Test scores over the years , he notes .
“ Even though their scores and grades are improving , and are very close to those of white applicants , African Americans and Mexican Americans are increasingly being shut out of law schools , ” he told the New York Times .
It ’s like imagining Carnegie Hall , which seats almost 3,000 people , filled to capacity but no Mexican Americans or African Americans allowed in , he added .
The study points out the number of Black and Mexican American students applying to law school has been relatively constant , or growing slightly , for two decades .
Yet from 2003 to 2008 , 61 percent of Black applicants and 46 percent of Mexican American applicants were denied acceptance at all of the law schools to which they applied , compared with 34 percent of white applicants .
The study also found that the size of law school classes and the number of law schools have increased over the years , which theoretically should have provided more opportunities for qualified minority applicants to obtain a law degree .
The study also suggests that following the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger – which said that race can be used as one of many factors in university admissions – law schools have not redesigned their admissions policies to take a more holistic approach .
“ What ’s happening , as the American population becomes more diverse , is that the lawyer corps and judges are remaining predominantly white , ” said John Nussbaumer to the Times .
Nussbaumer is the associate dean of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School ’s campus in Auburn Hills , Mich. , which is known for enrolling a high percentage of African American students .
It ’s concerning that a large percentage of minority applicants are being shut out , he said .
“ A big part of it is that many schools base their admissions criteria not on whether students have a reasonable chance of success , but how those L.S.A.T. numbers are going to affect their ranking in the U.S. News & World Report , ” said Nussbaumer .
“ Deans get fired if the rankings drop , so they set their L.S.A.T. requirements very high . ”
He continued , “ We ’re living proof that it does n’t have to be that way , that those students with slightly lower L.S.A.T. scores can graduate , pass the bar and be terrific lawyers . ”
Even if law schools are concerned with their rankings they should address the important issue of promoting diversity as well as affirmative action and equal opportunity policies , critics note .
A whole generation could be lost , they add .
The study found that among the 46,500 law school matriculants in the fall of 2008 , there were 3,392 African Americans , or 7.3 percent , and 673 Mexican Americans , or 1.4 percent .
Among the 43,520 in 1993 , there were 3,432 African Americans , or 7.9 percent , and 710 Mexican Americans , or 1.6 percent .
Hispanics , other than Mexicans and Puerto Ricans , have made slight gains over the years .
Johnson says the study focuses on the two groups , African Americans and Mexican Americans , who did not make progress in law school representation during the specified period .
The Hispanic / Latino group overall did increase , from 3.1 percent of the matriculants in 1993 , to 5.1 percent in 2008 , he notes .
The reality of the disparity is unfortunate , particularly since the 2008 L.S.A.T. scores among Mexican Americans were , on average , one point higher than those of all Hispanics together , and one point higher than in 1993 .
Johnson said the study was inspired due to growing concerns about the numbers especially after the Gutter v. Bollinger decision .
Many people are unaware of the numbers , even among those interested in diversity issues , he said .
“ For many African American and Mexican American students , law school is an elusive goal . ”
Others say the growing hesitancy among some minorities to embark on a legal career is directly affected by the rising hefty tuition costs .
The rising costs , they say , continue to limit minority students from even applying to law school .
The study , “ A Disturbing Trend in Law School Diversity ” was a collaboration of the Columbia University School of Law and the Society of American Law Teachers .
More information about the findings can be found at : http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/salt/.
The site offers data as well as best practices law schools can use to create diversity - building admissions policies consistent with the Gutter v. Bollinger ruling .

The United States does n't believe Iran is capable of enriching uranium to the degree the Islamic Republic claims , the White House said on Thursdya night .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday that Iran had produced its first batch of uranium enriched to a higher level than before , raising fears it may be moving closer to the ability to produce material for a nuclear weapon .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs dismissed Iran 's claims , saying that country 's leadership had made a series of statements based on politics , not physics .
The claim of new progress in Iran 's nuclear program came a day after the US Treasury Department imposed new sanctions , freezing the assets in US jurisdiction of a Revolutionary Guard general and four subsidiaries of a construction firm he runs .
Earlier Thursday , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that Iran would face harsher sanctions if it moves forward with a nuclear weapons program .
Brown 's comments came as hundreds of thousands of Iranians gathered in a central Teheran square to mark the 31st anniversary of the revolution that created the Islamic republic .
Speaking to reporters in Belgium , the UK prime minister said that while he would like to see dialogue with Iran , “ the patience of [ Western ] countries is not inexhaustible ” .
“ I think the choices could not be clearer .
Iran can either pursue a civilian nuclear program , respect human rights and earn the trust and respect of the international community , or it can move ahead with its nuclear weapons program , trample on human rights and be isolated and ostracized on the wrong side of history , outside the international community , " he said .
He also noted that the UK was stepping up talks with other countries about tougher sanctions on Iran .
Earlier Thursday , Ahmadinejad claimed that his country had " the capability to enrich uranium more than 20 percent or 80 percent , but we do n't enrich [ to this level ] because we do n't need it .
" During a speech broadcast live on state television , he said , " I want to announce with a loud voice here that the first package of 20 percent fuel was produced and provided to the scientists , " referring to the recently begun process of enriching Iran 's uranium stockpile to higher levels .
Uranium enriched to 80 percent is considered to be on the verge of Highly Enriched Uranium ( HEU ) needed to produce a high quality nuclear device .
Iran announced Tuesday it was beginning the process of enriching its uranium stockpile to a higher level .
The international community reacted by starting the process to impose new sanctions on Iran .
Ahmadinejad reiterated Iran 's position that it was not seeking to build nuclear weapons .
" When we say we do not manufacture the bomb , we mean it , and we do not believe in manufacturing a bomb , " he told the crowd .
" If we wanted to manufacture a bomb , we would announce it ... our nation has the courage to explicitly say it and build it and not fear you .
" Throughout the day , as security forces dispersed anti-government protests in the Iranian capital , Teheran residents reported Internet speeds dropping dramatically and e-mail services such as Gmail being blocked in a common government tactic to foil opposition attempts to organize .
State television showed images of thousands upon thousands carrying often identical banners marching along the city 's broad avenues toward the central Azadi , or freedom square , to attend a speech by Ahmadinejad .
In Azadi Square itself , massive crowds waved Iranian flags and carried pictures of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic state , and his successor as supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The opposition has vowed to stage counter demonstrations , but eyewitnesses say police have deployed hundreds of forces in central Teheran to confront them .
Witnesses said that riot police fired the paint - filled balls after protesters began to chant opposition slogans in Sadeqieh Square , which is about one kilometer from the huge pro-government gathering .
Witnesses say there were no apparent injuries among the several hundred protesters .
Iranian authorities again tried to squeeze off text messaging and Web links in attempts to cripple protest organizers .
Internet service was sharply slowed , mobile phone service widely cut and there were repeated disruptions in popular instant messaging services such as Google chat .
But several Iranians reached by The Associated Press said some messenger services , including Yahoo ! , and mobile phone texting were still sporadically accessible .
Many Internet users said they could not log into their Gmail account , Google 's e-mail service , since last week .
" We have heard from users in Iran that they are having trouble accessing Gmail , " said Google in a statement .
" We can confirm a sharp drop in traffic and we have looked at our own networks and found that they are working properly .
" Opposition Web sites reported that protesters have gathered in several places in Teheran to display green banners .
Foreign media were only allowed to cover the ceremonies in the square and the speech by Ahmadinejad , with photographers bussed to the site and then away .
There is an explicit ban on covering opposition protests .
Opposition members went on roof tops late Wednesday and shouted Allah - u - Akbar ( " God is greatest " ) in protest — echoing similar cries after the disputed June election as well as anti-shah protests more than three decades ago .
Since the election that brought Ahmadinejad to power , opposition protesters have repeatedly taken to the streets .
Iranian authorities are desperate to show the upper hand on the most important day of the nation 's political calendar .
But the high - profile events — including a huge gathering in Teheran 's Azadi Square and other places across Iran — offers a chance for opposition groups to make another powerful statement of their resolve .
Anti-government
Web sites and blogs have called for a major turnout and urged marches to display green emblems or clothes — the color adopted by the anti-government movement since June 's disputed presidential election .
The opposition leaders have promised to join street rallies , including the Green movement founder and former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Iranian officials , however , have warned that any protests will be immediately crushed by security forces .
At least eight people were killed in clashes during the last major opposition marches in late December .
In recent months , the opposition has built its street proteststrategy around days of important political or religious significancein attempts to embarrass authorities .
The tone of the rallies , however , has shifted from outrage over alleged fraud in Ahmadinejad ' sre-election to wider calls against the entire Islamic system , includingSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The last large - scalemarches — held to coincide with a Shi'ite holy day in late December — brought the most violent battles with security riots since shortlyafter the June 12 election .

If a guy had a suit like this and his homey filmed him in it , this is exactly what you ’d expect the video to look like .
By Occam ’s Razor , this is a guy in a suit ; because the other possibility requires the introduction of the assumption that an unknown species of great ape roams about .
But I hate to stop there ; that ’s too easy .
First let ’s see where and when the video was made : Just north of Greenhorn , Oregon in October of 2009 .
That appears consistent with the foliage seen in the video , about the right season judging by the leaves , and I probably would n’t expect to see any snow on the ground .
John E
Walker is what ’s on the YouTube page , but that ’s not the name he emailed me with ; and though the Scotch Whiskey reference calls attention to itself , there are people with that name .
He says is that it was shot on a JVC Everio GZ - HD7 3CCD camcorder , which is a real model of camera .
The picture looks pretty good , so probably a 3CCD , but that ’s about all I can guess .
I did n’t find anything in the mechanical details of the video to prove or disprove its authenticity .
So that does n’t leave us much to go on .
Maybe it is a Bigfoot .
Maybe it ’s a guy in a suit , one that flares out bellbottom style , like my own cheap - ass gorilla suit does .
Maybe it ’s an autonomous robot in a suit .
Maybe it ’s a Bigfoot in a Bigfoot suit .
Maybe it ’s an example of high - end composite work combined with low - end 3D modeling , all rendered on Renderman .
The fact is that we ca n’t really know or conclude much of anything about this video , and the million others like it .
We ca n’t prove it ’s a fake any more than we can prove it ’s a real Bigfoot .
What it is is crappy evidence .
It ’s not testable .
It ’s fun , and it ’s interesting , but its value as evidence is zero .
Its value as an anecdote is that it suggests a direction for research .
So to all who feel motivated : Grab your 3CCD cameras and head on up to Greenhorn , Oregon .
A bellbottomed Bigfoot might be waiting for you .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. taxpayer profits from bank bailout investments are being offset by estimated losses from American International Group and automakers and mortgage payment cuts for struggling homeowners , a U.S. Treasury report showed on Monday .
The Treasury estimated net losses on its $ 700 billion bailout program at $ 68.5 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2009 .
The December report for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , showed that the fiscal 2009 net loss included estimated losses of $ 30.4 billion for AIG and $ 30.4 billion for automakers , with $ 27.1 billion in losses from the Home Affordable Modification Program .
These were much larger than a $ 15 billion profit registered from the Capital Purchase Program for banks and $ 4.4 billion in profits from other bank investments , asset guarantee and lending programs .
A senior Treasury official said the bank investments will ultimately produce a positive return for taxpayers .
But the department was not yet ready to update its estimate of the final taxpayer costs for the bailouts .
The official said the Treasury would update its cost estimates on a quarterly basis as the bailout program shifts its focus toward small business lending and housing relief in its final 10 months of operation .
The Treasury in November said TARP ’s ultimate cost estimate had been reduced to about $ 141 billion from $ 341 billion earlier in the year .
Further reductions in the final cost estimate could aid the Obama administration as it faces pressure to produce a new budget that starts to show deficit reductions .
Die Opposition schreit auf , Liberale und Christsoziale würden den Staat zur Beute machen , die Lobbyisten gewännen immer mehr an Einfluss .
Und tatsächlich wird auf der einen Seite die Mehrwertsteuer für Hotels reduziert , auf der anderen Seite erhält die FDP eine Millionenspende aus der Branche .
Auch die CSU macht kräftig Kasse .
Die Düsseldorfer Substantia AG hat der FDP noch vor der Bundestagswahl 1,1 Millionen Euro überwiesen .
Die Summe sei eine der höchsten Parteispenden in der Geschichte der Freidemokraten , bestätigte ein FDP - Sprecher entsprechende " Spiegel " - Informationen .
Die Substantia AG gehört einem der reichsten Deutschen , August Baron von Finck .
Seine Familie ist Miteigentümer der Mövenpick - Gruppe , die in Deutschland 14 Hotels betreibt .
Auch die CSU wurde nach Informationen der " Süddeutschen Zeitung " mit über 800.000 Euro von Finck unterstützt .
In den schwarz - gelben Koalitionsverhandlungen hatte die FDP gemeinsam mit der CSU auf eine Senkung des Mehrwertsteuersatz auf Hotel - Übernachtungen von 19 auf 7 Prozent gedrungen .
Der stark umstrittene und von der Opposition als Klientelpolitik kritisierte Steuernachlass wurde im Wachstumsbeschleunigungsgesetz verankert , das zum 1 . Januar 2010 in Kraft getreten war .
Die frühere Staatsministerin Hildegard Hamm - Brücher ( ehemals FDP ) kritisierte laut " Spiegel " : " In der Regierung macht die FDP reine Klientelpolitik .
Sie kümmert sich um die Steuerfragen einer bestimmten Schicht , das ist alles . "
Die FDP mache sich den Staat zur Beute , kritisierte die Grünen - Fraktionsvorsitzende Renate Künast : " Jetzt ist offenbar Zahltag : Auf der einen Seite wird die Mehrwertsteuer für Hotels reduziert , auf der anderen Seite erhält die FDP eine Millionenspende aus der Branche .
Wir erwarten ein klärendes Wort des Parteivorsitzenden ( Guido ) Westerwelle , ob es zu seinem Politikverständnis gehört , den Staat für reine Klientelpolitk auszuplündern . "
Auch Lobbykritiker beobachteten die Politik der FDP mit Sorge , schreibt " Der Spiegel " : " Mit dem Eintritt der FDP in die Bundesregierung gewinnen die Unternehmerlobbyisten an Einfluss " , sagte Elmar Wigand vom Verein LobbyControl .
Der einflussreiche Deutsche Hotel - und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) hatte seit Monaten massiv für die Steuersenkung geworben .
Ernst Fischer , Präsident des Dehoga und selbst FDP - Mitglied , hatte dies wie folgt begründet : " Sieben Prozent Mehrwertsteuer wären das beste Konjunkturprogramm für eine Branche , in der über 100.000 Arbeitsplätze akut in Gefahr sind . "

I ’ve got another story to add to my Census taxpayer waste files .
In addition to the gold - plated Super Bowl ads and cross-country caravans , billion - dollar kiddie propaganda , and multiculti p.r. , you can now add government - sponsored Census fortune cookies to the pile .
Really .
Via the Seattle Times ( h/t My Two Census ) :
Next time you crack open a fortune cookie , check the flip side .
The federal government may have a message for you .
Tsue Chong Co. , a fortune - cookie factory in Seattle ’s Chinatown International District , is inserting five different census messages into 2 million cookies being shipped to restaurants and groceries across Washington , Oregon , Idaho and Montana .
Like the usual predictions of wealth , fame and long life you ’ll find on one side , the census missives on the opposite side are a bit … well … banal .
“ Put down your chopsticks and get involved in Census 2010 , ” reads one message .
“ Real Fortune is being heard , ” reads another .
It ’s all part of a broader effort by the Census Bureau to spread the word about the upcoming population count on April 1 .
The nation ’s 112 million households will begin receiving forms in the mail beginning in late March .
… The “ census ” cookies began rolling off the “ assembly line ” at Tsue Chong on Wednesday — at a rate of 8,000 an hour .

Paramount 's 1939 western GERONIMO
... a forgotten movie with a giant legacy .
by Ed Howard
A 1939 western named GERONIMO , the inspiration it gave a US Army paratrooper , and the formation of a US Army paratrooper tradition were events that combined to transform a character in a now - forgotten movie into a household word .
This is the story of the relationship between the 1939 Paramount movie , the WWII paratroopers , and the motivational yell , " Geronimo " .
1SG Ed Howard , A Co , 1/507th PIR ( Airborne School ) .
Late 1999 photo taken at Fort Benning , Georgia , about a year and a half before his retirement .
Down from Heaven comes ELEVEN
and there 's HELL to pay below
shout " GERONIMO " " GERONIMO " .
Hit the silk and check your canopy
and take a look around
The air is full of troopers
set for battle on the ground
Till we join the stick of ANGELS
killed on Leyte and Luzon
shout " GERONIMO " " GERONIMO " .
It 's a gory road to glory
but we 're ready here we go
shout " GERONIMO " " GERONIMO " .
The cry also found its role in the civilian sector , introduced to the public by the intense media coverage of America 's shock troops - the paratroopers .
The Geronimo cry had entered the public mainstream , and to the public , Geronimo was a novel expression of bravery , carried by the equally new type of warrior - the paratrooper .
It is no wonder the shout caught the attention of America , as it went hand in hand with the larger than life paratrooper .
To the red - blooded American boy , the jump cry of the paratrooper seemed like just the thing to say for his equivalent event .
What did little Johnny shout when he jumped from great heights such as the top bunk ?
" Geronimo " .
Across America the cry would be identified with a subsequent act of bravery , usually followed by pain !
After the war , practical training methods replaced tradition , and paratroopers were finally forbidden from yelling " Geronimo " in the air .
This was inevitable because the cry was never approved in any military parachuting manuals , and if actually executed in combat could become a bullet magnet .
The great paratrooper cry had run its course and served us well as a great WWII paratrooper tradition , but at war 's end , it would make way for peacetime Army practices , never to be heard at great heights again .
But while it is no longer shouted , it is still seen , worn , and sung !
The pocket patches are no longer worn , but the 501st and 509th are active army units in the modern Army and proudly display the " Geronimo " motto .
Troopers of the 501st PIR still wear the unaltered unit insignia , complete with the chief 's name .
The 509th PIR keeps reminders everywhere of their old Geronimo pocket patch .
The Song , Down from Heaven , is as familiar to paratroopers today as it was in WWII .
It is a dramatic and lively tune that never lost its appeal over the years .
It is almost impossible to attend a major ceremony in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg without hearing this staple of war - era music fill the air .
So well - loved is this song that even troopers who are not so musically inclined find themselves drawn into singing along !
In the civilian world , remnants of the confidence - inspiring yell remain .
They can still be seen in the actions of that kid jumping from the death - defying height of the top bunk and yelling what he thinks might be his last word , " Geronimo " .

A Swedish Weight Watchers group got a sign they might want to lay off the meatballs , according to a local report Thursday .
When a group of 20 members gathered in Vaxjo , south central Sweden for their regular weigh - in , the floor collapsed , the Smålandsposten newspaper reported .
“ We suddenly heard a huge thud ; we almost thought it was an earthquake and everything flew up in the air .
The floor collapsed in one corner of the room and along the walls , ” a member told the paper , according to a translation on Swedish news Web site " The Local . "
The smell of sewage quickly collected in the collapsed room .
Luckily there was never any danger because the floor was only slightly above ground level , the newspaper said .
No injuries were reported .

Ever wonder how your internet service provider , home network , processor speed , and other factors affect the speed and quality with which you can watch videos on YouTube ?
Wonder no more .
Google announced a personalized speed dashboard on Thursday for YouTube that tells anyone , in under a second , how fast their connection is to YouTube 's servers , and how fast it has been historically , over time .
The dashboard also graphs a comparison between one 's speed and that of users in other regions , or users in the same region who use competing internet service providers .
" Speed is really important to us , and we 've been working very actively on making the web faster ... and also sharing with companies and users all around the world so that we can have a better web experience , " Google product manager Amit Agarwal told Wired.com .
" Any user , anywhere in the world , can get insight into what speed they 're getting while watching YouTube videos . "
Google announced the service on Thursday afternoon and its dashboard site is up and running at youtube.com / my_speed .
If a competing ISP in your area offers a higher YouTube connection speed – and you watch a lot of YouTube – you might consider switching ISPs based on this data .
For instance , the graph to the above right shows that Time Warner offers slightly slower YouTube speeds than other providers in my area do , on average .
This level of transparency could pressure ISPs not to slow down data from YouTube , because it will be clear to consumers if a given provider offers a poor connection .
As the FAQ section on YouTube 's speed dashboard says , other factors besides an ISP – including home network configuration – can affect one 's YouTube speed .
However , home networking congestion can't account for an entire ISP offering , on average , a slower YouTube experience .
From the data in YouTube 's speed dashboard , people can discern that either something in their house ( a slow computer or misconfigured wireless network ) is causing the problem , or that their ISP is to blame .
As the battle over net neutrality heats up , such site - specific speed meters – especially those that , like this one , offer historical and comparison data – could prove invaluable .

Handbrake is a DVD - ripping tool with a strong emphasis on not just ripping media but recoding it for playback on computers , portable devices , and other non-disc based systems .
Handbrake can help you convert DVDs and other MPEG - based video into MP4 and MKV files .
You can tweak settings like video frame rate and audio codec playback to your heart 's content with Handbrake , and even batch encode all your media at one time to make filling up your iPod or other device relatively painless .
The one major shortcoming of Handbrake is that it does n't have any copy protection removal tools built in , which means you may occasionally need to use a 3rd - party stripping tool to prepare your DVD for conversion .

AnyDVD is another commercial entry in this week 's Hive Five .
It 's not cheap , with a one year license running $ 60 — although the multi- year discounts quickly stack up — but it can boast that it stays on top of current protection and encryption schemes to make sure you 're never locked out of your own discs .
In addition to stripping protections from the disc , it also has the ability to control DVD playback speed so that DVDs played on media center computers will play slower and quieter , and it allows you to remove things like forced subtitles , warning screens , and disc material you do n't want .

If you have been training for a while now without tracking your macros then you are missing out .
By tracking your macro nutrients you will be able to make progress quicker !
What you need to look at is calories , carbohydrates , proteins , fats and secondary to that fibre and sugar .
If you track each then you will know how your body reacts to more or less carbohydrates , proteins and fats .
For the secondary macros I only aim for around 20g of fibre a day and to keep the sugars under a quarter of the total carbohydrates .
Depending on calorie intake , the range of fats will be between 45 and 75 grams .
With my diet I am aiming to become leaner and maintain then build muscle .
Why Protein Bars are an Ideal Addition
Protein bars like cheap Quest bars are an ideal addition to your diet because the macro profile is very good .
With 20g of protein per bar and only 7g of carbs , eating these alongside a cup of tea allows you to enjoy eating and also contributing beneficially to your macro targets for each day .
( CNN ) -- Haitian native and " Heroes " cast member Jimmy Jean - Louis was searching for his elderly parents in Haiti on Wednesday afternoon after a powerful earthquake struck the nation .
Jean - Louis learned that a house he had grown up in collapsed , killing several of his relatives .
" I have not slept yet .
The second house that I grew up in was down , and some relatives have died , from what I have been told , " Jean - Louis said Wednesday .
" I have n't been able to reach my parents .
I have heard that they are OK , but I do not know what is going on around them . "
Jean - Louis was born in Petionville , Haiti , where he grew up without electricity or running water .
He moved to Paris , France , when he was 12 to pursue a modeling career and supported his parents by sending money home since he started acting nearly 20 years ago .
He is the founder of Hollywood Unites for Haiti , a nonprofit organization whose original mission was to provide sports and cultural education to underprivileged youth on the island .
The group is mobilizing for disaster relief after a magnitude - 7 earthquake struck Tuesday .
The actor heard about the quake moments after the news broke .
For several hours , he was unable to get in touch with anyone on the ground in Haiti .
Late Tuesday , he reached a friend who is the local director of Hollywood Unites for Haiti .
" He was stuck in the chaos , and he was supposed to give me complete details about what was going on on the ground and with my family , but all he could say was that the house was down and that some people from the house died , " Jean - Louis said .
" I 'm trying everyone on their cell phones and on their house phones , my parents ' friends and the people in their neighborhood , and I have been unable to speak with one person who is close to them . "
Jean - Louis , who is best known as " The Haitian " on the NBC series " Heroes , " returned from Haiti only a couple of weeks ago after spending the holidays with his parents .
He was planning to return this month but will now be traveling much sooner to provide relief aid .
" I am going to try to get in , but I am going to try to understand the situation first to see how I can best help , " Jean - Louis said .
" The plan is to at some point visit , and right now , I am trying to be as productive as I can be here . "
Jean - Louis and Hollywood Unites for Haiti are encouraging people looking to help to send money instead of goods at the moment .
" People should understand that sending donations of items and goods will be difficult right now because we will be bombarded and have no way to distribute them , " Jean - Louis said .
" I do n't think people have any idea how terrible this is because of the circumstances on the ground in Haiti and the lack of the infrastructure .
There are no roads , and it is going to be extremely difficult for help to reach people . "
The Bishop of Limerick Donal Murray has today " humbly apologised " to those who were abused as children as the Vatican confirmed his resignation had been accepted by Pope Benedict .
The bishop addressed churchgoers at Mass at St John 's Cathedral in Limerick .
In a statement , Bishop Murray said he had heard the views of many survivors , especially in the days following the publication of the Murphy report .
" Some expressed the wish that I should resign ; others asked me not to do so .
I know full well that my resignation cannot undo the pain that survivors of abuse have suffered in the past and continue to suffer each day .
I humbly apologise once again to all who were abused as little children .
To all survivors of abuse I repeat that my primary concern is to assist in every way that I can , on their journey towards finding closure and serenity . "
The bishop said he had asked the Pope to allow him resign and to appoint a new bishop to the diocese because " I believe that my presence will create difficulties for some of the survivors who must have first place in our thoughts and prayers .
“ Let my last words as Bishop of Limerick be those I spoke in St. Joseph's on 29th November last : ‘ We are people who believe that God ’s mercy and God ’s healing are without limit .
We are meant to be bearers of that hope to one another and especially to people whose trust was betrayed when they were just little children and who endured the terror , helplessness and suffering inflicted by a frightening and dominant adult .
They should always have a special place in our prayers ’ . "
Calls were made for a criminal investigation into how Bishop Murray handled abuse allegations against Fr Thomas Naughton , convicted for child sex abuse yesterday .
Bishop Murray is one of a number of auxiliary bishops criticised in the Murphy commission report into the handling of allegations of child sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese from 1975 to 2004 .
Naughton , who featured strongly in the Murphy report , was yesterday sentenced to three years in prison , with one year suspended , for abusing a boy at least 70 times in Valleymount , Co Wicklow , between 1982 and 1984 .
Parents who complained to Bishop Murray about the priest when he was an auxiliary bishop in Dublin in 1983 said they were dismissed by him .
Mervyn Rundle , who was abused by Naughton when the priest was moved from Valleymount to Donnycarney parish in 1984 , yesterday asked “ when are the guards going to act against these guys ? ”
In 1998 , Naughton was sentenced to three years in jail for abusing Mervyn Rundle and other boys in Donnycarney .
The sentence was reduced by six months , on appeal .
Retired Garda sergeant John Brennan , who sought to have Naughton removed from Valleymount in 1984 following complaints by parents , said “ as justice was done today , I think that it should now be taken a step further .
Fr Naughton , I ’ve always maintained , is a human being with a problem . ”
He continued : “ It was his superiors who , aware of this weakness , sent him around to other places , and I think they should n’t be allowed at this stage to resign or retire .
They should be the subject of a criminal investigation .
If there is neglect and evidence of a cover - up , it should n’t be a question of somebody resigning .
They should be the subject of a criminal charge . ”
A 78 - year - old St Patrick ’s Missionary Society priest , Naughton had pleaded guilty to five sample counts of indecent assault and yesterday received five three - year sentences , to run concurrently , with the final year suspended in each case .
Handing down the sentences at Wicklow Circuit Court in Bray , Judge Michael O’Shea said the abuse was “ appalling , shocking and horrifying ” .
The court heard that it started in 1982 , when the victim was six years old .
After he had made his First Communion he became an altar server in Valleymount parish , where Naughton was curate .
Judge O’Shea added that the abuse had an “ absolutely catastrophic ” impact on the victim ’s life .
Last night , Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said : “ Tom Naughton was an abuser who damaged the lives of many innocent young people .
I hope those involved in today ’s proceedings will find some solace and justice in his having to serve a jail sentence for his crimes . ”
Andrew Madden , who was abused by Fr Ivan Payne , said Donal Murray was Bishop in the archdiocese of Dublin during a time when the Murphy commission found that the sexual abuse of children by priests was covered up by the diocese and other church authorities .
" The structures and rules of the Catholic Church were found to have facilitated that cover - up , " he said .
The report tells us that some auxiliary bishops were made aware of complaints of child sexual abuse by priests in their geographical areas .
" It goes on to say other bishops found out about such priests through the regular monthly meetings involving the archbishop and the auxiliary bishops .
It is not believable to me that bishops attending those meetings were unaware that child sexual abuse was covered up by the archdiocese .
" They were bishops working in a diocese where children were sexually abused by priests that the diocese knew to be dangerous .
They were bishops that were part of a structure and culture that facilitated the sexual abuse of children .
They joined with other Bishops to issue a statement on 10th December 2009 to say they are shamed by the extent to which child sexual abuse was covered up in the Archdiocese of Dublin , yet individually they claim to have done nothing wrong .
" Their continued presence in office is an insult to every child sexually abused by a priest in the Dublin archdiocese , they display a contemptible level of arrogance and an inappropriate lack of humility .
" The Catholic church in Ireland has totally failed to respond at all appropriately to the findings of the Murphy report . "
Mayor of Limerick Kevin Kiely said he wished to acknowledge " the contribution that Dr Donal Murray has made to the Diocese of Limerick over the last 13 years " .
" Since he became Bishop of Limerick in 1996 , Dr Murray has served the people of Limerick to the best of his ability and I would like to pay tribute to him for his hard work and dedication on behalf of the diocese .
" I am saddened by the circumstances which have led to Dr Murray ’s resignation today after several days of reflection and I wish him well for the future . "
The electricity sector could shave up to 18 percent off its energy use and carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 by aggressively embracing smart - grid technologies , according to a new analysis .
Smart grid - related savings would come from a number of factors , most significantly from a " conservation effect " as consumers incorporate feedback on their energy use , the study found .
Additional factors include the use of power diagnostics to tune homes and smaller commercial buildings and increased use of wind and solar generation .
" The magnitude of these reductions suggests that , while a smart grid is not the primary mechanism for achieving aggressive national goals for energy and carbon savings , it is capable of providing a very substantial contribution to the goals for the electricity sector , " the authors found .
Led by Rob Pratt , a researcher with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and leader of the lab 's Energy Systems Transformation Initiative , the study does not aim to assess the environmental impacts of smart - grid technologies or argue their cost - effectiveness , the report notes .
Rather , it assesses the energy and CO2 savings that might accrue from a group of technologies that are typically justified because they promise to improve the reliability and efficient operation of the power system .
Based on published research studies and new analyses , the study identified nine mechanisms by which a smart grid can reduce energy use in the electricity sector .
A key savings stems from " demand response " -- or more simply , from conservation -- that arises in homes and small businesses when smart - grid technologies make usage data available .
The study estimated demand response could save 6 percent of those buildings ' energy use , which amounts to 3 percent of electricity overall .
Another chunk of savings , about 1.5 percent , can come from better insight into the breakdown of electric load at a site .
New data mining capabilities are an enabling technology , the authors found , that can allow for more targeted spending on particularly beneficial upgrades .
The authors attributed another 3 percent savings to support for electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Smart charging infrastructure is a central component of new vehicle technology plans that hinge on charging cars during off - peak hours when electricity is cheaper and less carbon intensive .
The analysis is based on a full availability of smart - grid technologies by 2030 .
In a side note , the authors point out that for all the savings potential in smart grid technologies , they will also slightly increase electric loads as electric substations get new computer servers and communication capabilities are built into a host of thermostats , refrigerators , dryers and the like .
" While the magnitude of this increase is small and may not be considered important , " the authors note , " it does point to the need for technology developers to minimize the increased loads of smart grid technologies . "

Permanently Ban the Sale of Ivory
by : Care2.com
recipient : CITES Secretary - General Willem Wijnstekers
Kenyan Wildlife Authorities recently seized $ 1 million worth of elephant tusks bound for ivory markets in Asia .
The growing demand of ivory has lead to skyrocketing rates of illegal poaching , and unless sales are permanently banned , elephants are likely to go extinct .
For the past 20 years , members of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) have allowed a limited legal ivory trade .
But as ivory prices continue to rise on the black market , hundred of elephants are being slaughtered annually -- threatening the already endangered populations .
The illegal poaching of elephants is escalating and unless ivory sales are permanently banned , it is likely that these amazing creatures will no longer roam the earth .
Now is the time to urge international leaders to permanently ban the sale of ivory once and for all !

As I am sure you are no doubt aware , Kenyan Wildlife Authorities recently seized $ 1 million worth of elephant tusks and rhino horns bound for ivory markets in Asia .
Despite efforts to ward off poachers , wildlife experts in Kenya have seen a rapid rise in the number of elephants being slaughtered for their tusks .
It has been 20 years since the International community banned the sale of ivory and I strongly urge you to reinstate a permanent ban in ivory sales .
[ Your comment will be inserted here ]
According to the World Wildlife Foundation , Africa has about 18,000 rhinos left , while sub-Saharan Africa has 690,000 elephants at most .
Increasing ivory demands in Asia are stimulating a large upsurge in poaching -- especially elephants and rhinos .
Elephant ivory is a lucrative business and unless the ban on ivory sales becomes permanent , elephant populations are going to continue to rapidly drop .
For the past 20 years , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) has allowed periodic sales of ivory which has undoubtedly sparked an increase in demand .
I strongly urge you to support the permanent ban of ivory sales and stop the killing of innocent animals once and for all .
With no further exceptions , now is the time to eliminate all one - time stockpile sales .
The elephants and rhinos are a part of our wold heritage and they should not be slaughtered for the benefit of a few people .
Thank you for taking the time to consider my comments .
I eagerly await your response .

Federal court hearings continued Tuesday on a lawsuit that could transform biotechnology in the United States by eliminating gene patents .
The case hinges around the claims of Utah - based Myriad Genetics on BRCA1 and BRCA2 , a pair of genes closely linked to breast and ovarian cancer .
Myriad " owns " the genes , and says its patents make it possible to profit on diagnostic tests .
The company argues that if you remove the patents , the tests — indeed , commercial biotechnology as we know it — will vanish .
A coalition of civil rights , research and women 's health groups is fighting the patents .
They argue that Myriad 's claims stifle innovation by discouraging researchers from looking at the genes , which are still not fully understood , and say Myriad 's monopoly limits women 's health choices .
More broadly , the claims set a precedent for other gene patents , which now cover about one - fifth of the human genome .
" Allowing patents on genetic material imposes real and severe limits on scientific research , learning and the free flow of information , " said Chris Hansen , an attorney with the America Civil Liberties Union , in a press release .
At Tuesday 's hearing , defense attorney Brian Poissant insisted that " ' women would not even know they had BRCA gene if it were n't discovered ' under a system that incentivizes patents , " reported GenomeWeb Daily News .
But much of the scientific community rejects Myriad 's case .
Roughly 150,000 researchers are represented by associations that have filed court briefs supporting the plaintiffs .
Among them are the American Medical Association , American Society of Human Genetics and March of Dimes .
In his recent book , The Language of Life : DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine , National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins also argued against broad gene patents .
" The information contained in our shared instruction book is so fundamental , and requires so much further research to understand its utility , that patenting it at the earliest stage is like putting up a whole lot of unnecessary toll booths on the road to discovery , ” he wrote .
In May , the court rejected Myriad 's request that the case be thrown out without a trial .
During Tuesday 's hearing , the plaintiffs asked to be declared victorious without a trial .
A decision is expected to take several months .
If the court rules against Myriad , patents involving genes and other biological products wo n't be eliminated altogether .
Instead , claims will need to be made on specific types of tests or modifications , rather than the discovery of something that exists in nature .
The ACLU likened Myriad 's claim to that of someone who patents gold after panning a few nuggets from a stream .
A case memo filed by the plaintiffs called Myriad 's prediction of industry doom " pure hyperbole . "
They cited a 1931 Supreme Court decision that struck down the American Fruit Company 's claimed ownership of fresh fruit .
" To be sure , the fruit industry survived , " wrote the plaintiffs .

Neuroscientists at MIT and Tsinghua University in Beijing show that increasing brain magnesium with a new compound enhanced learning abilities , working memory , and short - and long - term memory in rats .
The dietary supplement also boosted older rats ' ability to perform a variety of learning tests .
Magnesium , an essential element , is found in dark , leafy vegetables such as spinach and in some fruits .
Those who get less than 400 milligrams daily are at risk for allergies , asthma and heart disease , among other conditions .
In 2004 , Guosong Liu and colleagues at MIT discovered that magnesium might have a positive influence on learning and memory .
They followed up by developing a new magnesium compound — magnesium - L- threonate ( MgT ) — that is more effective than conventional oral supplements at boosting magnesium in the brain , and tested it on rats .
" We found that elevation of brain magnesium led to significant enhancement of spatial and associative memory in both young and aged rats , " said Liu , now director of the Center for Learning and Memory at Tsinghua University .
" If MgT is shown to be safe and effective in humans , these results may have a significant impact on public health . "
Liu is cofounder of Magceutics , a California - based company developing drugs for prevention and treatment of age - dependent memory decline and Alzheimer 's disease .
" Half the population of the industrialized countries has a magnesium deficit , which increases with aging .
If normal or even higher levels of magnesium can be maintained , we may be able to significantly slow age - related loss of cognitive function and perhaps prevent or treat diseases that affect cognitive function , " Liu said .
To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this MgT - induced memory enhancement , the researchers studied the changes induced in functional and structural properties of synapses .
They found that in young and aged rats , MgT increased plasticity among synapses , the connections among neurons , and boosted the density of synapses in the hippocampus , a critical brain region for learning and memory .
Susumu Tonegawa at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory helped carry out the initial behavioral experiments that showed that magnesium boosted memory in aged rats .
Min Zhou 's laboratory at the University of Toronto helped demonstrate the enhancement of synaptic plasticity in magnesium - treated rats .
This study not only highlights the importance of a diet with sufficient daily magnesium , but also suggests the usefulness of magnesium - based treatments for aging - associated memory decline , Tonegawa said .
Clinical studies in Beijing are now investigating the relationship between body magnesium status and cognitive functions in older humans and Alzheimer 's patients .

As the father of a three year old boy , I 've become much more attuned to the way that people treat children .
What astounds me is how much , as a society , we tend to despise children .
I 'm not a terribly touchy - feely parent ; I believe in rules and good behavior in public .
I do n't like ruining people 's days ( at least via my child ) , and we do n't take our son to nice restaurants , movies , or live theatre when he 's clearly not ready for it .
But there are some situations where it is necessary to take a child into the public eye .
One that 's on my mind right now ( because we 're traveling quite soon ) is plane rides .
I have seen the most egregious behavior here - from adults .
This post is triggered not just by reading this article , in which the usually decent Southwest airlines booted a mom and her two - year - old son off a plane , but also by the comments that the story has elicited .
On FARK.com , a news - linking website known for its amusing and snarky take on life , the story was filed under the category " Hero . "
The general trend was " about time , " with plenty of potshots at the mom ( who actually seemed to be reacting somewhat reasonably ; there were no dramatic threats of lawsuits ) .
As can be seen here , some suggested drugging the child ; one kind soul proposed putting a plastic bag over his head and another said they should have been ejected midflight .
I want to first reiterate that I can't stand bad parents or bad children , either .
There are parents who are over - permissive to the point of absurdity .
There are kids who are just hyper or obnoxious .
I also was n't on that Southwest flight - maybe the kid was unbearably loud or piercing or rude and the mom did n't respond appropriately .
Who knows ?
But anyone who 's been in charge of a toddler for more than three minutes knows that even the most perfect parent in the entire world can't prevent or stop every tantrum .
Toddlers have to have tantrums .
It 's how they learn boundaries .
And while I 'm usually more tolerant of my son's whims in public to spare other people , I also can't break every single rule .
And I can't teach him that throwing a tantrum will get him his way - I 'm the one that has to live with the aftermath of that , not the rest of the people on the plane .
But what happens is that all parents and kids are lumped in with this group .
People eye a parent boarding a plane with a child with instant suspicion - guilty until proven innocent .
I do n't like screaming in my ear , either .
I also do n't like people who wrestle the armrest away from me , people who lean their seat ALL the way back , and people who claim their suitcase is a purse and cram the overhead compartment with too many bags .
But that 's life .
That 's what traveling by air means .
Heck , that 's what it means to live in this world .
Several folks on this and other sites pointed out how much money they would pay for a child - free flight .
You know what ?
I 'd pay just as much for a child - friendly flight - where reasonably behaved kids can fly without of glares from miserable old ladies , put - off hipsters , and misanthropic businessmen .
I know that most of the posters , hiding behind anonymity and fake names , are either trying to be funny or just giving their initial response to the situation ... but wow , that 's a lot of and hatred to be carrying with you .
I 'd rather end this on a positive note .
Most people , regardless of what they may think in private ( or post on a website ) , act neutrally or even nicely .
A recent PostSecret from a single mom reminded me that there are cool and tolerant people on this planet :
Indeed , when we took our son on his first cross-country flight , he had a bad time .
He screamed , he was in pain from the air pressure , and generally was n't a happy camper .
People were okay , but I still remember That Guy .
He came up to me and said , " I have two kids .
I 've been where you are .
Hang in there , it 'll get better . "
In my life , I love my wife , my child , my family , a handful of close friends , and That Guy .
I hope he 's finding money or falling in love or getting elected mayor somewhere right now .

Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Nearly a week after a massive earthquake leveled much of Haiti , rescues of victims who survived without food or water have not abated .
A CNN crew in the Haitian capital Monday was flagged to the scene as a Peruvian search - and - rescue team pulled a university student out of the remains of the flattened school .
Text messages had been sent from beneath the rubble , drawing rescuers to the scene , said paramedic Clever Sobrino , who added that more trapped survivors are believed to be inside .
The student , Maxine Fallon , 23 , was treated by an Israeli doctor and taken to a U.N. treatment center on the back of a CNN truck .
Fallon said she had prayed fiercely for someone to find her beneath the ruins of what was once her university .
" I had hoped I would be rescued , " Fallon said .
Earlier , 6 - year - old Jessica Hartelin was pulled from the rubble by local residents and rushed to a field hospital set up by Israelis at a Port - au - Prince soccer field .
On Sunday , five people were rescued from the rubble of a grocery store , officials said , 24 hours after the effort to reach them began .
As of Sunday , more than 60 people had been found alive by rescue teams from the United States and other nations , Tim Callaghan of the U.S. Agency for International Development told reporters .
American teams have rescued about 30 of those , he said .
Earlier Monday , several hundred Haitians broke into a damaged supply store in downtown Port - au - Prince , looting it in a sign of growing desperation since the earthquake .
Fights broke out among some of the looters .
Young men holding two - by - fours with nails hammered into them began attacking each other .
CNN 's Anderson Cooper saw one man beaten until one of his arms started bleeding .
One boy collapsed onto the street in a pool of blood , Cooper said , describing the situation as " a frenzy of looting . "
Watch as Cooper carries injured boy
Police fired into the air , hoping to break up the incident .
Within about an hour , and with the store entirely looted , the crowd moved to another store half a block away .
People were n't stealing food -- they were taking candles for their homes without electricity or in hopes of selling them , Cooper said .
Some came along with money , buying supplies from looters -- in some cases in the hopes of selling for more somewhere else .
Other cases of looting have been reported , though generally involving smaller crowds .
See the latest developments from Haiti
Kenneth Merten , the U.S. ambassador to Haiti , said that " overall , people are very calm . "
That seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police , a force of about 9,000 .
National Police Chief Mario Andresol said Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake , with thousands of officers injured , killed or unaccounted for .
The Port - au - Prince force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500 he said .
Complicating matters even further , roughly another 4,000 " bad guys " are on the run , Andresol added , after the 95 - year - old , crowded National Penitentiary in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped .
" Today , we have double work , " Andresol said , adding that the police department is bringing in troops from other parts of the country .
" There are not enough , so we are trying . "
Bill Clinton , the former U.S. president who is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti , said Sunday that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has reported for duty since the January 12 earthquake .
Clinton arrived in the country Monday with his daughter , Chelsea .
He was to meet with local officials to discuss how best to proceed with recovery operations .
Watch Clinton talk about the aid bottleneck
The U.S. military considers the security situation stable , Rear Adm .
Mike Rogers , director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters Monday .
Rogers said stable meant the United States can carry out operations -- including search and rescue , distribution of aid , moving people in and out of the capital and flying aircraft .
Read full coverage of the earthquake in Haiti
Nothing suggests widespread disorder and panic , he said , citing the incidents of unrest as " isolated events . "
The country 's roads and the capital 's airport were so congested that the supply lines of goods into Haiti were clogged , leaving thousands of survivors to scrounge for food and emergency aid .
A U.S. Air Force C - 17 circumvented the airport congestion problem by dropping 55,000 pounds -- about 40 pallets -- of bottled water and food on Monday , the first U.S. airdrop of supplies .
But the congestion and distribution problems showed signs of easing Monday , with 180 flights passing through the airport without delays , said Gen. P.K. Keen , who is leading U.S. forces on Haiti .
During the previous day , more than 233,000 bottles of water and 140,000 meals had been distributed , not enough for the 3.5 million people affected , he said .
He predicted that the port , which was damaged in the earthquake , would be open " in some capacity " by the end of the week .
The dearth of hospital facilities also should ease soon , too , he said .
Israel and Argentina , Russia , Portugal and Turkey have already sent or are sending hospitals , he said .
Doctors Without Borders reported that flights carrying medical equipment were being diverted to the Dominican Republic .
Oxfam warned that fuel shortages could be on the horizon .
And a volunteer at a hospital in northern Haiti said he had open beds , but no way to get patients there from Port - au - Prince .
" My surgeons are sitting around looking at each other , wondering why they came , " Tim Traynor said .
Louis Belanger , a spokesman for Oxfam in Port - au - Prince , said many roads had been made passable so that trucks can deliver aid .
Jon Andrus , deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization , said doctors have seen no increase in reportable diseases within Haiti and there is no risk of a communicable disease outbreak or any other public health threat associated with bodies .
Damage to phone lines and wireless networks has made it difficult for aid agencies to communicate with each other and with the United Nations , which is in charge of coordinating relief efforts .
i Report : Earthquake victims
The head of the United Nations called for calm .
" I know that there is a frustration amongst Haitian people , but when I met them , from their faces , I have seen that they have great hope and they are a great , resilient people , " U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told CNN 's Christian Amanpour on Monday .
Ban visited the nation , the poorest in the Western Hemisphere , over the weekend .
" I told them that to be more patient , because [ the ] whole world [ is ] standing behind them . "
Still , victims were running out of patience .
i Report : I 'm alive !
Messages from Haiti
" We do n't have anything to eat ... we do n't even have some water to drink , " one woman said .
But Ban said he could n't estimate how long it will take to get the aid already collected for Haiti flowing freely into the country .
The United Nations has 9,000 peacekeepers in Haiti -- 3,000 of them in the capital -- and Ban has requested that the U.N. Security Council increase levels by another 3,500 " to take charge of all this security , to help humanitarian assistance be delivered in a safe way . "
The United States has 1,400 military forces in Haiti and another 5,000 offshore , Keen told reporters Monday .
That will grow to 4,000 to 5,000 on Haiti with another 5,000 in support , he said .
Impact Your World
Tens of thousands of food rations and sanitary packages have been handed out , Merten said .
The exhaustive work in perilous conditions earned the gratitude of people worldwide , but questions also grew about why much more was n't being done .
Some teams available to take off to Haiti could n't fly in due to a continuing bottleneck at Port - au - Prince 's airport .
Critical supplies were not making their way into the country at the needed pace .
At a U.S. medical facility , doctors were asking why they did n't have critical equipment or the ability to perform surgeries , while a field hospital set up by Israel did .
" The disaster was the quake .
This is the disaster that 's following in its wake , " said Dr. Jennifer Furin of Harvard Medical School , referring to the lack of better medical care on the ground .
Medical operations were under way off the coast on a U.S. ship for some patients who could be flown there .
i Report : Looking for loved ones ?
Families were " with their loved ones who they were so excited to see alive , only now to watch them die a slow , painful death from their rotting flesh because the infections are out of control and they need surgery , " Furin said .
" I 've been here since Thursday .
No one except the Israeli hospital has taken any of our patients , " she told CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen .
Cohen visited the Israeli hospital and said it was " like another world , " with imaging equipment and other machinery .
" They have actual operating rooms , and it 's just amazing . "
i Report : Earthquake 's aftermath
Stories of rescues were of little comfort for Len Gengel of Deerfield Beach , Florida , whose daughter was feared trapped in the Montana Hotel , a five - story structure that pancaked in the quake .
" We need American soldiers up there rescuing our children now , " Len Gengel told Merten on CNN .
" Time is of the essence .
I beg you . "
Merten said he would do all he could .
The United States was conducting medical operations on the USS Carl Vinson off the Haitian coast .
At the request of the military , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , CNN 's chief medical correspondent and a neurosurgeon , was the lead surgeon in an operation on a 12 - year - old Haitian girl rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard .
A fragment of concrete had penetrated the girl 's brain .
" They did not have a neurosurgeon in the area , " Gupta said .
The surgery was successful , and " the girl is going to do great , " he said .
Watch Gupta give an update on the operation
The U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort was due within 48 hours , Gupta said .
But only a limited number of patients can be flown out to the ships .
A more advanced field hospital was needed to save lives .
No overall death toll has been declared ; estimates range from 100,000 to 150,000 in Port - au - Prince alone .
The U.S. State Department has confirmed the deaths of 24 Americans .
Approximately 25 others are presumed to be dead , but those deaths have not been confirmed , the State Department said Monday .
Most of the bodies that once lay in the streets of Port - au - Prince have been moved .
Many were dumped into huge pits .
Most of the dead will never be identified .
CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Susan Candiotti , Rich Phillips , Arthur Brice , Eric Marrapodi and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report .
Spot the real denier
A denier has many tactics to stop people talking about evidence .
The real deniers here are those pushing a fake crisis .
To stop discussion :
Real deniers claim something needs to be peer reviewed in order to be discussed .
( Bad luck for Galileo and Einstein eh ? )
At the very least this slows down debate for up to a year , instead of discussing results that are right in front of us now .
Real deniers claim it only “ counts ” if it comes from a certified climate scientist .
( A flaw is a flaw , it does n’t matter who points it out . )
If it is peer reviewed , then real deniers claim it only counts if it comes from certain journals .
( The climate IS what it IS , regardless of anything printed in any journal . )
They claim something ca n’t be right because it would disagree with thousands of papers .
They mock and laugh , but provide no evidence .
Not a single paper .
( Then they claim that it ’s not a single paper but a “ body of work ” .
Which disagrees with point 1 . )
Real deniers assert it must be wrong because there is a “ consensus ” .
Notice how they wo n’t talk about evidence ?
Scientists do n’t vote for natural laws .
Science is not a democracy .
If all else fails , they call people names like … “ Denier ! ” Other variations include , Delayer , Inactivist , Conspiracy Theorist , or Do-Nothing !
Since they ca n’t back it up , this is baseless namecalling .
When they ca n’t find a real flaw , they look at “ funding ” and imagine one .
( Real scientists research nature .
Fake scientists google for dirt . )
Real Deniers deny that instruments are right .
No !
The simulations are more real than reality .
Trust the models !
They threaten dissenters with jail ( for fictitious crimes ) .
Climate Criminals !
Peer review is done by two anonymous , unpaid colleagues .
You get what you pay for and peer review is free .
If a company were audited like this , by two anonymous unpaid friends , the SEC would be jailing people .
Who is the real denier ?

ISTANBUL , Turkey — Hassan Beheshtpoor ( not his real name ) has been on the run since the summer .
He is a Tehran University student whose political activism marked him out several years before this summer ’s controversial presidential election triggered an ongoing campaign of opposition to the Iranian government .
Beheshtpoor , 22 , was arrested and cautioned about his activities back in 2007 .
Now , this financially stretched student hailing from a traditional Azeri family from the provinces has been banned from the Tehran University dormitories .
Along with yellow stars awarded to troublemakers , on - the - spot beatings by campus militiamen and even arrest , torture and long prison terms , these are the forms of pressure yielded by the regime in its campaign against the most vocal segment of the opposition movement that has surged in Iran over the past six months .
“ I heard that the university ’s guards identified me in one of their [ surveillance ] photos and I ’m dying from stress , ” Beheshtpoor wrote in an email from Tehran .
“ The government has turned into a desperate dog , it no longer recognizes any limits to its reactions . ”
Now living in a house shared with other student activists , Beheshtpoor headed to Qom last week for the funeral of Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri , who was the spiritual leader of the opposition before passing away on Sunday .
“ Qom ’s streets were full of crowds shouting slogans opposed to the system and the Supreme Leader , ” Beheshtpoor recounted .
“ The Bassijis [ Islamic militiamen ] were slack - jawed at the numbers and , not knowing what to do about the crowd , just watched us pass by . ”
Three days of street protests followed Montazeri ’s eventful funeral .
Their length and intensity evoked the summer ’s daily protests that were only suppressed after the government killed at least 11 demonstrators on one day in late June .
But the past several days have witnessed an unprecedented widening in the scope of protests across the country .
In seeking to suppress commemoration ceremonies for the departed ayatollah , the government sparked off violence in heretofore quiet provincial cities .
On Thursday , a senior ayatollah called Jalaleddin Taheri was stopped by security forces from presiding over a memorial service in Esfahan .
His son complained in an interview to BBC Persian of “ very harsh treatment ... so he could not reach the place where the ceremony was scheduled for . ”
There was more rioting on Wednesday in Najafabad , Ayatollah Montazeri ’s birthplace .
Esfahan and Najafabad belong to the Iranian plateau ’s ultra- conservative central zone , long considered a bastion of the Islamic Republic .
Esfahan ’s extended bazaar - clerical families are a particularly popular recruitment zone for the Iranian intelligence apparatus .
The city ’s extensive Graveyard of Martyrs is studded with thousands of bearded men looking out at the visitor from the illustrated gravestones typical of Shiite Islam .
A more extraordinary challenge to state authority occurred in the sleepy southeastern Iranian city of Sirjan .
A scheduled hanging was disrupted by a rioting crowd that took away the victims ’ unconscious bodies , resuscitated them and rioted again when the execution was repeated later that day .
Some Iranian news sources claimed that three people were killed and another 27 injured when members of a 5,000 - strong police force opened fire on a crowd .
“ In such smaller communities , the residents and the security forces know each other , limiting the government ’s ability to implement harsh policies , ” said Nader Uskowi , a Washington - based political analyst and consultant to the U.S. government .
Small conservative cities have largely withstood calls to join the opposition movement to the Islamic Republic .
“ The Sirjan incident is an example of a change in the society ’s psychology towards the state , ” said Mahmood Delkhasteh , a London - based researcher .
“ It shows that the society is slowly turning into an explosive mass that with one wrong move can detonate . ”
Besieged by negative news , government - aligned media such as the conservative Kayhan newspaper are turning their focus to foreign affairs .
The newspaper ’s front pages over the past three days have focused on the Saudi - Iranian proxy conflict in northern Yemen .
Yesterday ’s front page proclaimed : Millions of mourners on the road to Karbala , in a reference to the Sunday peak of the Shiite mourning festival of Ashura .
Widespread demonstrations are expected across Iran on Sunday .
Police deputy commander Ahmad Reza Radan warned that “ illegal gatherings that pass the red lines will be dealt with by measures that include arrests . ”
The Intelligence Ministry banned all memorial services for Ayatollah Montazeri .
Recognizing that the killing of demonstrators creates a cycle of mourning and violence similar to that which undid the Shah ’s military government during the 1979 Revolution , there have been no further fatal shootings in recent months .
“ The government chose to wage a campaign of attrition as opposed to an all - out attack on the Greens , ” said Uskowi .
“ It hoped the youths would lose their focus but in reality it was the government forces that lost their vigor . "
Back in Tehran , Beheshtpoor has decided to keep his head low and wait for opportunities such as religious festivals and state - sponsored demonstrations to take to the streets with his anti-government message .
“ The Islamic Republic is really scared and this fear is prompting it into strange actions , ” he concluded .
“ But whatever it does , it just boomerangs back onto itself .
It ’s the end of this system . ”
I do n’t know about you guys , but I really loved the Light Cycles in Tron .
It was the best design of a new sort of motorcycle that we still have n’t seen on our roads .
Sure , there are some really neat motorcycles in fiction , like the ones in Akira , but this design actually might be made .
The Wheel Driver concept was created by Japanese designer Yuji Fujimura .
The interesting thing is that the driver is seated inside the wheel , kind of like General Grievous ’ vehicle in Star Wars Episode III : Revenge of the Sith .
It would be pretty amazing to see a bunch of these single - wheeled motorcycles on the roads someday .

I often get sent links from readers about various photos contests they think I should enter .
It is flattering that they think my works is good enough to win , but the fact is I never enter photo contests .
Never .
A recent contest sponsored by Frommers is a great example and seems pretty typical of most photo contests .
Frommers is offering the winner of the contest $ 5,000 and a spot on the cover of one of their guidebooks .
Indeed , if I was offered $ 5,000 for the cover of a guidebook , I ’d take it .
Even if Frommers got nothing out of the contest other than the right to use the winning photos , it would still be a good deal for them .
It is probably less than what a full blown photo shoot might cost if they were to hire a professional photographer .
The catch , however , comes if you do n’t win ( and almost everyone who enters will not win ) .
The contest rules state the following ( emphasis theirs ) :
License : Participant retains ownership of the copyright in any submitted photographs .
However , by entering photograph(s ) in this Contest , participant grants Sponsor the irrevocable , perpetual right to edit , adapt , use and publish in any media now known or hereafter discovered any or all of the photographs without compensation to the participant , his or her successors or assigns , or any other entity .
ENTERING A SUBMISSION IN THIS CONTEST CONSTITUTES PARTICIPANT ’S IRREVOCABLE ASSIGNMENT , CONVEYANCE , AND TRANSFERENCE TO SPONSOR OF THE FOREGOING RIGHTS .
So even if you do n’t win , they can still use your photos without any sort of compensation whatsoever .
THAT is the real reason most companies run photo contests .
They get a large portfolio of decent images for basically nothing .
If you read the contest closely , they only say the the winner will end up on a cover .
They do n’t say the non-winners will not end up on a cover .
( that ’s a triple negative )
I should note that I ’m not mad at Frommers or any other company for running contest like this one .
From an business standpoint , it makes perfect sense .
Why pay photographers when you can get the photos for basically free ?
Almost every photo contest I ’ve seen has similar rules where the act of entering means you give away the rights to your photographs , for what in all probability amounts to nothing .
The contest will also get you some traffic and visibility , so there is an additional bonus on top of the photos .
Lonely Planet has run similar contests as well .
Many people simply do n’t care .
They are n’t serious photographers and if one of their photos does get used , then it is something they can brag about to their friends .
Photography is also a field where even a total rank amateur can get lucky and get a great photo , even if they did n’t intend it .
Put tens of millions of cameras in the hands of people and you ’ll get some great photos even if the people with the cameras do n’t know what they ’re doing .
If all the professional or serious amateur photographers out there avoid their contest , they can probably care less .
They are working with the law of large numbers .
Not every photo contest has rules which are as onerous , however .
Here is the money clause from the National Geographic 2009 International Photographer of the Year competition :
By entering the Contest , all entrants grant an irrevocable perpetual , nonexclusive license to Authorized Parties , to reproduce , distribute , display , and create derivative works of the entries ( along with a name credit ) in connection with the Contest and promotion of the Contest , in any media now or hereafter known , including , but not limited to : display at a potential exhibition of winners ; publication of a book featuring select entries in the Contest ; publication in National Geographic magazine or online highlighting entries or winners of the Contest .
This is much more reasonable .
National Geographic does n’t claim any rights to the image beyond the contest itself .
Given National Geographic ’s long history of sponsoring great photography , their rules do n’t surprise me .
The takeaway is this : read the rules before you enter any contest .
Know what you are giving up and what you are getting yourself into .
Photography is very subjective and even if you think you have a photo that is sure to win , it probably wont .
You might end up giving away the photo and never receiving so much as a “ thank you ” in return .
For the Network Managment course , taught by professor Luca Deri ( the author of the popular ntop ) , I wrote a little image sniffer with the pcap library .
The program listens to a network device and uses the Boyer - Moore algorithm Boyer - Moore - Horspool algorithm ( thanks to Boneropolis for the correction ) to retrive the starting / ending bytes of JPEG images , cutting off HTTP headers or similar from TCP packets payload , so you can have a rapid idea of what users are browsing on your network .
The images are saved as N.jpg in the current directory , where N is a raising counter .
The connections are stored and retrived with uthash , an open source C hash table .
Here the main C file , for the complete source download this tar .

It so happens that my name on is the front page of Namespaces in XML 1.0 , a technology which is pretty broadly disliked .
Well , it seemed like a good idea at the time .
But I think we ’ve learned some useful things since then and can make some good consensus recommendations for people doing this kind of thing , especially if they ’re using JSON .
Problems of History · A good place to start brushing up on this would be with James Clark ’s recent XML Namespaces .
James is authoritative on technology , but I ’m going to quibble with his take on history : “ the argument for naming namespaces with URIs is that you can do a GET on the URI and get something human - or machine - readable back that tells you about the semantics of the namespace . ”
I ’m not sure .
I recall it more simply : namespaces needed to have names and over at the Web consortium , it ’s basic dogma that whenever you ’re naming things , you should name them using URIs unless there ’s a good reason not to .
The benefits of using URIs are many and do n’t necessarily include using them to retrieve data .
In any case , the rest of James ’ argument is well worth reading .
I have another approach I ’d like to explore here , which is marginal for XML but real interesting for JSON .
Do It Like Java · My Java classes have names like org.tbray .
framer .
Framer or com.sun.cloud.VM , depending on the context .
It ’s very unlikely they ’ll collide with anything else .
We really could n’t adopt this approach for XML , because the dot “. ” had historically been allowed , and commonly used , in SGML element types and attribute names .
I bet that , if it had n’t , we might well have done that .
Especially for JSON · A lot of protocols these days format their messages in JSON , which makes perfect sense if you ’re not trying to interchange document - like things .
These messages tend to be dictionaries ; here ’s an example from the Sun Cloud API :
{ " name " : " Database " " uri " : " /vdc/m~001 " , " run_status " : " HALTED " , " description " : " MySQL host " , " tags " : [ " sql " ] }
In the Sun Cloud API , like in many others , the dictionary keys do n’t use any dots .
And like many others , there ’s a MustIgnore policy .
So , while I still have an action item to make this explicit , the extensibility policy is obvious : use java - style names with dots .
So if I wanted to add a sun-specific proprietary extension to this particular resource representation , it ’d look like this :
{ " name " : " Database " " uri " : " /vdc/m~001 " , " run_status " : " HALTED " , " description " : " MySQL host " , " tags " : [ " sql " ] , " com.sun.cloud.solaris-version " : " 2009.06 " , }
Simple , obvious , and explained in a single short paragraph ; I like it a lot .

New twist on solar cell design
Scientists in the US have developed a new flexible and lightweight solar cell , which uses a fraction the amount of silicon used in conventional cells , while still achieving high light conversion rates .
Reporting in journal Nature Materials Professor Harry Atwater of the Caltech and colleagues believe their new design could be used in applications ranging from car sun roofs to devices in clothing .
The key is to the cells high efficiency is its use of small micrometre sized rods of silicon instead of traditional silicon wafers .
Incoming light bounces back and forth multiple times between the rods in the panel until it 's absorbed .
Small alumina nano - particle reflectors are placed between the rods to ensure the light is guided as efficiently as possible .
The scientists claim up to 85 % of usable sunlight is absorbed by the new panels , compared to approximately 17 % efficiency with current commerically available solar cells .
Atwater says the silicon wire arrays offer a mechanically flexible alternative to conventional silicon wafer photovoltaics , and are much better at absorping in the near - infrared spectrum .
This allows overall sunlight absorption to exceed that of an equivalent volume of randomly textured silicon panels over a wide range of sunlight angles .
' Interesting ' result
Professor Martin Green of the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering at the University of New South Wales says " the good absorption demonstrated using the sparse array of silicon wires is interesting . "
" " The challenge with silicon wires has been getting good voltage output , because surface areas are large and this ultimately limits voltage , " says Green .
" However , the sparse array 's total surface area need not be a lot more than a thin conventional cell of the same volume , and that gives some hope here . "
But Green believes thinner versions of current solar cell technology could prove to be just as effective .
" Although volume is a reasonable metric to compare devices , low volume is of interest not only to reduce material costs , but also manufacturing time , " he says .
" It is not obvious that you would get much benefit in the latter area with this sparse array approach .
" I imagine a thin conventional cell could have been deposited much more quickly with the techniques used . "
Iranian Opposition Leader Mahdi Karroubi ' This Government Is Unworthy '
In an interview with SPIEGEL , opposition politician and former president of the Iranian parliament Mahdi Karroubi , 72 , discusses allegations that he has bowed under pressure from the government in Tehran .
A new study published in Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences rejects the theory that the origin of life stems from a system of self - catalytic molecules capable of experiencing Darwinian evolution without the need of RNA or DNA and their replication .
The research , which was carried out with the participation of Mauro Santos , researcher of the Department of Genetics and Microbiology at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona ( UAB ) , has demonstrated that , through the analysis of what some researchers name " compound genomes , " these chemical networks cannot be considered evolutionary units because they lose properties which are essential for evolution when they reach a critical size and greater level of complexity .
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) defines life as a " self - sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution . "
The scientific theories on the origin of life revolve around two main ideas : one focuses on genetics -- with RNA or DNA replication as an essential condition for Darwinian evolution to take place -- and the other focuses on metabolism .
It is clear that both situations must have begun with simple organic molecules formed by prebiotic processes , as was demonstrated by the Miller - Urey experiment ( in which organic molecules were created from inorganic substances ) .
The point in which these two theories differ is that the replication of RNA or DNA molecules is a far too complex process which requires a correct combination of monomers within the polymers to produce a molecular chain resulting from the replication .
Until now no plausible chemical explanation exists for how these processes occured .
In addition , defenders of the second theory argue that the processes needed for evolution to take place depend on primordial metabolism .
This metabolism is believed to be a type of chemical network entailing a high degree of mutual catalysis between its components which , in turn , eventually allows for adaptation and evolution without any molecular replication .
In the first half of the 20th century , Alexander Oparin established the " Metabolism First " hypothesis to explain the origin of life , thus strengthening the primary role of cells as small drops of coacervates ( evolutionary precursors of the first prokaryote cells ) .
Dr Oparin did not refer to RNA or DNA molecules since at that time it was not clear just how important the role of these molecules was in living organisms .
However he did form a solid base for the idea of self - replication as a collective property of molecular compounds .
Science more recently demonstrated that sets of chemical components store information about their composition which can be duplicated and transmitted to their descendents .
This has led to their being named " compound genomes " or composomes .
In other words , heredity does not require information in order to be stored in RNA or DNA molecules .
These " compound genomes " apparently fulfil the conditions required to be considered evolutionary units , which suggests a pathway from pre-Darwinian dynamics to a minimum protocell .
Researchers in this study nevertheless reveal that these systems are incapable of undergoing a Darwinian evolution .
For the first time a rigorous analysis was carried out to study the supposed evolution of these molecular networks using a combination of numerical and analytical simulations and network analysis approximations .
Their research demonstrated that the dynamics of molecular compound populations which divide after having reached a critical size do not evolve , since during this process the compounds lose properties which are essential for Darwinian evolution .
Researchers concluded that this fundamental limitation of " compound genomes " should lead to caution towards theories that set metabolism first as the origin as life , even though former metabolic systems could have offered a stable habitat in which primitive polymers such as RNA could have evolved .
Researchers state that different prebiotic Earth scenarios can be considered .
However , the basic property of life as a system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution began when genetic information was finally stored and transmitted such as occurs in nucleotide polymers ( RNA and DNA ) .
Lorna Bradbury , The Daily Telegraph 's acting literary editor , said : “ It is terribly sad to hear that the end may be near for this well - loved magazine .
It is an institution among its readers , who look forward every month to their subscription dropping through their letter box .
It is also a concern they could lose out on the money they paid for their subscription and are being given no reassurances that they will be given their cash back if the title closes . ”
The Red Queen 's Race is an apt analogy for the meltdown in assets and debt now swamping the global economy .
The a href = " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen's_race "
>
Red Queen 's race refers to running very fast to stay in the same place .
As asset values fall globally ( except where massive government stimulus has pushed the day of reckoning forward a bit ) , debt holders are frantically paying down or writing down debt -- running very fast -- but finding themselves in the same place -- zero equity - - despite their prodigious efforts .
I 've prepared a chart to illustrate The Red Queen 's Race in assets and debt :
Owning an asset as it catapults ever higher in a credit / asset bubble offers a fateful temptation to leverage that rising equity ( " free money " ) or extract it to enjoy .
Millions of speculators did so by borrowing against their stocks ( margin accounts ) and tens of millions did so by borrowing against their home equity via second mortgages or HELOCs ( home equity lines of credit ) .
Alas , when the asset bubbles bursts , values quickly begin a long and painful retrace to pre-bubble valuations .
In very short order , those who bought with high leverage or borrowed 90 % of their equity find themselves underwater , owing more than the value of their asset / property .
Those with 80 % of bubble - top value mortgages who cling to the hope of a rapid recovery in valuations soon find they too are underwater .
Lenders who thought they were " safe " extending 80 % - of - value loans at the bubble top find their 1 - 2 % reserves against losses are woefully inadequate as assets continue their ceaseless decline to rational valuations .
In a desperate attempt to stave off losing the Red Queen 's Race , The Federal Reserve essentially hands the banks billions in easy profits , loaning them unlimited funds at near - zero interest rates so they can " re-capitalize " by loaning their unlimited " free money " at higher rates of interest .
But even the incantations and legerdemaine of the Fed are no match for the inexorable punishment of running in place just to avoid falling behind ; no matter how fast the Fed - induced profits flow , they cannot gain on the declining assets .
Banks pocket billions yet their net equity remains far below zero .
At some point , the lender or owner tires of writing down or paying down debt to no avail , and they lose the Red Queen 's Race .
Having lost , some lenders , owners and even governments ( see Japan , Inc. for a woeful example ) maintain the fiction that equity is above zero by continuing the fraud of pricing assets at " mark to fantasy " valuations .
In other words , they list a mortgage at full nominal value , as if the underlying asset -- the house - - was still worth more than the mortgage .
Here 's the desperate game being played now on a global scale : mark the debt as if the bubble had never burst ( " mark to fantasy " ) in the hopes that government stimulus and lending will re-inflate the bubble , enabling owners and lenders alike to exit the asset at a price which makes them whole ( no losses incurred ) .
That is the entire raison d'etre for quantitative easing , near - zero interest rates and massive support of the mortgage markets , from China to the U.S.
If only another generation of suckers can be conned into believing that bubble prices are " rational " and can even be exceeded ( greed is not just good , it is necessary ) , then various financial Elites can exit their liquidity and debt traps by selling at the " new top . "
Unfortunately for global financial Elites and homeowners alike , there has never been a bubble which was reinflated for long .
Running faster ( expanding credit in a futile attempt to spark another bubble frenzy ) never wins the Red Queen 's Race , but it certainly sets up a higher bubble and a catastrophic exhaustion of credit , debt and belief in the system ( loss of institutional credibility ) .
Welcome to the Red Queen 's Race , which can only be lost .
Writing down debt as assets fall is simply staying in one place .
At some point the runners -- lenders and debtors alike -- tire of maintaining the futile fiction that " equity " still exists , and the race is lost : losses are finally accepted , debt is renounced , and bankruptcy wipes out the fictional equity .
We might call this inevitable reconciliation with reality the Red Queen 's Revenge .

Trade union brigade offer practical solidarity to the Ampilatwatja community .

By Emma Murphy , Ampilatwatja , Northern Territory
February 12 , 2010 -- From February 1 - 14 , in a remote part of Australia 's Northern Territory ( NT ) , a group of trade unionists and Aboriginal rights activists from Victoria , New South Wales and the NT joined forces with the Alyawarr people from Ampilatwatja community to help make history .
Many people around Australia have already been inspired by the Alyawarr people ’s walk - off .
On July 14 , 2009 , following a great tradition from Aboriginal struggles of the past century , they walked off their community and set up a protest camp .
Their community had been compulsorily “ acquired ” for five years by the Australian government , through powers granted to it through the NT Emergency Response legislation ( the NT " intervention " ) .
The welfare recipients of Ampilatwatja had their income “ quarantined ” — half their income replaced with a “ basics card ” that can only buy specified things at specified shops .
This even applies to the aged pensioners who worked hard all their life , for rations and a little cash , opening up the country so the pastoral industry could exploit it .
With their pensions now quarantined , the elders felt they ’d been returned to the rations days .
The NT intervention was supposedly about protecting children from abuse and neglect .
One of the main factors contributing to child neglect — and the potential for child abuse — was the massive overcrowding experienced in most Aboriginal communities .
Two - and - a- half years after the intervention began , not one new house had been built for Aboriginal communities , despite the A$ 672 million the federal government has put aside for Aboriginal housing .
However , on February 8 , the federal Labor government 's Indigenous affairs minister Jenny Macklin announced the completion of two houses in Wadeye , one of the small number of communities the government wants to make “ hub towns ” .
Under the government ’s plan , all new housing and other infrastructure will be concentrated in these “ hub towns ” , the intention being to close down 73 smaller communities , separating the Indigenous people from their traditional lands .
For the people of Ampilatwatja , the final straw came in July last year when their community housing had fallen into such disrepair that sewage was leaking over the floors and the ground .
Calls to the government department now in charge of what had been Aboriginal - run housing were falling on deaf ears .
So the people decided to walk out .
“ You can have the community ” , they said to the government .
“ We do n’t want it . ”
Solidarity brigade
Last year , on an east coast speaking tour to raise awareness , Alyawarr spokesperson Richard Downs inspired trade unionists and others with his people ’s struggle .
He drew links to the great Gurindji and Pilbara people 's struggles from last century , and reminded people of the important role unions played in them .
An idea was born .
“ Would n’t it be amazing ” , a Wollongong unionist said , “ if we — unionists and solidarity activists together with the community itself — could build a house where the government has failed ? "
That idea became a reality .
Unionists from the Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union , the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union , the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union ( CFMEU ) , the Australian Workers Union and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance , as well as activists and a film crew , took part in the protest house work brigade .
A pre-fabricated house had been donated .
The community wanted the house finished in time to launch it on February 14 , the day after the national day of action against the intervention .
Money was quickly raised , with several unions that were n’t sending members on the brigade sending money , including the National Tertiary Education Industry Union and the Maritime Union of Australia .
The MUA also donated a generator to run the power tools , and it was all go .
“ On Saturday , February 6 the last of 17 cubic metres of concrete was poured ” , Tim Gooden , secretary of the Geelong and Region Trades and Labour Council and brigade participant and well - known member of the Socialist Alliance , told Green Left Weekly .
“ There was lots of yelling and shouting and lots of photos taken because it was a major feat to get the concrete slab out and poured in four days by hand .
“ The slab has steel plates set in it for the house to fit on and be welded to .
The CFMEU bought the last building supplies needed in Alice , before we travelled for half a day north west .
All the concrete had to be burrowed in to two small ‘ brickie ’s mixers ’ and then taken out onto the slab .
“ The mixers nearly did not arrive — the truck carrying them flipped on its side about 200 km from the camp .
No -one was hurt , but it delayed the start of the pour by half a day . ”
Gooden said that half of the dozen unionists on the brigade were women , including three German construction workers who heard about the NT intervention while visiting Sydney .
Twelve young men from the Ampilatwatja community joined the construction team .
“ Because it was so hot — about 40 °C at 10 in the morning — and the water had to be bucketed in , we would start at 5 in the morning and finish at noon .
After lunch , which was prepared by the Alice Springs team of Nat [ Wasley ] and Paddy [ Gibson ] , we would head out with elders to the local water hole about an hour away to cool off and then return to start pouring again at 4 pm . ”
The team would work until dark then “ sit with the community watch a film with a noisy generator [ then ] go to bed on the ground , which was still nearly 40 degrees at midnight , and start all over again the next day ” .
Richard Downs told Green Left
Weekly he was happy with how well the union brigade had been received by the community , and how well the participants had taken community concerns and priorities on board .
“ There was lots of engagement with the local community , young fellas helping out with the building ” , he said .
The work team built other structures for the camp .
The housing in Ampilatwatja has been neglected for years .
The community had decided that two houses pegged for demolition should be taken down and reconstructed at the walk - off camp .
Two work teams — a men’s and a women ’s — spent a few days relocating the structures so the old people at the camp had more comfortable shelters .
Unionists worked alongside community members to reclaim the houses that had been neglected by the government .
The Government Business Manager ( GBM ) , sent to “ administer ” the community as part of the intervention , was n’t too impressed with it , but the elders and others in the community pointed out that they were supposed to be demolished anyway .
Pride and confidence boosted
Downs told GLW the walk - off camp had boosted the people ’s pride and confidence .
This was evident at a February 8 Ampilatwatja community meeting .
The meeting was to discuss the store , which had historically been community owned , providing employment as well as profits to fund other community programs .
Under the intervention , the store was seized and handed over to new administrators .
At the February 8 meeting , the community demanded it be handed back .
Work brigade participants sat alongside community members as they negotiated with the GBM , telling him that he had a fortnight to return the store to community control or they would all start shopping at a nearby community .
The GBM eventually backed down and agreed .
The walk - off camp has provided a new focus for unions to engage with the Aboriginal rights movement .
Kara Touchie , elected Indigenous representative on the ACTU executive , told GLW that Downs and Yuendumu leader Harry Nelson had inspired many unionists when they toured the east coast in 2009 .
“ Union officials were quite taken with what Richard and Harry were saying and realised it was time to re-engage [ with the movement ] .
We wanted to know what practical ways we could support them .
Coming to the walk - off camp , donating our labour , was one way … I think it 's awesome that they 're not waiting for the government ” , she said .
The unions , she said , were keen to support the campaign , but they would take their lead from the walk - off camp and see what the Alyawarr people wanted unions to do .
For Downs , that was the “ icing on the cake .
It gives me real heart …
The unions are making a commitment to come on board ” .
Adam Leeman , an AMWU and Socialist Alliance member from Sydney , told GLW : “ This brigade has been a great inspiration — to see that the Ampilatwatja community is directly fighting against the intervention .
But seeing the inspiration that this protest house has given the people round here — the confidence to take control — has made the experience even greater for me . ”
On February 14 , the house was launched with traditional Alyawarr songs and dancing as well as speakers including MUA Sydney branch secretary Paul McAleer .
A bus load of Anangu from the APY lands in South Australia joined the celebrations .
Elder Banjo Morton told GLW : “ That 's the way we wanted it with the unions helping us .
All different people working here together , helping us with the walk - off . ”

WASHINGTON 
As they try to pick up the pieces of their scorched health care legislation , Democrats in Congress are focusing first on the most popular ideas , from expanding patients ' rights to making insurance coverage more affordable .
Days after Republicans scored an upset victory in the Massachusetts Senate election that has since stalled progress on health care , Democrats remained uncertain on how and when to advance those priorities .
" We have to step back , take a deep breath and realize that … these bills as they stand now are dead , " said Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey , among the Democrats pushing for a more incremental approach .
POLL : Most Americans want more GOP support on health care BACKGROUND : Senate passes health care bill Breaking up President Obama 's health care legislation — which would have expanded health coverage to 30 million Americans — or shifting to a scaled - down bill that might win bipartisan support are among two options Democrats are considering , Pascrell and others said .
Though she vowed that Congress would pass some form of legislation , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday ruled out one last - ditch route that had been considered : passing the Senate 's measure in the House .
Too many Democrats oppose provisions in the Senate 's 10 - year , $ 871 billion bill , she said .
" In its present form , without any changes , I do n't think it 's possible to pass the Senate bill , " she said .
" I do n't see the votes for it . "
The fate of health care , Obama 's top domestic priority , has been uncertain since Republican Scott Brown won Tuesday 's Senate election in Massachusetts .
Brown , who said he expects to be seated in coming days , would give Republicans the 41 votes they need to block a final Senate vote on the health care bill .
Brown 's seat was held by Sen.
Edward Kennedy , an architect of the bill , for nearly 47 years .
The Democratic lawmaker died in August .
Throughout the past year , some provisions of the bill have received bipartisan support , such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions and from refusing to pay claims after their enrollees become sick .
Both parties broadly backed the idea of providing subsidies to help families afford premiums .
Pascrell said Democrats are focusing on those measures , which polls show have wide public support .
Trying to pass only popular provisions of the bill comes with risk .
In the case of the new insurance regulations , the industry has said Congress must pair those rules with a requirement that everyone buy a health care plan .
Otherwise , the industry says , premiums will increase .
Many well - liked items in the bill are linked to more controversial ideas , said the Brookings Institution 's Mark McClellan .
That is partly because of the complexity of the nation 's health care system , he said .
" People did n't develop a trillion - dollar bill because they wanted to spend a trillion dollars , " he said .
Republicans said they would be willing to find common ground with Democrats if given the opportunity .
Rep. Eric Cantor , R - Va. , said Democratic meetings in past days suggest that does n't appear likely .
" There was absolutely no indication whatsoever that the Democratic majority had gotten the message , " he said of the special election .
" They were … negotiating with themselves . "

Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine , an abortion rights Republican who has sponsored legislation that would require insurance companies to cover contraception , has seen a major change .
" Two decades or more ago , I do n't think there was much of a divide on contraception and family planning , " she says .
" It was one area both sides could agree on as a way to reduce unwanted pregnancies .
Now it becomes embroiled in philosophical disputes . "
The Guttmacher Institute , which like Siecus has been an advocate for birth control and sex education for decades , has also felt the shift .
" Ten years ago the fight was all about abortion , " says Cynthia Dailard , a senior public - policy associate at Guttmacher .
" Increasingly , they have moved to attack and denigrate contraception .
For those of us who work in the public health field , and respect longstanding public health principles — that condoms reduce S.T.D.'s , that contraception is the most effective way to help people avoid unintended pregnancy — it 's extremely disheartening to think we may be set back decades . "
It was a Friday afternoon at the end of August last year , with most of official Washington on vacation , when a press conference was called at F.D.A. headquarters in Rockville , Md . The occasion was a major drug announcement , but no one from the agency 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research was in the room to hear Commissioner Lester M. Crawford declare that " the agency is unable at this time to reach a decision on the approvability of the application . "
It was for Plan B .
Plan B , the brand name for the most common form of emergency contraception , has been on the market since 1999 ( another form , Preven , came on the market in 1998 ) .
The pill , which contains concentrated amounts of progestin , a hormone found in ordinary birth control pills , can prevent a pregnancy most effectively if taken within 72 hours of having sex .
( The abortion pill , by contrast , can be taken up to 49 days after the beginning of the last menstrual period and causes the chemical abortion of a fetus . )
Plan B's manufacturer applied in April 2003 for permission to sell Plan B over the counter .
Reproductive and women 's health professionals expected clear sailing for the drug ( morning - after contraception has been available in some European countries for more than 20 years ) .
Experts overwhelmingly considered it safe : in December 2003 the F.D.A.'s own joint advisory panel voted 28 - 0 that it was " safe for use in the nonprescription setting " and then voted 23 to 4 in favor of granting Plan B over - the - counter status .
The hope many people had for the drug was tied to an ugly number : 21 .
That is the number of abortions in the U.S. per year per 1,000 women of reproductive age , which puts the country at or near the top among developed nations .
Put another way , according to a study released this past week by the Guttmacher Institute , there are 6.4 million pregnancies a year in the U.S. , 3.1 million of which are unintended and 1.3 million of which end in abortion .
In the seven years since the last such study , the overall unintended - pregnancy rate has remained unchanged ; for women below the poverty level it increased 29 percent .
If women had quick , easy access to a backup contraceptive , the thinking of Plan B proponents went , those rates — and thus the abortion rate — would drop .
" I saw it as a win - win situation , something that everyone on both sides of the abortion issue could support , " says Dr. Susan F. Wood , who was at the time director of the Office of Women 's Health at the F.D.A .
" I still do n't get what happened . "
One thing that happened , which Dr. Wood and many others may have failed to notice , was the change in conservative circles on the subject of contraception .
At a White House press briefing in May of last year , three months before the F.D.A.'s nonruling on Plan B , Press Secretary Scott McClellan was asked four times by a WorldNetDaily correspondent , Les Kinsolving , if the president supported contraception .
" I think the president 's views are very clear when it comes to building a culture of life , " McClellan replied .
Kinsolving said , " If they were clear , I would n't have asked . "
McClellan replied : " And if you want to ask those questions , that 's fine .
I 'm just not going to dignify them with a response . "
This exchange caught the attention of bloggers and others .
In July , a group of Democrats in Congress , led by Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York , sent the first of four letters to the president asking outright : " Mr. President , do you support the right to use contraception ? "
According to Representative Maloney 's office , the White House has still not responded .

For those who were listening , that silence may have given an indication of what had been going on inside the F.D.A .
After the agency 's advisory committees voted in favor of over - the - counter status for Plan B at the end of 2003 , and after it was further approved at every level of the agency 's professional staff , standard procedure would have been for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research arm of the F.D.A. to approve the application .
But one member of the F.D.A. 's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee had reservations : Dr. W. David Hager , a Christian conservative whom President Bush appointed to lead the panel in 2002 .
( After an outcry from women 's groups , who were upset at Dr. Hager 's writing that he used Jesus as a model for how he treated women in his gynecology practice , he was shifted from chairman of the panel to ordinary member . )
Dr. Hager said he feared that if Plan B were freely available , it would increase sexual promiscuity among teenagers .
F.D.A. staff members presented research showing that these fears were ungrounded : large - scale studies showed no increase in sexual activity when Plan B was available to them , and both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Adolescent Medicine endorsed the switch to over - the - counter status .
Others argued that the concern was outside the agency 's purview : that the F.D.A.'s mandate was specifically limited to safety and did not extend to matters like whether a product might lead to people having more sex .
Meanwhile a government report later found that Dr. Janet Woodcock , deputy commissioner for operations at the F.D.A. , had also expressed a fear that making the drug available over the counter could lead to " extreme promiscuous behaviors such as the medication taking on an ' urban legend ' status that would lead adolescents to form sex - based cults centered around the use of Plan B . "
In May 2004 , the F.D.A. rejected the finding of its scientific committees and denied the application , citing some of the reasons that Dr. Hager had expressed .
