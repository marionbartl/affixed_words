Reformed hacker - turned - security - consultant Kevin Mitnick served five years in federal prison for breaking into phone and software company networks .
He talks about his past hacking exploits , computer security , and how he turned an illegal hobby into a useful career .
Hacking was n't always illegal .
I started off in what they call " phone phreaking " in the late 70s .
This is the same hobby Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had .
At this time , 1978 , there were no laws against hacking .
The first law that criminalized hacking was passed in 1980 in California .
I was doing this before it was illegal .
And my interest was entertainment — the pursuit of knowledge , challenge and the trophy of the stolen information .
There was no motive for money or malicious intent to use , disclose or destroy the data .
Learn the rules before you play the game .
I knew hacking was sneaky when I started , but I did n't think it would get me into trouble .
Back in my day , they did n't teach us about ethics in respect to hacking or using computers .
Now , I tell kids to not follow in my footsteps .
As computers become more accessible , there are more ethical ways to learn about computer security .
Plus , there are laws now .
Not everyone takes security seriously .
I 've been testing a company — a financial institution — and they are governed by Sarbanes - Oxley and other regulations .
I 've done their security assessments for the last four years and each time I get in the same way .
It 's surprising that these companies do security audits to find their vulnerabilities but do n't do much about them .
They are required by law to do the audits so you'd think the auditors would require them to fix the issues , but in a lot of cases they do n't .
Use your powers for good , not evil .
When I was released from custody in 2000 , the U.S. government asked for my help .
U.S. senators Fred Thompson and Joseph Lieberman invited me to testify before Congress about the government 's computer security vulnerabilities .
Once the restrictions of my release were up , I went into full - fledged security work , such as training , security assessments and product evaluations .
It 's a reversal of fortune .
Before , I was doing something exciting — but it was unauthorized and illegal .
Now , I do the same thing that got me in trouble , except I do it with authorization .
Clients hand me their network and tell me to break in so they can fix security vulnerabilities .
To me , it 's the same act but it helps my clients and it's legal and ethical , so it 's a win -win situation .
It 's interesting that you can take a criminal activity like hacking and make it into a legitimate enterprise .
I can't think of any other illegal activity you can do that with .
Even hackers get hacked .
Attackers found a way onto my Web server .
However , my website is hosted by a third - party hosting company , so when my site gets hacked it 's the hosting service 's security shortcomings , not my own .
Of course it 's embarrassing and I do n't like it .
Fortunately , I do n't have any proprietary information on my public - facing servers .
The downside is that people think my company was hacked , but it was really this hosting company 's network and not my own site that was breached .
Is it not a rather fantastic historical irony that the torture techniques that the North Vietnamese used against McCain that forced him to offer a videotaped false confession ... are now the techniques the Bush administration is using to gain " intelligence " about terror networks .
How is it possible to know that everything John McCain once said on videotape for the enemy was false , because it was coerced , and yet assert that everything we torture out of terror suspects using exactly the same techniques , is true ?
In fact , McCain at least knew somewhere that his own government knew he existed , that there were procedures to eventually release him , that he was on someone 's radar .
The average prisoner at Gitmo or in the other parts of the detention program believes that no one will ever save him , that he could be disappeared for ever , that there are no procedures for his eventual release and no government to remember him .
If McCain uttered lies on tape to stop the torture , why would an Islamist tell the truth ?
Nothing more accurately exposes the classic moral error of the Bush administration and its enablers in war crimes .
If the enemy tortures , it defines their moral evil and all intelligence gleaned from such coercion is self - evidently false propaganda .
If we do it , it is n't wrong , and it leads to good intelligence .
Got that ?
And these people have the gall to describe their ideological opponents as moral relativists .

Think Tank Report Over Half of Afghanistan under Taliban Control
Six years ago coalition forces headed into Afghanistan to eradicate the Taliban .
Now an international think tank says more than half of the country is under the Taliban 's thumb .
Meanwhile , an Oxfam report sharply criticized US - led development efforts in the region .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
A new analysis of the Martian rock that gave hints of water on the Red Planet -- and , therefore , optimism about the prospect of life -- now suggests the water was more likely a thick brine , far too salty to support life as we know it .
The finding , by scientists at Harvard University and Stony Brook University , is detailed this week in the journal Science .
" Liquid water is required by all species on Earth and we 've assumed that water is the very least that would be necessary for life on Mars , " says Nicholas J. Tosca , a postdoctoral researcher in Harvard 's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology .
" However , to really assess Mars ' habitability we need to consider the properties of its water .
Not all of Earth 's waters are able to support life , and the limits of terrestrial life are sharply defined by water 's temperature , acidity , and salinity . "
Together with co-authors Andrew H. Knoll and Scott M. McLennan , Tosca analyzed salt deposits in four - billion - year - old Martian rock explored by NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover , Opportunity , and by orbiting spacecraft .
It was the Mars Rover whose reports back to Earth stoked excitement over water on the ancient surface of the Red Planet .
The new analysis suggests that even billions of years ago , when there was unquestionably some water on Mars , its salinity commonly exceeded the levels in which terrestrial life can arise , survive , or thrive .
" Our sense has been that while Mars is a lousy environment for supporting life today , long ago it might have more closely resembled Earth , " says Knoll , Fisher Professor of Natural Sciences and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Harvard .
" But this result suggests quite strongly that even as long as four billion years ago , the surface of Mars would have been challenging for life .
No matter how far back we peer into Mars ' history , we may never see a point at which the planet really looked like Earth . "
Tosca , Knoll , and McLennan studied mineral deposits in Martian rock to calculate the " water activity " of the water that once existed on Mars .
Water activity is a quantity affected by how much solute is dissolved in water ; since water molecules continuously adhere to and surround solute molecules , water activity reflects the amount of water that remains available for biological processes .
The water activity of pure water is 1.0 , where all of its molecules are unaffected by dissolved solute and free to mediate biological processes .
Terrestrial seawater has a water activity of 0.98 .
Decades of research , largely from the food industry , have shown that few known organisms can grow when water activity falls below 0.9 , and very few can survive below 0.85 .
Based on the chemical composition of salts that precipitated out of ancient Martian waters , Tosca and his colleagues project that the water activity of Martian water was at most 0.78 to 0.86 , and quite possibly reaching below 0.5 as evaporation continued to concentrate the brines , making it an environment uninhabitable by terrestrial species .
" This does n't rule out life forms of a type we 've never encountered , " Knoll says , " but life that could originate and persist in such a salty setting would require biochemistry distinct from any known among even the most robust halophiles on Earth . "
The scientists say that the handful of terrestrial halophiles -- species that can tolerate high salinity -- descended from ancestors that first evolved in purer waters .
Based on what we know about Earth , they say that it 's difficult to imagine life arising in acidic , oxidizing brines like those inferred for ancient Mars .
" People have known for hundreds of years that salt prevents microbial growth , " Tosca says .
" It 's why meat was salted in the days before refrigeration . "
Tosca and Knoll say it 's possible there may have been more dilute waters earlier in Mars ' history , or elsewhere on the planet .
However , the area whose rocks they studied -- called Meridiani Planum -- is believed , based on Mars Rover data , to have been one of the wetter , more hospitable areas of ancient Mars .

Obama on McCain : Hypocrisy and fear - mongering
In an appearance in South Dakota just now , Barack Obama came back at yesterday 's attacks from George W. Bush and John McCain , accusing them of " hypocrisy , fear - peddling and fear - mongering . "
He responded first to the charge from Bush that Democrats stand for appeasement in the Middle East .
" That ’s exactly the kind of appalling attack that ’s divided our country and that alienates us from the world , and that ’s why we need change in Washington , " he said , going to repeatedly link Bush and McCain .
" That was frustrating enough , " he said of Bush 's words .
" Then John McCain gives a speech .
He gave a speech in the morning where he talked about the need for civility in our politics .
He talked about elevating the tone in our country ...
Not an hour later , he turned around and embraced George Bush 's attacks on Democrats .
He jumped on a call with a bunch of bloggers and said that I was n’t fit to protect this nation that I love . "
McCain " accused me of not being fit to protect this nation — a nation my grandfather served in World War II — a nation that ’s given me everything that I have , " Obama said , then pivoted to attack Bush and McCain on a series of issues : Iraq ; the survival of Osama bin Laden 's and Al Qaeda 's leadership ; Iran 's strength ; and Hamas ' and Hezbollah 's ascendancy .
He broke in particular with Bush 's focus on democracy in the Middle East above all else .
" They ’ll have to explain why Hamas now controls Gaza — Hamas that was strengthened because the U.S. insisted that we have democratic elections in the Palestinian Authority , " he said .
McCain " still has n’t spelled out one substantial way that he’d be different from GB when it comes to foreign policy , " Obama said , accusing both of " dishonest , divisive attacks . "
He also mocked McCain 's opposition to talking to Hamas in light of an interview McCain gave two years ago , in which he appeared to support talking to Hamas .
Then he returned to themes familiar from his primary fight with Hillary Rodham Clinton .
" They ’re trying to fool you .
They ’re trying to scare you .
And they ’re not telling you the truth .
And the reason is that they ca n’t win a foreign policy debate on the merits , " he said , calling their belief in the power of " tough talk " " naive and irresponsible " — charges he exchanged with Clinton over his plan to meet with dictators .
More and more U.S. college students are smoking tobacco using waterpipes – or hookahs – and it's becoming a growing public health issue , according to a new study led by a Virginia Commonwealth University researcher .
The findings offer important insight into the prevalence and perceptions related to waterpipe tobacco smokers and are reported in the May issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health .
" These results should serve as an alarm bell to anyone interested in public health in the United States .
Preventing tobacco - caused death and disease means remaining alert to new forms of tobacco smoking and then understanding the health risks of these new forms and communicating these risks to public health workers , policy makers , and to smokers themselves , " said principal investigator Thomas Eissenberg , Ph.D. , associate professor in the VCU Department of Psychology .
In a hookah , tobacco is heated by charcoal , and the resulting smoke is passed through a water - filled chamber , cooling the smoke before it reaches the smoker .
Some waterpipe users perceive this method of smoking tobacco as less harmful and addictive than cigarette smoking .
According to Eissenberg , current and prospective waterpipe tobacco smokers should be made aware that waterpipe tobacco smoking is not as benign as they might think .
Waterpipe and cigarette smoke contains some of the same toxins -- disease - causing tar and carbon monoxide , as well as dependence - producing nicotine .
Additionally , the exposure to these toxins through waterpipe smoking may be greater due to longer periods of use .
Further , smokers take more and larger puffs with waterpipes , leading to inhalation of 100 times more smoke from a single waterpipe use episode relative to a single cigarette .
Through a cross-sectional study , approximately 744 students , mostly between the ages of 18 and 21 , completed an Internet survey that included questions about demographics , tobacco use , risk perceptions and perceived social acceptability .
The research team found that approximately 43 percent of those surveyed had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past year ; and 20 percent of them had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past month .
Users were more likely to perceive waterpipes as less harmful than cigarettes compared to those who had never used a waterpipe before .
" The data we report , along with data from other schools , show that waterpipe tobacco smoking is common on college campuses across the country .
Thus , prevention messages , especially those that communicate the potential risks of waterpipe tobacco smoking , should focus on college campuses . "
In future studies , Eissenberg and his team hope to examine the prevalence of this method of tobacco use in a large , national sample of waterpipe tobacco smokers in the United States , and assess potential health risks and dependence - producing effects .
In the future , researchers may be able to determine the role that waterpipe use among youth may serve as a ' gateway ' for use of other tobacco products or psychoactive substances .

Who knows if one resounding win is enough to serve notice that these postseason Yankees are different than the Sultans of Streaky who pogoed through an erratic regular season .﻿﻿
But it ’s easier to believe that idea if Gerrit Cole is going to pitch like this when he gets the ball .
Above : a microburst , and not a tornado
They 're " matchsticks cracking , " a " deafening roar " ; they make their victims feel " surrounded by whiteness " ; they 're a " sudden roar like an express train " and , again , a " freight train tearing through [ one 's ] yard " ; above all else , they 're " a big push of power . "
They 're microbursts , and residents are usually too shaken up to know how to describe them when reporters arrive on - scene , as quoted above in Republican articles over the last decade .
Nonetheless , we had a microburst in Whately on Saturday that may have had a small tornado " embedded " in it , which is enough to make any reporter or TV news crew convulse with journalistic euphoria .
But what is a microburst ?
We took a look in the Republican archives - over 30 stories across 15 years of reporting on , defining , and describing microbursts and their effects , dating back to November , 1993 - for answers .
Below , we rank the most common scientific definitions of microbursts that came up in articles :
So , okay , a microburst is most likely to be " a downburst of violent winds . "
However , " mini - tornado , " the last description in the list above , is interesting .
One could indeed think of microbursts as a tornado 's younger , estranged brother , or a reverse tornado , or a giant wind bomb dropped from above , or God blowing down gales of condemnation on the infidels .
Microbursts are often mistaken , initially , as tornadoes for their intense wind and the damage they cause , until the weather experts are called in to " investigate " whether or not an intense gust of wind was a tornado or a microburst .
The two are actually pretty different , and a microburst is n't even categorized as a type of tornado - microbursts do n't spin .
Tornadoes , obviously , get most of the media attention in our weather reportage - they 're tall , gaudy , noisy , they stumble around and break things as if they were inebriated , they spin and sling roof panels and cows around and such .
According to the National Climactic Data Center , which has online records of storms dating back to 1950 , there have been 23 tornadoes in Franklin County , 15 in Hampden , and 8 in Hampshire over the last 58 years .
Microbursts , however , are shorter , quicker and much more compressed .
Microbursts form when heavy rains collide with and evaporate into dry air .
That rain quickly cools the air ; that cooled air , in turn , amasses weight , forms into a large cold , Steve - Austin - like fist of heavier air , then plummets through the warmer , lighter air and into the ground ( according , not directly in those words , to a 1994 Union - News article ) .
So , basically , the air drops a huge , single punch to the ground - rather than meandering through it .
The wind from the microburst then expands outward once it hits land , and screws you over that way .
The parameters of a microburst are as such : if the area of damage is within a 4 kilometer diameter , it 's a microburst .
Beyond 4 kilometers , it 's a macroburst .
What 's more , the microburst is much younger than a tornado , celebrating but its 33rd birthday on June 24 .
The late meteorologist Tetsuya " Ted " Fujita discovered and coined the term " microburst " when researching the cause of the Eastern Airlines Flight 66 crash in 1975 ; that airliner was essentially hurled down to the ground amidst intense thunderstorm winds , killing 109 passengers and 6 crew members [ these numbers vary according to where you look ] .
Fujita 's 1998 obit offers a brief history of the little wind - category disaster that could :
So , what do tornadoes and microbursts have in common ?
They cause such man -on - the - street interview exclamations as : " This is pretty bad , " and " I was in the living room and was looking out the picture window and saw the rain coming sideways [...]
" I said , ' Uh oh ! ' " ; as well as the headlines : " It 's official : Strong tornado ravaged Wendell " in July 2006 , and " Weather Service : Storm was really tornado " in Northampton , on July 4th , 2000 .
In fact , many local microburst / tornado stories occur within days of July 4th .
Like fireworks , microbursts and tornadoes are immense , kind - of mesmerizing things to look at .
Most of them occur in America , and are morbidly awesome unless they are destroying your home .
To that end , below is a tornado that is not happening to you :
Could microbial life exist inside Enceladus , where no sunlight reaches , photosynthesis is impossible and no oxygen is available ?
To answer that question , we need look no farther than our own planet to find examples of the types of exotic ecosystems that could make life possible on Saturn ’s geyser moon .
The answer appears to be , yes , it could be possible .
It is this tantalizing potential that brings us back to Enceladus for further study .
In recent years , life forms have been found on Earth that thrive in places where the sun does n’t shine and oxygen is not present because no photosynthesis takes place .
Microbes have been discovered that survive on the energy from the chemical interaction between different kinds of minerals , and others that live off the energy from the radioactive decay in rocks .
The ecosystems are completely independent of oxygen or organic material produced by photosynthesis at Earth ’s surface .
These extraordinary microbial ecosystems are models for life that might be present inside Enceladus today .
There are three such ecosystems found on Earth that would conceivably be a basis for life on Enceladus .
Two are based on methanogens , which belong to an ancient group related to bacteria , called the archaea — the rugged survivalists of bacteria that thrive in harsh environments without oxygen .
Deep volcanic rocks along the Columbia River and in Idaho Falls host two of these ecosystems , which pull their energy from the chemical interaction of different rocks .
The third ecosystem is powered by the energy produced in the radioactive decay in rocks , and was found deep below the surface in a mine in South Africa .
So the evidence points to the feasibility of life in Enceladus .
But how would it get its start ?
A major problem in answering that question is that we do n’t know how life originated on Earth , nor have we been able to reproduce Earth ’s first spark of life in the laboratory .
But here ’s the good news : there are a lot of theories for how life originated on Earth .
Now the question is — do they apply to Enceladus ?
Two of the theories for the origin of life on Earth do seem to apply to Enceladus –the “ primordial soup ” theory and the deep sea vent theory .
Primordial Soup Theory
The theory that the origin of life occurred in a soup of organic material that came together from non-biological sources traces back to Charles Darwin , and was demonstrated in a famous experiment in 1953 when the chemists Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey cooked up a primordial soup of chemicals thought to have been present on early Earth before life began .
A spark , simulating lightning , was passed through this highly reduced mixture of methane , ammonia , water vapor and hydrogen .
Within two weeks , a few amino acids , some of the building blocks of life , had formed in the soup .
While Miller and Urey did not actually create life , they demonstrated that very complex molecules ?
amino - acids ?
could emerge spontaneously from simpler chemicals .
On Earth , it ’s possible that the organic ingredients of the soup were produced from existing materials on the early Earth .
Another theory is that the right soup mix ingredients arrived as incoming comet material and interplanetary dust .
Organic chemicals were part of the raw material from which Enceladus and Saturn ’s other moons formed .
The origin of Enceladus ’ heat is less clear , but there are several possibilities that could have given Enceladus a layer of liquid water that persists today .
Early on , it could have been heated by decay of short - lived radioactivity in rocks , with the heating prolonged by tidal influences .
Or perhaps an earlier oblong orbit could have brought more tidal heating than exists there today .
A past tidal relationship with another moon could have caused the heat .
Another theory says the heat could have been produced from a process called serpentization , where chemical binding of water and silicate rock could occur at the upper layer of the moon ’s core .
This increases the volume of the rock and creates energy in the form of heat .
Any of these heating mechanisms might have created a liquid subsurface aquifer solution rich in organics , allowing Enceladus to serve up a suitable prebiotic soup .
Deep Sea Vent Theory
The deep sea vent theory for the origin of life on Earth might apply to Enceladus as well .
In this scenario , life on Earth began at the interface where chemically rich fluids , heated by tidal or other mechanisms , emerge from below the sea floor .
Chemical energy is derived from the reduced gases , such as hydrogen - sulfide and hydrogen coming out from the vent in contact with a suitable oxidant , such as carbon dioxide .
Hot spots on an Enceladus sea floor could be locales for this type of process .
We do n’t know how long it takes for life to start when the ingredients are there and the environment is suitable , but it appears to have happened quickly on Earth .
So maybe it was possible that on Enceladus , life started in a “ warm little pond ” below the icy surface occurring over the last few tens of millions of years .
For life to persist once it has been established requires an environment of liquid water , the essential elements and nutrients , and an energy source .
At Enceladus , we have evidence for liquid water , but we do n’t know its origin .
We have observed simple organic chemicals there , and the March 12 close flyby indicates there are some complex organic chemicals , as well .
An energy source of some sort is producing geysers .
As Cassini ’s exploration continues , we ’re seeking to bring together more pieces of this intriguing puzzle .
The first step toward answering the question of whether life exists inside the subsurface aquifer of Enceladus is to analyze the organic compounds in the plume .
Cassini ’s March 12 passage through the plume provided some measurements that help us move toward an answer , and preliminary plans call for Cassini to fly through the plume again for more measurements in the future .
Ultimately , another mission in the future could conceivably land near the plume or even return plume material to Earth for laboratory analysis .

' No ' to the EU Why Europe Should Listen to Ireland
Ireland shot down the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum held on Thursday .
Already , EU politicians are branding the Irish as ingrates .
But it is exactly that kind of arrogance which helped lead to the Irish " no " in the first place .

andwere photographed today visiting the Kabbalah Center in Manhattan .
The group arrived in a rain storm , leaving everyone a little worse for wear .
Madonna , in particular , looked like her hair was soaking wet .
We have photos of the group as they exit the center later today .
The only family member missing from the photos is Rocco Ritchie .
David Banda is the couples adopted son from Malawi and Lourdes is the daughter of Carlos Leon , an actor and personal trainer who had an affair with Madonna in 1996 .
The family outing may be Madonna 's way of silencing the media speculation that she and Guy are headed for divorce court .
The singer is also rumored to be having an affair with Alex Rodriguez , the New York Yankees player who recently split with his wife Cynthia .
Check out the family photos taken earlier today .

The trend is especially pronounced in Philadelphia 's suburbs , where Democratic leads acquired in Montgomery and Bucks Counties in the primary season have already grown .
In Montgomery County , Democratic Commissioner Joseph M. Hoeffel III reacted with some glee to numbers that showed his party had increased its advantage from 10,001 voters on April 22 to 13,784 as of yesterday .
" The timing of the arrest , only days after the commemoration of the massacre of over 7,000 Bosnians committed in Srebrenica , is particularly appropriate , as there is no better tribute to the victims of the war 's atrocities than bringing their perpetrators to justice , " the White House Press Secretary said .

Black Listed News
July 11 , 2008
( Note : Dr. Doug Rokke is the former Director of the U.S. Army ’s Depleted Uranium Project .
It was his task to clean up the radioactive battlefields of the Gulf War .
Today , this leading opponent of nuclear warfare is vitally concerned that sand contaminated by radioactive munitions exploded in the Middle East has been shipped to Idaho for burial .
And more , much more .
He asked me to call his warning to public attention . )
During the summer of 1991 , the United States military had collected artillery , tanks , Bradley fighting vehicles , conventional and unconventional munitions , trucks , etc. at Camp Doha in Kuwait .
The shipment across the ocean , unloading at Longview , Washington State port , transport by rail , and burial in Idaho endangers not only the residents of these areas but poses a significant agricultural threat through introduction of pests , microbes , etc. foreign to our nation .
As result of carelessness this weapons depot caught fire with consequent catastrophic explosion resulting in death , injury , illness and extensive environmental contamination from depleted uranium and conventional explosives .
Recently the emirate of Kuwait required the United States Department of Defense to remove the contamination .
Consequently , over 6,700 tons of contaminated soil sand and other residue was collected and has been shipped back to the United States for burial by American Ecology at Boise Idaho .
When Bob Nichols , an investigative journalist , and I contacted American Ecology we found out that they had absolutely no knowledge of U.S. Army Regulation 700 - 48 , U.S. Army PAM 700 - 48 , U.S. Army Technical Bulletin 9-1300 -278 , and all of the medical orders dealing with depleted uranium contamination , environmental remediation procedures , safety , and medical care .
They had never heard of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for dealing with mixed – hazardous waste such as radioactive materials and conventional explosives byproducts .
( reference " Approaches for the Remediation of Federal Facility Sites Contaminated with Explosives or Radioactive Wastes " , EPA/625/R-93/013 , September 1993 ) .
The shipment across the ocean , unloading at Longview , Washington State port , transport by rail , and burial in Idaho endangers not only the residents of these areas but poses a significant agricultural threat through introduction of pests , microbes , etc. foreign to our nation .
Sadly the known adverse health and environmental hazards from uranium weapons contamination are in our own backyard .
The EPA has listed the former Nuclear Metals - Starmet uranium weapons manufacturing site in Concord Ma . On EPA ’s Superfund National Priority List because it poses a significant risk to public health and the environment .
Consequently the community in which our nation was born on April 18 , 1775 is now the location of America ’s own closed dirty bomb factory that will endanger the health and safety of the descendants of our original patriots - “ the Minutemen ” .
The previous delivery of at least 100 GBU 28 bunker busters bombs containing depleted uranium warheads by the United States and their use by Israel against Lebanese targets has resulted in additional radioactive and chemical toxic contamination with consequent adverse health and environmental effects throughout the middle east .
Israeli tank gunners are also using depleted uranium tank rounds as photographs verify .
Today , U.S. , British , and now Israeli military personnel are using illegal uranium munitions - America ’s and England ’s own " dirty bombs " while U.S. Army , U.S. Department of Energy , U.S. Department of Defense , and British Ministry of Defence officials deny that there are any adverse health and environmental effects as a consequence of the manufacture , testing , and / or use of uranium munitions to avoid liability for the willful and illegal dispersal of a radioactive toxic material – depleted uranium .
The use of uranium weapons is absolutely unacceptable , and a crime against humanity .
Consequently the citizens of the world and all governments must force cessation of uranium weapons use .
I must demand that Israel now provide medical care to all DU casualties in Lebanon and clean up all DU contamination .
U.S. and British officials have arrogantly refused to comply with their own regulations , orders , and directives that require United States Department of Defense officials to provide prompt and effective medical care to " all " exposed individuals .
Reference : Medical Management of Unusual Depleted Uranium Casualties , DOD , Pentagon , 10/14/93 , Medical Management of Army personnel Exposed to Depleted Uranium ( DU ) Headquarters , U.S. Army Medical Command 29 April 2004 , and section 2 - 5 of U.S. Army Regulation 700 - 48 .
Israeli officials must not do so now .
They also refuse to clean up dispersed radioactive Contamination as required by Army Regulation - AR 700 - 48 : " Management of Equipment Contaminated With Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities "
( Headquarters , Department Of The Army , Washington , D.C. , September 2002 ) and U.S. Army Technical Bulletin- TB 9-1300 - 278 : " Guidelines For Safe Response To Handling , Storage , And Transportation Accidents Involving Army Tank Munitions Or Armor Which Contain Depleted Uranium " ( Headquarters , Department Of The Army , Washington , D.C. , JULY 1996 ) .
Specifically section 2 - 4 of United States Army Regulation - AR 700 - 48 dated September 16 , 2002 requires that :
(1) " Military personnel " identify , segregate , isolate , secure , and label all RCE " ( radiologically contaminated equipment ) .
(2) " Procedures to minimize the spread of radioactivity will be implemented as soon as possible . "
(3) " Radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial , submersion , incineration , destruction in place , or abandonment " and
(4) " All equipment , to include captured or combat RCE , will be surveyed , packaged , retrograded , decontaminated and released IAW Technical Bulletin 9-1300 -278 , DA PAM 700 - 48 " ( Note : Maximum exposure limits are specified in Appendix F ) .
DOD leaders are not showing the DU training tapes to military personnel .
These three video tapes : ( 1 ) " Depleted Uranium Hazard Awareness " , ( 2 ) " Contaminated and Damaged Equipment Management " , and ( 3 ) " Operation of the AN / PDR 77 Radiac Set " are essential to understanding the hazards from the use of uranium weapons and management of uranium weapons contamination .
DOD leaders must show these tapes to all military personnel involved in the use of uranium weapons and the consequent management of uranium contamination .
The previous and current use of uranium weapons , the release of radioactive components in destroyed U.S. and foreign military equipment , and releases of industrial , medical , research facility radioactive materials have resulted in unacceptable exposures .
Therefore , decontamination must be completed as required by U.S. Army Regulation 700 - 48 and should include releases of all radioactive materials resulting from military operations .
The extent of adverse health and environmental effects of uranium weapons contamination is not limited to combat zones in the Balkans , Iraq , and Afghanistan but includes facilities and sites where uranium weapons were manufactured or tested including Vieques ; Puerto Rico ; Colonie , New York ; Concord , MA ; Jefferson Proving Grounds , Indiana ; and Schofield Barracks , Hawaii .
Therefore , medical care must be provided by the United States Department of Defense officials to all individuals affected by the manufacturing , testing , and / or use of uranium munitions .
Thorough environmental remediation also must be completed without further delay .
I am amazed that fifteen years after was I asked to clean up the initial DU mess from Gulf War 1 and over ten years since I finished the depleted uranium project that United States Department of Defense officials and others still attempt to justify uranium munitions use while ignoring mandatory requirements .
I am dismayed that Department of Defense and Department of Energy officials and representatives continue personal attacks aimed to silence or discredit those of us who are demanding that medical care be provided to all DU casualties and that environmental remediation is completed in compliance with U.S. Army Regulation 700 - 48 .
But beyond the ignored mandatory actions the willful dispersal of tons of solid radioactive and chemically toxic waste in the form of uranium munitions is illegal ( http://www.traprockpeace.org/karen_parker_du_illegality.pdf) and just does not even pass the common sense test and according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , DHS , is a dirty bomb .
DHS issued " dirty bomb " response guidelines , http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/fr-cont.html
, on January 3 , 2006 for incidents within the United States but ignore DOD use of uranium weapons and existing DOD regulations .
These guidelines specifically state that : " Characteristics of RDD and IND Incidents : A radiological incident is defined as an event or series of events , deliberate or accidental , leading to the release , or potential release , into the environment of radioactive material in sufficient quantity to warrant consideration of protective actions .
Use of an RDD or IND is an act of terror that produces a radiological incident . "
Thus the use of uranium munitions is " an act or terror " as defined by DHS .
Finally continued compliance with the infamous March 1991 Los Alamos Memorandum that was issued to ensure continued use of uranium munitions can not be justified .
In conclusion : the President of the United States - George W. Bush , the Prime Minister of Great Britain - Gordon Brown , and the Prime Minister of Israel Olmert must acknowledge and accept responsibility for willful use of illegal uranium munitions - their own " dirty bombs " - resulting in adverse health and environmental effects .
President Bush , Prime Minister Brown , and Prime Minister Olmert should order :
1. medical care for all casualties ,
2. thorough environmental remediation ,
3. immediate cessation of retaliation against all of us who demand compliance with medical care and environmental remediation requirements ,
4. and stop the already illegal the use ( UN finding ) of depleted uranium munitions .

A friend gave me the Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD this past Christmas , and I finally got around to watching them the other day .
Since I had n’t seen the series in a few years , I ’d forgotten just how magnificent the movies really are .
Before their release , I had been openly skeptical that anyone could do justice to Tolkien ’s marvelous trilogy , but director Peter Jackson and his cast and crew did it ; they hit a grand slam .
As I watched the movies , I was struck by the timeless and universal themes woven into Tolkien ’s tale .
Power , and the seductive pull it exerts on the human psyche , is at the heart of the human experience and at the root of most of our tragedies .
By the time the final credits rolled , I got a sinking feeling that many of the movie ’s characters and plot themes were being repeated all around us in a tragic example of life imitating art .
With several ongoing wars , an economy in peril , and a farcical electoral season upon us , the pursuit of power is the narrative of the day , and our cast of characters is veritably Tolkienesque .
Here , then , are my nominations for our very own Americanized version of The Lord of the Rings :
Saruman the White : Alan Greenspan
Alan Greenspan was once a white wizard of libertarianism .
He preached the gospel of individual liberty and free market economics all over the world .
For years , he collaborated with Ayn Rand , and he even wrote an eloquent paean on the virtues of the gold standard .
But as the years passed , he ensconced himself high atop the Fed Tower in Washington and hungrily stared into Sauron ’s crystal ball .
Seduced by the dark side , he sent forth swarms of counterfeit dollars , more destructive than any horde of uruk - hai , to obliterate our economy and wreck the livelihood of our people .
Frodo Baggins : Ron Paul
Long ago , America had rulers who respected our constitution and actually believed that there should be reasonable limits to the federal government ’s power .
During that time , the nation prospered and the people lived in peace .
But when our Founders ’ line disappeared , a succession of power - mongering con artists took over .
Now , we teeter on the edge of bankruptcy in an age of intrusive government and ceaseless warfare .
Ron Paul , a diminutive , humble man from a shire somewhere in Texas , seeks to take the One Ring and hurl it into the fires of Mount Doom .
While there is always hope , his is a long and difficult journey , and his chances of success are slim .
Sméagol : Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton had the One Ring for eight long years .
She reveled in its power and glory until it was taken away by George W. Bush .
Ever since then , she ’s been trolling around the countryside in a desperate quest to get it back .
( Rumor has it that she goes to bed at night caressing a miniature copy of the Presidential Seal while mumbling " my precious . " )
A coincidence ?
Sauron : Alexander Hamilton
There are many candidates for the role of Sauron in this American morality play , but after some deep thought I believe the dubious distinction belongs to Alexander Hamilton .
In many ways , he was the weasel in the Founders ’ woodpile , the serpent in the Garden of Eden .
While the other Founders were envisioning a radical new republic based on individual liberty and limited government , Hamilton worked tirelessly to fashion something very different .
He believed in an omnipotent central government , an activist foreign policy , a powerful standing military and the benevolent effects of central banking .
( One government to rule them all … and in the darkness , bind them ) .
Though Hamilton has long since passed from the physical world , his fiery eye still hovers over Mordor - on - the - Potomac , a mortal threat to the remnants of our republic .
Gandalf the Gray : Lew Rockwell
Lew Rockwell , following in the footsteps of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard , has walked the earth these past decades warning of the coming tempest .
He has organized a small band of partisans and sent them forth to save Middle America from the evil hordes of Mordor .
Grima Wormtongue : Dick Cheney
In Lord of the Rings , Grima is the archetypical court manipulator .
An inveterate liar and flatterer , he works his wiles on the hapless King Theoden to deliver Rohan into Saruman ’s clutches .
Dick Cheney plies a similar trade in the White House , where he whispers his dark plots into the ear of our imbecilic president and moves his agenda of war and state capitalism inexorably forward .
The Dead Army of Dunharrow : The American People
Many years ago , these soldiers , also called the Shadow Host , pledged their lives in defense of Gondor .
But at a crucial moment they betrayed their oaths .
Instead , they fled into the caverns below Dwimorberg Mountain where they were condemned to a living death until the day they should somehow regain their honor .
The American people , likewise , were bequeathed a free republic courtesy of the sweat and blood of their forefathers .
Through the years , that republic has come under relentless assault from those who would replace it with a militarized , authoritarian empire .
And rather than fulfill their oath to defend that republic , the masses of the American people have retreated into a sheep - like , narcotized state of willful ignorance and indifference .
It remains to be seen whether some Aragon will appear and shame them into recapturing their birthright .
But America may not be as lucky as the denizens of Middle Earth .
From what I ’ve been seeing on the campaign trail this year , Sauron is coasting to victory .

Soaring petrol prices helped drive up US consumer prices last month at the fastest rate in six months , the government said yesterday , but core prices remained tame , easing inflation fears in financial markets .
A separate report showed US consumer sentiment tumbling to a 28 - year low this month , with some lessening of expectations on inflation one year out and a steady reading on long - term inflation expectations , which held at a 13 - year high .
The Commerce Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a steep 0.6 per cent last month , a touch more than Wall Street had expected , after a modest 0.2 pc gain in April .
However , so - called core prices , which exclude volatile food and energy cost , edged up just 0.2 pc .
Surging petrol prices and soft labour market conditions have depressed consumer spirits .
The Reuters / University of Michigan sentiment index for this month dropped to 56.7 from 59.8 last month .
Wall Street economists had expected a decline to only 59.5 .
“ Today ’s inflation numbers do not put any additional pressure on the Fed to hike interest rates , ” said Mark Vitner , senior economist at Wachovia in Charlotte , North Carolina .
“ The Fed is not nearly as behind the curve as some people currently believe . ”
The reassuring data followed a series of inflation warnings from central bankers around the globe , and capped off a week in which expectations of higher US rates had climbed sharply .
Read
Energy prices surged 4.4 pc last month , the biggest rise since November , after holding steady in April .
Gasoline prices spiked 5.7 pc , also the biggest rise in six months .
The cost of food rose 0.3 pc after climbing 0.9 pc in April .
Over the past year , consumer prices have risen 4.2 pc on soaring food and energy costs , the highest reading since January .
But core prices are up a tamer 2.3 pc over the past 12 months , the same as in April .
Officials at the Fed and other central banks have made clear they are on high alert for signs the sharp run-up in food and gasoline prices is bleeding through to other costs , and they will likely welcome the benign reading on core prices .
The US central bank focuses on core inflation in setting interest rates because it believes the sharp price swings food and energy often exhibit can obscure underlying inflation trends .
However , in recent days , Fed officials have cast a wary eye on record - high oil prices and warned about the risk that rising inflation expectations could become self - fulfilling .
“ The latest round of increases in energy prices has added to the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations , ” Fed chief Ben Bernanke said .
The number of top degrees has more than doubled in the past decade Universities are turning a blind eye to cheating to boost degree results , a leading academic has said .
Buckingham University 's Professor Geoffrey Alderman says league tables create pressure to award high marks .
The number of first - class honours degrees awarded has risen by more than 100 % in the past decade .
The number of undergraduates is up by just over 40 % .
Universities UK , which represents vice - chancellors , said all courses were subject to regular internal monitoring .
Professor Alderman , who used to set standards at the University of London , will say in a lecture that academics are under pressure to turn a blind eye to plagiarism and " mark positively " , which could lead to a collapse in degree standards .
PLAGIARISM 9,200 students caught 143 expelled Most common penalty to re-submit work More students received verbal reprimand than were expelled
Few penalties for plagiarism Despite the rise in first class degrees , Professor Alderman says standards have actually dropped .
He also says universities have been lenient with overseas students because they rely on them heavily for their fees .
Professor Alderman will say : " Standards of English literacy at UK universities are often poor .
" To compensate for this , lecturers are pressured to ' mark positively ' .
This is particularly true in relation to international students , whose full - cost fees are now a lucrative and essential source of much - needed revenue .

He will add : " I have heard it seriously argued that international students who plagiarise should be treated more leniently than British students because of ' differential cultural norms ' .
" It is indeed rare , nowadays , for habitual plagiarists to be expelled from their universities . "
A study published recently found only 143 students caught cheating were expelled out of 9,200 cases - despite almost all universities threatening expulsion as a sanction .
Universities UK said the system for assuring quality and standards in higher education was " sound and well - established " .
A spokesman added : " It is also well respected internationally and has informed and influenced parallel developments worldwide . "

What are these ?
A few weeks ago , we asked you to take a survey about whether Star Trek or Doctor Who had molded your brain .
We wanted to know whether there was any connection between being a fan of one of these shows and what your career aspirations might be - as well as what career you wind up having .
Over 1600 people responded , and it turns out Doctor Who and Star Trek fans are n't very differently - brained .
Both shows inspire fans to have similar dream jobs , though not all of them manage to get those jobs when they grow up .
We also learned what fans want most from the shows .
Find out more , and check out our amazing data charts , below .

Overall Mindsets
The spread of occupations and aspirations for both Doctor Who and Star Trek fans is near - identical ; what differs , in fact , is the occupations and the aspirations themselves .
The number one dream of approximately 29 % of the 1,648 survey respondents is to work in science .
Visual and Performing Arts takes a close second , with 14 % of respondents wishing to work in that area .
After that , 11 % of respondents declared " Other , " and while most of those were either unsure of their careers or unwilling to place their jobs in one of the broader categories , the most outspoken contingent in the " Other " group announced their childhood wishes to be astronauts .
Both Star Trek and Doctor Who , then , breed aspiring stargazers , intellectuals , artists , actors , and people with careers too varied to define .

Where the lives of fans actually end up is a slightly different matter .
23 % of respondents work in Computers & Mathematics , even though less than 7 % aspired to that career .
Students are next — perhaps those 17 % of respondents are all budding scientists and thespians , though the majority suggests otherwise .
9 % of respondents qualified their careers as Education , Museum Work , and Library Science ; only 5 % wanted to work in that area as children .
Just under half of the aspiring visual and performing artists achieved their dream , and only 2 % work in the nerd - kid - favorite career of Science .
While this is as much influenced by teachers , parents , mentors , locations , and salaries as it is any television show , the crevasse between childhood aspirations and eventual careers is a telling look at how the needs of the world transform the dreams of individuals .
" They are both studies of humanity : Star Trek is more about putting people into abstract situations and seeing what humanity emerges , while Doctor Who tends toward deciding what humanity should be inserted into an abstract situation . "
" I 'm a fan of Star Trek for its optimism .
I like the idea that science and engineering can be applied to solve our problems .
I like Doctor Who for its sense of wonder at the universe 's complexity . "
" Star Trek represents a structured authority in exploration , while Doctor Who favors the " mad genius inventor , " an individual exploring on their own .
... Doctor
Who does a better job of depicting what it is to be truly alien .
Star
Trek does a good job of examining what it means to be truly human . "

Age and Discovery
In the 13 - 19 and 30 - 39 age groups , Doctor Who takes the lead — in 20 - 29 , 40 - 49 , and 50 - 59 , Star Trek wins by a large margin .
Over half of respondents in the latter three age groups are Star Trek fans , while in its arenas Doctor Who scrapes by with an average of 52 % .
Of course , 77 % of survey respondents are from the United States , which means that older fans would faced the difficult task of watching overseas television to be Whovians .
Advertisement
New fans are arriving by the moment , however , to change those numbers .
28 % of Doctor
Who fans discovered the show less than 5 years ago ; these fresh recruits no doubt owe their fandom to the revived New Who .
Star Trek 's fan base , according to these survey respondents , has grown only 2 % in the last 5 years , so it looks like Enterprise did n't help much .
Either way , do n't let these results depress you .
I doubt the devoted fanbase — the 64 % of 15 - plus - year Doctor Who fans and 81 % of those near - lifetime Star Trek fans — is going anywhere anytime soon .
" I was drawn to the Doctor because he always resolved conflicts using is head and relied little on brute force and violence .
I love the cerebral nature of it ! "
" What draws me to Star Trek is Roddenberry 's vision of a universe where the definition of what it means to be human is constantly changing so that it 's more inclusive .
... I have major problems with the Doctor as a character , because he 's fundamentally undemocratic — this guy just goes around killing aliens on my behalf , but I have no say in it . "
" Star Trek ... imagines a scientific , scholarly existence in a future where ( generally ) people are nice to each other ; it scratches ( sorta ) my hard sci - fi itch .
[ Doctor Who is ] lots of fun following the adventures of a charismatic , brilliant eccentric in a crazy world ; it scratches my Douglas Adams - ish fantastic sci- fi itch . "
" Trek tells the story of events that happen to people , but not so much what happens between people . "

Watching the Shows
The Star Trek fanbase sure is a law - abiding bunch :
Of the 992 people who are fans of Star Trek ( 217 of them also fans of Doctor Who ) , 81 % watch the show when it airs and only 8 % snag it from the web .
Meanwhile , 48 % of the 873 who watch Doctor Who ( including , again , the 217 who also love Star Trek ) download their episodes from the internet — compare that to the 46 % who watch it on television .
Of course , this may have something to do with the fact that Doctor Who 's overwhelming US fanbase does n't feel like waiting for BBC America to show episodes nearly a year old .
Regardless , there 's got to be something here about the average Star Trek fan 's respect for the directives of the government — and the Doctor Who fan 's love of defiant adventure .
Advertisement
Star Trek , however , does have more appeal across the globe , suggesting either greater exposure for American television or greater appeal to people in varied societies .
Star Trek 's fans hail from 33 countries , while Doctor Who 's live in 22 .
There are fans of both shows in 12 apparently sci-fi-friendly countries : the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , Austrlia , New Zealand , China , Brazil , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain , and Trinidad & Tobago .
By the way , judging from plentiful reader comments , Star Trek takes the cake for special effects , while Doctor Who garnered the most praise for its acting .
Food for thought — and evidence , perhaps , that David Tennant 's Doctor ought to face down Patrick Stewart 's Captain in a special crossover episode of doom .
( Or perhaps they should just have a torrid affair : More than one reader expressed disappointment in Star Trek 's record on homosexuality . )
" I was attracted to the misanthropic anti-establishment character of the Doctor , and the unique odds of his adventures — a single person pitting wits against brawn , whereas Trek was always about the establishment , not the underdog . "
" The beauty of Star Trek is the betterment of humans through the unquenchable need to know more .
[ The Doctor ] is a renegade , cruising around , finding problems and making them right with his vast knowledge and skills . "

Final Comments
There were quite a few problems with my survey , and you all pointed them out when you took it .
A few examples : my categories for occupations and aspirations were too broad , birthplace might not be the most accurate indicator of a person 's national identity , and it 's impossible to quantify moral attitudes and opinions on the world simply by asking about career aspirations .
The list goes on .
I urge you to download my data sheet , conduct your own research , and draw your own conclusions .
As a science fiction fan , you should be well - suited to the task !
In conclusion , I have to leave you with these two stories .
Someone out there has the most awesome husband ever , and someone else should feel free to claim the most awesome parents .
" When I first met my husband and asked for his number , he said he'd give it to me if I knew who Davros was .
I explained all about the Daleks to him , he gave me his number , and , well , now we are married .
I guess I owe finding true love to Doctor Who . "
" My parents met because of Original Star Trek .
I was saturated with it since before I was born .
I grew up being dragged to conventions and fan club meetings , and learned an awful lot about life through my mom 's secret stash of fanfiction .
Although it 's not my favorite show , I have a tremendous respect for it , because it really did made me into someone confident in her ' geekiness . ' "

( It was pointed out to me bythat cross-posting my Shapely Prose entry to my LJ would be a good idea .
Which , for some reason , did n’t even occur to me .
But , hey , that ’s a damn good idea !
Originally posted here on September 18 , 2007 . ) I believe weight loss surgery ( wls ) is dangerous , invasive , and overly performed .
I hate that something created as a last resort has turned into magical cure - all for everyone over 200 pounds .
I hate that it ’s become so popular and hyped that people whose information is based solely on what they see on TV have no hesitation in suggesting it to complete strangers .
But what if you do n’t quality ?
Gain weight !
Go to Mexico !
Find a less strict surgeon !
WLS is the quick and easy answer !
Because altering your eating and drinking habits forcould n’t possibly be something worth a second thought .
I always have been and always will be highly , highly critical of weight loss surgery .
And I ’m having mine next month .
It ’s the hardest decision I ’ve ever made because doing something that ’s so completely at odds with what you believe in is a massive mind - fuck .
I ’ve been called a traitor and a sell - out and I guess I ca n’t really argue with that ; I believe strongly in size - acceptance and I ’m electing to have my stomach sliced open and my organs rearranged .
It ’s something I never thought I ’d do .
Me ?
Having weight loss surgery ?
That ’s crazy talk …
I do n’t even believe in dieting , for god ’s sake !
Sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where what we need is n’t what we want .
Where what we need is n’t even something we necessarily believe in .
I never wanted to be seen as yet another fat person who really wanted to be thin .
Who says fat is great … but not for me .
And I know that ’s how people see me now .
I struggled with that for a long time ; reconciling my ideology with my desperate need for a surgery that was my best option .
I did n’t have it sooner because I did n’t want to admit I needed it .
I was so ashamed of not being healthy , of not being strong , of representing all the stereotypes I despise .
I ’ve been blogging for about five years now and I ’ve always been commended for my honesty .
On one hand it ’s accurate because I do n’t lie in my blog and I readily admit things that really do n’t cast me in the greatest light !
But on the other hand …
There ’s a lot I just do n’t say because I ’m too ashamed .
And I am so fuckingof being ashamed .
I ’m so fucking tired of hiding my reality because it is n’t as pretty as someone else ’s .
I ’m so tired of believing I ’m an embarrassment to fat people , as if my very existence is harming the movement .
I may be an anomaly but I still exist and I still matter .
So I ’m going to do the hardest thing I ’ve ever done .
I ’m going to tell you what it ’s like to live in my body .
I ’m 5 ’ 6 ” and I weigh 530 pounds .
Well , 529.8 to be exact but I round up .
( I have insulin resistance , hypertension , high cholesterol , gastroesophageal reflux disease , depression and social anxiety and am on medication for all of it .
I take a lot of pills !
I ’ve had to sleep sitting up for the last several months .
I do sleep but not long and not deeply … I miss dreaming .
My circulation is horrible and my arms and legs frequently go numb or swell so badly I can’t move and I feel as if the skin is literally going to split open .
My poor circulation also causes severe discoloration all over the lower half of my body as well as both forearms .
I have some issues with incontinence because I carry all of my weight in my belly and there ’s a lot of pressure on my bladder .
My lower belly is so large and heavy that having it hang from my body is actually painful .
I have a lot of problems with infections between my skin folds and summer really is n’t helping matters .
( I ’m in pain every moment of every day .
I ca n’t walk or stand longer than a few seconds and I ’m so afraid of my ankles or knees giving out from under me .
Walking from my bedroom to the bathroom leaves me gasping for breath and my legs shaking from exertion .
Usually I have to stop half way there and lean on something for a few seconds .
Several months ago I had to get a disability placard for my car .
God , I was so embarrassed by that .
Not was .
Am .
I ca n’t stand people seeing me park in the disabled spot .
Sometimes … cough … sometimes if people are watching me , I totally fake a limp .
Because I hate the idea of people thinking fat = disabled .
At the end of June I had to take a leave of absence from my job because getting out of bed and going to work every day was too painful and difficult .
I had pushed myself for so many months , through the pain and exhaustion , and I just could n’t do it anymore .
I was on the verge of physically and mentally collapsing and I could n’t bring myself to fake it for one more day .
Plus , my seat belt does n’t fit me any longer and driving on the freeways in LA with no seat belt is a terrifying experience !
Even more so when you take into account the fact that I was dozing off at the wheel ( due my sleep issues ) several times a week .
Work was going to kill me one way or another !
There are friends I have n’t seen in years .
Good friends who I used to see regularly and who I ’ve known for more than half my life .
Who used to know everything about me until my reality became a secret .
Now I lie to them about why we do n’t spend time together .
Because I do n’t want to say , “ I love you but it hurts me too much to walk .
I love you and I miss you and it hurts not to see you but the physical pain is so much worse . ”
So I say something vague about not feeling well which is n’t really a lie but is n’t really true either .
Because I ca n’t bring myself to tell them that every step feels like a thousand and my body is breaking .
I ’ve always been the strong one and I do n’t know how to admit I ’m weak .
( I do n’t remember when it started .
Because I did n’t talk about it and I sure as hell did n’t write about it .
Probably a year ago , I ’d guess . ()
I was no longer able to clean myself after going to the bathroom .
Every time I went to the bathroom , I had to take a shower .
While I was at work I would try to hold it .
I frequently made myself sick and gave myself painful stomach cramps doing so .
I had IBS to begin with and that did n’t help matters .
Worse , it did n’t always work .
So I ’d go to the bathroom and have to spend the rest of the day sitting in my own shit .
Sometimes for one hour , sometimes eight .
The physical discomfort was awful but nothing in comparison to the shame .
Fuck .
The .
Wondering if you smell , wondering if people know , wondering if they talk about it when you ’re not in the room .
Hoping that no one says anything so you stay as far away from everyone as possible .
I felt so disgusting and so embarrassed that I just wanted to die .
And I truly felt I would rather die than admit it to anyone .
( I ca n’t stand for more than a few seconds which made the frequent showering very difficult and painful .
So , now my mom cleans me .
I ’m 28 years old and my mom has to wipe my ass .
It ’s been a few months and I still apologize every time .
Every single time even though she keeps telling me to stop .
Because I ’m just so embarrassed that I can’t take care of myself .
Oh yeah … the whole showering thing .
I ca n’t do that anymore either .
I have n’t had a shower in months .
Because I ca n’t stand and because it ’s difficult for me to even fit inside the shower these days .
My mom brings a bucket of warm water , baby soap , a wash cloth , and towel into my room and washes me .
Sometimes I close my eyes and genuinely enjoy the feeling of becoming clean .
But a lot of times I cry .
I lay on my bed while my mom washes me and I cry .
I do that a lot .
Cry. Sometimes I cry because I miss having a life and I want to do so many things but physically can’t .
Sometimes I cry because I do n’t know how much longer I can handle any of it .
Sometimes it ’s out of shame .
Sometimes it ’s from the pain .
Sometimes it ’s because I can feel my body shutting down and I ’m truly afraid I ’m going to die very soon .
Sometimes it ’s because I wish I were already dead .
And sometimes I cry out of sorrow .
I place my hands on my belly and I whisper to my body how sorry I am .
Sorry that she ’s going to have to be cut up ; sorry that I could n’t fix things on my own ; sorry that I let things go so far before I asked for help ; sorry that she ’s hurting so much ; sorry that I feel imprisoned by her ; sorry that I do n’t always love her or treat her the way I should .
I cry and I apologize for everything that ’s been done to her and for all the things to come .
I cry and I thank her for being so strong and putting up with so much ; asking her to hold on for just a little while longer and promising her that things will get better .
I cry and I ask her to forgive me for what I have to do to her because it ’s the only option I have left .
Because I know it ’s the best decision for me , no matter how hard it was to make .
Do I wish I did n’t have to have weight loss surgery ?
Yes , of course .
I wish I was strong and healthy and could honestly say that my weight is n’t negatively impacting my life .
But I can ’t , not now .
I wish I did n’t have to acknowledge the things I ’m most shamed by and I could hide it all , pretending to be functional in order to save that single shred of humility I have left .
But should I allow that wish to stop me from having wls when the alternative is becoming completely bed - ridden ?
Should I not have surgery simply because I do n’t want people to think less of me or to incorrectly assume the motivations behind it ?
Is it worth it ?
A few days ago I had to go to the hospital to see a nutritionist .
I needed them to bring a wheelchair to the parking structure because I barely made it from my car to the elevator before my legs nearly gave out and I could n’t breathe .
I almost did n’t do it .
I almost turned around and left because I was too embarrassed to say that I needed a wheelchair .
It was crossing a line I did n’t ever want to cross .
But I did it .
Because practicality finally won out over pride .
And , ultimately , that ’s what all of this has been about .
I absolutely believe there are people who weigh 530 pounds and are happy and healthy .
I ’d never be so myopic as to claim my experience as the norm .
I also absolutely still believe that wls is dangerous , highly invasive and overly performed … if anything the last 16 months have made me evencritical of the entire industry .
I ’ll never advocate wls or start proselytizing because “ it changed / saved / fixed my life and it could do the same for you ! ” I will never be that asshole .
But Ibe that asshole who claimed to be fat - positive but had weight loss surgery anyway .
And I think I ’m learning to be okay with that .-------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the folks coming across this now ... Well , whether you ’re here to tell me how disgusting and repulsive I am or to tell me that I should have eaten less ( never would have thought of that one ! ) or just out of curiosity , you might as well have all the information .
I ’m sure 98 % of you are just looking for more things to mock and laugh at but , hey , at least I ’m entertaining you !
My surgery was on October 22 , 2007 .
You can read about it here .
So those of you telling me to die on the operating table ... too late !
Sorry to disappoint you !
As of April 22nd , I ’ve lost 152 pounds .
I no longer have GERD ( acid reflux ) or sleep apnea .
My blood sugar and cholesterol have normalized .
All of my vitamin levels are good .
Walking and moving are becoming easier and easier .
I average around 1,200 calories a day .
Sometimes higher , sometimes lower .
At this point I ’m pretty much capable of eating anything .
But that ’s only a recent thing .
Up until this past month or so I was n’t able to eat meat unless it was shredded and in sauce or mayonnaise .
Oh and some vegetables are still difficult / impossible for me to digest .
In terms of quantity , I can eat a couple of ounces of food at a time .
I had a serious sugar addiction beforehand and that ’s gone .
I ’m not lying , I do eat candy but too much gives me headaches now so , meh , not as interested as I once was .
Now that my palate is n’t deadened , fruit pretty much meets my sugar needs .
Also , I have almost no interest in cupcakes now !
They ’re pretty to look at and wear but eating them ?
Not really interested .
Which is kind of weird .
People want to know what I eat .
Or have decided that I ’m clearly unhealthy and destined for failure because I eat cheese and have popcorn with a tablespoon of butter and a little powdered nacho cheese flavoring every night .
I eat cheese .
I eat popcorn .
I also eat watermelon , peas , hardboiled eggs , cottage cheese , yogurt , Kashi cereal , skim milk , couscous , tomatoes , pickles , apples , rice cakes , and a million other things .
I do occasionally eat fast food .
Maybe a couple of times a month .
Here ’s an example .
I was craving a cheeseburger .
So I went to Wendy ’s and got the 99cent cheeseburger .
It was four meals / snacks .
I also got a small Frosty .
That ’s been in the freezer for more than a week and is still almost full .
A foot - long Subway sandwich is four meals and sometimes I can’t finish all the bread .
I ’m supposed to eat fuller fat products becauseand they contain less weird chemicals .
So my eating butter or mayo or sour cream is n’t the end of the world .
I aim for three liters of water a day and would exercise more if not for my chronic back pain .
Though my joint pain is lessening as the weight comes off .
Now that I can move more easily , I ’m realizing how good exercising actually feels .
And to clarify a few things .
1 . When I say I do n’t believe in “ dieting ” I mean I do n’t believe in Weight Watchers , Jenny Craig , Nutrisystem , etc .
Because most people gain the weight back once they stop “ dieting . ”
God knows I did !
Just because I do n’t believe in the diet industry does n’t mean I do n’t believe in eating healthy and exercising .
Just because I do n’t believe in the diet industrydoes n’t mean I have n’t tried every single diet in existence before making the decision to have surgery .
2 .
When I said that it ’s possible for someone to weigh 530 pounds and be happy and healthy ?
I said that because it ’s not my place to judge the health or happiness of others .
I ’m not going to make a blanket statement saying “ X>certain weight , therefore X = unhealthy and miserable . ”
If someone weighs 530 pounds and says they ’re happy and healthy , who the fuck am I to disagree ?
I ’m not them and I ’m not their doctor so it ’s not my place to scream about how impossible that must be .3 .
Perhaps the Fat Acceptance movement would n’t have to exist if people were n’t so quick to tell folks that they should die / kill themselves / are worthless / useless / etc. simply because they ’re fat .
You ’re pretty much proving its necessity by harassing and threatening the people who belong to it .
4 .
I do n’t care if you ’ve had weight loss surgery .
It does n’t change the way I view you .
The fact that any fat person can manage tohave this surgery the way it ’s shoved in our faces every day is a miracle .
I do n’t care what you do with your body .
Have surgery , do n’t have surgery , it ’s not my decision to make .
Some Fat Acceptance advocates hate on and wo n't associate with people who choose to have surgery .
That is n’t who I am .
I care about people more than I care about politics .
Always have , always will .
Long before I chose to have surgery I had friends who ’d done it .
What the hell do I care ?
Like suddenly a small stomach is going to make me walk away from someone ?
And I do n’t care if that makes me hypocritical in your eyes .
But if you honestly think that the way WLS is viewed and treated in this country is normal ?
You ’re the one in denial , not me .
I do n’t have a problem with WLS because I think everyone who has it is a sell - out and a traitor ( and I 've been called both . )
I have a problem with WLS because doctors are pushing it on smaller and smaller patients .
I have a problem with WLS because it ’s treated like a magic - bullet cure - all that will make you thin and happy in an hour and you ’ll be back to work and running a mile within a week .
I have a problem with WLS because people who are n’t fat enough to get it here , either intentionally gain weight or go to Mexico in order to have it done .
I have a problem with WLS becauseare getting it .
I have a problem with the doctors and the companies that gloss over the life - changing reality of the procedure because they want more patients and more insurance companies shelling out for a surgery that will significantly alter the rest of your life .
I ’m a hypocrite .
Fine .
But I can walk now .
And that ’s a good enough trade off for me .
Who needs the environment when condos can be slapped up and friends can make a handsome profit ?
The deal was struck behind closed doors between Mark E. Rey , the former timber lobbyist who oversees the U.S. Forest Service , and Plum Creek Timber Co. , a former logging company turned real estate investment trust that is building homes .
Plum Creek owns more than 8 million acres nationwide , including 1.2 million acres in the mountains of western Montana , where local officials were stunned and outraged at the deal .
“ We have 40 years of Forest Service history that has been reversed in the last three months , ” said Pat O’Herren , an official in Missoula County , which is threatening to sue the Forest Service for forgoing environmental assessments and other procedures that would have given the public a voice in the matter .
1.はじめに
プログラミング言語とはシステム化する対象物を抽象化し、コンピュータで処理可能なコードを記述するために用いる人工言語である。プログラミング言語はコンピュータの機械語と一対一の対応をもったアセンブラから始まり、コンパイラを用いて機械語に翻訳することを前提としたコンパイラ言語、インタプリタと呼ばれるプログラムがソースコードを解釈し実行するスクリプト言語と、記述できる抽象度を高める方向へと進化してきた。
プログラミング言語はその存在理由から、より抽象度の高い記述が行えること、すばやい開発を行える事が求められる。抽象度の高い記述とは、プログラムがどういう処理を行うか( HOW ) ではなく何の処理を行うか( WHAT ) を記述しやすい構文、機能を持っていることを、すばやい開発とは記述性の高さ、コードの密度の高さ、バグの発生しにくい構文、機能を持っていることをさす。
この抽象度の高い記述、すばやい開発を行う妨げになるのが記憶領域の管理である。記憶領域の動的確保を行う場合など、コンピュータの抽象化されていない部分を直接プログラマが操作する必要が生じる。記憶領域の操作は領域の不正アクセス、開放忘れによるメモリリークなどのバグと常に隣り合わせである。言語処理系の構文木など、複雑な参照が行われているデータ構造ではとくに記憶領域の開放が問題となる。
これらの問題を解決するための機構がガベージコレクションである。ガベージコレクションは記憶領域の動的確保、開放を抽象化し、プログラマが明示的に管理を行う必要を減らす。本研究では、ガベージコレクションをLISPというプログラミング言語処理系に実装することにより、実装方法などの検討を行った。
2.ガベージコレクション
ガベージコレクション（GCと略す）はプログラミング言語処理系（以下言語処理系）の一部もしくはライブラリとして提供される、動的に確保した記憶領域のうち利用されていない記憶領域を自動的に回収し、再利用または開放を行う機構である。
GCを導入することによりプログラマは手動での記憶領域の管理から開放される。
2.1.ガベージコレクションの必要性
GCは近年の言語処理系では必須の機能として提供されているが、この要因としては、
言語処理系の提供する機能の高度化
明示的な管理を行うと実現しにくいプログラミングスタイルの主流化
コンピュータの高速、大容量化により、実行効率より開発効率が求められるようになった
などが考えられる 。
2.1.1.例 : 例外
例外とはプログラム実行中におこる不都合を処理するための分岐である。不都合は対処されもとの処理に戻ればよいが、ファイルやメモリなどの資源確保の失敗など取り返しのつかない不都合に対しては処理の継続をあきらめなければならない。その場合、それまでの処理で確保した資源の開放が問題となる。
ここではGCの存在が例外を利用したプログラミングにどのような影響を与えるかを述べる。プログラムの例としてC++とJavaをあげ、例外を利用したプログラムとしてコンストラクタで例外を発生させるクラスを作成する。
2.1.1.1.C++
Figure 1 . とFigure 2.はファイルを管理するクラスを利用したプログラムである。
C++の標準ライブラリは初期設定では例外を発生させることは無いため、通常は例外を発生させないFigure 1.のようなプログラミングスタイルが主流であるが、ここではFigure 2.のように意図的に例外の発生を許可している。Figure 2.は全ての例外を捕捉してコンストラクタ外に例外が漏れないよう記述している。
C++ではコンストラクタで例外が発生して処理が中断してしまった場合にデストラクタが呼び出されないという有名なバグが存在する。また、デストラクタで例外が発生した場合、例外クラスの中で例外が発生する場合も再現が難しいバグになる。例外クラスの中で例外が発生する代表的な例としては、bad_alloc例外が発生した状況で、例外オブジェクトを作成するためにnewを使い、再度bad_allocを発生させる場合などがある。これらのバグは発見することが難しい。
このため、コンストラクタ、デストラクタの処理が例外により中断することは許されない。つまり、C++では例外安全(例外が発生しても処理が中断されないこと)なコンストラクタ、クラスを作成することが安全なプログラムを作成する必要条件である。これらのことから、C++は例外という機構を取り入れたがために例外を利用するための資源管理をプログラマに強いるようになってしまった。
これらは資源管理をプログラマが行う必要から生じる。GCが存在すればこのように資源の解放について注意を向けるコストが軽減される。
# include < iostream > # include < fstream > # include < string > class file_io { private : std::ifstream * ifs_ ; std::ofstream * ofs_ ; bool is_fail_ ; public : file_io( ) : is_fail_( false ) , ifs_( NULL ) , ofs_( NULL ) {} file_io ( std : : string input_file , std:: string output_file ) : is_fail_( false ) , ifs_( NULL ) , ofs_( NULL ) { ifs_ = new std::ifstream ( ) ; ofs_ = new std ::ofstream ( ) ; if ( ifs_ == NULL || ofs_ == NULL ) { is_fail_ = true ; return ; } ifs_->open(input_file.c_str ( ) ) ; ofs_->open(output_file.c_str ( ) ) ; if ( ifs_ - > fail ( ) || ofs_ -> fail ( ) ) { is_fail_ = true ; } } ~ file_io ( ) { delete ifs_ ; delete ofs_ ; } bool fail ( ) { return is_fail_ ; } /* and more definitions ... */ } ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { if ( argc < 3 ) { return - 1 ; } file_io fio = file_io ( argv [ 1 ] , argv [ 2 ] ) ; std::cout << fio.fail ( ) << std::endl ; }
# include < iostream > # include < fstream > # include < string > # include < new > // new 演算子の例外発生を許可する class file_io { private : std::ifstream * ifs_ ; std::ofstream * ofs_ ; bool is_fail_ ; public : file_io( ) : is_fail_( false ) , ifs_( NULL ) , ofs_( NULL ) {} file_io ( std : : string input_file , std:: string output_file ) : is_fail_( false ) , ifs_( NULL ) , ofs_( NULL ) { try { ifs_ = new std::ifstream ( ) ; ofs_ = new std::ofstream ( ) ; } catch ( std: :bad_alloc ) { is_fail_ = true ; return ; } // 例外を許可する ifs_->exceptions(std::ios_base::failbit ) ; ofs_->exceptions(std::ios_base::failbit ) ; try { ifs_->open( input_file.c_str ( ) ) ; ofs_->open(output_file.c_str ( ) ) ; } catch ( std::ios_base : : failure ) { is_fail_ = true ; } } ~ file_io ( ) { delete ifs_ ; delete ofs_ ; } bool fail ( ) { return is_fail_ ; } /* and more definitions ... */ } ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { if ( argc < 3 ) { return - 1 ; } file_io fio = file_io ( argv [ 1 ] , argv [ 2 ] ) ; std::cout << fio.fail ( ) << std::endl ; }
2.1.1.2.Java
Figure 3 . はJavaでの例である。このプログラムではFileIOクラスのオブジェクトを得るときにコンストラクタが呼ばれる。コンストラクタはファイル名を引数に取り、FileInputStreamを作成する。ファイルが存在しない場合にはjava.io.FileNotFoundExceptionが発生する。Javaではコンストラクタ内での例外の呼び出しがされてもデストラクタ不在にようメモリリークはGCが存在するため発生しない。
import java.io. * ; class FileIO { FileInputStream fis ; FileOutputStream fos ; FileIO ( String input , String output ) throws Exception { fis = new FileInputStream ( input ) ; fos = new FileOutputStream ( output ) } } class ExceptionWithGC { static public void main ( String [ ] args ) { try { FileIO fio = new FileIO ( args [ 0 ] , args [ 1 ] ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { System.out.println ( " Exception occurred " ) ; System.out.println(e ) ; } } }
2.1.2.例 : プログラミングスタイル
文字列の拡張の例を挙げる。Javaでの文字列の拡張とCでの拡張の例を示す。
2.1.2.1.C
Figure 4.は標準入力から一行文字列を読み込むプログラムである。
このプログラムは一文字読み込んだ後バッファを拡張して、一文字追加していく。改行もしくはEOFに達したら、バッファからstrdupで文字列を複製し、その複製した文字列を返している。
Cのプログラムでは文字列への文字の追加と記憶領域の管理が分離できずに、本来の意味が薄れてしまっている。
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h> /* read line */ char * freadline ( FILE * in ) { char * buffer , * tmp ; int c ; buffer = malloc ( 1 ) ; if ( buffer == NULL ) goto END ; buffer [ 0 ] = “ \0 ” ; while ( ( c = fgetchar ( in ) ) != EOF ) { tmp = realloc ( buffer , strlen ( buffer ) + 2 ) ; if ( tmp == NULL ) break ; buffer = tmp ; tmp = tmp + strlen ( buffer ) ; * tmp ++ = c ; *t mp = “ \0 ” ; if ( c == “
” ) break ; } END : return buffer ; } int main ( void ) { char * line = readline ( stdin ) ; printf ( “ %s ” , line ) ; free ( line ) ; }
2.1.2.2.Java
Figure 5 . はFigure 4.をJavaで書き直したプログラムである。
一文字読み込むごとに可変の文字列に文字を追加していき、一行分読み込んだら可変長文字列から文字列へ変換を行って、文字列を返している。このプログラムのソースからはメモリ管理を行っている部分は隠蔽され、非常にわかりやすいソースコードとなっている。
class ReadLine { static public String readline ( InputStream is ) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder ( ) ; int ch = 0 ; while ( ( ch = is.read ( ) ) != - 1 || ch == '
') { sb.appned ( ( char ) ch ) ; } return sb.toString ( ) ; } static public void main ( String [ ] args ) { Stirng line = ReadLine.readline( System.in ) ; System.out.println( line ) ; } }
この例ではプログラムの記述性、可読性を重点に置いている。実際のプログラム開発ではプログラムの保守、拡張段階でこの二つの要素が大いに影響してくる。保守を行うには保守するプログラムの理解が必要となる。Figure 5.のように記憶領域の管理が隠蔽されていると、本来のプログラムの意味が理解しやすくなる。
この二つの例のとおり、GCを利用することによりプログラミングの手間が大幅に省かれ、GCのない言語処理系では行いにくい、目的の処理だけに注目したプログラミングも利用できるようになる。
また、メモリ管理をGCに一任することにより、文字列操作などで生じやすいプログラマのミスによる不正領域へのアクセス、利用中の領域の開放や領域の二重開放、メモリリークを軽減できることもできる。
これにより、メモリ管理用コードが必要なくなることによるソースコードの簡潔さの向上、メモリ関連のデバッグのコストの軽減など開発効率の向上が得られる。
2.2.ガベージコレクションの速度
一般的にmalloc / freeを利用した手動でのメモリ管理と比べGCの方が処理速度が遅いと考えられがちだがこれは間違いである。メモリ開放のコストが変化するのではなく、手動でメモリ管理を行いコストを分散するか、GCを利用して集中して行うかの差である。したがって、速度のよしあしは分散、集中によるメリットを比較するだけに依存する。
これとは別に、特定の条件下ではGCとmalloc/freeとでは速度の差が顕著に現れる例がある。
GCの速度がでる場合としてはmalloc/freeの実装に失敗していている場合がある。通常GCでは巨大な記憶領域を確保してその領域のうち必要な領域をGCが切り売りして管理を行う。そのためmalloc/freeの実装に左右されず一定の性能を得られる可能性が高い。
malloc/freeが早い例としては、大量の記憶領域を利用し、さらにその記憶領域のほとんどが利用される場合である。この場合、GCが発生する度に大量の記憶領域を走査しなければならない。この場合、malloc/freeで必要ない領域だけを開放する方法が速度が得られる。
このように、条件をそろえれば差は生じるが、双方とも実装の未熟さが原因にくるため、洗練された実装では差は生じないと考えることができる。
2.3.GCのアルゴリズム
GCの基本的なアルゴリズムは大きく分けて二つに分けられる。
参照カウン ト( Reference counting )
Tracing collectors
2.3.1.参照カウント
参照カウン ト( Reference counting ) はオブジェクト（動的に確保したメモリ領域の単位）が参照されている数を元に領域の開放を行うGCである。全てのオブジェクトに対して参照カウントと呼ばれる整数値を付加する。参照カウントはプログラム全体にこのオブジェクトを指し示すポインタがいくつ存在するかを記録するもので、変数の代入などによって変化する。そして、この参照カウントが0になった場合、つまり、どこからも参照されなくなった場合にそのオブジェクトを開放するというものである。
参照カウントの利点としては以下のことがあげられる。
処理が高 速
手動の管理と同様に参照されなくなった時点で即座にオブジェクトの開放が行われる
記憶領域管理以外にも利用ができる( File、mutexなど)
逆に欠点としては 、
整数値を付加するため領域のオーバーヘッドが生じる
参照カウントのオーバーフローを考慮する必要がある
循環参照が起こった場合に回収が行われない( Figure 7 . )
などががある 。
2.3.2 . Tracing collectors
Tracing collectorsは次のような段階を含むGCで、一般的にGCと呼ばれているのはこちらのアルゴリズムである。
初期化( 例、マークをはずす ) トレース( 例、マークもしくはコピー ) 回収 確保した領域の再利 用
Tracing collectorsは名前のとおりオブジェクトに含まれるポインタをトレースして利用しているオブジェクト、していないオブジェクトを判別する。このとき、トレースのはじめとなるオブジェクトをルート( Root )と呼び、到達できたオブジェクトはプログラムが利用中のオブジェクト、到達できなかったオブジェクトはごみとみなし回収を行う。したがって、アルゴリズムの回収段階では確保した全てのオブジェクトに何らかの方法でアクセスできる必要がある。
トレースのアルゴリズムにはマークアンドスイープ( Mark and Sweep ) 、コピ ー( Copying ) という二つの方法が存在する 。
2.3.2.1.マークアンドスイープ
マークアンドスイープはトレース段階と回収段階が明確に分かれたアルゴリズムである。
アルゴリズム1のトレース段階ではルートから到達できるオブジェクトに印をつけていく。
アルゴリズム1の回収段階では、全てのオブジェクトを調べマークのついていないオブジェクトを回収する。
マークアンドスウィープGCの利点としては以下のことがあげられる。
実装が容易であ る
オブジェクトがあまり回収されない場合にコピーGCと比べて性能がよい
循環参照が起こったオブジェクトでも回収が行える
欠点としては 、
必要ない部分から回収を行うため領域の断片化が生じる
管理する記憶領域の量に応じて性能が劣化する
などがある 。
本論文ではこのマークアンドスイープの派生である保守的マークアンドスイープを利用している。保守的マークアンドスイープについては処理系の実装の項で再度取り上げる。
2.3.2.2.コピー
コピーは領域を半分にしてGCを行うアルゴリズムである。
アルゴリズム1のトレース段階ではルートから到達できるオブジェクトを新しい領域にコピーしていく。トレースが終わり、利用中の全てのオブジェクトを新しい領域にコピーできたら、古い領域全てを破棄する(アルゴリズム1の回収段階 ) 。
オブジェクトを移動させるため、ポインタの付け替えを行うか、プログラム内ではポインタとは別のIDを用いる必要がある。
コピーGCの利点としては以下のことがあげられる。
回収段階がほとんどないためマークアンドスイープGCと比べ高速
隙間を詰めてコピーを行うため領域の断片化が発生しない
循環参照が起こったオブジェクトでも回収が行える
欠点としては 、
コピーを行ったオブジェクトのポインタの付け替えが必要( Figure 11 . )
ポインタ以外 のIDを用いての管理が必要
ごみとなる領域が極端に少ない場合性能が劣化する
などがある 。
2.4.正確 vs 保守的
利用しているオブジェクトをたどる方法とは別に、利用しているオブジェクトの判定法について正確なGC(precise GC ) と保守的GC( conservative GC ) という区別がある。
正確なGCは、利用中のオブジェクトを正確に求め、利用していないオブジェクトを全て回収するGCである。通常GCといえば正確なGCを示す。
保守的GCは利用中らしき曖昧なオブジェクトは保持して回収を行わないGCである。具体的にはオブジェクトのルートに管理するオブジェクトの領域(ヒープなど)をさすポインタがに含まれた場合には、そのポインタがさすオブジェクトの回収は行わないなどの方針を採る。結果として本来ゴミであるオブジェクトを保持してしまうが、このオブジェクトは無効なポインタをさすことはないので若干のメモリリークが生じるが、単純な割りに安全である。通常ルートはレジスタ、スタック、大域領域、ヒープ領域などがあるが、これら全てが曖昧として保守的GCを行う場合を特に全保守(fully conservative ) 、一部を曖昧として行う場合を半保守( partially conservative ) という 。
保守的と正確という考え方は記憶領域をマークする方針であるため、具体的なアルゴリズムは規定しない。
保守的GCはマークアンドスイープGCと組み合わせて利用されることが多い。また、本来GCをサポートしないCなどの言語での実装が容易であるため、Rubyなどの言語処理系ではこの保守的マークアンドスイープGCが利用されている。
3.Lisp
本研究ではさまざまなGCの効率を調べるためにプログラミング言語を作り、GCを実装する。そしてベンチマークテストによって比較を行う。そこで、GCの性能が反映されやすく実装がやさしい構造をもつLISP言語を選んだ。
LISP ( LISt Processingの略)
は1958年にジョン・マッカーシーによって発明されたプログラミング言語である。ラムダ演算の計算モデルを紙の上で表現するための記法をFORTRANの上に移植することにより初のLISPインタプリタが誕生した。
現在LISP はCommon LispとSchemeという二つの方言が主流であるが、ここではLISP全てに当てはまる話題を取り上げる。
3.1.特徴とプログラムの例
3.1.1.Atom
LISP で扱うデータの中で、値そのものを示すデータをAtomと呼ぶ。Atomには名前をあらわすシンボル( Symbol)、真偽値、数値を表す数字そのもの、文字列、関数をあらわすプロシージャ( Procedure ) などが含まれる。
AtomはLISPプログラムに直接リテラルとして記述できるもの(数値、文字列等)や、LISPの式を実行した結果として得られるもの（シンボル、プロシージャ）、その他LISP処理系の拡張で用意されたデータ構造などが含まれる。
リテラルもしくは式 実行した結果 Atomの種類 10 10 数値 " the string " " the string " 文字列 ' symbol symbol シンボル ( quote symbol ) symbol シンボル ( lambda ( x ) x ) procedure ( 何らかの内部表現 ) プロシージ ャ
3.1.2.Cons Cell
LISP にはもうひと つCons Cell( もしく はPair ) と呼ぶデータが存在する 。Cons Cellは二つのデータをまとめるデータである。Cons Cellの先頭をCar（カー）、最後をCdr(クダー)と呼ぶ。Car、CdrはAtom、 Cons Cellどちらのデータも示すことができる。
AとBのCons（もしく はPair）と言った場合、CarがAを、CdrがBを示すCons Cellのことを言う 。Cons Cellを作成することをconsすると言う。
3.1.3.S式
LISP はプログラムの記述法にS式( Symbol - Expression ) と呼ばれる記述方式を採用している。S式は次のように定義される。
S式 ::= Atom S式 ::= S式とS式のCons
S式はAtomを含むがconsされているものはAtomではない。S式を記述する場合、リテラル表記できるAtomはそのまま記述し、Cons Cellはドット対( A . B ) のように表記する 。AがCar、BがCdrにあたる。
LISP で はCons Cellをドット対で表現したS式よりも次のように連続する " . ( " と対応する " ) " を省略したリスト表記を主に利用する。リスト表記されたS式のうち、(< S式> ... < S式 n>)という形になっているものをリストと呼び、リストの最後がドット対になっているものをドットリストと呼ぶ。
S式 リスト表記 種類 ( a . b ) ( a . b ) ドットリスト ( a . ( b . c ) ) ( a b .c ) ドットリスト ( a . ( b . ( ) ) ) ( a b ) リスト ( ( a . b ) . ( c . ( d . e ) ) ) ( ( a . b ) c d .
e ) ドットリスト ( ( a . b ) . ( c . ( d . ( ) ) ) ) ( ( a . b ) c d ) リスト ( ( a . ( b . ( ) ) ) . ( c . ( d . ( ) ) ) ) ( ( a b ) c d ) リス ト
特別な例としては、何もないリストをnil（Common Lispでの表現。ニル）や( ) （Schemeでの表現。空リスト）などで表す。nilや( )
はAtomでもある。
3.1.4.プログラム
LISP ではS式（リスト やAtom）を式として評価( Eval ) していく。評価とは式から値を求めることを言う。LISPでは式の種類に応じて次のように評価を行う。
式の種類 評価の方法 リスト ( < 関数 > < 引数> ... <引数>)のような関数呼び出しとみなして評価する。 シンボル シンボルに対応付けられた値を取り出す。 シンボル以外のAtom Atom自身を返す。
関数には引数を全ては評価しない特殊形式( special form , macro ) と引数を全て評価するプロシージャの二種類が存在する。関数に引数を渡して値を求めることを引数を関数に適応( apply)する、もしくは単に適応すると言う。
3.1.4.1.特殊形式
代表的な特殊形式にはquote、set!、cond、lambdaなどが存在する。構文(syntax )とも呼ばれる。
3.1.4.1.1.quote
quote引数を評価せずにそのまま返す特殊形式である。引数を一つとる。リストをデータ構造として扱いたい場合、シンボル自体を取り出したい場合などに利用する。'(
クオート)を利用した省略記法をサポートするLISP処理系も多い。
( quote 10 ) ; =>10 ( quote a ) ; => a ( quote ( this is the list ) ) :=> ( this is the list ) ' symbol ; => symbol '( another list ) ; => ( another list )
3.1.4.1.2.set !
set!はシンボルに値を対応付ける特殊形式である。二引数をとる。第一引数はシンボルをとり、第二引数の評価した値を第一引数のシンボルに対応付ける。なおLISPでは値をシンボルに対応付けることを束縛するという。
( set ! a 10 ) a ; => 10 ( set ! b '( the list ) ) b ; => ( the list )
3.1.4.1.3.cond
condは分岐を表す特殊形式である。複数の引数をとり、引数の構造は次のようになっている必要がある。
( cond < condition clause1 > < condition clause > ... ) < condition clause n> := ( < condition > < expression > ...)
condでは < condition clause >を順番に評価していく。<condition clause >のうち、<condition>を評価して真を示す値であれば続く<expression>を順番に評価し、<condition>が偽を示す値であれば続く<expression>を評価せずに次の<condition clause >を評価する。
最後の<condition clause >の< test>はelseなどの特別なシンボルが使われる場合も許されており、その場合は無条件で続く<expression>が評価される。
( set ! a 10 ) ( cond ( ( <= 1 a ) 1 ) ( (= 0 a ) 0 ) ( else - 1 ) ) ; => 1 ( set ! b - 1 ) ( cond ( ( <= 1 b ) 1 ) ( (= 0 b ) 0 ) ( else - 1 ) ) ; => -1
3.1.4.1.4.lambda
lambdaはプロシージャを作る特殊形式である。第一引数にはプロシージャの引数のリストを、第二引数以降にはプロシージャの中身を記述する。プロシージャを呼び出した場合は、中身のうち一番最後に評価した式の値を返す。lambda式とも言う。
( lambda ( x ) x ) ; => procedure ( set ! identity ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ( identity 10 ) ; => 10 ( ( lambda ( x y ) (+ x y ) ) 10 20 ) ; => 30 ( ( lambda ( x y ) x (+ x y ) y ) 10 20 ) ; => 20
3.1.4.1.5.プロシージャ
プロシージャは特殊形式とは異なり引数の評価を行ってから関数の値を求める関数のことである。プロシージャには大きく分けてCons Cellを作成するcons、四則演算の+や*、比較関数<といった言語処理系に組み込まれている組み込みプロシージャと、プログラマがlambda式で作成した自作プロシージャの二つの種類が存在する。
プロシージャでは全ての引数を評価してから関数の評価を行うため、特殊形式と異なり構文ではない。LISPには特殊形式とプロシージャの二種類の関数しか存在しないともいえる。
( set ! a 10 ) ( cons 'a ' b ) ; => ( a . b ) ( cons a ( cons 'b nil ) ) ; => ( 10 b ) (* a 4 ) ; => 40 (< a 2 ) ; => 偽を表す 値( nil、#fなど ) (+ a (* 3 4 ) ) ; => 22 ( set ! add - 1 ( ( lambda ( x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) ) 1 ) ) ( add - 1 10 ) ; => 11
3.1.5.環境
LISPではC言語などで言うスコープを環境と呼び、また一番外側の環境をトップレベル( Top-Level)と呼ぶ。LISPではlambdaで作成するプロシージャのみが新しい環境を作成する。
プロシージャは作成されたときの環境を持ち、プロシージャが持つ仮引数と、実引数を束縛する時、つまり評価する時に作成されたときの環境を拡張する形で新しい環境を作成する。
現在のLISPではスタティックスコープが採用されているが、スタティックスコープは定義された時の環境をプロシージャが保存することにより実現している。Figure 23のxやyなど、トップレベル以外に定義されているlambdaの仮引数となっている変数をレキシカル変数と呼ぶ。
レキシカル変数x は( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) が作成するプロシージャが破棄されるまでプロシージャの中で半永久的に利用できるが、このようにレキシカル変数を利用しているプロシージャを特にクロージャと呼ぶ。
3.2.LISPとGC
GCはLISPと同時に誕生した機構である。LISPではプログラムを読み込み、リストを作成し、そのリストを評価してプログラムを実行する。評価した後のリストや、評価で利用した一時領域はごみとなるが、LISPではプログラマが明示的にメモリを確保、開放する方法は用意されていないためこれらのごみはいずれは計算機の資源を食いつくしてしまう。しかし、このリストを構成するCons CellやAtomはごみとなっても再利用が可能であるので再利用を行う。
LISP 以外のインタプリタの言語処理系も同様にプログラムを読み込み、実行する際に言語特有のデータ構造(文字列、ファイルポインタ、構文木など)を作成する。ここで構文木とは与えられたプログラムを解釈するためにインタプリタが一時領域に作るデータ構造である。名前を変数、配列、関数、型と区別したり、かっこが無くても演算子の優先順位を理解して数式の解釈したりする。
構文木はLISPはすでに示したようにかっこの木構造のみで構文が規定されるため、多言語と違い構文解釈はかっこ表示を内部リスト構造に変換するだけである、つまり構文木はリストに、構文木を構成するデータ構造がCons Cell、要素がAtomに相当する。LISPと同様にインタプリタの言語処理系を利用する場合には構文木を管理する必要がある。この管理にしばしばGCが利用される。
リスト、構文木はプログラマが直接管理を行うことも可能な場合がある。しかし、その場合は言語処理系の内部に手を加えることになり言語処理系をして抽象度を向上させる目的と反してしまう。
このように、抽象度の高いインタプリタの言語処理系を利用して抽象度の高いプログラムを作成する場合にはGCは必須の機能となっている。
4.GC付属LISP処理系
本論文ではGC付属のLISP処理系の作成する。LISP処理系の仕様はSchemeのサブセットとする。処理系の構造には古典的なS式のインタプリタ（解釈系）、GCのアルゴリズムには保守的Mark and Sweepを採用する。
4.1.LISP処理系の構造
古典的なS式のインタプリタとしてのLISP処理系を作成する場合に肝となる機能はread-eval-print-loop(replと略す)とGCである。このreplはその名のとおり、入力を読み取り、評価(evalute)し、出力することを繰り返す機構である。
readを行うreaderは文字列としてのS式を読み取り、LISP処理系の内部表現としてのS式(リスト)を組み立てる。evalはreaderが作り出したリストを解釈しプログラムを実行する。printは実行結果を目に見える形で出力する。
4.2.作成言語
本研究ではGCを実装することもあり、あらかじめGCが搭載されたプログラミング言語ではなくC言語によって作成を行った。C++言語を採用しなかった理由は、保守的GCとインスタンスのファイナライザの協調を行うことにより、本質でない部分に注意をそそがれてしまうのを防ぐためである。
4.3.作成
本研究で作成し たLISP 処理系( 以下処理系 ) の解説を行う 。
4.3.1.データ構造
作成した処理系全体で利用するデータ構造はscheme.hで定義している。古典的なLISP処理系ではCellと呼ばれる複数のデータ構造をunionでまとめたメンバとそのunionを識別するメンバを持つデータ構造を利用するのが主流である。
Cellがもつunionでまとめたメンバのデータ構造にはS式の項で述べたcons(Cellのポインタを二つ持つデータ構造)とatomを含む。今回作成する処理系のatomはsymbol、integer、 primitive、closure、macroである。
CellにLISP処理系で利用するデータ構造を詰め込む理由には、Cellというひとつのデータ構造で処理系で利用するS式を全て表現できることの他に、データのサイズを一定にし、GCでのメモリ領域の断片化を防ぐ意味も含まれてる。
作成した処理系で はCellはSCMという名前にtypedefしている
typedef struct _ Cell * SCM ; /* scheme cell object interface */ struct _ Cell { struct _ Header { enum SchemeCellType type ; short gc_flag ; } header ; /* cell header */ union { struct _ Cons { SCM car ; SCM cdr ; } cons ; struct _ Integer { int value ; } integer ; struct _ Symbol { char * name ; int length ; SCM value ; } symbol ; struct _ Primitive { enum PrimitiveType type ; char * name ; SCM ( * proc ) ( ) ; } primitive ; struct _ Closure { SCM args ; SCM body ; SCM env ; } closure ; struct _ Macro { SCM closure ; } macro ; /* more ... */ } object ; /* cell object */ } ;
なおCellのための記憶領域の確保にはGCが深くかかわってる来る。現段階では特別な管理せずにmallocのみで済ませる。Cellの確保についてはGCの項(4.4.1)で詳しく述べる。
4.3.2.シンボルテーブル
シンボルというデータ構造はscheme.hで、シンボル、シンボルテーブルとその操作を行う関数はsymbol.cにて定義している。
シンボルとはLISPのatomで名前をつかさどるデータ構造である。同じ名前を持つシンボルは常に同じオブジェクトを利用すること、つまり同じシンボルは同じアドレスを持つことがLISP処理系では求められる。これを実現するためにシンボルテーブルを利用する。本処理系ではシンボルテーブルはチェインハッシュで実現している。シンボルは名前(文字列)から求める。はじめに名前のハッシュ値を求め、チェインハッシュの位置を決定する。次にS式と同様にCons Cellを利用している線形リストをたどり、文字列と同様の名前を持つシンボルを求める。名前に対応するシンボルが存在しない場合は新たにシンボルを作成してシンボルテーブルに追加を行う。
名前からシンボルを求めることをinternと呼ぶ。
4.3.3.reader
readerはread.cに定義している。S式を読み取りCellを利用してリストを作成する。
読み込め るS式の字句解析についてはR5RS[1]を参考に作成した。再帰降下型のパーサとなっている。
このreaderが生成するリストは通常primitive、closure、macroなどのを含まないCellだけでできたものを返す。primitive、closure、macroなどは4.3.5で説明するevalにて、symbolに束縛された値を取り出したり、関数を実行することにより作成するのが常である。
4.3.4.print
printはprint.cに定義している。
print はS式を表示するための機構である。printの本体は巨大なif-else文である。引数として与えられたS式の要素にあわせて印字を行う。要素がAtomの場合はprintがそのAtomに対応する印字を行う。 要素 がCons Cellリストの表示の場合はpirntはprint_listに役割を譲渡する( Figure 27 . ( 1 ) ) 。
print_list はCons Cellをたどりそれぞれの要素を引数にprintをよびだし、リストの表示を行う( Figure 28 . ( 1 ) ) 。
SCM print ( SCM sexp , FILE * file ) { if ( SCM_CONSTANT_P ( sexp ) ) { switch ( AS_UINT ( sexp ) ) { case AS_UINT ( SCM_NULL ) : fprintf ( file , " ( ) " ) ; break ; case AS_UINT ( SCM_FALSE ) : fprintf ( file , " # f " ) ; break ; case AS_UINT ( SCM_TRUE ) : fprintf ( file , " #t " ) ; break ; case AS_UINT ( SCM_EOF ) : fprintf ( file , " #eof " ) ; break ; case AS_UINT ( SCM_UNDEFINED ) : fprintf ( file , " #undefined " ) ; break ; default : scheme_error ( " bad constant " ) ; break ; } return SCM_UNDEFINED ; } if ( SYMBOL_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " %s " , SYMBOL_NAME ( sexp ) ) ; } else if ( INTEGER_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " %d " , INTEGER_VALUE ( sexp ) ) ; } else if ( STRING_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " \ " %s\ " " , STRING_VALUE ( sexp ) ) ; } else if ( CONS_P ( sexp ) ) { print_list ( sexp , file ) ; /* ( 1 ) */ } else if ( PRIMITIVE_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " #< primitive %s > " , PRIMITIVE_NAME ( sexp ) ) ; } else if ( CLOSURE_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " #< closure > " ) ; print( CLOSURE_ARGS ( sexp ) , file ) ; print( CLOSURE_BODY ( sexp ) , file ) ; } else if ( MACRO_P ( sexp ) ) { fprintf ( file , " # < macro > " ) ; print( MACRO_CLOSURE ( sexp ) , file ) ; } else { printf ( " print unsupported : %p " , sexp ) ; } return SCM_UNDEFINED ; }
static SCM print_list ( SCM sexp , FILE * file ) { SCM lst = sexp ; putc ( '(' , file ) ; for ( ; ;) { print ( CAR ( lst ) , file ) ; lst = CDR ( lst ) ; if ( NULL_P ( lst ) ) break ; else if ( CONS_P ( lst ) ) putc ( ' ' , file ) ; else { fprintf ( file , " . " ) ; print ( lst , file ) ; break ; } /* ( 1 ) */ } putc (' ) ' , file ) ; return SCM_NULL ; }
4.3.5.環境
環境についての実装はenv.cに定義している。evalでプログラムを評価する際に変数の値を取り出す先が環境である。そのため環境はスコープと等価であるともいえる。
一番外側の環境はトップレベルと呼ば れLISP 処理系の中でグローバルなものである。トップレベルではシンボルと値が一対一の関係となるため、シンボルそのものと値を関連付けることによりトップレベル環境を実現する。トップレベル以外の環境については、Figure 30.のようにシンボルと値のリストのペアをリストとして持つことにより実現する。新しい環境はlambda式でプロシージャを作成するときに作成される。
environment = ( ( var1 var2 var3 ... ) ( val1 val2 val3 ... ) ) environments = ( environmentN environmentN - 1 ... )
環境の例 をFigure 31.に、そのときの環境のリスト表記をFigure 32.に、AtomとCons Cellを用いたデータ構造 をFigure 33.に示す 。( lambda ( x ) ... ) が作り出す環境を環境１ 、( lambda ( y ) ... )
が作り出す環境を環境2とする。この例では環境1にてxが20に対応付けられ、環境2にてyが10に対応付けされる。この環境下で(+ x y) の評価を行うと式は(+
20 10 ) となり、30が得られる。
( ( (y ) . ( 10 ) ) // 環 境2 ( ( x ) . ( 20 ) ) // 環境1 )
4.3.6.Static scope
スタティックスコー プ( Static scope ) とは4.3.5で示した環境を使って変数の値を取り出す方法である。３．１．５でも示したとおり、スタティックスコープでは複数の環境で同様の変数が使われていた場合は、式に一番近い環境の値を利用する。また、スタティックスコープはlambda式の様に定義したときの環境を保存するので、プロシージャの中身では、定義したときの環境の変数が利用できる。SchemeがLISP処理系としてはじめてスタティックスコープを採用して以来、現在ではスタティックスコープが主流である。
これとは異なり、初期のLISPはダイナミックスコープを採用していた。lambda式でプロシージャはただのコードの断片として扱い、定義した時の環境を保存せず、適応した時の環境の変数を利用していた。
本処理系ではスタティックスコープを実現するために、lambda式が作り出すプロシージャが環境を保存する。プロシージャが環境を保存することにより、処理系全体の動作をスタティックスコープにすることができる。
4.3.7.評価
evalとapplyはeval.cに定義している。処理系の心臓部分である。readerが作成したリストを解釈、評価（evaluation）、関数の適応（apply）を行う。3.1.4のFigure 17.を再度示す。
式の種類 評価の方法 リスト ( < 関数 > < 引数> ... <引数>)のような関数呼び出しとみなして評価する。 シンボル シンボルに対応付けられた値を取り出す。 シンボル以外のAtom Atom自身を返す。
evalでは数値のような即値やシンボルに束縛された値を取り出したりする( Figure 35 . ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) ) 。
また、リストの先頭のatomを評価したときの値が関数として実行するが、この関数を引数に適応させるにはapplyを利用する( Figure 35 . ( 3 ) ) 。applyはその中でapply_primitive( Figure 36.)とapply_closure( Figure 37 .)を呼び出す。これらの関数の中でさらにevalが呼び出される。evalとapplyは相互再帰呼び出しを行いながらプログラムを実行する。
SCM eval ( SCM sexp , SCM env ) { SCM kar = SCM_NULL ; SCM result = NULL ; struct EvalState state = { env , EVAL_STATUS_RETURN_VALUE} ; eval_loop : set_current_sexp(sexp ) ; if ( SYMBOL_P ( sexp ) ) return symbol_value ( sexp , state.env ) ; /* ( 2 ) */ if (! CONS_P ( sexp ) ) return sexp ; /* ( 1 ) */ if ( CONS_P ( sexp ) ) { SCM subr ; state.status = EVAL_STATUS_RETURN_VALUE
; kar = CAR ( sexp ) ; if ( SYMBOL_P ( kar ) ) { subr = symbol_value ( kar , state.env ) ; } else if ( CONS_P ( kar ) ) { subr = eval ( kar , state.env ) ; } result = apply ( subr , CDR ( sexp ) , &state , SCM_TRUE ) ; /* ( 3 ) */ sexp = result ; if ( state.status == EVAL_STATUS_NEED_EVAL ) { goto eval_loop ; } } return sexp ; }
static SCM apply ( SCM subr , SCM arg , struct EvalState * state , SCM need_argument_eval ) { if ( PRIMITIVE_P ( subr ) ) { return apply_primitive ( subr , arg , state , need_argument_eval ) ; } else if ( CLOSURE_P ( subr ) ) { return apply_closure ( subr , arg , state , need_argument_eval ) ; }/* ... */ else { scheme_error ( " subroutine type error " ) ; return NULL ; } }
static SCM apply_closure ( SCM
closure , SCM arg , struct EvalState * state , SCM need_argument_eval ) { SCM closure_env = NULL ; SCM result = SCM_NULL ; SCM evaled_arg = SCM_NULL ; SCM body = CLOSURE_BODY ( closure ) ; if ( length ( CLOSURE_ARGS ( closure ) ) > length ( arg ) ) { scheme_error ( " argument error " ) ; } if ( FALSE_P( need_argument_eval ) ) { evaled_arg = arg ; } else { evaled_arg = eval_list ( arg , state ->env ) ; } closure_env = extend_environment ( CLOSURE_ARGS( closure ) , evaled_arg , CLOSURE_ENV ( closure ) ) ; while (! NULL_P ( body ) ) { // need_argument_evalで末尾再帰 /* ( 1 ) */ if ( LIST_1_P ( body ) && FALSE_P ( need_argument_eval ) ) { state -> status = EVAL_STATUS_NEED_EVAL
; state ->env=closure_env ; result = CAR ( body ) ; break ; } result = eval ( CAR ( body ) , closure_env ) ; body = CDR ( body ) ; } return result ; }
static SCM apply_primitive ( SCM subr , SCM arg , struct EvalState * state , SCM need_argument_eval ) { if ( SPECIAL_FORM_P ( subr ) ) { return PRIMITIVE_PROC ( subr ) ( arg , state ) ; } else if ( LIST_EXPR_P ( subr ) ) { SCM evaled_arg ; if ( FALSE_P ( need_argument_eval ) ) { evaled_arg = arg ; } else { evaled_arg = eval_list ( arg , state -> env ) ; } return PRIMITIVE_PROC ( subr ) ( evaled_arg ) ; } else { SCM result , evaled_arg ; if ( FALSE_P ( need_argument_eval ) ) { evaled_arg = arg ; } else { evaled_arg = eval_list ( arg , state -> env ) ; } switch ( PRIMITIVE_TYPE ( subr ) ) { case PRIMITIVE_TYPE_EXPR_0 : if ( length ( arg ) != 0 ) goto ARG_ERROR ; result = PRIMITIVE_PROC ( subr ) ( ) ; break ; /* ... */ case PRIMITIVE_TYPE_EXPR_4 : if ( length ( arg ) != 4 ) goto ARG_ERROR ; result = PRIMITIVE_PROC ( subr ) ( CAR ( evaled_arg ) , CADR ( evaled_arg ) , CADDR ( evaled_arg ) , CAR ( CDDDR ( evaled_arg ) ) ) ; case PRIMITIVE_TYPE_EXPR_5 : if ( length ( arg ) != 5 ) goto ARG_ERROR ; default : return SCM_NULL ; } return result ; ARG_ERROR : scheme_error ( " eval unsupported : " ) ; } return SCM_NULL ; }
4.3.8.末尾再帰の最適化
Lisp方言Schemeでは、末尾再起の最適化が言語使用として含まれており、最適化のためのアルゴリズムはこのeval、applyに記述する。
コンパイルしてVMやCPUで実行する処理系などでは、再起をループに変換する一般的なアルゴリズムが採用できる。しかし、今回作成する処理系のようにS式を直接解釈し、再起にネイティブスタックを利用する処理系ではこの方法は利用できない。
よって、今回の最適化には、SIODなど古い処理系で採用されている方法を利用する。アルゴリズムは、最後に評価するリストをいったんevalに返し、そのリストを再度evalすることによって実現する( Figure 38 . ( 1 ) ) 。Figure 39.はこのアルゴリズムのスケッチである。
リストの再評価は評価が必要かどうかのフラグで管理する。フラグが値を示す場合( Figure39,40.ではis as value、プログラムではEVAL_STATUS_RETURN_VALUE）の場合はapply関数の戻り値は値とみなしそのまま、eval関数の戻り値とし、再評価を示す場合( Figure 39,40 .の場合はis need eval、プログラムで はEVAL_STATUS_NEED_EVAL）の場合は再評価を行う。
この再評価の環境は最後のリストを評価する時の環境と一致している必要があるため、何らかの方法で利用する環境を新しい環境に更新する必要がある。今回作成した処理系ではeval関数の引数には環境を持たせeval関数からいったん戻す前に環境を更新している( Figure 40 . ) 。
LISP 処理系全体が末尾再帰の最適化に対応するには、特殊形式全てとプロシージャで末尾再帰の最適化を行うように変更すればよい。これは、LISPのプログラムは最終的には特殊形式とプロシージャの二つの関数の実行に簡約されるからである。
4.4.GCの制作
4.3.1で説明したようにCellの確保に関しては本節で説明する。具体的にはalloc.cにおいてCellの確保とGCを行う手続きを記述する。なおGCには保守的マークアンドスウィープGCを使用する。
4.4.1. Cell allocator
GCでは動的に確保したデータを全て管理する必要がある。そのため、GCを利用する場合にはGCに対応した専用のメモリアロケータを作成しそのアロケータを利用する必要がる。そのためCellを確保する専用のアロケータを定義する。
こ のCellアロケータは一度に大量のヒープを確保してCellの単位で切り売りする仕組みを実装してある。ヒープの最初の要素を各ヒープページとfree Cellの管理に利用している。
Cellアロケータではfree Cellの残り総数が0になるとまずGCでCellを回収する。その後free Cellが一定以上回収できなかった場合、mallocでヒープを追加確保して、free Cellを追加する。
4.4.2.マークアンドスイープ
GCの実装には保守的マークアンドスウィープを利用する。保守的なGCの実装法については次の章で説明を行い、ここではその基礎であるマークアンドスウィープの実装について説明を行う。
マークアンドスウィープGCとは次の二段階のアルゴリズムを利用するGCである。
全ての使われてい るCellにマークをする。 マークの付いていないCellを回収する。
以下のその動作を詳しく説明していく。
マークアンドスウィープでマークを行う始点となるオブジェクトをRootとよぶ。LISP処理系でのRootとなるオブジェクトは値が束縛されているシンボル、グローバル変数に代入されたCell、そして保守的GCの対象となるマシンスタックとレジスタにあるCellである。GCではまずこれらRootを走査し、走査できる全てのオブジェクトにマークをつけていく。走査の次はマークのついていないオブジェクトの回収を行う。そして、回収できたオブジェクトの総数に応じてヒープの拡張を行う。
static void scheme_gc( void ) { int collect_cells ; gc_mark_stack ( ) ; gc_mark_symbol_table ( ) ; /* ... */ collect_cells = gc_sweep ( ) ; /* ... */ if ( collect_cells < 600 ) { add_heap ( ) ; } current_search_page = page_list ; }
オブジェクトのマークを行うgc_mark_objectではRootとなるオブジェクトを基準に再帰的にリストをたどりオブジェクトにマークしていく。ここでいうオブジェクトはCellのことである。定数やすでにマークがついているオブジェクトはそれ以上走査しないようにはじいている( Figure 43 . ( 1 ) ) 。また、Cellの中の型にあわせて次のオブジェクトへの走査の方法を変えている( Figure 43 . ( 2 ) )。さらに次に走査するオブジェクトがひとつになった場合はgoto分で末尾再起の最適化を行い、スタックの消費を抑えている( Figure 43 . ( 3 ) ) 。
オブジェクトの回収を行うgc_sweepでは各ヒープページを全て走査し、マークのついていないCellをFreelistに追加する( Figure 44 . ( 1 ) ) 。マークのついているCellはマークを外して、次回の回収に備えている( Figure 44 . ( 2 ) ) 。
static void gc_mark_object ( SCM obj ) { loop : if ( obj == NULL ) return ; /* ( 1 ) */ if ( SCM_CONSTANT_P ( obj ) ) return ; /* scm constant is not marking */ if ( FREE_CELL_P ( obj ) ) return ; /* free cell is not marking */ if ( GC_MARK_P ( obj ) ) return ; /* already marked .
*/ GC_MARK ( obj ) ; /* ( 2 ) */ if ( CONS_P ( obj ) ) { gc_mark_object ( CAR ( obj ) ) ; obj = CDR ( obj ) ; goto loop ; /* ( 3 ) */ } else if ( INTEGER_P ( obj ) ) { return ; } else if ( SYMBOL_P ( obj ) ) { gc_mark_object ( SYMBOL_VCELL( obj ) ) ; } else if ( STRING_P ( obj ) ) { return ; } else if ( PRIMITIVE_P ( obj ) ) { return ; } else if ( CLOSURE_P ( obj ) ) { gc_mark_object ( CLOSURE_ARGS ( obj ) ) ; gc_mark_object( CLOSURE_BODY( obj ) ) ; obj = CLOSURE_ENV ( obj ) ; goto loop ; /* ( 3 ) */ } else if ( MACRO_P ( obj ) ) { obj = MACRO_CLOSURE ( obj ) ; goto loop ; /* ( 3 ) */ } }
static int gc_sweep ( void ) { SCM page = page_list ; int collect = 0 ; gc_sweep_symbol_table_free_cell_remove( ) ; while ( page != NULL ) { SCM cell = page ; SCM last_cell = page + ALLOCATE_HEAP_PAGE_OBJECT_SIZE
- 1 ; while ( AS_UINT ( cell ) <= AS_UINT ( last_cell ) ) { if ( FREE_CELL_P( cell ) ) { /* through */ } else if ( GC_MARK_P ( cell ) ) { if (!
GC_FOREVER_MARK_P( cell ) ) { GC_UNMARK ( cell ) ; } /* ( 2 ) */ } else { /* unmarked */ /* ( 1 ) */ cell_finalize ( cell ) ; int cell_index = 0 ; if ( PAGES_FREE_CELL_LIST ( page ) != NULL ) { cell_index = AS_UINT ( FREE_CELL_INDEX( PAGES_FREE_CELL_LIST( page ) ) ) ; } cell_index + + ; FREE_CELL_CONSTRUCT( cell , AS_SCM ( cell_index ) , PAGES_FREE_CELL_LIST( page ) ) ; PAGES_FREE_CELL_LIST( page ) = cell ; free_cell_total_size ++ ; collect ++ ; } cell ++ ; } page = NEXT_PAGE ( page ) ; } return collect ; }
4.4.3.保守的GCの方法
保守的なGCとはスタックアドレスの中身などが、ヒープに確保したGCの管理下にあるオブジェクトをさしている場合に、そのオブジェクトが利用中であると考えGCを行う方法である。正確なGCとは異なり、利用中のオブジェクトらしきものは回収を行わないため保守的と呼ばれる。
C言語などでスタックの底のアドレスを得るに、LISPを行うプログラムの先頭でローカル変数を宣言する。このローカル変数のアドレスをスタックの底のアドレスとする。
#define SCHEME_STACK_INITIALIZE
\ SCM __dummy_scheme_stack_start_object ; \ stack_initialize( &__dummy_scheme_stack_start_object )
int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { { SCHEME_STACK_INITIALIZE ; scheme_initialize( ) ; read_eval_print_loop ( ) ; scheme_finalize ( ) ; exit( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; } }
次にスタックの先端のアドレスの確保するために、スタックのGCを行うコードの直前、変数宣言の最後にスタックの先端のアドレスの確保するためのローカル変数を宣言する。このローカル変数のアドレスをスタックの先端のアドレスとする。
スタックアドレスはこれで取得できたので次にレジスタの内容の保存を行う( Figure 47 . ( 1 ) ) 。レジスタの内容を保存するにはC言語の標準ライブラリのsetjmpを利用する。jmp_bufをスタックの先端のアドレスの確保するためのローカル変数の前に宣言する。確保したjmp_bufに対してsetjmp関数を実行し、レジスタの中身をjmp_bufに保存する( Figure 47 . ( 2 ) ) 。
最後にこれらの情報からマシンスタックの範囲を求め、その領域の値がGCが管理しているヒープのアドレスだった場合gc_mark_objectを実行する。
static void gc_mark_stack ( void ) { jmp_buf save_register_for_gc_mark ; void * start ; void * end ; int i ; void * end_of_stack ; /* ( 2 ) register value dump */ setjmp(save_register_for_gc_mark ) ; /* ( 1 ) スタックの先端を記録 */ SCHEME_SET_STACK_END(&end_of_stack ) ; if ( AS_UINT ( stack_start ) < AS_UINT ( stack_end ) ) { start = stack_start ; end = stack_end ; } else { start = stack_end ; end = stack_start ; } /* 保守 的GCを行う */ for ( i = 0 ; i < sizeof ( void *) ; i++) { gc_mark_memory ( start , end , i ) ; } return ; }
static void gc_mark_memory ( void * start , void * end , int offset ) { SCM * obj ; for ( obj = ( SCM *) ( char *) start + offset ; ( void *) obj < end ; obj ++ ) { gc_mark_maybe_object(*obj ) ; } }
5.評価
たらいまわし関数の実行例で他のインタプリタと比較を行う。また、言語処理系の作成とGCの作成の結合関係、保守の容易さについて評価を行う。
5.1.性能比較
性能比較をたらいまわし関数の実行時間により行う。比較対象には同じインタプリタのScheme処理系のSigScheme[3]を利用する。
比較に利用したソースコードを示す。
( define tak ( lambda ( x y z ) ( cond ( (< y x ) ( tak ( tak (- x 1 ) y z ) ( tak (- y 1 ) z x ) ( tak (- z 1 ) x y ) ) ) ( #t y ) ) ) ) ( tak 10 5 0 ) ( exit 0 )
( set ! tak ( lambda ( x y z ) ( cond ( (< y x ) ( tak ( tak (- x 1 ) y z ) ( tak (- y 1 ) z x ) ( tak (- z 1 ) x y ) ) ) ( #t y ) ) ) ) ( tak 10 5 0 ) ( exit 0 )
実行結果を以下に示す 。
% time cat tarai.scm | sscm > / dev/null cat tarai.scm 0.01s user 0.00s system 71 % cpu 0.017 total sscm > / dev/null 0.69s user 0.07s system 98 % cpu 0.774 total
% time cat tarai.lisp | ./ thesischeme > / dev/null cat tarai.lisp 0.00s user 0.00s system 19 % cpu 0.020 total ./ thesischeme > / dev/null 5.82s user 0.04s system 97 % cpu 5.990 total
% time cat tarai.lisp | ./ thesischeme > / dev/null cat tarai.lisp 0.00s user 0.01s system 20 % cpu 0.040 total ./ thesischeme > / dev/null 4.52s user 0.06s system 95 % cpu 4.810 total
% time cat tarai.lisp | ./ thesischeme > / dev/null cat tarai.lisp 0.00s user 0.00s system 35 % cpu 0.011 total ./ thesischeme > / dev/null 2.14s user 0.02s system 99 % cpu 2.173 total
この結果より、一度に確保するヒープサイズを大きくするほど速度が出ることがわかる。しかし、ヒープサイズを大きくしても作成した処理系はSigSchemeと比べ2倍以上処理が遅いことがわかる。
5.2.言語処理系とGCの結合関係
通常の言語処理系はメモリアロケータが全資源を握っていると仮定する。このメモリアロケータを含む記憶領域管理機構に対して不要なメモリを自動的に回収するか、言語から回収するかを考える。すると言語から回収するには言語に記憶領域管理情報を扱う機能が必要となる。これは言語が扱うコンピュータの機構の抽象度が低くなるため、抽象度の高いプログラミング言語にはふかしたくない機能である。したがって、GCの依存度は言語の抽象度と関連すると考えられる。
一方、記憶領域管理機構は言語に要求され記憶領域を渡せばどのような手法をとってもよいブラックボックスになってる。そのためアルゴリズムの改良などが独自に行える。ただし、言語が要求する記憶領域に一定の規則( 同一サイズなど)がある場合、アルゴリズムの効率化が図れる。
したがって記憶領域管理機構は言語の扱うデータに依存する。又、記憶領域管理にかかる時間はプログラマーから見ると予期しがたいものがあるため、この時間が一定ではなくばらつく場合はプログラム実行時のリアルタイム性が失われる。そのため言語実行に関する制約がある場合、記憶領域の手法に制約が課せられることがある。
5.3.プログラムの保守
言語処理系とGCとの依存関係を考慮すると、処理系に新しいデータ構造を追加した場合、新しいルートを追加した場合のみGCに手を加える必要があることがわかる。ルートを言語処理系側でリンクトリストなどで管理すればさらに変更点が減り、新しいデータ構造のときのみGCを修正すればよいことがわかる。またGCの変更点はgc_mark_objectただひとつであるので、GC付属の言語処理系の保守のコストは言語処理系のみの場合の保守のコストと限りなく近いことが推測できる。
6.まとめ
GC付属のLISP処理系を作成した。これにより、保守的GCを採用する限り言語処理系とGCは完璧に分離して実装を行えることを確認できた。しかし、マークアンドスウィープGC以外のGCのアルゴリズムや保守的でないGCの場合に同様に分離して実装を行えるかの実証ができなかった。
GCのアルゴリズムによりプログラミングスタイルにどのように制限が生じるかをあらかじめ確認できれば、新たにGCを実装する開発者にとって見積もりがしやすくなる。
今回の研究で作成した処理系は一種類のGCしか実装できなかったため、もうひとつの代償的なGCであるコピーGCの実装を行うことや、GCの実行時間を分散してリアルタイム性を向上させるリアルタイムGCなどの実装を行うことが今後の研究課題である。

George W. Bush looked into the TV camera , Tuesday morning [ July 15 ] and tried to assuage the fears of about 300 million Americans who believed they were in the middle of a Recession .
" The economy is growing , " said the President .
" Productivity is high , " he told us .
" Trade 's up .
People are working , " he said .
In the Bush White House , the " R Word " is just a myth .
Of course , the man who once wanted to be known as the Compassionate Conservative did say he knew " It 's been a difficult time for many American families . "
" Difficult " does n't even begin to describe what has happened to Americans the past seven years .
Within hours of the President 's speech , a less optimistic Ben Bernanke , chair of the Federal Reserve , told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is high and " seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term . "
In sworn testimony , he told the senators that " Many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress , in part because of the outlook for the economy and thus for credit quality , remains uncertain . "
Market Watch reports that over the past year , " inflation at the wholesale level gained 9.2 % -- the largest year - over - year gain since June 1981 . "
On the day that the President assuaged and the Federal Reserve chairman testified , General Motors announced it would freeze job hirings in several areas , lay off salaried workers , suspend shareholder dividends , and borrow up to $ 3 billion .
Six weeks earlier , GM announced it was closing four plants ; on the day the President spoke , GM announced four more plant closings .
The nation 's largest corporation , which saw a 16 percent sales decline in the first half of the year , announced that it was giving retired workers a slight pension increase but was cutting health care benefits .
About 8.5 million Americans actively seeking work are unemployed , an increase of about 21.4 percent over one year ago , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) .
The unemployment rate of 5.5 percent is up from 4.6 percent a year ago .
More important , about 1.5 million of the 8.5 million unemployed have been unemployed at least six months , a 37 percent increase over the past year , according to the BLS .
Not included in the numbers are the " 1.6 million people who are ' marginally attached ' to the workforce , who had looked for work in the previous 12 months , but not in the last month , " according to Andre Damon of Global Research .
Damon also reports that the BLS data does not include about 420,000 " ' discouraged workers ' , who had given up looking for work because they think that there is no work available . "
Work is available in dozens of other countries , where American companies seeking to " maximize the bottom line " have been outsourcing jobs for years .
About 14 million American jobs are going to be outsourced in the next four years , according to a report issued by the University of California at Berkeley .
Short - sighted and greedy , these CEOs and their boards believe child labor and wages that can dip below $ 1 an hour is just another acceptable business practice .
The " Made in America " label is now becoming as extinct as corporate morality .
Americans who have been using credit cards to survive the Recession and have now reached their credit limit can raise their limit or sometimes reduce their payments or rate .
All they have to do is call a credit card agency 's toll - free number , which is answered by someone at a call center in India .
Those same call centers are also telemarketing Americans to get into even more debt by getting credit cards .
In a true " global economy , " as many now euphemistically refer to outsourcing , persons having trouble with their computers assembled from parts made in Mexico and several Asian countries can now call technicians in India for assistance .
Book and magazine publishers have been outsourcing art , design , editing , and printing overseas .
Even newspapers have figured out how to cut even more costs while driving up profits .
The Orange County ( Calif . )
Register , which laid off 90 persons in 2007 , outsourced copyediting and page design to journalists in India .
The Modesto ( Calif . )
Bee and Sacramento Bee have outsourced most of their advertising design departments to India .
For Americans who have jobs , getting to them is more expensive .
It makes no difference if the worker drives or takes public transportation , the rising cost of oil has pushed Americans into a crisis .
Gas prices rose more than 25 percent in the past year , to more than $ 4 by July 1 ; diesel prices are up more than 30 percent to more than $ 5 .
The higher fuel costs affect almost every service and industry from home heating to food production and road repair .
Flushed with an inflated housing boom , banks and mortgage companies had begun issuing mortgages , usually with excessive fees and high interest rates , to just about anyone with a pulse .
The weaker the credit rating , the higher the fees and interest .
Even if the economy was healthy , there would have been several hundred thousand defaults .
By the end of 2007 , about 2.5 million mortgages were in default , almost 40 percent higher than one year earlier .
Attached to the problem is that many new homeowners bought houses at inflated prices , assured by lending companies that housing prices would continue to rise , are making monthly payments that put them at financial risk , and are now watching the value of their houses decline .
Foreclosures and the Recession have driven down housing prices throughout the country .
In 20 major American cities , house prices declined about 15 percent , according to the Case - Shiller index of housing prices .
Prices declined by 25 percent in Las Vegas , Miami , and Phoenix , according to Case - Shiller .
In California , the median price of houses declined by 35 percent over last year , according to the California Association of Realtors .
Monday morning , the day before the President 's speech , hundreds of Americans stood in line at the 33 Southern California branches of IndyMac Bank , now renamed Indymac Federal Bank , to withdraw what they hoped was all of their money .
Over 11 days , customers had withdrawn about $ 1.3 billion , amid rumors that the bank was failing .
The previous Friday , federal regulators seized the bank , once one of the nation 's largest mortgage lenders .
Last year , the bank lost $ 615 million ; the books bled red another $ 184 million the first three months of this year .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) guarantees each individual account to $ 100,000 , joint accounts to $ 200,000 , and retirement accounts to $ 250,000 .
Those with less knew they would get all of their money .
For those with more , some were just hoping to recover 50 cents on the dollar .
The cost to the FDIC is expected to be $ 4 - 8 billion .
IndyMac was the fifth bank to fail in the previous six months .
Also failing were the Federal National Mortgage Association ( better known as Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ( better known as Freddie Mac ) .
The quasi - governmental agencies either own the loans or guarantee loans for almost half of the nation 's $ 11 trillion in mortgages .
But , with more homeowners buying houses they could n't afford and now being subjected to rising costs in almost every area , combined with higher unemployment , both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced collapse , their stock value freefalling about 90 percent in the past year .
To keep the two agencies from failing , which would undoubtedly throw the nation into a deeper Recession that could dive into a Depression , the Federal Reserve announced it would issue low - cost loans of up to $ 15 billion .
While 15 billion taxpayer dollars may seem significant , it is only about 9 percent of the $ 168 billion Congress appropriated for the war this year .
President Bush , Vice - President Cheney , and their advisors were vigorous in demanding the U.S. go to war in Iraq and vigorous in demanding massive funding for that war , which may now cost more than $ 1 trillion .
President Bush did acknowledge that the economy was n't " as good as we'd like , and to the extent that we 'll find weaknesses , we 'll move . "
As domestic problems piled up the past few years , much caused by a diversion of the budget and assets to Iraq , it seemed that the Bush - Cheney Administration moved on domestic policies at the speed of a glacier .
Not receiving much help are the 47 million Americans who do n't have medical insurance , mostly because they can't afford the premiums , and the 3.5 million homeless , most of whom once had homes and jobs but are now living in their cars or makeshift shelters .
About one - fourth of the homeless are veterans ; slightly more than one - third of the homeless are children .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton and Al Gore campaigned against President George H.W. Bush on the slogan , " It 's the economy , Stupid . "
The politics of that election came down to asking Americans if they were better off under that President Bush after four years than they were when his presidency began .
Four presidential terms later , after eight years of a rising economy under President Clinton , it 's the economy -- not the war , the attack upon civil liberties , the destruction of the environment , or any of a few dozen other destructive policies -- that may be what finally scuttles this Bush 's legacy .

Spare us the pain of yet another repetition of the “ Chicken Little , the sky is falling ” syndrome , as journalist Seymour Hersh so accurately stated about his own writings on Iran during a recent edition of the CNN talk show Late Edition .
The substance of the latest ‘ revelations ’ of “ Preparing the Battlefield ” , published in the June 29 , 2008 issue of The New Yorker , is no more than a rehash of very old news packaged under an alarmist - intended title .
The so - called ‘ facts ’ do not amount to more than their intended purpose : to further dramatize the threat of military attack against the Iranian people and nation , in the form of the ceaseless psychological warfare , known as psyops , emanating from the Western mass media .
It seems one of the motives in writing this latest ‘ exposé ’ of the Bush administration ’s well - financed covert operations against Iran was best illuminated in Hersh ’s discussion and retelling of the Pentagon ’s version of the Iranian patrol boat incident back in January 2008 .
“ Weariness with the war in Iraq has undoubtedly affected the public ’s tolerance for an attack on Iran , but this mood could change quickly , ” writes the investigative journalist , citing the Iranian patrol boat incident as a clear example of the “ potential for escalation ” .
Although Hersh referred to a Gallup poll taken last November , when seventy - three percent ( 73 % ) of the Americans surveyed favored economic means and diplomacy to address the issue of Iran ’s nuclear program , compared to only eighteen percent ( 18 % ) who favored direct military action , he went on to repeat George Bush ’s characterization of the incident as “ provocative ” and “ dangerous ” on the day Bush was heading for an eight - day trip to the Middle East .
“ There was , very briefly , a sense of crisis and outrage at Iran , ” Hersh wrote .
What was left out of this story was that the purpose of the Bush trip was to gather support for the administration ’s sagging efforts to convince some of the Arab governments to comply with the U.S. foreign policy objective of isolating Iran so as to advance the United States ’ hegemonic goals in the region .
Furthermore , in repeating only a part of the old news , Mr. Hersh neglected to mention that the Iranian government produced actual audio - video footage of the so - called ‘ provocative ’ encounter , blowing so many holes in the official version that a week later the Pentagon had to sing a different tune .
As we recall , Bush ’s efforts , as well as the ridiculous Pentagon version of Navy warships being threatened by five small Iranian speedboats , fell flat on its face , and to this day Iran continues to enjoy a certain stature among its neighbors .
So , exactly what is the NEW news ?
We have already heard about the ‘ secret ’ moves of the Bush administration against Iran , in the form of arming terrorist groups , such as the Jundullah , which has links to Al - Qaeda and ties to the drug culture via the CIA and Special Operations funding .
The Iranian community is aware of the Pentagon ’s use and funding of another dissident group camped out in Iraq under U.S. command , the Mujahideen - e - Khalq , known as the MEK , which is paradoxically still on the State Department ’s terrorist list .
These two groups , along with a tiny third armed group of thugs known as the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan ( PJAK ) , all receive notoriety and power because of their financial and logistical ties to U.S. counter - intelligence operations in the Middle East and Asia .
Perhaps the real news is the fact that the U.S. Congress has actually authorized up to $ 400 million for covert operations against Iran through the secret but complicit actions of key members of the Democratic leadership in Congress , who were supposed to be making efforts to stymie the administration ’s plans for continuing the occupation of Iraq .
So what are the other developments in this article ?
It is public knowledge printed in all of the mass media outlets that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s recent trip to Tehran in June resulted in an announcement ( for what it ’s worth ) that the Iraqi government would ban any contact between foreigners and the MEK , and that Iraq was not willing to be a staging ground for covert operations against other countries in the region ( Iran ) , much to the disconcertment of Washington .
Hersh ’s article spent considerable effort restating the old news about Admiral Fallon having been pushed out as head of the U.S. Central Command over ‘ disagreements ’ on Iran .
What was more revealing was confirmation of our understanding that Fallon ’s resignation had more to do with “ putting out the fires in Iraq ” as Fallon himself has stated , meaning controlling the resistance forces in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting against the continued occupation by U.S. and NATO soldiers , than it did about attacking Iran .
It seems that the bulk of the military establishment , Fallon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff included , along with key policy - makers in the high echelons of the U.S. government , had already concluded that expansion of the war from Afghanistan and Iraq into Iran was not possible at this time .
In times of the “ crisis of ruling for the empire ” , who does n’t know that inter-agency disagreements , miscalculations of intelligence assessments , and even inner party political fights usually result in some heads rolling ?
This has been the outcome faced by the Bush administration , which has been stripped of almost all of the “ Old Guard ” after nearly seven years of war in Afghanistan and over five years of war in Iraq .
Given the rising tension between Iran and the U.S. these days , which could be read in the price of a barrel of oil , of course , it is politically safer not to downgrade the U.S. threat , but to yield to and resound the Washington - Tel Aviv war drum beats serves the conservative causes of the warmongers in the psyops battleground .
It may be worth noting that the day after Hersh ’s CNN interview , CNBC , the stock market channel , was giving airtime to John Bolton , a very hawkish neoconservative , spreading his threat that Israel will bomb Iran ’s strategic facilities , at the same time Seymour Hersh was being interviewed on Democracy Now .
Why are Bolton and Hersh singing the same song ?
Perhaps the real complications come with the realization among both Republicans and Democrats , in and out of the White House , that the United States government has to come up with a strong and convincing excuse , a justification , to the American people as to why they must be willing to expend even more than the trillion dollars of the U.S. treasury that has already been spent in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and perhaps for the next 5 to 10 years .
That ’s a hard sell .

THE TYPE OF ADVICE GIVEN BY A PHYSICAN TO AN ATHEIST PATIENT WHO IS DYING Comfort for the dying Atheist
As a physician I have seen my fair share of death and dying .
Unlike the death scenes we see in movies death is often a prolonged and agonizing process .
Could there be any stronger evidence for the lack of a loving or merciful God ?
Every hospital I 've worked in , even the most secular of institutions , has a chaplain or other clergyman standing by to comfort the dying person and his or her family .
These clergymen are almost invariably Christians who come to the deathbed armed with the purportedly priceless gifts of salvation and eternal life .
Is it any wonder that the Church grows richer every year ?
But what does the Atheist have to offer a colleague who is about to die ?
Perhaps more than one might think .
1 ) . A hand to hold .
Not just any hand but a hand connected to a brain that thinks rationally .
2 ) . A reality check .
Cognition and memory tend to fade in our final hours and the resulting confusion can be frightening .
Remind your friend that ghosts , goblins , ghouls , devils , purgatory , hell , and other bizarre figments of religious mythology do not exist .
Reassure your friend that Christian threats of eternal punishment are both primitive and absurd .
3 ) . Immortality .
The Atheistic belief that we cease to exist at the moment of death is almost certainly true .
But in the greater scheme of things we do , in a manner of speaking , have the opportunity to live on after death .
If our ideas and actions have advanced humanity , even in a small way , then a part of us does live on .
Remind your dying friend of this fact .
4 ) Peace and tranquility Clergymen and evangelicals know that there is no better place to proselytize than the deathbed .
But for the Atheist the same unwanted appeals to savage thinking that have always been annoying may be unbearable in the final hours .
Screen visitors and politely but firmly insist , No , my friend does not want to hear about Jesus .
5 ) Gratitude .
The Atheist who gives to Atheistic , free thought , and other rational organizations has changed the world for the better .
Unlike the individual who leaves money to a Christian church in a misguided attempt to buy salvation , the Atheist expects nothing in return .
Thank the dying Atheist for this unselfish act and for helping to make the world a better place for future generations
What follows is by JK . 6 ) .
That future non-existence is no worse than the non-existence before birth .
[ This fact was argued by the Epicurean philosophers and is found in De Rerum Natura by Lucretius . 7 ) . That the atheist is unto himself true .
He does n't have to suppress the obvious conclusions that as happened unto Fido and Polly , so to will happen to him .
Nor does he have to believe that a beneficent Jehovah created has created a world full of illness , poverty , and cruelty and allows it continue -- or the absurd excuses such as he must test us to find out who is worthy of salvation .
Nor does he have to fret that he will not be among the 144,000 blessed ( as stated in Revelations ) and thus eternally to endure hell fires .
8 ) .
That if perchance there is a god , we have a soul , and the god chooses among the soul which shall be blessed in the hereafter , it is far more likely that he will choose a rational , thinking person who comes to a reasoned conclusion about god and worship then some religious fool — the turning around of Pascal 's Wager .
* David Hume , one of the 2 greatest English philosophers , recalled what transpired with the death of Voltaire : a member of the clergy being present who said that Voltaire had underwent last rites .
( However , the Church must have known this to be a lie , for they would not allow Voltaire to be buried in church grounds ) .
David Hume arranged before his death to have Boswell , the famed English chronicler and Hume 's friend present , to prevent the same being said of him as was of Voltaire .
A reading of Adam Smith 's short account of his last day and his short autobiographical sketch reveals that he was far from frightened at the prospect of eternal non-existence .
He writes of an inner calmness and relief as the end of his life approached .
IMMORTALITY
A couple of considerations on death which are strong evidence against the immortality of the soul .
1 . Do you believe in existence before life ?
{ If yes , then what did you do for the last 12 billion years ? }
2 . I believe that not living after death is no worse than not living before birth -- Epicurus .
3 . Do you believe that there is a dog heaven ?
Then why do you believe that what happens to me after death is any different than what happens to Fido ?
However , like special creation , the position on immortality of the soul is essentially a religious belief and thus their assertions in support of the immortality of a soul turn upon those sophistries offered in support of their god .
Their descriptions of existence after death are just an elaboration of what their god likes and how their god has given them special knowledge .
For those wishing to be entertained on the topic of Christian faith , there are the illustrated brotherhood of religions and where is god 's son ?
On point is the list of the basic reasons to be without religion .
On the issue of post - death existence are works by John Stuart Mills and Lucretius the Roman Epicurean .
In a passage that merits reading for its conciseness and clarity , John Stuart Mills explains his father ’s opposition to religion for being the greatest of evils and the results of this evil are describe in James Haught ’s Holy Horror .

TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
Three people were killed and at least 84 were injured Saturday morning when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck northeastern Japan , Japanese officials said .
The quake struck at about 8:43 a.m. north of Sendai , Japan .
Another five people were missing , national police said .
Officials said the earthquake led to the buckling of highways and caused some bridges to collapse .
Bullet trains were also stopped in the affected areas .
Two nuclear power plants in the region were not affected , officials said .
Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura said one man was killed when he was buried in a landslide in Fukushima Prefecture and the other was struck by a truck as he rushed out of his house in Iwate Prefecture .
Officials have not yet released details of the third death .
Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda sent priority orders for rescue operations , Machimura said .
The quake , which struck at about 8:43 a.m. ( 11:43 p.m. GMT Friday ) , was centered 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Sendai in southern Iwate prefecture .
The Japanese Meteorological Agency said several strong aftershocks followed the initial quake .
The Iwate government office said it had received reports that eight children and a teacher were injured by breaking windows at a preschool and that the earthquake produced landslides in some areas .
The Miyagi fire department said there had been some injuries caused by falling furniture , and some bus passengers were injured when the vehicle bounced on a bridge .
Two houses collapsed , the fire department said .
East Japan Railway suspended Shinkansen bullet trains in the Tohoku region , and many other train lines in the region suspended operation as well .
Expressways in Miyagi were also closed .
Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that operations at nuclear power plants in Fukushima prefecture were not affected , Kyodo said .
There were no tsunami warnings issued after the quake .
Local governments , fire departments and police were working to gather damage reports .
CNN 's Junko Ogura and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report .

I ’ve learned a lot about python by implementing tinypy .
Today I was thinking over my re-work of classes , objects , and inheritance in tinypy ( not in trunk yet ) .
I noted how in tinypy , I will be able to change the class of an object via a function call ( a - la lua ) :
class A : pass
class B : pass
x = A ( ) # x is an instance of A
setmeta( x , B ) # x is now an instance of B !!!
So I thought to myself , I wonder if python can do that .
Well , it can , and as per usual , its solution is quite elegant :
class A : pass
class B : pass
x = A ( ) # x is an instance of A
x.__class__ = B # x is now an instance of B !!!
So , lesson of the day — you can dynamically change the class of an object in bigpy .
Which , actually , I ’ve sometimes wanted to do , I just did n’t realize I * could * do it .
While browsing my favorite programming news site programming .
reddit.com , I stumbled across this link to a video lecture on C++'s upcoming standard C++0 x by no one else than Bjarne Stroustrup himself !
You can start watching it right away or you can download it in DivX or MPEG and watch it later .
I have a great interest in the C and C++ family of programming languages and their history , and I have read two of Bjarne 's books - C++ Programming Language and The Design and Evolution of C++.
I enjoyed every page of these books and they made me not only a decent C++ programmer but also made me understand how the language was formed , what it 's goals were , where it was headed and how the language got various constructs it has now .
If you ever consider becoming a great C++ programmer , these books are a definite read .
The most fundamental things these books taught me was to think think of various levels of abstraction and approaching a given programming problem from various programming paradigms .
When I found the link I put aside all the things I was working on and started watching the video lecture .
I love C++ that much !
A note aside for people wanting to learn C++.
I see people argue on programming .
reddit.com and other sites that C++ is not worth learning , that it's is a dead language and X is better than C++ , etc .
Do n't listen to this crap !
If you ever watched Guy Kawasaki 's presentation The Art of the Start , the 11th point of success is " Do n't let the bozos grind you down . "
That 's what all these bozos on Reddit are trying to do .
Do n't listen to them ; just start learning C++ and you will succeed .
Now , back to the lecture .
Here , I cite what the lecturer has to say about his lecture :
A good programming language is far more than a simple collection of features .
My ideal is to provide a set of facilities that smoothly work together to support design and programming styles of a generality beyond my imagination .
Here , I briefly outline rules of thumb ( guidelines , principles ) that are being applied in the design of C++0 x .
Then , I present the state of the standards process ( we are aiming for C++09 ) and give examples of a few of the proposals such as concepts , generalized initialization , being considered in the ISO C++ standards committee .
Since there are far more proposals than could be presented in an hour , I 'll take questions .
Just like I did while learning JavaScript from video lectures , I am going to timestamp blog about most interesting things that caught my attention .
Here are the things that caught my attention in Bjarne 's C++ video presentation .
Time in the brackets is when it appeared on the video . '+' before the brackets indicate that I knew it already , ' -' that I did n't ( just for personal notes ) .
I will write down some obvious facts about the language even though I know them , so you got an idea what the lecture was about .
+( 03:25 ) C++ is used on both Mars rovers , Spirit and Opportunity .
Design life of the rowers was 6 months .
+( 05:30 ) C++ is a better C in a way that it can roughly do the same as C but also has many new features
+/-( 06:55 )
Highest level goals of C++ are to make it a better language for systems programming and library building and make it easier to teach and learn .
and make it .
( 08:46 ) Joke :
The next Intels will execute infinite loop in five minutes and that 's why you do n't need performance . :)
: The next Intels will execute infinite loop in five minutes and that 's why you do n't need performance . :) +/-( 10:00 )
The main problem for a new revision of the standard is the popularity of C++.
Existing and new users want countless improvements .
Adding a new feature needs to keep the existing code absolutely stable .
Each new feature makes the language harder to learn .
+( 15:46 ) The current C++ ISO standard is from 1998 , with a revision in 2003 .
( 15:50 ) Joke :
If you can tell the difference between C++ 1998 and C++ 03 , then you have just been reading too many manuals .
: If you can tell the difference between C++ 1998 and C++ 03 , then you have just been reading too many manuals .
( 16:36 ) Joke : Some of C++ language developers working on C++0 x are very , very keen to get that x to be a decimal number .
: Some of C++ language developers working on C++0 x are very , very keen to get that x to be a decimal number . +( 17:20 ) Voting on C++ standard features is done nation - wide .
Each nation casts one vote .
+/-( 19:14 ) Standardization matters because it directly affects millions of peoples , new techniques need to get into mainstream use , it 's a defense against vendor lock - in
+/-( 22:10 ) Rules of thumb for the standard : Maintain stability and compatibility , Prefer libraries to language extensions , Prefer generality to specialization , Support both experts and novices , Increase type safety , Improve performance and ability to work directly with hardware , Fit into the real world , Make only changes that changes the way people think .
-( 30:28 ) There are around 100 new proposals for language features .
-( 33:22 ) There are much less library proposals .
Just 11 new proposals for Library TR1 !
-( 35:47 ) Areas of language change are machine model and concurrency , modules and DLLs , support for generic programming .
+( 38:01 ) Vector initialization problem example .
( 40:50 ) Even Bjarne made an error when using the verbose syntax for initializing a vector with a list of values from an array :
" If you have tedious , verbose and indirect code , you make mistakes ! "
-( 41:09 ) Indirect vector initialization from arrays violates Stroustrup 's language design principle ( from The Design and Evolution of C++ ) - " Support user - defined and built - in types equally well . "
. " -( 41:56 ) C++0 x solution to initialization problem are initialized lists , std::initializer_list < type >.
, std::initializer_list < type >. -( 43:43 ) There are too many ways to initialize things in C++ and they work in various contexts , C++0 x introduces uniform initialization syntax which can be used in any initialization .
which can be used in any initialization .
-( 46:50 ) Fundamental cause of lots of problems in C++ with generic programming is that the compiler does n't know what template argument types are supposed to do .
+/-( 49:30 ) C++ 98 got templates right in a way that parametrization did n't require hierarchies , parametrization could be done with non-types , the code generated had uncompromising efficiency and that it turned out that template instantiation was Turing complete !
-( 54:42 ) Concept aims of C++0 x are direct expression of intent ( lecture got cut here ( they ran out of type or something ) :( and the next moment was somewhere in the future ) , no performance degradation compared to current code , relatively easy implementation within current compilers and that current template code must remain valid .
( they ran out of type or something ) :( and the next moment was somewhere in the future ) , no performance degradation compared to current code , relatively easy implementation within current compilers and that current template code must remain valid .
-( 55:33 ) Lecture continues here from where it was cut .
It 's something about type system how it makes sure correct data types using just declarations , and about compile time type contracts through templates .
-( 1:06:14 ) Quick summary : template aliases , initializer lists , overloading based on concepts , type deduction from initializers , a new for loop for ranges .
After the lecture the following questions were asked :
( 01:09:40 ) What 's your opinion about the Microsoft implementation of C ++?
A : Microsoft 's implementation is the the best out there , they conform to the standards pretty well and the code generated is also good .
GNU gcc is also good .
Though , they want you to use their " Managed C++ " called C++/CLI which is totally unportable .
Apple does the same with their version of C++ which is Objective C/C++ and and so does GNU .
They all play this game of trying to get users just to use their product and not switch to their competitor products .
( 01:11:56 ) Do you think you 'll ever design a new language from scratch ?
A : Certainly not from scratch .
You have to answer the question , why are you designing a language ?
You design a language to solve a certain problem .
If I ever designs a new language it will be because I feel that some problem needs a solution .
( 01:13:39 ) You mentioned threads , are there other things like transactions and cache mangement ?
A : Concurrency is becoming very important .
The question is how do you do it ?
My solution is to provide language primitives out of which you build libraries that use these primitives and provide various models of concurrency .
Doing it directly with language primitives is too hard .
( 01:16:25 ) How long after the standard is out do you expect to see a production compiler ?
A : After the C++0 x standard is approved and released the vendors will start releasing compilers right away .
Some of them have already built in some of the upcoming features .
( 01:17:55 ) Is auto like a type inference ?
A : auto is kinda type inference but it 's very simple .
You simply look at the type of initializer and you use it .
( 01:18:47 ) Would it be useful to have a switch in every compiler for deprecating features ?
A : Yes , that would be useful because the compilers have to support old features which we would like to get rid of ever .
I have not been able to convince compiler makes to do it .
( 01:19:16 ) Is it possible to do garbage collection ( GC ) cleanly and efficiently in C ++?
A : Yes , it is possible to do GC in C ++.
An implementation already exists and I will have a discussion tomorrow on whether to put it in standard .
There are two problems , though .
One is that people would start writing poor code never caring to free the used memory which would lead to poor performance .
The other is that GC can be a performance virus .
( 01:24:39 ) A lot of academic institutions have dropped teaching C++.
As a result there are a lot of poor coding practices and poor coding solutions coming in from people .
Are there any plans to have some documentation on how it would be more teachable ?
A : I have become an academic for the last couple of years and someone talked me into teaching undergrads .
I am more used to serious Ph.D's from good universities with 10 years of experience and it's not quite the same !
I tried out ideas and I wrote a text book which will get out some time next year .
( 01:26:24 ) How soon after you created C++ did you see it start to take over the industry ?
A : The first commercial release was in 1985 .
I had access to data how many C++ users there were and kept track of it during 80s .
From 1979 till 1991 the doubling rate was 7.5 months .
And now we are at 3 million users .
( 01:28:25 ) A lot of template classes at the moment use template hoisting to make them more efficient in terms of code size at compilation time .
Is there anything being done to address the issues that make it necessary ?
A : There is a trick of avoiding a lot of separate template instantiations based on void pointer .
I do n't see any changes to that .
That 's a portable way of doing it .
( 01:29:50 ) What 's your opinion on generic programming at runtime level ?
A : It would be a good idea , but what 's mostly called generic programming at runtime level has either so many indirections that it runs at 1/10 ths of the speed of non-generic code or it's not too generic and you can't do any of the interesting stuff .
( 01:31:33 ) You talked about having user defined types act the same way as built in types .
Pointers are used for various optimizations like function overloading and smart pointers .
Do you see a problem here ?
Is it being solved ?
A : First of all , I think smart pointers are overused .
Secondly , we can emulate inheritance with smart pointers .
You can basically build a perfect smart pointer now .
I worry about smart pointers because if you use a smart pointer and I give you one and we have no agreement on how mine works , we got a race condition .
We have no lock on this code and we got two pieces of code which poke in the same area .
You have to be very careful of the semantics of this smart pointer .
( 01:33:38 ) There are interesting parallels between templates and duck typing used in dynamic languages .
Will templates overtake classes for writing code and filing contracts ?
A : Yes , templates has roughly the same as duck typing in scripting languages done dynamically .
I think interfaces will be much better specified with concepts and there is still a large components of duck typing .
Templates are becoming more important .
Please remember that templates by themselves are nothing !
They help you to abstract you over something .
( 01:37:14 ) Have you ever gotten any death threads because of the changes in the language ?
A : I have never gotten any death threads for any reason .
And lets keep it that way !
( 01:37:28 ) Is there any particular naming convention you subscribe to ?
A : Yes , I like underscores .
I do not like the camel stuff , it 's less readable .
( 01:37:57 ) The new language features you come up with .
There are so many languages upcoming right now ?
Do you try to reuse any of the things they have done ?
A : I try to learn from new languages , particularly , the users of new language .
But grafting from one language to another is much harder than most people think .
When you see something work in one language , then you see what problem are they solving , can we solve as elegantly in C ++?
If the answer is no , then we see how it can be solved and see the way it was done in other language .
But simple grafting is a very hard exercise .
( 01:38:52 ) When you initially designed the language , did you start from rigorous specifications or how did it start ?
A : I am trying to be rigorous , but it 's still informal in a sense that it is written in English .
I started out with C specification written by Dennis Ritchie .
Some things have improved , some have become more obscure because of the more words people use .
We have tried several times to see if we can make it also formal .
It would be nice to have formal sematics either for all of it or parts of it .
It has not been that successful over the years .
But I am very happy to report that a group from IBM this year managed to prove that C++ inheritance system was formally sound .
It 's proven .
So 20 years later they proved that I did n't screw up .
( 01:40:18 ) With Sun releasing some hardware which runs Java bytecode , are you afraid that it could take away C++'s embedded position ?
A : Java would kill C++ totally in 2 years , Sun said in 1996 .
They sort of been repeating this story over and over again .
There is a lot of Java , and there is a lot of C++ and it's a big world .
( 01:41:05 ) How do you balance things at compile time and runtime , for example exceptions ?
A : If you need to have balance , something at runtime , then you have to have it at runtime .
For example , most of the good uses of virtual functions can't be done at runtime because you do n't have the information .
Talking about exceptions , there are compilers which add no overhead if no exceptions are thrown .
There are trade offs and some things you just need to do at runtime .

The polls just closed in West Virginia , and already Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner .
This is not shocking or surprising as she was expected to blow out Barack Obama in a state where he did n’t make much of an effort to connect with voters .
Exit polls show that Hillary Clinton won the state by at least a 2 to 1 margin .
In actual numbers this means that she will pick up 19 delegates to Barack Obama ’s 9 .
This is a symbolic win for Clinton that she hopes will put a seed of doubt into the superdelegates ’ minds about Barack Obama ’s electability .
West Virginia has one of the oldest electorates in the country .
A vast majority of Democrats in the state do not have college degrees .
26 % of the voters in the primary were over 65 , and 12 % were under age 30 .
No one should be surprised if Clinton wins the state 70 % - 30 % or 80% - 20 %
Advertisements
This is a victory that means nothing .
If Clinton would have won Indiana by a wider margin , then perhaps the case could be made to the superdelegates that they should wait , but now Clinton needs to run up gigantic margins of victory , and win 80 % of the remaining superdelegates .
This is an unlikely result at best .

Yahoo's solution – to burn a CD and then re-rip it , is far from perfect .
You 'll lose quality , much like in the old analog tape - to - tape days , but at least you 'll still have a copy .
The other alternative is BitTorrent , where you can find complete , high bitrate copies of most new music , complete with artwork .
It 's free , fast and devoid of all copy protection .
No , we do n't condone piracy , but until those other idiots in the music industry realize that to compete with BitTorrent they need to offer a better product , not a far , far worse one , it seems that there is n't much alternative .
Will Yahoo relent and extend the death sentence placed on its music ?
Microsoft did just that after a deluge of user complaints about its similar euthanization of PlaysForSure back in April .
Another alternative would be for Yahoo to simply replace these locked files with plain vanilla MP3s , something the company is not averse to .
Back in February , Yahoo Music boss Dave Goldberg told the Silicon Valley Watcher that " I 've long advocated removing DRM on music because there is already a lot of music available without DRM , and it just makes things complicated for the user " .
The trouble here would still seem to be the record labels , who ultimately get to say what is done with their music .
It must be obvious , even to them , that DRM is dying ( it just takes one single track to be uploaded to a file sharing site to negate all the other DRMed tracks sold ) .
Even so , instead of just dropping it and offering the customers what they want , the Big Labels are instead using DRM as a bargaining tool .
Famously , the Amazon music store carries music from all the big four labels in plain MP3 format .
The same music is n't all available from the biggest online shop , the iTunes Store .
The reason ?
It 's widely thought that it is because the labels are n't happy with iTunes stranglehold on pricing and distribution , and is punishing Apple to force a more flexible market ( read : higher prices ) .
Add to this that most non -geek users do n't care about DRM until it bites them , much like a fly does n't see the spider 's web until it is already trapped , and you have a situation that is , as Goldberg says " complicated for the user . "
What can we say to convince you , record executive ?
It wo n't work .
In his latest column for Britain 's Guardian , Cory Doctorow likens the music industry 's approach to that of the early days of the spam war .
Despite content filtering , blacklisting and ISP level intervention , we have lost the war on spam .
Doctorow wonders " how the entertainment industry plans on doing any better trying the same tactics on an even grander and more savage scale " .
One word : Fail .
And the only ones getting hurt are , once again , the customers .

While doing a general Google search for some Pit Bull related information , I came up on an article on the Village Voice website titled , “ Man ’s Best Defense , Tyler Eison turns pit bull pups into deadly weapons “ .
The article starts out with a quote directly from Tyler Eison , a real estate investor and auto dealer , stating , “ These are not normal dogs .
I like having very vicious , angry dogs .
I ’m going to teach them not to like other dogs .
I ’m going to agitate them , make them aggressive .
That way when it ’s about business , they are going to be serious . ”
He goes on through the article to describe the ways in which he trains his puppies , whom he admits are not vicious on their own , instead saying , “ if you want a truly vicious dog you have to create it yourself . ”
Beginning at nine weeks old he started antagonizing the puppies , trying to weed out the tough ones from the weak so he could better focus his time on creating monsters out of the pups that showed some determination and aggression .
He forces the puppies to scrap with one another , allowing the stronger willed pups to dominate their smaller , more scared , contemporaries .
The reporter described an incident where he witnessed Eison force two dogs to go after one another , the smaller one eventually running into the yard and hiding , relieving himself in a secluded area of the yard .
It seems that every Pit Bull abuser wants to play the childhood card when explaining how their so - called “ love ” of Pitbulls began .
He fondly spoke of a feral Pit Bull which his grandparents ( assuredly ) over - bred , that saved his life when a heater caught fire in their home .
Then at 19 , Eison was involved in a fender bender which erupted into an argument , at which point the other man proclaimed he was going to get something from the trunk of his car .
Eison surmised this something was a gun , so he wasted no time in releasing Conan on him .
“ I was n’t going to let him kill me , so my dog took care of him , ” he remembers .
“ I sicced my dog on that guy , man , and beat the other one up myself .
I had no choice . ”
A backyard breeder , Tyler Eison keeps all of his dogs in kennels in the yard , and sells off the less aggressive pups from his litters for thousands of dollars .
In total he has 4 dogs that live in separate kennels behind his home ( separate because they are all extremely dog aggressive ) – 3 Pits and 1 Cane Corso , in addition to 3 dogs that live at a friend ’s house .
He is the only one who is capable of handling his dogs , and he has found himself late to many business engagements and meetings because of the time commitments to his dogs .
Through inbreeding — called linebreeding —
Eison will isolate the traits he seeks , eventually mating the best female of this first litter with her father ; leading to a greater chance for instability and genetic defects .
I really do not even know where to begin with expressing my disgust , sadness , and ill - will toward this man .
He is the reason why breed specific bans are a false sense of security for all of the “ Pit Bull Haters ” of this earth ; the epitome of irresponsible ownership .
It is not the Pitbulls that are the problem , it is the irresponsible scum , like this ignorant backyard breeder , that need to be banned .
Tyler Eison is using these dogs as living , breathing , feeling weapons , taking all of the wonderful qualities of the breed and morphing them into his own security system .
It is a cowardly act indeed to create vicious dogs to make up for some sort of toughness complex within yourself .
It is fascinating to me that someone would be willing to be portrayed in an article showing them in such a negative light , basically glorifying their criminal activities and attempting to justify their mistreatment of animals .
Anyone that says , “ it would be embarrassing to be seen with a neutered dog ” , should have their own reproductive organs removed – surgically , with no anesthesia ; this is despicable .
I would even go so far as to say that people like this should be banned from being able to take care of any living being .
I am just going to keep treading water by spreading the “ good word ” of these dogs if people like Eison are able to proliferate their beliefs and infect the public with aggressive , improperly trained dogs with poor temperaments .
The key to solving this problem is to get to the root of the problem .
Neighbors witnessing this sort of behavior , and family members of people like Eison , need to stand up and do what is right .
Forget your childhood , forget what you have seen or heard , rise above your upbringing and realize that no dog deserves this type of life , and no dog is inherently vicious ( as Eison ’s article points out ) .
The Pit Bulls are not the problem here , it is the people that need to be rehabilitated .
So keep on believing in the false sense of security that Breed Specific Legislation offers , but until a fundamental change can be made amongst people who share the same views as Eison , dogs are going to continue to be abused , and act out because of their inhumane treatment , even after the Pit Bulls are long gone .
The latest fake scandal fit the usual pattern as an awkwardly phrased remark , lifted out of context and willfully misinterpreted , exploded across the airwaves .
What General Clark actually said was that Mr. McCain ’s war service , though heroic , did n’t necessarily constitute a qualification for the presidency .
It was a blunt but truthful remark , and not at all outrageous — especially given the fact that General Clark is himself a bona fide war hero .
Yet the Clark affair did reveal something important — not about General Clark , but about Mr. McCain .
Now we know what a McCain administration would represent : namely , a third term for Karl Rove .
It was predictable that the McCain campaign would go wild over the Clark remarks .
Mr. McCain ’s run for the White House has always been based on persona rather than policy : he does n’t have ideas that voters agree with , but he does have an inspiring life story — which , contrary to the myth of the modest maverick , he talks about all the time .
The suggestion that this life story is n’t relevant to his quest for office was bound to provoke a violent reaction .
But the McCain campaign went beyond condemning General Clark ’s remarks ; it went out of its way to distort them .
“ This backhanded slap against John as not being a worthy warrior because he just got shot down is one of the more surprising insults in my military history , ” said retired Col .
Bud Day , who participated in a conference call organized by the campaign .
In fact , General Clark had said no such thing .
The irony , not lost on Democrats , is that Col .
Day himself has done what he falsely accused Wesley Clark of doing : he appeared in the 2004 Swift boat ads that impugned John Kerry ’s wartime service .
The willingness of the McCain campaign to engage in these tactics , employing such tainted spokesmen , tells us that the campaign has decided to go negative — specifically , to apply the strategy Karl Rove used so effectively in 2002 and 2004 ( but not so effectively in 2006 ) , that of portraying Democrats as unpatriotic .
And sure enough , Adam Nagourney of The New York Times reports signs of the “ increasing influence of veterans of Mr. Rove ’s shop in the McCain operation . ”
Will Rovian tactics work this year ?
Sounds overly dramatic , you say ?
Well , if you consider how effective Rove 's techniques have been in jerking the chain of American voters , it 's not a far - fetched argument at all that Karl Rove has been setting the agenda for the last eight years .
Today Paul Krugman points out that electing John McCain means allowing Rove to do it yet again : The despicable Joe Scarborough and the equally despicable Andrea Mitchell , both of whom ought to know better , are doing the best to ensure that these tactics DO work again this year .
The question is whether the voters are going to believe their own eyes and their own experience , or the probe into the mean , small part of the human brain that Rove keeps poking with a sharp stick .

In Latin America , if we exclude Cuba , we can point to three general categories of governments .
First , the governments of the right , the allies of Washington , that play an active role in the region and occupy a strategic position : these are the governments of Álvaro Uribe in Colombia , Alan García in Peru and Felipe Calderón in México .
Second , we find supposed “ left ” governments that implement a neoliberal policy and support the national or regional bourgeoisies in their projects : Brazil , Uruguay , Chile , Nicaragua and the government of Cristina Fernandez Kirchner , from Argentina ’s Peronists .
They are governments that implement a neoliberal policy that favour grand capital , covered up with some social assistance measures .
In effect , they make it a bit easier to swallow the neoliberal pill by applying social programs .
For example , in Brazil poor families receive a bit of help from the government , which assures them popular support in the poorest region of the country .
Some of these governments are attempting to improve their relations with Washington , especially with the establishment of free trade agreements with the United States .
Chile signed one and Lula , in Brazil , is also seeking an agreement with Washington around a series of political issues .
But at the same time great differences of opinion persist between the government of Lula and the United States .
These differences include defence of the interests of the Brazilian bourgeoisie in agriculture and a series of industrial sectors , especially those that export , who do not accept the protectionism of the United States .
In the third category of countries we find Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador , which are confronted by the active opposition of important sectors of the local capitalist class and Washington .
Cuba is , by itself , a fourth category .
The importance of popular mobilisations ...
Regarding the countries that make up the third category -- Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador -- we have to point out that we can only understand the politics of these countries if we take into consideration the powerful popular mobilisations that have marked recent history .
In Ecuador , four right - wing presidents were sent home between 1997 and 2005 thanks to the mass mobilisations of the population .
In Bolivia , important struggles emerged against the privatisation of water in April 2000 and towards the end of 2004 .
The mobilisations around the issue of gas , in October 2003 , overthrew and forced then president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada to flee ( to the United States ) .
Venezuela , since 1989 , has seen important mobilisations that inaugurated the mass social struggles against the International Monetary Fund that spread across the globe through the 1990s .
Even more spectacular were the enormous popular mobilisations of April 12 , 2002 , spontaneous manifestations against the coup attempt to overthrow Hugo Chávez .
These mobilisations directly achieved the return of Hugo Chávez to the presidential palace of Miraflores on April 13 , 2002 .
These mass popular mobilisations are a decisive factor in the existence and survival of the governments of Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador .
... and the democratic adoption of new constitutions
The second important point is the revision of the constitution .
In Venezuela in 1999 , during Hugo Chávez 's first term , a new democratic constitution ( drafted up by a constituent assembly ) was adopted by referendum .
This constitution , which continues to be in force , has guaranteed more cultural , economic and social rights to the majority of the Venezuelan population .
Furthermore , the actual constitution established a democratic mechanism that allows the recall of all those in elected posts at all levels ( including the president of the republic ) halfway through their term .
The adoption of a new constitution in Venezuela , subsequently inspired the governments of Bolivia and Ecuador .
Bolivia adopted a new constitution in 2007 , and in Ecuador , the Constituent Assembly elected in September 2007 , is drafting a new constitution which will be submitted to a referendum in September 2008 .
These are effectively profound reforms !
These democratic political changes being implemented in these three countries have not only been systematically been silenced in the mass media of the most industrialised countries and in others , but furthermore the media has orchestrated a constant campaign of attacks with the aim of presenting the heads of states of the three countries as repulsive populist and authoritarian leaders .
The experiences of these three Andean countries , regarding the adoption of new constitutions , are very rich .
They should be an inspiration for the peoples and political forces of other countries .
We only have to compare the situation of Europe , with the absence of any democratic procedure for the approval of the constitutional treaty .
Contradictions
Of course , the experiences underway in Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador also have contradictions and important limitations that should be analysed .
In Ecuador , the reform process underway is mobilising broad social sectors .
The current president , Rafael Correa , was elected at the end of 2006 , by a large majority , without having a political party or parliamentarians behind him .
Despite the strong opposition from the right and all the mass media – in Ecuador there is no public state television or radio station – Correa won the referendum to convoke a Constituent Assembly with 82 % of the vote .
This political movement , which Correa had constructed along the way through 2007 , achieved more than 70 % of the vote in the elections for the Constituent Assembly .
If we add on top of this his allies , he has the advantage of a majority of more than 80 % .
At the moment in Ecuador , the social movements are permanently invited to the Constituent Assembly , with the aim of better taking into consideration their proposals .
In this way , the new constitution can be elaborated by a broad majority of the population .
Therefore it is a very open and very interesting process .
We will know the definitive results by the end of July , when the Constituent Assembly has adopted the project of the new constitution in order to afterwards submit it to a referendum at the end of September .
It is probable that the text that will be presented to voters could be criticised over diverse aspects ( the absence of right to abortion or the absence of prohibition on genetically modified organisms , for example ) .
In Bolivia , the process of revision is being carried out in the midst of a much more conflict .
The party of President Evo Morales , the Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) , clearly won a simple majority in the Constituent Assembly ( 55 % ) , but did not have an absolute majority of two - thirds .
This complicates the situation .
Finally , the new constitution was adopted in December 2007 despite the obstructions , sometimes violent , placed by the right and the dominant classes .
As a consequence , the situation is extremely polarised , given the very aggressive mobilisation by reactionary sectors .
The right moved into action with a racist campaign and the threat of a territorial separation of the eastern part of the country , where they control the situation .
This reactionary revolt has been able to halt , until now , the holding of the referendum over the new constitution .
The return to public control of natural resources
A third important point : the governments of Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador have taken measures to strengthen the public sector and gain control of their natural resources .
In Venezuela , the state took control of the large oil company , PDVSA , that although publicly owned favoured private interests and declared the majority of its profits in the United States .
It was a very hard battle .
The capitalist class organised a coup in April 2002 , followed by a shutdown that paralysed the company in December 2002 and January 2003 .
Venezuela ’s gross domestic product sunk in the first months of 2003 , but the government finally regained control of the situation with the support of the majority of the people .
Last year , the Venezuelan state also took control of an important oilfield , the Faja de Orinoco .
In Venezuela , the state produces two - thirds of petroleum , and a third is by the large petroleum companies .
However , currently the petroleum is exploited in the framework of the new negotiated contracts in which the state collects more rent than previously .
We have to add other nationalisations : the production and distribution of electricity , telecommunications ( CANTV ) , a steel factory ( SIDOR , which has 15,000 workers ) , the cement sector and some companies involved in food production .
Not to forget the agrarian reform , aimed at handing land to those who work it .
Bolivia nationalised oil and the production of gas in 2006 .
Evo Morales sent the army to take control of the oilfields , but the multinationals continue to be active there , given it is they which extract the oil and gas .
Clearly , the state is the property owner of natural wealth , but it is the large multinationals that exploit the petroleum and gas .
Strategic agreements
Here is the strategic importance of the agreements between Venezuela and Bolivia , which would allow Bolivia to strengthen a public petroleum company to extract and refine oil and gas .
Bolivia does not have a refinery ; the ones that Ecuador have are not sufficient .
Bolivia and Ecuador export petroleum and import fuel and other refined products .
Here as well , we can see the importance of the strategic agreements between Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia to strengthen the autonomy of the latter two .
What Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador have in common with the second category of countries ( Brazil , Uruguay , Chile , Argentina ) is a determined policy of social assistance programs .
It is not about purely and simply rejecting these measures , but it is totally necessary to promote the creation of jobs , sharply increase wages and guarantee more social and economic rights for workers , peasants , artisans , petty traders , pensioners and other social sectors .
Venezuela and Bolivia have advanced in this direction but there is still much to be done .
Ecuador : Will Correa suspend the payment of part of the debt ?
Ecuador launched an important initiative regarding its public debt .
Rafael Correa created , in July 2007 , the Integral Auditing Commission of the internal and external public debt ( CAIC ) .
It is a commission of 12 members from the social movements and NGOs in Ecuador , six members from international campaigns for the cancellation of the Third World debt ( I am part of the commission as the representative of Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt , CADTM ) and four representatives of the state ( the ministry of finance , the Accounts Tribunal , the anti-corruption commission and the general treasury ) .
What is interesting is that there is no talk about representatives of civil society ( which includes bosses ’ associations , for example ) , but rather delegates from social movements such as the Indigenous movement ( CONAIE , Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador ) and other radical social movements in Ecuador .
Correa ’s idea , and that of a sectors of his government , is to avoid repayment of a large part of the public debt .
If Correa achieves his goal , it would signify a direct confrontation with his own national bourgeoisie , because it is the Ecuadorian bourgeoisie which gains the most from the repayment of the bulk of the public debt .
It would also signify a confrontation with international financial markets and with the World Bank .
The rightwing of the government and the large financial groups , not to say the World Bank and the governments of most industrialised countries , are exercising strong pressure in order to convince Correa to do nothing .
He should make a decision by the middle of July 2008 , when the CAIC hands over its report .
There is nothing certain about it , and there is the possibility that Correa could decide to avoid this confrontation .
The strategy of the United States and the local capitalists : confrontation and separation
The strategy of the United States and the local capitalist class is clearly orientated towards confrontation : the coup against Chavez in 2002 , the Venezuelan bosses ’ lockout in December 2002 and January 2003 , and the campaigns by the mass media in Bolivia , Ecuador and Venezuela against the government .
But the fundamental issue is a new strategy of dividing up country .
The capitalist class of Bolivia is organising the eastern part of the country to split off .
What the mass media calls la media luna ( the half moon ) , with Santa Cruz as the prinicpal economic centre .
The large landowners and the owners of exportcompanies ( particularly of transgenic soya ) are inciting the population to declare independence in defiance of the national state .
They habitually resort to racist actions .
We have to affirm , without ambiguities , that the population of this rich region does not constitute a nation that would have the right to national self - determination .
The government responded to the right by saying it is willing to concede more autonomy to the regions but not separation , and in this case they have reason on their side .
In Ecuador , the economic centre is found in Guayaquil , on the Pacific coast , while Quito – which is also important in economic terms – is the political capital , situated 2800 metres above sea level in the Andean ranges .
The capitalist class of Guayaquil wants to declare its independence under the leadership of its rightist mayor .
In Venezuela , the governor of the western state of Zulia ( which borders Colombia ) has been brandishing the threat of separation .
All of this constitutes , without a doubt , a premeditated continental strategy of Washington that aims to support the local bourgeoisies in a process of breaking up countries that are passing through left experiences .
Reminiscent of Katanga
It is reminiscent of the policy of Belgium , the United States and other powers with respect to the province of Katanga , in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Let us recall that the Western capitals supported the separatism of Katanga against the Congo ’s Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba .
When the pro-West dictator Mobuto took power ( after the assassination of Lumumba , who was taken by force to Katanga and handed over to his worst enemies ) , the great powers stopped supporting the separatists .
I think it is an important issue because some on the left consider these divisions of countries as an irrefutable expression of the right of peoples to self - determination .
In the Bolivian case , it is clearly the reaction of the local capitalist class against the rights of the Indigenous majority of the nation .
As if it was n’t enough , they utilise racist and reactionary language .
The mayor of Santa Cruz , Percy Fernández , commenting on the adoption of the project of the new constitution by the Constituent Assembly , declared on December 9 , 2007 , that : `` In this country , soon it will be necessary to pain oneself and wear feathers in order to exist ! ’’
Since then , his supporters have organised attacks against the Indigenous people who , we should recall , constitute the majority of the population of the country and who for centuries have been victims of domination at the hands of Europe and its descendents .
Multinationals attack
The strategy of Washington and certain European capitals includes moreover another aspect .
The conflict between the multinational ExxonMobil and Venezuela ’s state oil company PDVSA , the disagreement between Occidental Petroleum of the United States and PetroEcuador , a public company in Ecuador , the disagreement between Telecom Italia and Bolivia , etc .
The large multinationals ( without forgetting Petrobras from Brazil ) oppose the decisions of the three leftwing governments to restore public control over natural resources .
These multinationals have utilised the tribunal of the World Bank ( CIADI ) to resolve disagreements concerning investments .
They have also resorted to tribunals dealing with trade issues , in London , Amsterdam or New York .
There exists the risk that in the next few months a conflict could explode over a contract between two Latin American countries : the president - elect of Paraguay , Fernando Lugo , who will be inaugurated in August 2008 , declared that he would revise the one - sided contract imposed by Brazil on this country when both lived under military dictatorships ( the contract over Itaipú , which dates back to 1973 ) .
Effectively , while the price of energy is sharply rising , Brazil pays a ridiculously low price for electricity produced in Paraguay .
Paraguay and Brazil have completely different economic weights and Paraguay has good reason to demand the revision of the contract or its termination .
These types of conflict situations demonstrate the necessity for Latin American countries to pull out of CIADI , as Bolivia did , and create a Latin American organisation for resolving litigation between states and multinationals ( from the North or South ) , or between Latin American states .
Of course , in this last scenario , it is necessary to first seek a bilateral agreement before resorting to a multilateral solution .
Trade agreements between peoples
In opposition to the free trade agreements that some Latin American countries have signed with the United States and the European Union , it is worth highlighting the new agreements that have been signed between the governments of Venezuela , Bolivia and Cuba .
We have to cite , for example , the 20,000 Cuban doctors who voluntarily work in Venezuela to provide free health care , predominately in the poor barrios , and the 40,000 operations for cataracts and other eye problems which Venezuelan citizens benefit from for free in Cuban hospitals .
In exchange , principally in the form of barter , Venezuela provides oil to Cuba .
The same types of agreements exist between Venezuela and Bolivia .
In conclusion , the experiences underway in these countries are very different to the caricatures and negative images that the majority of the mass media presents .
The processes underway are complex and sometimes contradictory ; retreats are possible , even probable .
Perhaps the governments will not be able to go sufficiently far enough in their political and social transformations in favour of the people .
The destabilisation orchestrated by the local dominant classes and Washington could slow the processes .
With Colombia ’s aggression against Ecuador in March 2008 , it is clear that Bogotá and Washington are willing to utilise the guns of war against the regimes in Quito and Caracas .
One aspect to highlight , which we have not been able to analyse in this article , is the weakness of the producers ’ control over the entire production process ( what is traditionally called in the workers ’ movements , workers ’ control and self - management ) .

McCain got a wee bit defensive today when questioned as to why he left the country for three days when we have our own pressing problems .
From ABC ’s Political Punch :
Before Robin Roberts could ask a question , McCain said this :
“ May I just say , I ’m here for one day , I ’m in Mexico the next day , then I ’m back home — also drugs is a big , big problem in America , the continued flow of drugs from Colombia through Mexico into the United States is still one of our major challenges to all America . ”
“ I ’ve been here many times , I ’ve been here several times in the past , as well as with Mexico , and I think that it deserves our attention , ” McCain added .
When Roberts asked why he was in Colombia when the economy is foremost in voters ’ minds , this was McCain ’s response :
“ Well , I ’d be glad to repeat myself , ” he said .
“ There is clearly a continued threat of drugs pouring into the United States of America , which can harm us and our young people very badly .
I ’m happy to say that there has been some success .
The cost of cocaine on the street is up . ”
Not to belittle the nation ’s drug plague — but in between the bird chirps , I think 1984 just called , asking for its candidate back .
Maybe this is huge with conservative voters and I ’m missing something , but I had Nancy Reagan flashbacks .
With the economy teetering , $ 80 SUV fill - ups , and two real wars , this is what McCain has chosen to spotlight in a foreign trip , four months before Election Day ?
Just judging from the polls — should n’t he be a little more concerned with the price of gas than the price of cocaine ?
Plants could act as safe , speedy factories for growing antibodies for personalized treatments against a common form of cancer , according to new findings from the Stanford University School of Medicine .
The findings came in the first human tests of an injectable vaccine grown in genetically engineered plants .
The treatments , which would vaccinate cancer patients against their malignant cells , could lead to earlier personalized therapy to tackle follicular B - cell lymphoma , an immune - system malignancy diagnosed in about 16,000 people each year .
Doctors regard follicular B - cell lymphoma as a chronic , incurable disease .
The standard treatment , chemotherapy , has such severe side effects that patients often opt for watchful waiting in the early stages of illness .
However , plant - grown vaccines , which lack side effects , could allow earlier , more aggressive management of the cancer .
" This would be a way to treat cancer without side effects , " said Ronald Levy , MD , professor of oncology and the Robert K. and Helen K. Summy Professor in the School of Medicine , who is the study 's senior author .
" The idea is to marshal the body 's own immune system to fight cancer . "
The findings will appear July 21 in the advance online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study was a phase - 1 trial that showed plant - grown cancer vaccines were safe for patients and could be produced quickly and cheaply .
Sixteen newly diagnosed lymphoma patients received the treatment ; none experienced any side effects from plant - grown vaccines .
Future studies will test the vaccine 's effectiveness .
The cancer vaccines rely on a biological quirk of follicular B - cell lymphoma , which is a type of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
The cancer starts when a single immune cell multiplies uncontrollably , producing many identical clones of itself .
The clones all carry the same antibody on their exterior , a marker that is unique to the cancer and is not found on any of the body 's healthy cells .
Levy 's vaccination strategy is to inject many copies of the cancer - specific antibody into a newly diagnosed lymphoma patient , stimulating the patient 's immune system to seek and destroy malignant cells .
Previous trials of this kind of vaccine , produced in animal cells and tested in mice and humans , have had mixed success , and the vaccines are not yet commercially available .
Growing cancer vaccines in plants could circumvent some of the hurdles to turning the concept into a real treatment , Levy said .
Because each person 's cancer antibody is unique , every patient needs a personalized vaccine .
Growing personalized vaccines in animal cells takes months , costs thousands of dollars per patient and comes with the theoretical risk that a patient might inadvertently be infected with an animal virus that contaminated the cells used to grow the vaccine .
Personalized vaccines could also be produced with genetically engineered bacteria , but bacteria - grown vaccines are n't ideal , either .
" The plant system has some advantages , " said Levy , who is also a member of the Stanford Cancer Center and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator .
The researchers chose tobacco plants that were genetically engineered to reproduce quantities of the vaccine .
To make a tobacco plant churn out a human antibody , scientists isolate the antibody from the patient 's tumor and put the antibody gene into a modified version of the tobacco mosaic virus .
They infect a tobacco plant with the gene - carrying virus by scratching the virus on its leaves .
The virus takes the gene into the plant 's cells , which then churn out lots of antibody .
After a few days , technicians snip off the plant 's leaves , grind them up and purify the antibody .
Only a few plants are needed to make enough vaccine for each patient .
" The new manufacturing system allows very rapid production of a vaccine , " said Charles Arntzen , PhD , a professor of plant biology at the Arizona Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University , who was not involved in the research .
" I think without the speed , it would be hard to convince a cancer patient to wait for a vaccine to be developed , rather than going on some other therapy . "
" It 's pretty cool technology , " Levy said .
" And it 's really ironic that you would make a treatment for cancer out of tobacco .
That appealed to me . "
None of the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes end up in the purified vaccines .
Not only is the technology fast , cheap and safe , but Levy said there 's reason to expect that the plant - grown antibodies will generate a stronger immune response than those made in animal cells .
Both plant and animal cells attach sugars to antibodies and other proteins during biochemical processing , but the plant and animal sugars are different .
The difference might prompt a more robust immune response to plant - grown antibodies , Levy said .
The next research step is a phase - 2 clinical trial to test the effectiveness of plant - grown vaccines in a larger group of lymphoma patients , Levy said .
He 's optimistic , adding , " We know that if you get the immune system revved up , it can attack and kill cancer . "

A former military officer who served as chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell on Wednesday said Vice President Dick Cheney probably knew the U.S. military was using torture on Iraqi detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and at prisons in Iraq .
Col. Lawrence B. Wilkerson ’s testimony before a House panel followed revelations this week that detainees were subjected to beatings and other aggressive interrogation techniques with the authorization of government attorneys .
“ At what level did American leadership fail ? ” Col.
Wilkerson said during a hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution , civil rights and civil liberties .
“ I believe it failed at the highest levels of the Pentagon , in the Vice President ’s Office and perhaps even in the Oval Office . ”
Painful interrogation techniques were apparently authorized in a Feb. 7 , 2002 , order signed by President Bush that also said al Qaeda and Taliban detainees were not to be considered prisoners of war .
The order was based on a legal memo from the White House counsel ’s office .
Prisoner - of - war status is supposed to protect captives from torture under the Geneva Conventions .
After they received the president ’s order , Pentagon officials compiled a list of interrogation techniques that later were used on detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison , Guantanamo and elsewhere , according to documents released by the Senate Armed Services Committee this week .
The documents state that CIA agents contributed to the plan to use the aggressive interrogation techniques .
During an Oct. 2 , 2002 , meeting with military and intelligence officials at Guantanamo , the documents state that CIA counterterrorism lawyer Jonathan Fredman said torture “ is basically subject to perception . ”
He also reportedly said , “ If the detainee dies , you ’re doing it wrong . ”
Col .
Wilkerson said , “ The president may have been ignorant of the worst parts of the failure . ”
Douglas Feith , one of the government attorneys suspected of contributing legal advice for the Defense Department ’s authorization of aggressive interrogation techniques , had notified the committee he would not appear at the hearing Wednesday .
Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , said Mr. Feith , a former undersecretary of defense for policy , would be compelled to testify later .
“ Mr. Feith ’s unwillingness to attend voluntarily and provide the truth about this government ’s actions shows a fundamental disrespect for Congress and the American people , ” Mr. Nadler said .
He also said the military ’s use of so - called waterboarding , beatings and putting prisoners in painful “ stress positions ” appears to be “ more widespread and the legal justifications more flimsy than have been initially reported .
Evidence also appears to be mounting that officials at the highest levels of this administration may have been directly involved to a far greater extent and far earlier in the process than had been previously represented to Congress and to the American people . ”
Waterboarding refers to putting a cloth over a restrained person ’s mouth and nose , then pouring water over them to give them the sensation of drowning .
Daniel Levin , former acting assistant attorney general , testified that he contributed legal advice on torture to the Bush administration , but that he told high - level officials that it was unjustified under international law .

The McCain campaign has sharply criticized Barack Obama ’s decision to become the first general election presidential candidate since the 1970s to opt out of the public financing system , a decision Obama can afford because of his stunning success with hundreds of thousands of low - dollar donors .
As David notes at the link above , the McCain campaign said Obama ’s decision “ undermines his call for a new type of politics . ”
But McCain , a longtime foe of Big Money in politics , once had a friendlier view of presidential fundraisers like Obama .
Here he is on the Fox News show “ On the Record , ” in January 2004 :
“ I think it ’s wonderful that Howard Dean was able to use the Internet , $ 50 , $ 75 , $ 100 contributions .
That ’s what we want it to be all about .
We want average citizens to contribute small amounts of money , and that ’s a commitment to a campaign .
So I ’m for that .
I think it ’s a great thing .
I think the Internet is going to change American politics for the better . ”
And here he is on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball , ” in June 2004 :
The father who had to pick which of his twins to save when their canoe capsized
A grieving father told yesterday how he was forced to make a ' life and death ' decision over which of his children to save when a family canoe trip turned to tragedy .
TV presenter Ian Clayton 's daughter Billie , nine , died after their canoe capsized , throwing them into fast - flowing water , along with Billie 's twin brother Edward .
Yesterday Mr Clayton , 48 , spoke through tears as he told how he had been told by his son to save Billie first .
He desperately tried to lift the canoe clear but could n't see Billie and was only able to grab Edward .
Victim : Billie Clayton , nine , who died in the tragic canoeing accident
Buoyed by their lifejackets , Mr Clayton and his son were carried away by the strong current of the River Wye in Powys , Wales .
Yesterday he told an inquest into Billie 's death : ' When I got to Edward up the river that day , he said , " Save my sister first . "
It 's hard to understand what was going through that little lad 's mind for him to say that .'
Mr Clayton , who presents My Yorkshire for ITV 's local output , went on to explain the agonising decision he was forced to make .
He said : ' It was a challenge for me .
What twin to go for ?
' Sometimes I dream that I saved Billie instead .
I will never know if I made the right decision .
' Should I go for the one I can see and hope that later I can find the one I can't see ?
In the end I went for the one I could see . '
He then told how he got his son , who was clinging on to an overhanging branch , out of the water , saying : ' It looked like he was bodysurfing because of the power of the water .
I pulled him up and he nearly strangled me because he was holding on so tight .
TV presenter Ian Clayton was forced to make a life and death choice between his children
' I kept saying , " You are going to be OK " , but he kept saying , " You are not going to let me die , are you Daddy ? "
The pair were met by an ambulance crew when they reached the river bank , as Mr Clayton had earlier called the canoe company and told them to dial for help .
However , a 999 operator warned him not to risk his life by jumping back in to save Billie .
' I was frightened to jump back in there , ' he said .
' I will admit it .
I 'm not sure if I would have if that woman had n't told me not to . '
He added : ' The next time I saw ( Billie ) was in the operating theatre in the hospital .
' It is such a tragedy and people say that tragedy gets better with time .
But it does n't .
The pain is still the same today , two years and two months after . '
Coroner Peter Maddox stated that there was ' serious cause for concern ' about the way canoes were rented to novices in the UK .
He said : ' There seems to be a potentially large hole in which the very inexperienced may fall . '
The trio , who were on holiday from their home in Featherstone , Yorkshire , had left the children 's mother , Heather Parkinson , behind in nearby Hay - on - Wye on April 12 2006 .
But they took a wrong turn and , as they tried to turn the canoe , a surge of water flipped it over .
Holding up a photo of his daughter yesterday , Mr Clayton said : ' I want people to remember who we are talking about .
This is Billie when she was eight and it is her last school photograph .
' Most people who look at it say , " What a beautiful girl . "
She was a delight - an absolute delight . '
The hearing , which is expected to last three days , continues .
Scientists are working on adapting the software to react to crowd noise CCTV cameras which use artificial intelligence software are being developed to " hear " sounds like windows smashing , researchers have revealed .
University of Portsmouth scientists are working on adapting the software so it can also react to crowd noise .
Crimes would be captured on camera faster and response times improved .
The news comes after the BBC learned councils in southern England routinely used powers brought in to fight terrorism and crime to spy on people .
Figures obtained by BBC South showed the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) was used more than 750 times by the councils in 2007 / 08 .
If in a car park someone smashes a window , the camera would turn to look at them and the camera operator would be alerted
Dr David Brown
The new three - year surveillance study is being funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) .
The existing software is sophisticated enough to identify minor visual cues such as whether a car aerial is up or more complex activity such as violent behaviour , researchers said .
Dr David Brown , from the University of Portsmouth , said : " The visual - recognition software will be able to identify visual patterns but for the next stage we want to get the camera to pivot if it hears a certain type of sound .
" So , if in a car park someone smashes a window , the camera would turn to look at them and the camera operator would be alerted .
' Read ' profiles
" The longer artificial intelligence is in the software the more it learns . "
He added : " Later versions will get cleverer as time goes on , perhaps eventually being able to identify specific words being said or violent sounds .
" In identifying sound we are looking for the shapes of sound .
" In the same way , if you close your eyes , you can trace the shape of a physical object and ' read ' its profile with your hand , we are developing shapes of sound so the software recognises them . "
By the end of the study , the researchers hope to have generated algorithms - a mathematical formula for solving problems - that can be used inside existing CCTV software .
Then each successive generation of algorithms would become more sophisticated as they " learn " what they are looking and listening out for .

What are these ?
A tagua nut sure has a lot of names .
Like The Rain Forest Ivory or Vegetable Ivory .
Other titles are Corozo ( also spelled Corrozzo ) , Binroji Nut ( Japanese ) , Steinnuss ( German ) , and Coquilla Nut .
A tagua nut is the fruit of a palm tree , primarily Phytelephas macrocarpa , which flourishes in tropical rain forests from Paraguay to Panama .
Natives replant palm trees for their seeds instead of logging them , which saves a bit of the rain forests .
They polish the shell of the seeds and typically carve them into the shape of a button , living creature , or beautiful jewelry .
Just think : an object much like a gem with all the qualities of ivory , but without harming wildlife .
Where tagua nuts grow high up in South American palms , there are about 40 shelled seeds to a cluster , called a cabeza .
Harvesting them appears totally harmless to trees and forests .
Some businesses customize tagua nuts by company contracts .
Being a fraction of the cost of ivory , it ’s not a hard sell .
Tagua vendors can toot their horn for indirectly saving elephants , whales , walrus and other species .
Humans are so fortunate to have a natural , organic , resourceful product in plentiful supply .
There are other interesting facts about tagua nuts .
Twenty percent of all buttons were made of tagua nuts in the 1920’s .
Ecuador continues to offer tagua buttons and enjoys a thriving tagua jewelry market too .
Stephanie Schiff is the owner of Ecobutterfly in Los Angeles .
She offers buttons and beads made from tagua nuts .
Check out her bamboo , sustainable wood and recycled glass items as well .
“ Like all creations made from a corozo or tagua nut , each button is a little different from the next , ” says Stephanie .
“ When it comes to color shading , the nut has swirl patterning that makes colors more varied and interesting .
That especially makes these buttons so beautiful and unique . ”
Be sure to stay tuned for more interesting facts about tagua .
How they are naturally processed and colored is fascinating .
Bring on your comments and queries .
No matter what you call this lovely ivory - something , designers have good reason to go nuts and save a little rainforest with tagua !

Rogue archivist Carl Malamud sez ,
The State of Oregon is sending out cease and desist letters to sites like Justia and Public .
Resource .
Org that have been posting copies of Oregon laws , known as the Oregon Revised Statutes .
We 've sent Oregon back two letters .
The first reviews the law and explains to the Legislative Counsel why their assertion of copyright over the state statutes is particularly weak , from both a common law perspective and from their own enabling legislation .
The position of the Legislative Counsel is that their public access obligations have been fulfilled by their web site .
However , their web site has over 500,000 HTML errors , does not meet Section 508 accessibility requirements , has no metadata , as our second letter points out .
Particularly galling is the fact that Thomson
West has also made a copy of these statutes and has done so without a commercial license , but the Legislative Counsel explicitly told Tim Stanley of Justia that they were n't going to send cease and desist letters to West .
Evidently , it is much easier to pick on the little guys .
Oregon is not unique in asserting copyright over state law , but they are definitely one of the more aggressive in this kind of FUD campaign .
Justia and Public .

Questions
Start by introducing yourself to your Genius .
" I'm from the DRM elimination crew at DefectiveByDesign.org -- I 'd like to ask you a few questions about the defects Apple has designed into the iPhone 3G . "
Why do all developers have to submit their applications to Apple before they can be loaded onto an iPhone ?
Most smartphones , including those by OpenMoko , Nokia , RIM , Palm and even Microsoft , allow applications to come from a variety of sources , including free software developers .
Free " as in freedom " software development requires that users and developers be able to share and modify the source code for programs they use .
i Phone users are not permitted by Apple to share or load modified versions of programs distributed through the App Store -- even when a program 's developer wants users to be able to do this !
Apple markets itself as empowering , alternative technology -- How does Apple plan to support free software development ?
Why does iTunes still contain so much DRM - laden music ?
Services like Amazon , eMusic , Napster , Rhapsody , Play.com and 7digital are all selling music without DRM .
A typical response to this might be that Apple has no option to sell media without DRM , but this is simply untrue .
Jobs is the largest individual shareholder at Disney , and he could insist that its films be DRM - free .
Apple should be leading the way to promote DRM - free music , but instead is lagging behind .
What is Apple doing to fix this ?
If it really is the RIAA 's fault , can you tell me specifically what the RIAA said to Jobs when he asked for the ability to sell DRM - free music ?
The iPhone 3G has GPS support .
How can users be sure that the GPS cannot be used to track their position , without their permission ?
When the only thing preventing the GPS from being used is software , and the software in question is known only to Apple , why should iPhone users trust Apple ?
There is a privacy agreement , but how would I ever know that the agreement was violated ?
In ' Thoughts on Music ' , Steve Jobs said , " it is useful to remember that all iPods play music that is free of any DRM and encoded in ' open ' licensable formats such as MP3 and AAC " .
If Jobs really wants to see open formats , why does n't the iPhone play Ogg Vorbis , Ogg Theora video and FLAC ?
These formats require no licensing costs , and are not encumbered by patents .
How does Apple plan to support these formats in the future ?
Will Apple approve applications for the App Store that support these formats ?
Last question .
Why can the iPhone 3G only be activated by Apple and AT&T ?
In the United States , the Register of Copyrights has ruled that consumers have the right to unlock their phones and switch to a different carrier .
How does Apple plan to remedy this discrepancy ?
Next steps
Give your Genius their score , your contact information ( if you want ) and your handout , along with any additional feedback you have about the defects in iPhone 3G .
Thank them for their time , and quickly and politely leave the store .
Outside the store , distribute some of the flyers and spend some time talking to people about these issues .
Let us know how it went by sending an email to info@defectivebydesign.org with your Genius 's information , score , and your comments .

After her Supreme Court argument in the Medtronic case , Zieve told me she was n’t sure what to expect .
Until the arrival of Chief Justice Roberts , groups like Public Citizen had found that they had a better chance of winning pre-emption cases before the Supreme Court than in the lower courts .
But during the first two years of the Roberts Court , the justices had decided two pre-emption cases in favor of the corporate defendants .
The trend has continued .
On Feb. 21 , the Supreme Court handed Zieve a crushing defeat : an 8 - 1 opinion immunizing the makers of defective medical devices from product - liability suits .
The lone dissent was written by Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who objected that Congress could not have intended such a “ radical curtailment ” of state personal - injury suits when it regulated medical devices in 1976 .
Ginsburg , who is devoted to liberal judicial restraint , has consistently opposed efforts to second - guess punitive - damage awards or expand federal pre-emption .
I called Zieve soon after the Supreme Court issued its opinion , and she sounded shocked .
“ It ’s really unfathomable to me , ” she said .
“ I was n’t sure that this was a business - friendly court , but now I ’m finding it harder not to view it that way . ”
Zieve said that , as a result of the decision , “ I think the industry will keep unsafe devices on the market longer and be slower to improve products . ”
In the eyes of advocates like Zieve and Public Citizen , the public is now caught in a Catch - 22 : at the very moment that agencies like the F.D.A. are being strongly reproved by critics  including the agency ’s own internal science board  for being unwilling or unable to protect public health , the court is making it harder for people to receive compensation for the injuries that result .
On rare occasions , the Roberts Court has held that the Bush administration ’s deregulatory efforts circumvent the will of Congress  like the 5 - 4 decision last year holding that the Environmental Protection Agency acted capriciously when it adopted a rule that said it had no legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases .
But by and large , the Supreme Court defers to agencies that refuse to regulate public health and safety .
“ The industry has a lot of money , and they can routinely hire the biggest names in the biggest firms , while we ’re doing it on our own , ” Zieve told me .
“ We do n’t charge anything  we ’re free .
It did n’t cost $ 250,000 to get us to write the brief . ”
VII .
The Supreme Court is unlikely to reconsider its pro-business outlook anytime soon .
Nevertheless , there are several currents in American political life that run counter to the court , even if they may not be strong enough , or suitably directed , to reverse it .
There are , for example , economic populists in both political parties  John Edwards Democrats and Mike Huckabee Republicans , to cite just two types  who express concern about growing economic inequality and corporate corruption , and blame unchecked corporate power for America ’s escalating economic problems .
These populists tend to be from the working and middle classes rather than the professional classes , and their numbers may be growing .
In recent Pew surveys , 65 percent of Americans agreed that corporations make excessive profits  the highest number in 20 years .
Moreover , about half the country now asserts that America is divided on economic lines into two groups  the “ haves ” and “ have nots ”  up from only 26 percent two decades ago .
And the number of Americans who view themselves as “ have nots ” has doubled to 34 percent today from 17 percent in 1988 .
Responding to pressures from this demographic , a Democratic Congress  bolstered by states - rights conservatives  might well try to pass legislation to counteract the court ’s recent decisions barring product - liability suits for defective medical devices .
What about the executive branch ?
It seems unlikely that John McCain , if he were elected president , would push back against the court : he has already pledged to appoint “ judges of the character and quality of Justices Roberts and Alito , ” rather than justices more devoted to states rights , like Scalia and Thomas .
As for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , both have sounded increasingly populist notes in an effort to attract union and blue - collar supporters , ratcheting up their attacks on corporate wealth and power , singling out the drug , oil and health - insurance industries and promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement .
But despite their rhetoric , it is not clear that either candidate would actually appoint justices any more populist than Bill Clinton ’s nominees .
“ I would be stunned to find an anti-business appointee from either of them , ” Cass Sunstein , who is a constitutional adviser to Obama , told me .
“ There ’s not a strong interest on the part of Obama or Clinton in demonizing business , and you would n’t expect to see that in their Supreme Court nominees . ”
Still , the possibility does exist .
If the economy continues to decline and blue - collar voters end up being crucial in the election , a Democratic president might appoint an economic populist to the Supreme Court as a kind of payback .
Earlier this month , on the campaign trail in Ohio , Obama mentioned Earl Warren , who served as governor of California before becoming chief justice , as a model of the kind of justice he hoped to appoint .
“ I want people on the bench who have enough empathy , enough feeling , for what ordinary people are going through , ” Obama said .
He praised Warren for understanding that segregation was wrong because of the stigma it attached to blacks , rather than because of the precise nature of its sociological impact .
Appointing a former politician to the court would almost certainly introduce a more populist element : the Supreme Court that in 1954 decided Brown v. Board of Education included , in addition to a former governor , three former senators , a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and two former attorneys general .
( By contrast , the Roberts court is composed of nine former judges . )
Using Git for Local Version Control
Posted by by Ben Teese
The Problem
As I work , I like to be able to do very regular checkins to our Subversion server ( ensuring the tests pass beforehand , of course ) .
This gives me an easy fallback position if I make some change that causes test breakages .
Sometimes it ’s just easier to rollback and start again than to try and figure out how I broke it .
This is especially the case when refactoring .
We use Crucible for our code reviews , connected to our Subversion server .
The problem is that when I want somebody to review a new feature or bug fix , the reviews might need to span a bunch of these fine - grained changesets .
Crucible allows you to have multiple changesets in a review , but I do n’t want people to have to review every little changeset – I want them to be able to just look at the difference between the start point and the end point .
A Solution
To get around this , I ’ve been using Git to track my local changes , a custom script to bundle my changes into a single changeset , then git -svn to commit them to my Subversion server when I am ready .
I ’m not going to give you a tutorial on Git here , but here are the basic steps involved :
Get Git and git-svn .
Clone your remote SVN repository into a local Git repository .
If your SVN repository has a lot of history , this may take a while – but this is a one - off event .
Go get a coffee whilst you wait .
Once it ’s done , start coding .
At this point it might be worth reading some of the introductory Git documentation to get an understanding of how it works .
Commit your changes to your local Git repository as per normal Git usage .
Periodically rebase to the remote SVN repository using
git svn rebase .
This will ensure you ’ve got the latest changes in the SVN repository .
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you ’re happy with your changes .
Create branches if you want , but do n’t merge between them ( we ’ll discuss why later ) .
When you ’re ready to check - in to SVN , first use a custom bash script that was written by my colleague Tom Lee .
Why do this ?
Well , to commit from Git to Subversion , you ’d normally just use :
git svn dcommit
However , the problem with this is that ’ll it commit a new changeset to SVN for each Git commit you ’ve done .
We do n’t want this .
Instead , we want to bundle everything up into a single commit first .
Update :
As suggested by one of the commenters , a better way to do this is to use git - svn rebase - i See My git - svn workflow for further information .
The way to do is to create a temporary Git branch , and merge all of your changes into it .
This will squash them into a single changeset , which you can then commit to SVN in one hit .
Whilst you can do this manually if you want , Tom ’s script does this for you automatically .
Put the script in the same directory as your other Git executables and make it executable too .
You can then run it as follows :
git - prepare - svn-commit -m ' Added some new feature '
It ’ll bundle everything up into a single changeset with the provided commit message .
Note that this script has only been tested with Ubuntu – your mileage may vary .
Now you can check it in :
git svn dcommit
and it ’ll just commit a single bundled changeset to your Subversion repository .
Additional Benefits of using Git
Git has a number of features that are very appealing .
One that stood out for me is the ability to very quickly and easily create branches locally and then instantly switch between them .
Often I would have a number of branches going at the same time , each one for different code enhancements or defect fixes .
In theory I could probably do all of this using Subversion branches , but Git offered one additional advantage – I do n’t require a network connection to use it .
I regularly work with it offline , only having to find a network connection when I ’m ready to upload my changes to Subversion .
I also have the added bonus that I do n’t end up with a bazillion branches hanging around on the Subversion server .
It ’s worth noting that I ’ve never merged between local Git branches that originated from the Subversion server – indeed , the git - svn documentation recommends against it ( see the ‘ Caveats ’ section of the git- svn Manual Page ) .
However , this was n’t ever a problem for me ; by committing finished work to Subversion , switching to a Git branch containing unfinished work and then rebasing against the Subversion repository , code could easily be transmitted between branches .
Drawbacks of using Git
I found Git to have a steep learning curve .
In particular , it ’s two - stage approach to commits took a little getting used to .
This problem was exacerbated by the fact that I was using git -svn as well .
The best example of this was the extreme bewilderment I experienced when I first encountered merge conflicts during a rebase against the Subversion repository .
The best piece of advice I can give you if you encounter such a conflict during a rebase is to do what Git tells you .
Git will provide a number of ‘ what you can do next ’ instructions when it encounters a conflict that it needs you to resolve .
Read these instructions carefully and follow them .
I tried to short - cut them and ended up hopelessly tangled up .
Finally , there ’s not much Git tool support out there at the moment , so you ’re pretty much gonna be doing it all from the command - line .
Credits
Thanks to Tom Lee for breaking a trail to this solution – I knew what I wanted and thought Git might provide a solution , but Tom was the one who actually figured it out and put it all together .
He also pulled me out of a few holes that I dug myself into during the learning process .
At his Paris GDC session exploring the development of 2 K 's critical success BioShock , lead programmer Chris Kline started off by saying his main point would be that " BioShock should 've failed . "
" In fact , " he continued , " it did fail a lot , over the course of time .
A series of big mistakes and corrections and slipped ship dates , but all of these helped make it a good game . "
Initial Shock
In early 2002 , realizing that the team needed to make a big budget title , then - Irrational Games decided : " Here was our idea : Let 's just make System Shock 2 .
This was easy because we 'd already made System Shock 2 .
We knew it was a critical success , and we thought we knew all the things that kept it from being financially successful . "
" I said this was going to be about failure , " said Kline , " and the very first failure was that we wanted to base this whole thing on System Shock 2 . "
Irrational decided that the two main areas where the game needed to innovate were on narrative and AI -- specifically , an AI ecology that was not singularly focused on attacking the player -- but development abruptly stopped on the game at that point , for the next two years .
When they returned to the game , there was some concern about the fact that they were trying to sell to publishers a sequel to an unsuccessful game , so the developers " faked it , " said Kline , by giving GameSpot an exclusive on the game alongside a planned System Shock 2 retrospective for its five year anniversary .
" The design team 's core assumption was that Shock 2 was a near - perfect game design .
And we could just fix a few flaws .
So what did we keep ?
Resource scarcity , the customization of the character through different systems , and we wanted the player to be cautious about moving through the world , " Kline explained .
Ecologies and Evolutions
Irrational went for the concept of life existing around you but without you , but found that the AI ecology - why the enemies would fight each other - made no sense .
" The world needs to revolve around the player , " Kline said .
" Another mistake we made on the art side was focusing too much on the monster models , " he continued .
" The real problem at this time was that we did n't know what the main focus of the visuals was .
What we now know is that it's not the monsters , but the city of Rapture . "
He continued by saying in designing the ' gatherers ' -- what would become the Little Sisters but began as designs as varied as insects , a frog with a bottle , and a dog in a wheelchair -- nobody was focusing on what the end user experience was , and everyone was moving in different directions .
That changed for the E3 2006 demo , where everyone had to pull together and really make it work .
" In order to show we could create a compelling user experience , we had to change how we were thinking about the game .
We had to start thinking about what the player was really going to feel in this game , " Kline said .
Shoot For Success
Following the demo , though , he said that while it was getting critical acclaim , it was n't actually gaining much interest from users , so they changed marketing to say that it was a shooter - and then found they had to prove it .
" What 's interesting is that even though it was the same game , " Kline said , " when we presented it as a shooter people started getting more excited about it .
Even the team . "
" We were actually so focused on the big details that we actually forgot how important the little details are , " he said , so they changed the game to make it more exciting , but still found that there was a lot they were n't paying attention to .
The harvest or save mechanics were n't implemented yet , the money versus Adam mechanics , how to encourage plasmid use , balancing , framerate , even the script --
" There were a lot of problems , " Kline sighed .
In the end , though , he confessed , " Some people think that constantly messing up , and pushing dates is n't a good way to make a game , but as far as I 'm concerned it 's the only way to make a good game . "
Developers need to doubt everything and listen to everyone , Kline concluded .
" Always remember that you might be totally screwing everything up . "

Scott McClellan has previously said he'd be " happy " to testify before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee .
Looks like he 's about to get his chance .
On June 20th .
Unlike Karl Rove , who said he 'd similarly be happy to tell his story ( on the Siegelman affair ) to Congress , we suspect McClellan will actually keep his word .
This just in from Conyers ' office ...
For Immediate Release : June 9 , 2008 Conyers Invites McClellan to Testify June 20th ( Washington , DC ) - Today , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) invited former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan to testify before the Committee at a June 20th hearing about reported efforts to cover up the role of the White House in the Valerie Plame leak as described in his recent book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception .
I have extended an invitation to Mr. McClellan to testify before the Judiciary Committee after discussions between Committee staff and his attorneys , said Conyers .
In his book , Mr. McClellan suggests that senior WhiteHouse officials may have obstructed justice and engaged in a cover - up regarding the Valerie Plame leak .
This alleged activity could well extend beyond the scope of the offenses for which Scooter Libby has been convicted and deserves further attention .
A copy of Chairman Conyers ' letter is attached .
##110-JUD-060908 ##
The letter referred to above is just a single paragraph invitation , and largely restates the above .
UPDATE : McClellan accepts invitation .
Public Record has details ...

This is the name given to the Mausoleums of the Ming dynasties ’ 13 emperors .
The original tomb was the Changling tomb , built for Emperor Zhu Di and his Empresses .
All the other 12 tombs are built around it but only two are open to the public – the first , Changling and the thirteenth , Dingling .
Changling is the largest and is completely preserved with the main building covering an internal area of 1,956 square metres and being the only large palace which is made of camphor wood .
Dingling , unlike Changling is built about 27 metres deep underground and is the mausoleum of Emperor Zhu Yijun and his two empresses .
The underground labyrinth houses 5 ‘ palaces ’ - front , middle , rear , left and right .
The Emperor and his two queens lie in the rear hall with Emperor Zhu Yijun in the middle and his queens on either side .
Displayed along with the coffins are various treasures amongst which is the gold imperial crown , made of extremely fine gold threads , inlaid with two dragons playing with pearl .
A rare treasure indeed !
Additionally 4 phoenix crowns , inlaid with thousands of pearls and precious stones were found .
These were worn by the queens on important ceremonial occasions .
More than 3,000 items were uncovered here in Dingling tomb and many are on display in the Exhibition room .
Author : Officials against torture memo feared wiretaps , physical danger David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email This According to Jane Mayer , author of The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , two top lawyers in the Justice Department who attempted to push back against the authorization of torture by Vice President Cheney 's staff became so paranoid that they worried they were being wiretapped and even feared they might be in physical danger .
Mayer told the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe that Cheney 's staff took advantage of 9/11 to enhance presidential power and that -- in the words of Republican lawyer and former 9/11 Commission director Philip Zelikow -- " fear and anxiety were exploited by fools and zealots . "
Mayer added , however , that there were also opponents of torture and other extreme powers within the administration .
" Almost from the start after 9/11 , " she stated , " lawyers in the administration have said , ' That 's not the American way , we can't do that , it 's criminal , it may be a war crime . ' "
Mayer pointed out that " two of the top lawyers in the Bush administration , Jim Comey who was the number two in the Justice Department and Jack Goldsmith who ran the Office of Legal Counsel , were trying really hard to put the country back on what they thought was a legal footing when it came to how to treat prisoners .
They were trying to take away the torture memo and replace it with something that was more responsible . "
" As they were working on this , " Mayer continued , " they became so paranoid that the vice president 's office was either trying to push back in some way -- they thought they might be being wiretapped , they thought they might be in physical danger .
The fights were that intense .
I can't tell you how passionate and hard - fought these fights were inside this government . "
Host Joe Scarborough appeared less interested in following up on Mayer 's statements about Goldsmith and Comey than in her implied characterization of Dick Cheney .
" Are you suggesting that the vice president of the United States is a fool ? " he asked .
" Or a zealot ? "
Mayer avoided answering directly , but suggested that " some of the people after 9/11 at the top of our government were so panicked about the need to protect the country ... that they went overboard , and they sacrificed too many of our American values . "
Mayer pointed in particular to " the way the CIA became the master of a secret program in which they deliberately used cruelty to coerce people into talking . "
She noted that these interrogation techniques " are going to make it very hard to get prosecutions through .
... I 've been told by a number of people ... that there 's no court in the land that would allow people to be prosecuted after they 've been through what they went through . "
Scarborough , however , appeared determined to elicit a comment on Cheney , asking once again , " Is that primarily who you believe was driving these operations ? "
Mayer appeared reluctant to accuse Cheney directly but replied cautiously , " In my effort to figure out where the policy that wound up in torture in everything but name came from , much of it came from Cheney 's office . "
Scarborough next asked , " Is n't there a bit of Monday morning quarterbacking ? ...
Now we have the luxury to be shocked and stunned .
...
In 2002 and 2003 there was an urgency , not just by an extreme administration ... but by Americans to figure out where the next attack was coming from . "
Mayer agreed that right after 9/11 " public opinion supported really brutal policies , " but she insisted that " it 's not so much Monday morning quarterbacking as people saying seven years later , ' Gee , was this the right thing to do ? ' ...
There 's kind of a national debate going on . " " [ Torture ] has n't worked very well , " Mayer stated .
" It 's gotten some confessions that worked and a lot of really bad information -- including some that led us into the war in Iraq . "
Even after Mayer left , Scarborough continued to argue with Shuster about the efficacy of torture .
" It led to results , " he insisted .
" To say that we were led on too many wild goosechases is just not historically accurate . "

At first blush , it would seem to be a positive for Obama that he is hard to mock .
But on second thought , is it another sign that he ’s trying so hard to be perfect that it ’s stultifying ?
Or that eight years of W. and Cheney have robbed Democratic voters of their sense of humor ?
Certainly , as the potential first black president , and as a contender with tender experience , Obama must feel under strain to be serious .
But he does not want the “ take ” on him to become that he ’s so tightly wrapped , overcalculated and circumspect that he can’t even allow anyone to make jokes about him , and that his supporters are so evangelical and eager for a champion to rescue America that their response to any razzing is a sanctimonious :
Do n’t mess with our messiah !
If Obama keeps being stingy with his quips and smiles , and if the dominant perception of him is that you ca n’t make jokes about him , it might infect his campaign with an airless quality .
His humorlessness could spark humor .
On Tuesday , Andy Borowitz satirized on that subject .
He said that Obama , sympathetic to comics ’ attempts to find jokes to make about him , had put out a list of official ones , including this :
“ A traveling salesman knocks on the door of a farmhouse , and much to his surprise , Barack Obama answers the door .
The salesman says , ‘ I was expecting the farmer ’s daughter . ’
Barack Obama replies , ‘ She ’s not here .
The farm was foreclosed on because of subprime loans that are making a mockery of the American dream . ’ ”
John McCain ’s Don Rickles routines 
“ Thanks for the question , you little jerk ”  can fall flat .
But he seems like a guy who can be teased harmlessly .
If Obama offers only eat - your - arugula chiding and chilly earnestness , he becomes an otherworldly type , not the regular guy he needs to be .

How long does an experiment need to continue before it 's declared a failure ?
For alcohol prohibition , our US version , it was about 13 years .
Between mafia crime , poisonings from adulterated beverages , and the dropping age at which people were becoming alcoholics , Americans decided that the " Noble Experiment " -- whether it should actually be regarded as noble or not -- was a bad idea .
And they ended it .
New York State did its part 75 years ago today , ratifying the 21st amendment to repeal the 18th amendment , bringing the Constitution one state closer to being restored .
It took another half a year , until December 5th , to get the 36 states on the board that were needed at the time to get the job done .
But Americans of the '30s recognized the failure of the prohibition experiment , and they took action by enacting legalization of alcohol .
Industrialist John D. Rockefeller described the evolution of his thinking that led to the recognition of prohibition 's failure , in a famous 1932 letter :
" When Prohibition was introduced , I hoped that it would be widely supported by public opinion and the day would soon come when the evil effects of alcohol would be recognized .
I have slowly and reluctantly come to believe that this has not been the result .
Instead , drinking has generally increased ; the speakeasy has replaced the saloon ; a vast army of lawbreakers has appeared ; many of our best citizens have openly ignored Prohibition ; respect for the law has been greatly lessened ; and crime has increased to a level never seen before . "
In the context of today 's leading prohibition -- the drug war -- it 's important to realize that those other drugs were made illegal even before alcohol was .
It was December 17th , 1914 , when the Harrison Narcotics Act passed the US Congress -- ostensibly a regulatory law to synchronize America 's system with a new one being adopted by countries around the world .
But law enforcement interpreted it as prohibiting drugs -- coca and opium , and derivatives of them such as heroin and cocaine , were the ones in question then -- and law enforcement got its way .
Which means that drugs have been illegal for almost a century .
And yet despite a century of prohibition -- a century of fighting opium -- the Taliban could somehow make a hundred million off of it last year , that 's how much of it is still being used .
Our addiction rate in the US is higher today than it is believed to have been at the turn of the 20th century , and while other things that have certainly changed that could affect drug use , if you 're fighting a " drug war " to end drug use , if addiction goes in completely the opposite direction , then you have a problem .
A recent example of things going in the completely opposite direction as intended is cocaine prices on the streets of our cities , which according to DEA data is about a fifth of what it was in 1980 when adjusting for inflation and purity .
The goal of the eradication - interdiction - arrest - incarceration strategy is to raise prices , in order to discourage use .
Oh , and the drugs have gotten worse too -- who had ever heard of crack cocaine before 1986 -- 72 years after passage of the Harrison Act ?
Marijuana prohibition , enacted in 1937 , is an even less successful experiment than opiate and cocaine prohibition .
For the harder drugs one might say at least that some young people have trouble getting them , although that 's really just the kids who are n't into drugs .
But marijuana can be purchased by virtually any high school student in the country , at virtually any high school in the country , and generally from other students .
When kids are dealing drugs to other kids , and that is happening EVERYWHERE , what is the result of the experiment ?
What is its conclusion ?
Is further research really necessary at that point ?
No , it 's not .
The findings are on the drug prohibition experiment are conclusive -- it 's a failure .
And while many of the people waging the drug war believe it 's noble , that belief is misguided -- with half a million people incarcerated in US jails and prisons for drug offenses , the prohibition experiment is anything but noble .
The day we legalize drugs is the day we can begin to clean up the mess that the drug prohibition experiment has created .
In retrospect it ’s amazing how little formality surrounds the Governor General .
She seems genuinely interested in everyone she meets , and walks freely among the crowd .
What other country would have it ’s Head of State climb on the blanket toss ?
I love Canada .
Nasim ’s story : Â making and unmaking terrorists
by Connor O’Steen
It turns out the road between [ location excised ] and [ location excised ] is currently held by the Taliban , so until NATO clears things up I ’ll be here .
Seeing how that ’s the case , and I now have some extra time on my hands , I might as well tell you some more about what I ’ve seen .
Nasim showed up on our doorstep early in the morning , and when asked what he needed , said that he had been told by some of the other children of Chaghcharan that we ran an orphanage .
His face was bruised and slightly purplish , both of his eyes were swollen and there were dark rings underneath .
Nasim is about 14 inches shorter than I am , but he says that he ’s fifteen .
We ’re still unsure whether this is because he ’s malnourished or because , like most Afghans , he has no idea when he was born .
( As an aside , this is why a number of Afghan passports and ID ’s list the date of birth as January 1st , followed by the year .
Even the years are often uncertain data ) .
Either way , he did n’t look like he could be older than 12 .
Nasim was our guest for about five days as we worked to get him into the orphanage , and in that time , we managed to learn some of his story , the rest of which we gathered through the unique displeasure of visiting his village a few days after that .
For the sake of avoiding some tedious explanations and re-explanations of when we learned the chronology of events , I ’ll give you the full story rather than the pieces of it .
Nasim ’s father and mother divorced about a year and a half ago .
Divorce in Afghanistan is a notoriously risky business as it is likely to result in allegations of adultery which , in turn , can result in revenge or honor killings .
Still , this one seemed to go all right –Nasim ’s mother moved back into the house of her first husband and his father quickly remarried .
Nasim found himself left out of both arrangements , however , and had an uneasy existence shuttled back and forth from his mother ’s and father ’s houses , essentially begging for food and shelter and exchanging labor for meals .
A year ago , his father beat him badly and told him that if he ever came back , he would kill him .
After that , Nasim started the 45 - mile journey to Chaghcharan .
Because he had no money and no food , his progress was painfully slow .
As he made his way there , he was exploited for labor , exchanging work for two meals a day .
Sitting outside on our porch at night , he told us how he saved up scraps of food so he had something to eat as he jumped from village to village .
When we drove to Nasim ’s home it took us an hour and a half .
It took Nasim six months to get to Chaghcharan .
His troubles were n’t over there .
He found himself excluded from the orphanage because he lacked an ID or an adult to confirm that his parents were unwilling to take care of him .
For the following six months , in the harsh winter of Chaghcharan [ Ed. note : Â Chaghcharan is at around 10,000 feet above sea level ] , he worked for two meals a day at a tire repair shop and slept in an unheatedÂ garage .
The bruises under his eyes explain the abuse , and the scabies infecting his arms and legs showed his living conditions .
This is n’t a story designed to ruin your day or make you feel bad about your own life .
Â
In fact , this story is n’t particularly unusual in terms of the way orphans and neglected children are treated here .
That ’s the point .
Labor exploitation has become systematized by three decades of war , hardship , poverty , and the destruction of familial and clan ties .
These children , lacking the defense mechanism of parental protection , do hard manual labor to survive .
The odds of receiving any kind of money are practically none ; most wealth in Afghanistan is inherited , so starting on the bottom is a particular disadvantage .
Being an orphan outside of an orphanage is to live a life without any hope for advancement or improvement .
You will not be educated , you will not be paid , no one will help you when you get sick or hurt , you ’ll only be fed enough to keep you working .
Of course the orphanage is n’t the only option .
Â
You could also do what Nasim ’s older brother did .
Confronted with the same hopeless situation , he and a group of friends went to Pakistan to study in a madrassa .
There ’s little doubt in my mind that he ’ll be back on Afghan soil soon , working to shape his country into the same frustrated and angry mold that he himself was sculpted into .
There ’s a silver lining to this particularly dark cloud .
Nasim is in the orphanage now and he says that , for the first time in his life , he has hope for something better .
He ’s getting an education , and he ’s being fed unconditionally .
Afghanistan is n’t a doomed country the same way Nasim , by taking his life in his own hands , has never been a doomed child .
What our responsibility must be is to make sure that orphanages like these can continue to shelter the children stuck on the bottom rung of the socio-economic ladder .
[ Ed. note : Â A “ madrassa ” is simply a school .
Â
The madrassas along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , however , were and are the breeding ground for the Taliban .
Â
During the Soviet - Afghan War , Saudi Arabia funded more than 8,000 madrassas that teach little except the most aggressive , fundamentalist side of Islam – a mixture of Wahhabism and the brand of hatred stemming from the Muslim Brotherhood . ]
Americans are shell - shocked at $ 4 - a - gallon gas .
But consider France , where a gallon of petrol runs nearly $ 10 .
Or Turkey , where it ’s more than $ 11 .
Drivers around the world are being pummeled by the effects of record gas prices .
And now some are hitting back , staging strikes and protests from Europe to Indonesia to demand that governments do more to ease the pain .
It ’s a growing problem in a world that ’s increasingly mobile and more vulnerable than ever to the cost of crude oil , which is racing higher by the day and showing no signs of stopping .
“ I do n’t know why it is , but . . . it hurts , ” said Marie Penucci , a violinist who was filling up her Volkswagen to the tune of $ 9.66 a gallon at an Esso station in Paris .

As she pumped , she looked wistfully at a commuter climbing onto one of the city ’s cheap rental bicycles , an option not open to her because she must travel long distances to performances .
As oil soars , the effect on drivers can vary widely .
Taxes and subsidies that differ from country to country are the main reasons , along with limits in oil refining capacity and hard - to - reach places that drive up shipping costs .
In Europe and Japan , for example , high taxes have made drivers accustomed to staggering gas prices .
As a result , plenty of European adults never even bother to learn to drive , preferring cheap mass transit to getting behind the wheel .
Those who do drive are still testing new pain thresholds .
And it would be worse in Europe if the strong euro were n’t cushioning the blow .

On the other hand , in emerging economies such as those in China and India , government subsidies shield motorists .
But that still means governments themselves have to find a way to afford the soaring market prices for oil .
Increasingly , people around the world are reaching the boiling point -- and it ’s not just drivers .
Fishermen in Spain and Portugal began nationwide strikes Friday , keeping their trawlers and commercial boats docked at ports .
In Madrid , demonstrators handed out 20 tons of fish in a bid to win support from the public .
In Spain , the European Union ’s most - important producer of fish , the fishing confederation estimates fuel prices have gone up 320 % in the last five years -- so high that many fishermen can no longer afford to take their boats out .

French fishermen and farmers , who need fuel for trawlers and tractors , say their livelihoods are threatened by soaring prices and have blocked oil terminals around France and shipping traffic on the English Channel to demand government help .
British and Bulgarian truckers are staging fuel protests , too .
Indonesians are staging their own protests against shrinking gasoline subsidies in a nation where nearly half the population of 235 million lives on less than $ 2 a day .
The world is driving more than ever :
There are 887 million vehicles in the world , up from 553 million just 15 years ago , according to London consultancy Global Insight .
It estimates the figure will be 1 billion four years from now .

In Europe , the high tax burden means crude prices make up a smaller part of the retail cost of gas .
“ The pain of a rise in prices is much less in Europe , because we may be paying a lot more here , but the rise in a percentage sense is a lot smaller , ” said Julius Walker , oil analyst at Paris - based International Energy Agency .
The United States , with its relatively low taxes , is considered to have retail prices closer to what energy data charts call the “ real cost ” of gasoline -- closely linked to the price of oil .
So as oil prices have soared , U.S. gas prices have soared along with them .

The average price for regular unleaded gas have risen from $ 1.47 a gallon in May 2003 to more than $ 3.96 now , a jump of nearly 170 % .
In the same period , the most popular grade of gas in France rose by just over 90 % -- a relatively gentle climb .
Americans are driving less -- about 11 billion fewer miles in March 2008 than March 2007 , a drop of about 4 % , according to the Schork Report newsletter .
It was the first drop in March driving in almost three decades .
In the U.S. , presidential candidates Sens. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) have proposed suspending the federal gas tax for the summer to give drivers some help , although it is not clear whether they would actually see much relief .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has urged the EU to cut its value - added tax on fuel .

Nations that produce huge amounts of oil are n’t necessarily in better shape .
Russia is the world ’s second - leading producer of oil , but gas there comes to about $ 3.68 a gallon -- about the same as in the U.S. , where the average worker earns about six times as much money .
Much of the Russian cost comes from taxes , which run 60 % to 70 % .
Limited refining capacity and the costs of transporting gasoline across the country ’s vast expanse also push up prices .
Turkey faces similar problems .
It costs $ 11.29 a gallon there , meaning filling up the tank of a mid-size car can reach nearly $ 200 -- enough to give up on driving and buy a domestic plane ticket .
Advertisement
It ’s not that bad everywhere .
In China , government - mandated low retail gas prices have helped farmers and China ’s urban poor .
But in a country struggling with pollution it has hurt conservation .
The Chinese used about 5 % more gas in the first four months of this year than last .
And in Venezuela , long - held government subsidies and bountiful supplies have made the people think of cheap fuel as a birthright .
It ’s a veritable wonderland for gas guzzlers -- 12 cents a gallon .
Car buyers there are snapping up SUVs .
For solutions to the oil crisis , policymakers in less oil - rich nations are looking to Brazil , where ethanol made from sugar cane is widely available to the nation ’s 190 million people .
Advertisement
Eight out of every 10 new cars sold there are flex - fuel models that run on pure ethanol , gas or any combination of the two .
Ethanol in Sao Paulo is running about half the price of gas , which is $ 5.67 per gallon .
But those examples are the exception .
“ It ’s been tough .
I had to switch to regular gasoline from premium class , ” said Hiroyuki Kashiwabara , a Japanese worker whose monthly spending on gasoline has increased by nearly $ 100 over the last couple of months .
“ My salary does n’t change , and I ca n’t cut back on my spending on food or anything else . ”
Jean - Marc Jancovici , a French engineer and co-author of a philosophical treatise called “ Fill It Up , Please ! ” , despairs over the developing world ’s rising thirst for shrinking oil resources .

His answer ?
To rich consumers , at least , he says : Pick up your bike and “ stop being petroleum slaves . ”
Stephen Hawking should be pleased .
The first signs of an effect the British physicist predicted more than 30 years ago - known as Hawking radiation - have finally materialised from the simulated edge of a black hole .
Quantum mechanics tells us that entangled pairs made up of a particle and its antiparticle can spontaneously pop out of otherwise empty space , exist for a fleeting moment , and then annihilate each other and disappear .
In the 1970s , Hawking predicted that if such a pair were created near a black hole 's event horizon , one of its members might fall into the black hole before it could be annihilated .
The partner left stranded outside the event horizon would appear to an observer to have been radiated from the black hole .
It 's tough to see what 's going on around real black holes , so physicists hoping to test the prediction have been trying to create artificial event horizons in the lab ( New Scientist , 16 February , p 15 ) .
One promising way to mimic a black hole is to use a supercooled substance known as a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .
If one region of the BEC is manipulated to move faster than the speed of sound , then sound waves travelling through the rest of the substance would not be able to keep up , effectively becoming trapped behind an event horizon .
Hawking radiation should show at this boundary as the production of particle - like packets of vibrational energy called phonons .
Now Iacopo Carusotto at the University of Trento in Italy and his colleagues claim to have seen just that in a computer simulation of a BEC .
Their model shows that phonons do appear at the event horizon - and that one member of the pair falls into the " black hole " while the other remains outside as predicted .
Both phonon partners created identical density patterns in the surrounding BEC , confirming that they were entangled .
Until now , researchers studying the way BECs should behave have used approximate calculations based on the equations used to analyse real black holes .
Carusotto's team , by contrast , did not assume any similarities to black holes .
" In this way , our observations can be considered as [ the ] first independent proof of the existence of Hawking radiation , " the authors write in a preprint of their paper , which has been submitted to a major journal ( www.arxiv.org/abs/0803.0507).
Ralf Schützhold , an authority on artificial black holes at Dresden University of Technology in Germany , points out that the group will have to create the effect in a real BEC before they can claim to have observed Hawking radiation .
He believes their simulation will help experimenters spot the signature of such an event .
" Until now , we did not know a good way to measure entangled phonons , but the density signature that the group has found will help . "

Here is an image I did for Official Playstation Magazine UK which is in their latest issue .
I had a hard time getting it to look exactly like the game model because I started out with an illustration that I realized later was a bit different than the game .
So after the fact , I started messing with it to try to get him closer to the game model .
This image involved a lot more illustration on my part than the other ones too since I was changing the lighting compared to my source image .
Anyway , enjoy!ugh , .... you 'd think after all this time I would have spelled Niko right .

Small Is Bountiful
Peasant farmers offer the best chance of feeding the world .
So why do we treat them with contempt ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 10th June 2008
I suggest you sit down before you read this .
Robert Mugabe is right .
At last week ’s global food summit he was the only leader to speak of “ the importance … of land in agricultural production and food security ” .
(1) Countries should follow Zimbabwe ’s lead , he said , in democratising ownership .
Of course the old bastard has done just the opposite .
He has evicted his opponents and given land to his supporters .
He has failed to support the new settlements with credit or expertise , with the result that farming in Zimbabwe has collapsed .
The country was in desperate need of land reform when Mugabe became president .
It remains in desperate need of land reform today .
But he is right in theory .
Though the rich world ’s governments wo n’t hear it , the issue of whether or not the world will be fed is partly a function of ownership .
This reflects an unexpected discovery .
It was first made in 1962 by the Nobel economist Amartya Sen ( 2 ) , and has since been confirmed by dozens of further studies .
There is an inverse relationship between the size of farms and the amount of crops they produce per hectare .
The smaller they are , the greater the yield .
In some cases , the difference is enormous .
A recent study of farming in Turkey , for example , found that farms of less than one hectare are twenty times as productive as farms of over ten hectares ( 3 ) .
Sen ’s observation has been tested in India , Pakistan , Nepal , Malaysia , Thailand , Java , the Phillippines , Brazil , Colombia and Paraguay .
It appears to hold almost everywhere .
The finding would be surprising in any industry , as we have come to associate efficiency with scale .
In farming , it seems particularly odd , because small producers are less likely to own machinery , less likely to have capital or access to credit , and less likely to know about the latest techniques .
There ’s a good deal of controversy about why this relationship exists .
Some researchers argued that it was the result of a statistical artefact : fertile soils support higher populations than barren lands , so farm size could be a result of productivity , rather than the other way around .
But further studies have shown that the inverse relationship holds across an area of fertile land .
Moreover , it works even in countries like Brazil , where the biggest farmers have grabbed the best land ( 4 ) .
The most plausible explanation is that small farmers use more labour per hectare than big farmers ( 5 ) .
Their workforce largely consists of members of their own families , which means that labour costs are lower than on large farms ( they do n’t have to spend money recruiting or supervising workers ) , while the quality of the work is higher .
With more labour , farmers can cultivate their land more intensively : they spend more time terracing and building irrigation systems ; they sow again immediately after the harvest ; they might grow several different crops in the same field .
In the early days of the Green Revolution , this relationship seemed to go into reverse : the bigger farms , with access to credit , were able to invest in new varieties and boost their yields .
But as the new varieties have spread to smaller farmers , the inverse relationship has reasserted itself ( 6 ) .
If governments are serious about feeding the world , they should be breaking up large landholdings , redistributing them to the poor and concentrating their research and their funding on supporting small farms .
There are plenty of other reasons for defending small farmers in poor countries .
The economic miracles in South Korea , Taiwan and Japan arose from their land reform programmes .
Peasant farmers used the cash they made to build small businesses .
The same thing seems to have happened in China , though it was delayed for 40 years by collectivisation and the Great Leap Backwards : the economic benefits of the redistribution that began in 1949 were not felt until the early 80 s ( 7 ) .
Growth based on small farms tends to be more equitable than growth built around capital - intensive industries ( 8 ) .
Though their land is used intensively , the total ecological impact of smallholdings is lower .
When small farms are bought up by big ones , the displaced workers move into new land to try to scratch out a living .
I once followed evicted peasants from the Brazilian state of Maranhao 2000 miles across the Amazon to the land of the Yanomami Indians , then watched them rip it apart .
But the prejudice against small farmers is unshakeable .
It gives rise to the oddest insult in the English language : when you call someone a peasant , you are accusing them of being self - reliant and productive .
Peasants are detested by capitalists and communists alike .
Both have sought to seize their land , and have a powerful vested interest in demeaning and demonising them .
In its profile of Turkey , the country whose small farmers are 20 times more productive than its large ones , the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation states that , as a result of small landholdings , “ farm output … remains low .
” ( 9 ) The OECD states that “ stopping land fragmentation ” in Turkey “ and consolidating the highly fragmented land is indispensable for raising agricultural productivity . ” ( 10 ) Neither body provides any supporting evidence .
A rootless , half - starved labouring class suits capital very well .
Like Mugabe , the donor countries and the big international bodies loudly demand that small farmers be supported , while quietly shafting them .
Last week ’s food summit agreed “ to help farmers , particularly small - scale producers , increase production and integrate with local , regional , and international markets . ” ( 11 ) But when , earlier this year , the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge proposed a means of doing just this , the US , Australia and Canada refused to endorse it as it offended big business ( 12 ) , while the United Kingdom remains the only country that wo n’t reveal whether or not it supports the study ( 13 ) .
Big business is killing small farming .
By extending intellectual property rights over every aspect of production ; by developing plants which either wo n’t breed true or which do n’t reproduce at all ( 14 ) , it ensures that only those with access to capital can cultivate .
As it captures both the wholesale and retail markets , it seeks to reduce its transaction costs by engaging only with major sellers .
If you think that supermarkets are giving farmers in the UK a hard time , you should see what they are doing to growers in the poor world .
As developing countries sweep away street markets and hawkers ’ stalls and replace them with superstores and glossy malls , the most productive farmers lose their customers and are forced to sell up .
The rich nations support this process by demanding access for their companies .
Their agricultural subsidies still help their own , large farmers to compete unfairly with the small producers of the poor world .
This leads to an interesting conclusion .
For many years , well - meaning liberals have supported the fair trade movement because of the benefits it delivers directly to the people it buys from .
But the structure of the global food market is changing so rapidly that fair trade is now becoming one of the few means by which small farmers in poor nations might survive .
A shift from small to large farms will cause a major decline in global production , just as food supplies become tight .
Fair trade might now be necessary not only as a means of redistributing income , but also to feed the world .

BBC News , Cochabamba
At the beginning of the year , Tony and his friend arrived at a birthday party in the Bolivian city of El Alto and realised they had come empty handed .
Dummies strung from lamp posts serve as a grim warning
After greeting the host , they went to find a shop .
But as they came out of the house a girl who had just been the victim of an attempted robbery saw them , and alerted the neighbours .
" People started to point at us , they started to bang the doors yelling we were robbers , " Tony told the BBC as he walked down the streets where he was attacked , his face still swollen from the beatings .
" All the other people around there woke up and were coming out of their homes with whatever they had at hand , like sticks , " " They started to beat me insanely , with their hands , with rocks . "
" They were out of control , not listening at all we were yelling : ' you are confused , we are innocent , we are innocent , please ' , we begged a lot , even crying " , Tony added .
Alternative justice
In El Alto , La Paz 's destitute and neglected satellite city , people have had enough with the state 's failure to provide security and an effective judicial system .
For them , vigilante justice seems to be the alternative .
Dummies with nooses around their necks hang from lamp posts , a grim warning to potential offenders .
After about 30 minutes , the police came to the rescue of Tony and his friend .
Seriously injured , Tony was taken straight to hospital .
Tony says he was lucky that he lived to tell the tale Doctors had to implant platinum to reconstruct his facial bones .
" I was very lucky because there are people - both guilty and innocent - who get caught up in this kind of confusion and who do not live to tell the tale , " Tony said .
Lynch mob attacks appear to be on the rise throughout Bolivia .
More than 40 cases have been reported since the beginning of the year , compared with some 57 for 2007 .
The worrying rise in such violence has provoked a new debate over the lack of security and justice in the country - and even a widespread media campaign by Bolivia 's ombudsman to try and stop the practice .
Bolivian President Evo Morales is planning to give the country 's indigenous majority greater powers to decide how to punish criminals within their communities .
Officials say this will complement ordinary justice , which is slow and overloaded with cases , and alleviate the frustration they say causes mob violence like lynching .
' Not acceptable ' But Bolivia 's first indigenous minister of justice , Celima Torrico , says confusion between mob justice and community justice seems to be driving people to acts of lynching .
Celima Torrico : Lynching has no justification " Lately , we have seen many , many lynchings and sometimes people associate this with community justice , " Ms Torrico told the BBC at her office .
" But no , it can not be acceptable for anyone to take justice into their own hands . "
Community justice is a traditional form of justice deeply rooted among Andean indigenous groups .
For its supporters , it is a move toward using dialogue and community service work as a way for dealing with conflicts .
But practices vary and some communities may decide corporal punishment in the form of whipping should be used .
To its critics it gives a green light for violence and brutality against those suspected of offending community sensibilities .
Walter Avila 's death was murder , say his widow and mother " Taking justice into one 's own hands is not recognised by our country 's internal norms , nor in our constitution , " said Ms Torrico .
" The misunderstanding is very worrying because lynching somebody is a crime , it is not justice , it is not a solution . "
Lynchings do not just happen in El Alto but throughout Bolivia .
Recently in the central Cochabamba area , a violent mob descended on three policemen - who for reasons that remain unclear were dressed in civilian clothes - brutally beating them to death after somebody accused them of corruption .
" What justice and legality can you expect when we are increasingly surrounded by lynching cases here ? " asks Margarita , the mother of one of the policemen , Walter Avila .
Sitting next to her , Walter 's widow Mirna , dressed in mourning black , said tearfully that people would have had more pity for an animal .
" People do n't get that community justice is not killing , murdering , torturing and killing people ; what happened to my husband was not community justice , it was simply a brutal murder . "

Best Slow Motion Balloon Pop Ever ( video ) - [ off - topic ]
03:27 PM EST - Feb , 23 2008 - ( 1 comments )
I could watch this over and over a hundred times , and I may have .
Best slow motion balloon pop ever ! :-)
Australian teenager Zak Touilii suffers from duchenne muscular dystrophy , a disease that 's left him confined to a wheelchair for most of his life .
When presented with the opportunity to request something from the Make a Wish Foundation , Zak opted for a PlayStation 3 , which the charity donated to him along with a bunch of games .
Sadly , thieves broke into his home last week and made off with some of the family 's valuables , including jewellery , appliances and , yes , Zak 's PS3 , along with all his games .
So , so low .

Thugs steal disabled boy 's PlayStation 3 [ Daily Telegraph ]
There are more than 4 million miles of paved road in the United States , and 93 percent of them are covered in asphalt .
Unless you 're backpacking in the wilds of Alaska or wandering the bayous of Louisiana , you are never more than 22 miles from a stretch of blacktop .
That 's a lot of asphalt , and a lot of energy needed to produce it - which is why Hussain Bahia wants to find a greener way to make the stuff .
He 's a civil engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , and he says anything that increases asphalt 's recycled material content or cuts the energy needed to lay it down will have a big impact on the environment - and our pocketbooks .
" This is a no - brainer , " says Bahia , who has been studying asphalt for more than 20 years .
" If any person involved in managing our infrastructure looks at the data , why would you spend more energy and money on something else ? "
Bahia is part of a $ 5 million research program called the Asphalt Research Consortium , which hopes to , among other things , make blacktop more ecologically sustainable .
One of his first goals is to develop " cold- mix " asphalts that require significantly less energy than conventional asphalt to apply .
Asphalt is about 5 percent oil and 95 percent sand and rock ; it 's made from a black , sticky byproduct of oil refining .
It 's too thick to be applied without being heated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit .
That requires a lot of energy , which is why other countries have been using cold - mix asphalts - also called emulsions - for years .
One method involves shearing asphalt into fine particles , then mixing them with water and soap - like chemicals called surfactants that hold the asphalt in solution until its laid .
Bahia says studies have shown cold mixes require seven times less energy than hot mixes and they produce less CO2 and other emissions .
But they are n't widely used in the United States because hot mixes have worked so well , and there are no standards dictating how cold mixes are produced or how they 'll perform .
Bahia hopes to develop quality control tests and standards that will convince engineers and road builders to adopt cold mixes .
Bahia wants to experiment with adding polymers or plastics to cold mix asphalts to further improve durability and make roads quieter .
" At U.S. refineries today , there are very mature , established specifications for hot binders , " he says .
" But for emulsions , there is no clear agreement on how to define the quality .
So we have emulsions already , but we do n't produce them as much because the specifications are n't as clear . "
And until now , asphalt has been cheap , which is another reason hot mixes have remained the standard .
But as the price of petroleum has hit record levels , so too has the price of asphalt - and the cost of applying it .
Asphalt sold for $ 35 a ton a few years ago , but it 's up to $ 80 and could hit $ 100 .
That has some states are scaling back repaving projects and looking for alternatives .
Asphalt already is one of the most frequently widely recycled products in the country , but switching to cold - mix would allow the use of even more recycled products - which already include rubber , glass and concrete - when producing blacktop .
" Why are we spending so much money on something else ?
I think there 's a very good reason - lack of sufficient knowledge , " Bahia says .
" And our job as a university is to provide the knowledge that will hopefully one day get us there . "

Murdered pair had bright futures Horror descends on quiet street Two French research students found stabbed to death following a flat fire had been tied up and suffered horrific , excessive injuries , police have said .
The bodies of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez , both 23 , were found in a ground - floor flat in New Cross , south - east London , on Sunday night .
They had suffered a total of 243 stab wounds to the head , neck and chest before being set alight .
The biochemistry students had been studying at Imperial College , London .
Det Ch Insp Mick Duthie said he had no idea why the students were killed .
Fiancee 's tribute Speaking at a news conference at Scotland Yard , he said the flat had been broken into six days before and a laptop had been stolen .
He also said a white male was seen running from the scene of the fire , but police have not ruled out the possibility others might have been involved in the murders .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Bonomo's fiancee , Mary Bertez , wrote a tribute to him on the social networking website facebook .
She said : " I will never stop thinking about you for a second .
I had 10 months of a happiness I had never experienced until then .
" Today you are gone .
I will try to be as good as you always wanted .
" I will give all the required information to the investigation , my dear , so you can be avenged . "
Mr Duthie said one line of inquiry was that the attack was a case of mistaken identity .
" We cannot find anything in these two young men 's background to suggest they were involved in any criminality , that they had done anything wrong , " he said .
' Frenzied , horrific attack '
The BBC 's crime correspondent Ben Ando said Mr Bonomo had 196 stab wounds , including 100 to his back , and Mr Ferez had been stabbed 47 times .
He added a chemical was used as an accelerant in the fire .
Mr Duthie said : " The extent of the injuries are horrific .
I have never seen injuries like this throughout my career .
" I would not say this was a professional attack .
I would say it was a frenzied , horrible , horrific attack .
" I imagine it would take some considerable amount of time to inflict the nature of the injuries . "
Mr Bonomo's fiancee Ms Bertez said she will never stop thinking of him
The detective said no weapon had been recovered during extensive searches in the area and police were studying some " limited " CCTV footage .
Mr Duthie said the postgraduate students had been in London since the beginning of May and were due to return to France at the end of July .
Imperial College 's Rector , Sir Roy Anderson , said the students had " bright futures ahead of them " .
The emergency services were called after residents reported an explosion in Sterling Gardens on Sunday night .
Mr Ferez , who lived at another south London address , was visiting his friend when the attack took place .
Mr Duthie said Mr Bonomo was known to be alive in the early hours of Sunday morning because he spoke to his girlfriend in France .
The parents of the two men are in the UK and have had to identify their sons , police said .
Police said Mr Bonomo , of Velaux , and Mr Ferez , of Prouzel , studied in Clermont - Ferrand , central France , and had been chosen to take part in a research project into chains of protein within DNA at Imperial College , which was due to last up to four months .

" On October 21 ( 1948 ) the Government of Israel took a decision that was to have a lasting and divisive effect on the rights and status of those Arabs who lived within its borders : the official establishment of military government in the areas where most of the inhabitants were Arabs . "
– Martin Gilbert , Israel : A History
I had given up on finding an American with a moral conscience and the courage to go with it and was on the verge of retiring my keyboard when I met the Rev. Thomas L. Are .
Rev .
Are is a Presbyterian pastor who used to tell his Atlanta , Georgia , congregation : " I am a Zionist . "
Like most Americans , Rev .
Are had been seduced by Israeli propaganda and helped to spread the propaganda among his congregation .
Around 1990 Rev .
Are had an awakening for which he credits the Christian Canon of St. George ’s Cathedral in Jerusalem and author Marc Ellis , co-editor of the book , Beyond Occupation .
Realizing that his ignorance of the situation on the ground had made him complicit in great crimes , Rev .
Are wrote a book hoping to save others from his mistake and perhaps in part to make amends , Israeli Peace / Palestinian Justice , published in Canada in 1994 .
Rev .
Are researched his subject and wrote a brave book .
Keep in mind that 1994 was long prior to Walt and Mearsheimer ’s recent book , which exposed the power of the Israel Lobby and its ability to control the explanation Americans receive about the " Israeli - Palestinian conflict . "
Rev .
Are begins with an account of Israel ’s opening attack on the Palestinians , an event which took place before most Americans alive today were born .
He quotes the distinguished British historian , Arnold J. Toynbee : " The treatment of the Palestinian Arabs in 1947 ( and 1948 ) was as morally indefensible as the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis .
Though nor comparable in quantity to the crimes of the Nazis , it was comparable in quality . "
Golda Meir , considered by Israelis as a great leader and by others as one of history ’s great killers , disputed the facts : " It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them .
They did not exist . "
Golda Meir ’s apology for Israel ’s great crimes is so counter - factual that it blows the mind .
Palestinian refugee camps still exist outside Palestine filled with Palestinians and their descendants whose towns , villages , homes and lands were seized by the Israelis in 1948 .
Rev .
Are provides the reader with Na’im Ateek ’s description of what happened to him , an 11 - year old , when the Jews came to take Beisan on May 12 , 1948 .
Entire Palestinian communities simply disappeared .
In 1949 the United Nations counted 711,000 Palestinian refugees .
In 2005 the United Nations Relief and Works Agency estimated 4.25 million Palestinians and their descendants were refugees from their homeland .
The Israeli policy of evicting non-Jews has continued for six decades .
On June 19 , 2008 , the Laity Committee in the Holy Land reported in Window Into Palestine that the Israeli Ministry of Interior is taking away the residency rights of Jerusalem Christians who have been reclassified as " visitors in their own city . "
On December 10 , 2007 , MK Ephraim Sneh boasted in the Jerusalem Post that Israel had achieved " a true Zionist victory " over the UN partition plan " which sought to establish two nations in the land of Israel . "
The partition plan had assigned Israel 56 percent of Palestine , leaving the inhabitants with only 44 percent .
But Israel had altered this over time .
Sneh proudly declared : " When we complete the permanent agreement , we will hold 78 percent of the land while the Palestinians will control 22 percent . "
Sneb could have added that the 22 percent is essentially a collection of unconnected ghettos cut off from one another and from roads , water , medical care , and jobs .
Rev .
Are documents that the abuse of Palestinians ’ human rights is official Israeli policy .
Killings , torture , and beatings are routine .
On May 17 , 1990 , the Washington Post reported that Save the Children " documented indiscriminate beating , tear - gassing and shooting of children at home or just outside the house playing in the street , who were sitting in the classroom or going to the store for groceries . "
On January 19 , 1988 , Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin , later Prime Minister , announced the policy of " punitive beating " of Palestinians .
The Israelis described the purpose of punitive beating : " Our task is to recreate a barrier and once again put the fear of death into the Arabs of the area . "
According to Save the Children , beatings of children and women are common .
Rev .
Are , citing the report in the Washington Post , writes : " Save the Children concluded that one - third of beaten children were under ten years old , and one - fifth under the age of five .
Nearly a third of the children beaten suffered broken bones . "
On February 8 , 1988 , Newsweek magazine quoted an Israeli soldier : " We got orders to knock on every door , enter and take out all the males .
The younger ones we lined up with their faces against the wall , and soldiers beat them with billy clubs .
This was no private initiative , these were orders from our company commander … .
After one soldier finished beating a detainee , another soldier called him ‘ you Nazi , ’ and the first man shot back : ‘ You bleeding heart . ’
When one soldier tried to stop another from beating an Arab for no reason , a fist fight broke out . "
These were the old days before conscience was eliminated from the ranks of the Israeli military .
In the London Sunday Times , June 19 , 1977 , Ralph Schoenman , executive director of the Bertrand Russell Foundation , wrote : " Israeli interrogators routinely ill - treat and torture Arab prisoners .
Prisoners are hooded or blindfolded and are hung by their wrists for long periods .
Most are struck in the genitals or in other ways sexually abused .
Most are sexually assaulted .
Others are administered electric shock . "
Amnesty International concluded that " there is no country in the world in which the use of official and sustained torture is as well established and documented as in the case of Israel . "
Even the pro-Israeli Washington
Post reported : " Upon arrest , a detainee undergoes a period of starvation , deprivation of sleep by organized methods and prolonged periods during which the prisoner is made to stand with his hands cuffed and raised , a filthy sack covering the head .
Prisoners are dragged on the ground , beaten with objects , kicked , stripped and placed under ice - cold showers . "
Sounds like Abu Gharib .
There are news reports that Israeli torture experts participated in the torture of the detainees assembled by the American military as part of the Bush Regime ’s propaganda onslaught to convince Americans that Iraq was overflowing with al - Qaeda terrorists .
On July 23 , 2008 , Antiwar.com posted an Iraqi news report that the Iraqi government had released a total of 109,087 Iraqis that the Americans had " detained . "
Obviously , these " terrorist detainees " had been used for the needs of Bush Regime propaganda .
No one will ever know how many of them were abused by Israeli torturers imported by the CIA .
Rev .
Are ’s book makes sensible suggestions for resolving the conflict that Israel began .
However , the problem is that Israeli governments believe only in force .
The policy of the Israeli government has always been to beat , kill , and brutalize Palestinians into submission and flight .
Anyone who doubts this can read the book of Israel ’s finest historian Ilan Pappe , The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine ( 06 ) .
Americans are a gullible and naive people .
They have been complicit for 60 years in crimes that in Arnold Toynbee ’s words " are comparable in quality " to the crimes of Nazi Germany .
As Toynbee was writing decades ago , the accumulated Israeli crimes might now be comparable also in quantity .
The US routinely vetoes United Nations condemnations of Israel for its brutal crimes against the Palestinians .
Insouciant American taxpayers have been bled for a half century to provide the Israelis with superior military weapons with which Israelis assault their neighbors , all the while convincing America  essentially a captive nation  that Israel is the victim .
John F. Mahoney wrote : " Thomas Are reminds me of Dietrich Bonhoeffer : an active pastor who comes to the unsettling realization that he and his people have been fed a terrible lie that is killing and torturing thousands of innocent men , women and children .
Not without ample research and prayer does such a pastor , in turn , risk unsettling his congregation .
The Reverend Are has done his homework and , I suspect , has prayed often and long during the writing of this courageous book . "
Bonhoeffer was a Lutheran theologian and pastor who was executed for his active participation in the German Resistance against Nazism .
Professor Benjamin M. Weir , San Francisco Theological Seminary , wrote : " This book will make the reader squirm .
It asks you to lend your voice in behalf of the voiceless . "
Americans who can no longer think for themselves and who are terrified of disapproval by their peer group are incapable of lending their voices to anyone except those who control the world of propaganda in which they live .
The ignorance and unconcern of Americans is a great frustration to my friends in the Israeli peace movement .
Without outside support those Israelis who believe in good will are deprived , by America ’s support for their government ’s policy of violence , of any peaceful resolution of a conflict began in 1947 by Israeli aggression against unsuspecting Palestinian villages .
Rev .
Are wrote his book with the hope that the pen is mightier than the sword and that facts can crowd out propaganda and create a framework for a just resolution of the Palestinian issue .
In his concluding chapter , " What Christians Can Do , " Rev .
Are writes : " We can not allow others to dictate our thinking on any subject , especially on anything as important as Christian faithfulness , which is tested by an attitude towards seeking justice for the oppressed .
It ’s a Christian ’s duty to know . "
Duty , of course , has costs .
Rev .
Are writes : " Speak up for the Palestinians and you will make enemies .
Yet , as Christians , we must be willing to raise issues that until now we have chosen to dodge . "
More than a decade later , President Jimmy Carter , a true friend of Israel , tried again to awaken Americans ’ moral conscience with his book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid .
Carter was instantly demonized by the Israel Lobby .
Sixty years of efforts by good and humane people to hold Israel accountable have so far failed , but they are more important today than ever before .
Israel has its captive American nation on the verge of attacking Iran , the consequences of which could be catastrophic for all concerned .
The alleged purpose of the attack is to eliminate nonexistent Iranian nuclear weapons .
The real reason is to eliminate all support for Hamas and Hezbollah so that Israel can seize the entire West Bank and southern Lebanon .
The Bush regime is eager to do Israel ’s bidding , and the media and evangelical " Christian " churches have been preparing the American people for the event .
It is paradoxical that Israel is demonstrating that veracity lies not in the Christian belief in good will but in Lenin ’s doctrine that violence is the effective force in history and that the evangelical Christian Zionist churches agree .
Background
We undertook a randomised , double - blinded , placebo - controlled , crossover trial to test whether intake of artificial food colour and additives ( AFCA ) affected childhood behaviour .
Methods
153 3 - year - old and 144 8/9 - year - old children were included in the study .
The challenge drink contained sodium benzoate and one of two AFCA mixes ( A or B ) or a placebo mix .
The main outcome measure was a global hyperactivity aggregate ( GHA ) , based on aggregated z - scores of observed behaviours and ratings by teachers and parents , plus , for 8/9 - year - old children , a computerised test of attention .
This clinical trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials ( registration number ISRCTN74481308 ) .
Analysis was per protocol .
Findings
16 3 - year - old children and 14 8/9 - year - old children did not complete the study , for reasons unrelated to childhood behaviour .
Mix
A had a significantly adverse effect compared with placebo in GHA for all 3 - year - old children ( effect size 0·20 [ 95 % CI 0·01 –0·39 ] , p=0·044 ) but not mix B versus placebo .
This result persisted when analysis was restricted to 3 - year - old children who consumed more than 85 % of juice and had no missing data ( 0·32 [ 0·05–0·60 ] , p=0·02 ) .
8/9 - year - old children showed a significantly adverse effect when given mix A ( 0·12 [ 0·02–0·23 ] , p=0·023 ) or mix B ( 0·17 [ 0·07–0·28 ] , p=0·001 ) when analysis was restricted to those children consuming at least 85 % of drinks with no missing data .
Interpretation
Artificial colours or a sodium benzoate preservative ( or both ) in the diet result in increased hyperactivity in 3 - year - old and 8/9 - year - old children in the general population .
One of the most interesting new features about the electorate that 's coming into sharper focus during this campaign cycle is a certain sector 's use of social networking technologies to achieve its collective social goals .
" There 's a magic combination between people who are passionate about a lot of things on the web , which can act as an engine of social change , and other people ( the experts ) who live and breathe a particular issue .
How do you reach out and build a community around that ? " asks Joshua Levy , the new managing editor of Change.org .
Photo : Joshua Levy
This sector is the so - called Millennial Generation , those who were born between 1982 and 2002 , according to researchers Neil Howe and William Strauss .
You 've already witnessed some of this action underway .
The most prominent example is Barack Obama 's social - networking driven presidential campaign .
One of the defining aspects of this emerging – and sizable – generation is its collective approach to social issues and the rate at which its members volunteer , according to the researchers , whose work and its significance for politics have been chronicled extensively in two new books , " Millennial Makeover : MySpace , YouTube & The Future of American Politics , " and " Youth To Power . "
As if to prove the point , Obama 's online networking has been helped along by
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes , who at 24 is by definition part of this Millennial demographic .
But how can this intent and energy be harnessed and capitalized upon beyond electoral politics ?
That 's a question that 27 - year - old Ben Rattray and his new hire Joshua Levy are attempting to tackle with aptly - named Change.org , an organization that 's banking on a number of trends to try and make social activism more efficient and effective .
Levy joins the organization after two years as associate editor at TechPresident , the blog associated with the annual conference that 's all about technology and politics .
Rattray wants to make it easy for people who want to make lasting social change to find opportunities , and to network with others online .
So , for example , if you want to do something to change the current situation on any given social issue , you 'd go and use Change. org 's search engine to find the non-profits and peers who are interested in the same thing .
Though the group does n't specify that it 's targeting a certain demographic , the civic - minded generation of more than 50 million people will certainly provide a boost to this start - up 's goal of connecting like - minded people around causes that they care about .
And it 's just one out of several emerging kinds of social entrepreneur type of projects , such as the New Progressive Coalition 's , that 's trying to build an infrastructure beyond the election .
The common goal is to capitalize on the energy and let 's - improve - things - without - DC - ethos we 've seen behind the social networking phenomenon .
Change.org currently has 2,000 non-profit groups using its social networking site , Rattray says .
Its next iteration , which Levy has been hired to build , is a blogging network .
" The idea is to translate people 's interest in a social issue to action , " Rattray says .
" There 's a huge opportunity online to create niche media portals about things not often covered in the news . "
Levy will serve as the site 's managing editor .
He 's been charged with hiring 15 bloggers who will be paid a monthly stipend to write about specific issues , such as homelessness , global warming , human trafficking , and so on .
Rattray hopes to have about 50 bloggers by the end of the year .
The project 's goal is to enable people with similar interests in specific areas of social change to congregate in one place and to enable them to contribute , share and hash out ideas both amongst themselves and the non-profit organizations .
Levy says that the project also turns on the idea of asking a large number of busy people to contribute small chunks of time to volunteer – just as
Wikipedia does .
Collectively , that time and expertise that 's focused on a common goal adds up exponentially .
Or at least that 's the hope .
An important Adam Liptak story in today ’s New York Times examines the American exceptionalism of our First Amendment as contrasted with Canada ’s frightening prosecution of Macleans ’s magazine for daring to print opinions that complaining Muslims found offensive .
Our risk in the world today is that we will be reduced to the lowest common denominator of speech as dictated by the worst regime .
Libel tourism is endangering the publication of ideas and reporting that might cost financial damages under other countries ’ wrong - way libel laws .
Google censors its search results in China rather than exerting its moral influence there — do n’t be evil — in favor of free speech .
Except there ’s this :
The internet is the First Amendment brought to life .
Our First Amendment argues that it is both undesirable and impossible to contain speech and the marketplace of ideas .
The internet enforces that idea .
You simply can’t contain speech on it .
Oh , governments will try .
And those who favor rule by the offended will try to make them .
And companies have become accomplices to regimes ’ crimes against speech by handing over speakers ’ identities ( see Yahoo in China and Google in India ) .
These are , of course , the areas where anonymity has its place ( the ethic of identity in these cases is protecting the identity of speakers ) .
So we can treat the First Amendment and the moral of speech as exceptionalism , because it has been .
Or we can recognize that the internet offers the openness of speech to anyone anywhere , though not without risk , and we who have this privilege can make it our mission to educate others about the inevitability and benefits of free speech .

It can be argued that Microsoft 's main focus with Windows Vista was security .
While sceptics try to claim that there has not been much improvement , Vista does appear to be Microsoft 's most secure OS to date .
Nevertheless , it 's far from perfect , and not only on the security front .
While many tests show that Vista outperforms XP on some high - end computers , the average computer system does not run Windows Vista as well as it does Windows XP .
This will of course change as the average computer becomes more powerful and as Microsoft tweaks the operating system ( SP1 already offers some help ) , but the fact of the matter is that Vista is recognized as a slow operating system .
Many have therefore turned their hopes to Windows 7 .
Maybe , just maybe , Microsoft will not increase the minimum requirements as it did from Windows XP to Windows Vista .
Considering that Microsoft hopes to get Windows 7 out the door faster than it did with Vista ( which came out six years after XP , compared to the typical three ) this is entirely possible , and Bill Gates has all but confirmed that Windows 7 will focus on performance improvements :
We 're hard at work , I would say , on the next version , which we call Windows 7 .
I 'm very excited about the work being done there .
The ability to be lower power , take less memory , be more efficient , and have lots more connections up to the mobile phone , so those scenarios connect up well to make it a great platform for the best gaming that can be done , to connect up to the thing being done out on the Internet , so that , for example , if you have two personal computers , that your files automatically are synchronized between them , and so you do n't have a lot of work to move that data back and forth .
One must remember though : Windows 7 is still in the development stage and Bill Gates touched upon a lot more than just performance improvements for Windows in his high - hopes speech at the Windows Digital Lifestyle Consortium in Japan .
Windows 7 will undoubtedly have problems , but for some reason ( crazy optimism ?
lack of sleep ? )
I have much higher expectations for this release than I did for Vista .
That might be because Steve Sinofsky , who previously headed up the Office 2007 project , is in charge .

Last year , I took a position as the “ Director of IT Services ” for a tiny , six - person e-commerce company .
The fact that I would n’t be managing anyone should have been a red flag , but I hoped that I could get approval down the road to build a real IT department .
It did n’t take me too long to figure out what a hellhole this company was .
The owners were a husband - wife team , though The Wife was the “ legal owner ” so the company would be woman - owned ( and therefore eligible for minority business status ) .
And they were cheap .
Really cheap .
All the computers were refurbished , 5 - year old machines that they got from a liquidation auction or something .
The computers ran Office 2000 off of what appeared to be pirated discs , although the owners assured me that they purchased them legit at the auction .
The network consisted of an almost ten - year old domain controller running Windows 2000 that nobody used and various five - port Linksys hubs strewn about the office to connect computers .
They were too cheap to pay for hot water .
That ’s right , we had no hot water in the office .
I asked about this one day and , without skipping a beat , my boss ( The Husband ) said “ Hot water costs MONEY ! ”
The system they used to run their business was a cesspit of spaghetti VBScript / Classic ASP code that was based on an open - source package called Comersus .
They spent a hefty sum of $ 200 for it .
I can only guess that their rationale was they could buy a bare - bones package and then pay a programmer to make it better .
Unfortunately for them , the person they hired , my predecessor , seemed to know as much VBScript as it took to read a “ Teach Yourself VBScript In 24 Hours ” book .
Which happened to be about as much VBSscript that the author of Comersus knew , as the code was very similar : a textbook example of cargo - cult programming at its best ( or worst , in this case ) .
The code was not commented at all , used cryptic variable names ( seemingly all without vowels ) and had zero indentation , especially when it came to nested statements .
Oh , and there was over 15,000 files .
To complicate matters even more , the company had “ licensed their technology ” to another company in the same line of business .
This partnership consisted of my company doing all the processing work , and the other company ... well , I never did figure out what they actually did .
My predecessor tackled this partnership by creating a copy of our database and site , and renaming some twenty - four configuration values in “ tbl_settings ” to reflect this other company .
This , of course , meant that there were now some 30,000 files floating about , and that any change I made to fix one site had to be repeated with the other site .
Perhaps the worst part of the site(s ) is that it was originally designed to be bilingual ( English and Spanish ) .
To accomplish this , there is a “ languages.asp ” file that contained ... you guessed it , a dictionary object mapping certain sections to the equivalent words in English / Spanish .
This lead to code snippets such as the following :
Response . Write dictLanguage ( " prod_view_45 " ) & " : " & dictLanguage ( " currsymbl " ) & prce
Obviously , “ prod_view_45 ” is the string “ Your price . ”
Of course , the site is actually English - only , but my predecessor never bothered to change this , making even a mundane fix a matter of hunting through hundreds of random strings .
On the business end , both companies sold products to the federal government by “ utilizing ” their minority status : by federal law , a certain percentage of business must be given to minority - owned businesses .
It should come as no surprise , however , that there was absolutely no business process and certainly no workflow for how to get things done .
The entire operation was basically a fly - by - the - seat - of - your - pants sort of thing , and my daily work ended up consisting 90 % of running reports for The Husband so that he could make up different pricing .
I brought up the issue of trying to establish a workflow to avoid just dropping things in my lap , but he said that their simply was n’t time for that due to the restrictions .
On top of that , even a simple bug took days to fix due to the convoluted mess that was the code , and most of my programming tasks were aborted because it “ took too long to fix . ”
I tried again to explain the concept of “ technical debt ” and how bad the code was , but my concerns were dismissed .
The last straw came in preparation for a deal with the Air Force .
In a fit of brilliance , The Husband decided that we would offer exactly the same line item they requested .
If they wanted “ 12 notebooks ” , we would create a “ new ” item called “ Notebooks , Package of 12 ” instead of selling them twelve individual notebooks .
As you might imagine , this involved all sorts of special pricing , which then had to go through several different channels because it was sold to the government .
On the first attempt of getting this set up , The Husband mistakenly told me to change the wrong pricing file and then completely exploded when I followed his instruction and changed the wrong pricing file .
He screamed profanities at me , and said how everyone in the office ( except for himself and The Wife ) did n’t know anything and was a complete screw - up ( he used a somewhat more vulgar term ) .
In the end , fearing another blowup , not wanting to deal with a company that had no idea what they were doing , and had no desire to change , I gave my two - weeks notice and resigned .
While I did n’t have another job lined when I quit , I did learn a valuable lesson .
Next time , make sure your prospective employer pays for hot water .
East Germany ( TGW ) –
The world ’s largest thin film solar farm , built by Juwi , has begun operation in Germany at the Waldponez Solar Park .
The power plant was built on the site of a former East German air base and has the surface area equivalent to 200 soccer fields .
Though the farm is not yet fully operational , it will be by 2009 , when it will be able to produce 40 megawatts of electricity .
The facility will use 550,000 thin film modules , of which 350,000 have already been installed .

A woman , who was dubbed " serial womb raider " , has been arrested , after she cut a newborn baby from a mother and then claimed that she was the one to give birth to the baby .
The name of the woman is Andrea Curry - Demus , she is 38 - years old .
After the crime she went to a US hospital and said that she had just gave birth to a baby .
The hospital staff noticed that the umbilical cord of the baby was still attached , and that the infant had not yet been cleaned up .
Shortly after that , doctors discovered that Curry - Demus was not the baby 's mother and later she claimed that she bought the baby from a friend , who received 500 pounds .
Curry - Demus ' neighbors noticed a strange smell that came out of the woman 's apartment , located in Wilkinsburg , Pennsylvania .
It is worth mentioning that the woman already had the history of attempting to steal newborn babies .
After breaking into her apartment , the police found the body of Kia Johnson , who was tied up with a duct tape .
There was evidence that she had been drugged .
Kia Johnson was discovered with her uterus sliced open .
According to authorities , the woman was nearly at full term pregnancy .
Authorities also mentioned that Johnson had been partly eviscerated and most of her internal organs were removed .
The country coroner said that police found a placenta at the crime scene .
After a short court appearance Andrea Curry - Demus was found guilty of child endangerment and trading newborns .
Besides being held on 5,000 pounds , the court stated that the woman must undergo psychiatric tests .
In 1990s , the woman was pleaded guilty of kidnapping a newborn and stabbing a pregnant woman in order to steal her unborn baby .
According to the court records , Curry - Demus had a miscarriage when she was 12 and in 1990 , being aged 21 , she got married for a second time .
The current incident resembles another crime that occurred last month when a woman had her baby stolen by Sisouvanh Synhavong , after the two got acknowledged on a bus .
The 23 - year old Synhavong kidnapped the pregnant Araceli Gomez , 27 .
Afterwards the woman was tied up and gagged , before Synhavong sliced open Gomez 's womb to steal the baby .
If convicted , the woman will face death penalty , being accused of first degree murder .

Interestingly , in defense of his own article , Luttwak sent me an analysis of it by a scholar of Muslim law whom he did not identify .
That scholar also did not agree with Luttwak that Obama was an apostate or that Muslim law would prohibit punishment for any Muslim who killed an apostate .
He wrote , “ You seem to be describing some anarcho - utopian version of Islamic legalism , which has never existed , and after the birth of the modern nation state will never exist . ”

Chuck Kennedy / McClatchy - Tribune
Luttwak made several sweeping statements that the scholars I interviewed said were incorrect or highly debatable , including assertions that in Islam a father ’s religion always determines a child ’s , regardless of the facts of his upbringing ; that Obama ’s “ conversion ” to Christianity was apostasy ; that apostasy is , with few exceptions , a capital crime ; and that a Muslim could not be punished for killing an apostate .
Obama was born in Hawaii to a mother from Kansas with Christian roots and a Kenyan father whose own father had converted to Islam .
When Obama was a toddler , his father left the family .
His mother later married an Indonesian Muslim , and Obama spent five years in Jakarta , where he attended Catholic and Muslim schools and , according to The Los Angeles Times , was enrolled in the third and fourth grades as a Muslim .
Luttwak wrote that given those facts , Obama was a Muslim and his mother ’s Christian background was irrelevant .
But Sherman A. Jackson , a professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Michigan , cited an ancient Islamic jurist , Ibn al - Qasim , who said , “ If you divorce a Christian woman and ignore your child from her to the point that the child grows up to be a Christian , the child is to be left , ” meaning left to make his own choice .
Jackson said that there was not total agreement among Islamic jurists on the point , but Luttwak ’s assertion to the contrary was wrong .
Khaled Abou El Fadl , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , School of Law , said the majority opinion among Islamic jurists is that the law of apostasy can apply only to individuals who knowingly decide to be Muslims and later renege .
One school of thought , he said , is that an individual must be at least a teenager to make the choice .
Obama ’s campaign told The Los Angeles Times last year that he “ has never been a practicing Muslim . ”
As a young adult , he chose to be baptized as a Christian .
Abdullahi Ahmed An - Na’im , a professor of law at Emory University , said that Sharia , or Islamic law , including the law of apostasy , does not apply to an American or anyone outside the Muslim world .
Of the more than 40 countries where Muslims are the majority , he said , Sharia is the official legal system only in Saudi Arabia and Iran , and even there apostasy is unevenly prosecuted , and apostates often wind up in prison , not executed .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A new era for the U.S. government 's takeover of failed banks is about to begin .
IndyMac Bancorp Inc. became the biggest casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis over the weekend , as federal regulators shut down the troubled Pasadena , Calif . - based savings bank in one of the largest U.S. bank failures ever .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a statement it will take over operations of IndyMac IMB , +1.48 % , which will open for business on Monday as IndyMac Federal Bank .
The thrift - the fifth U.S. bank to fail so far this year -- had total assets of $ 32 billion as of March 31 .
In a televised statement Sunday afternoon , FDIC Chief Operating Officer John Bovenzi said that " come Monday morning , it will be business as usual , " and urged customers to " view this as a change in ownership . "
Bovenzi described the FDIC takeover as " orderly . "
Much of IndyMac 's business was built on so - called Alt - A single family mortgages , which were often made to borrowers with poor credit .
As the secondary market for these loans collapsed , IndyMac 's financial condition turned precarious .
" IndyMac has been in trouble for a long time , in part because of the way it funded itself with a large reliance on broker deposits , interest - rate sensitive deposits , and Alt - A mortgage lending , " said Bert Ely , a banking consultant in Alexandria , Va .
IndyMac is the third - largest financial institution to fail in U.S. history , according to the Office of Thrift Supervision , which had regulated IndyMac .
Regulators said the " immediate cause " of IndyMac 's failure was a deposit run in recent days that began after a June 26 letter to the OTS and the FDIC from New York Senator Charles Schumer was made public .
The letter voiced concerns about IndyMac 's soundness .
By July 10 , depositors had pulled more than $ 1.3 billion from their accounts , the OTS said in a statement .
" The institution failed today due to a liquidity crisis , " said OTS Director John Reich .
" Although this institution was already in distress , I am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process . "
But Schumer was n't having it , telling the Wall Street Journal that if OTS " had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac 's poor and loose lending practices continue , we would n't be where we are today . "
Instead of " pointing false fingers of blame , OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs , " he said .
Serious questions about IndyMac 's viability had surfaced earlier this week , when the bank reported that regulators said that its business was no longer " well capitalized . "
The company had agreed to a new business plan with regulators that included halting new mortgages to shrink its balance sheet and improve capital ratios , while announcing it would cut more than half of its workforce .
See related story .
Ely said that while Schumer 's letter did have an impact , IndyMac 's collapse was only a matter of time .
" What Schumer did was wrong and irresponsible , and I 'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish , " Ely noted .
" But IndyMac was already well - known to be a forthcoming failure . "
For the bank 's patrons , their principal and interest on insured accounts are covered by the FDIC up to at least $ 100,000 with some entitlements and accounts covered for more .
IRA funds are insured up to $ 250,000 .
The failure of IndyMac is going to blow a big hole in the FDIC 's cash reserves , costing between $ 4 billion and $ 8 billion - or potentially more than a tenth of its deposit - insurance fund .
It will rank as the third largest bank failure ever in the U.S. -- and the biggest in two decades -- following those of Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. , which went down in 1984 , and the collapse four years later of the American Savings & Loan Association of Stockton , Calif .
Shares of IndyMac fell more than 60 % after hours , to 11 cents .
A year ago , the stock traded as high as $ 29.91 .

A more typical American scene would be hard to imagine : a young mother and her daughter in Wal - Mart .
Yet as she pushed the shopping cart with the 4 - year - old Esther Miriam sitting , princesslike , in the child ’s seat , Sterna Gittel Grunwald ( call her Gitty ) , her five - one frame nicely defined in snug black jeans and white cotton shirt , kept an eye out for spies .
The Satmar Hasidim from Kiryas Joel , the Catskill village where the now - 23 - year - old Gitty grew up , only came to Wal - Mart for the big sales .
There was something about the store ’s dizzying display of cheesy American choice that made the townspeople nervous , Gitty thought .
But still , in KJ , you could never be too paranoid .
Once , when Esther Miriam was a baby , Gitty took her for a walk .
“ A guy looked into the carriage , ” Gitty recalls .
“ He said how cute Esther Miriam was and went on his way .
“ It was nice .
But then these three minivans come tearing down the street .
Hasids jump out and surround me , screaming , ‘ Who was that guy ?
What did he want ? ’ ”
It was the Vaad Hatznius , Kiryas Joel ’s “ moral police , ” whom Gitty refers to as “ those stupid Talibans . ”
Mostly , the Vaads write down the license plates of people who drive on Shabbos and note which women enter the Landau supermarket with their legs insufficiently covered .
But if someone ratted on you , the Vaads might come to your house to see if you were watching porn on that DVD hidden under the bed .
In Kiryas Joel , Gitty says , they think there ’s no reason to have a DVD except to watch porn .
“ They call it the holy shtetl , ” Gitty said , rolling her matchless pale - green eyes as she talks about her former hometown , where the streets are named for famous rabbis and European Hasidic settlements .
When KJ was founded in 1977 by the Satmar grand rebbe Joel Teitelbaum — Kiryas Joel means Joel ’s Village in Yiddish — holiness was the goal .
Like Moses before him , Rebbe Teitelbaum had led the Satmars from the shadow of Auschwitz to the Williamsburg promised land , where they thrived , becoming the largest Hasidic sect in the world .
But Williamsburg could be noisy and cruel , with the thrum of the BQE and Puerto Ricans on the street .
Kiryas Joel , an incorporated village within the town of Monroe 50 miles up the Thruway , would be a sanctuary .
In Kiryas Joel , a Jew could live as he did in eighteenth - century Europe , where the great sage the Baal Shem Tov first articulated the mystic , ecstatic path to G-d that would evolve into modern - day Hasidism .
Here , a scholar could think of nothing but Torah amid the bounty of Creation .
Only 3 when her mother , Deborah , a former hippie and the child of secular New York Jews , first came to KJ as a bal tshuva , or Jew returning to orthodoxy , Gitty would reach her late teens before she realized she was living in perhaps the most religiously conservative community in America .
“ In my parents ’ house , there ’s no TV , no radio , no newspapers not in Yiddish , no Internet , ” Gitty says .
“ We were n’t supposed to pay any attention to the outside world . ”
Indeed , even today , a year and a half after fleeing KJ , in one short conversation , Gitty evidenced unfamiliarity with Che Guevara , Michael Jordan , Mike Tyson , Dolly Parton , and Keith Richards .
It was only after her arranged marriage , at age 17 , to Joel — nicknamed Yoely — Grunwald , another Kiryas Joel teenager , who would become Esther Miriam ’s father , that Gitty knew “ I could n’t live in KJ anymore , that I did n’t want to be one of those women who pop out babies every eighteen months and think whatever their husbands tell them to …
When Esther Miriam was born , that raised the stakes , because now there were two of us .
Two KJ girls . ”
In early 2007 , Gitty fled Kiryas Joel for good , taking Esther Miriam with her .
At first , they lived in the relatively relaxed frum ( Orthodox ) community of Monsey , New York , then moved to Brooklyn .
“ It was just the two of us .
I loved it , ” Gitty says .
Then in January of this year , as Esther Miriam was walked with her class to a Flatbush playground , she was taken , says Gitty , who believes her husband was behind the act .
“ Some KJ guys snatched her off the street .
Esther Miriam said they were wearing masks .
All she remembers was crying , crying so hard , ” Gitty says , calling it the worst day of her life .
“ When they told me what happened , I could n’t breathe .
I felt like I was being suffocated .
I still do . ”
Since then , Esther Miriam has been in KJ , at times in the house of Yoely ’s parents , as Gitty works through the courts , both secular and rabbinical , to try to regain custody of her daughter .
For the time being , Gitty says , “ Yoely calls the shots , when I can see my daughter and where . ”
That ’s why Gitty was nervous taking Esther Miriam to Wal - Mart .
Yoely had decreed the store off - limits .

Beelining through the toy department , Gitty halted in front of the towering Play - Doh display , hastily tossing three packages of the faux clay into the steel - mesh cart .
The $ 30 cost , added to the $ 20 price of the already picked - out Barbie , would clean out Gitty for the week , but there was little choice .
She was desperate to get Esther Miriam something .
Gitty had n’t seen her daughter for almost three weeks , and the way things were going , she did n’t know when she ’d see her again .
Turning from the Play - Doh , Esther Miriam began admiring a pair of pink ballet slippers .
This was a problem , since in KJ pink ballet slippers are not considered appropriate for little girls , who wear navy - blue or black flats .
Such shoes are in keeping with the community ’s idea of tznius , or modesty .
In KJ , where it is considered a disaster for a man to see a woman ’s uncovered hair , Esther Miriam ’s wearing pink ballet slippers could be tantamount to a chilul hashem , an affront to G-d .
“ Know what Esther Miriam told me ? ” Gitty railed .
“ If G - d sees you with your legs uncovered , you go to hell .
She ’s 4 years old , worrying about hell !
My own daughter ! ”
This was how it was in KJ , Gitty said , where even your parents would turn on you if you were n’t religious enough .
Gitty points to what happened when she went to the beth din , the Satmar rabbinical court , trying to win custody of Esther Miriam .
“ Big chance I had , ” Gitty declared .
“ My mother and stepfather would n’t support me .
So there I am , this silly little irreligious girl , all by myself .
I ’d been brought up to revere these rabbis .
And they ’re looking at me like I ’m a goy .
Worse than a goy , because I ’m trying to take a Jewish girl away from the religion .
In KJ , they think I ’ll turn Esther Miriam into a prostitute .
They tell her I ’m dead . ”
Still , it did n’t pay to give Yoely any more ammunition .
So , no : Esther Miriam would not get her ballet slippers .
“ Tateh , ” Gitty said to Esther Miriam , using the Yiddish familiar term for daddy , as she placed the slippers back on the shelf , “ would n’t like it . ”
After Wal - Mart , the plan was for Gitty to drop Esther Miriam at Hershey ’s Auto , where Yoely Grunwald sells many of KJ ’s ubiquitous minivans and SUVs .
Gitty was due by 6:30 but was running late .
This was a problem because it was Friday afternoon .
At sunset , an hour away now , a siren would sound throughout the town announcing the arrival of Shabbos .
At this point , all everyday activity in KJ would cease .
By KJ ’s main shopping center , spring rain falling , the urgency was obvious .
Rushing to prepare for the holiday , dozens of vans jockeyed for position amid the puddles in the parking lot , taillights flashing wildly , horns permanently engaged .
“ Shit .
They ’re making us late , ” Gitty said , offering a running commentary on Satmar driving etiquette , which , like all Hasidic social skills , she believes , is nonexistent .
The fact is KJ is simply too crowded for two - lane roads and dinky parking lots .
As anyone driving in Midwood or Kew Gardens knows , the exploding haredi population has extended far beyond the familiar boundaries of Crown Heights and Williamsburg .
Everywhere you look is a black hat , the various sects named for their town of origin , the Bobov from Bobowa in the former Galicia , the Belz from Belz in Ukraine — and the Satmars from Satu Mare , in present - day Romania — each group with their dynastically determined rebbe and variation on basic Hasidic dress .
Still , Kiryas Joel stands alone .
Over the past six years , this self - contained village , where families with ten children are not unusual , has been one of the fastest - growing communities of its size in New York State , with one of the youngest median ages ( 15 ) .
Rebbe Teitelbaum ’s vision of a bucolic retreat has dissolved in the boomtown sprawl of nearly identical four - story aluminum - sided condos off the north end of the 208 exit off Route 17 .
Every day , buses make the run to Williamsburg , a curtain down the middle aisle to separate the men from the women .
By the time Gitty reached Hershey ’s Auto , it was pouring .
Yoely , a bearded , vaguely paunchy man in his middle twenties , was pacing the car lot , his white shirt soaked and sticking to his stomach .
When he saw Gitty , he jabbed his finger toward his watch .
Gitty will never forget the moment she first laid eyes on Yoely Grunwald .
She was past her 17th birthday when her parents told her they had arranged for her marriage .
“ Ca n’t I see him first ? ” Gitty asked .
“ Sure , ” they said , “ look out the window . ”
“ He was walking down the street with a rabbi beside him .
He was looking down , so I could n’t see his face .
He walked around a minute , then turned around and walked away .
Everyone said , ‘ Okay , you saw him . ’ ”

In the parking lot , the passage of child from parent to parent took place almost without comment .
Gitty handed over the Play - Doh .
Esther Miriam got out of the car .
Gitty wanted to get out , too , give her daughter one more kiss , but she could n’t .
She was wearing pants .
For a KJ man to see a KJ woman wearing pants is a terrible thing , one more violation of tznius .
In a moment , Yoely had the little girl in his arms and was making his way to his car .
“ I love you , Esther Miriam .
Mommy loves you , ” Gitty shouted as the waving child and father disappeared into the crowd of Satmars scurrying through the rain .
Gitty sat staring at the rise and fall of the windshield wipers , “ more or less numb . ”
She had been raised to be a Satmar woman , and she remains one to a large degree .
Satmar women are supposed to be tough .
You could n’t expect some delicate flower to have eight or nine babies by the time she turned 30 .
Several of Gitty ’s classmates are already on their fourth kid .
Gitty was tough .
Through the depressing court appearances , each time Yoely ’s mother hung up on her when she called to talk to Esther Miriam , Gitty kept it together .
But like the KJ women Gitty says were quietly going crazy bearing all those children , she found there was a time when toughness became numbness .
It was something you had to fight against .
“ Leaving KJ cost me a lot .
It cost me my daughter , ” Gitty finally said , the rain beating down on the car roof .
“ But I ’m going to get her back . ”
Right then , Gitty ’s eyes fell to a container of Pringles on the car floor .
Gitty bought the chips for Esther Miriam in Wal - Mart , noting the OUD on the label , which means the Orthodox Union had certified the product as “ kosher dairy . ”
During their marriage , Gitty and Yoely fought about whether OUD was kosher enough .
Yoely said no , because OUD did not positively guarantee that any milk used was obtained by Jewish hands .
When he saw the OUD on the Pringles can , Yoely dropped it like it was hot .
Gitty looked mournfully at the chips .
“ Esther Miriam really wanted those Pringles , ” she said .
“ They ’re looking at me like I ’m a goy , ” says Gitty .
“ Worse than a goy , because I ’m trying to take a Jewish girl away from the religion . ”
If you call Gitty ’s grandparents , Matty and Carol Feinman , New York Jews , they do not object .
“ We ’re Jews .
We live in New York .
What else should we be ? ” asks Carol Feinman , still wry and sassy in her eighties as she sits in the Feinmans ’ typically rambling Washington Heights apartment .
The Feinmans ’ secular , intellectual , liberal , mordantly humorous New York Jew pedigree is pure , with a bohemian tilt .
Matty , also in his eighties , got kicked out of Brooklyn Tech , joined the Navy , came back to New York , got his teacher ’s license , and taught at Music and Art high school when it used to be on Convent Avenue in Harlem and was , as any early - sixties boy will tell you , home to the coolest ( Jewish and otherwise ) girls in the city .
Now legally blind , Matty still paints every day — he ’s especially interested in Photoshopping abstract images — in his studio that juts out over Riverside Drive .
“ Trying to make something to look at , every day , that ’s it , for me , ” Matty says .
For years , Carol Feinman did PR work downtown for “ big - shot musicians , ” including Ella Fitzgerald .
A singer herself , Carol still dresses up to perform at open - mike nights on Bleecker Street , doing mostly Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan standards .
Cut from a similar cloth of New York Jew–dom , I recognize , and embrace , people like Matty and Carol Feinman .
And , like the Feinmans , I remember when it was an event to see a Hasid , even in Brooklyn .
Back in the middle to late fifties , as my parents and I drove up Eastern Parkway to visit my grandparents , should a Hasid pass by , my mother rarely failed to comment .
“ What is with these getups , are n’t they hot ? …
Do n’t they know this is n’t Poland ?
It ’s enough to make you plotz , ” she ’d say .
“ What business is it of yours what they do ? ” rejoined my father , never one for extended conversations .
This was barely a decade after the war , before the word Holocaust , with the big H , had become commonplace .
My father fought in the Battle of the Bulge , he was in Patton ’s Third Army , which later liberated Buchenwald .
He knew .
But it was n’t anything you wanted to talk about , especially to your snot - nose son .
Better he should roam carefree in the vacant lots of Flushing , a little pisher with a Ted Kluszewski mitt , unfettered by memory ’s chokehold .
Who needed these musty Kafka characters , dragging behind them the heavy chains of history ?
But there was also a pride — a civic / ethnic / fuck - the - Nazis pride — in the presence of these ragtag scholars , clutching their prayer books in front of the Loew ’s Kameo Theatre .
Here in New York — our New York !— a
Jew would always be safe .
So what if they screwed like bunnies through a hole in a sheet ?
Was n’t the world a little short of Jews at the moment ?
Besides , someone had to think about G-d all the time , even here , in this new land of two - car garages , baseball , and Reform temples .

Now , however , with their real - estate wealth , bloc-voting political power , and sheer numbers , the Hasidic expansion suggests a question .
With the fracture of the old - time - liberal , Democratic - voting , Chinese - food - eating , Alfred Kazin–Norman Mailer–Woody Allen–style intellectual , pre-Seinfeld New York Jew — you do n’t really suppose Mike Bloomberg falls in the same category as Ed Koch or Abe Beame , do you ?— could the black hats be the new face of the tribe ?
The new New York Jew ?
“ Over my dead body ! ” declares Matty Feinman , who wonders if , for all their endless Halacha , the people in Kiryas Joel are even Jews at all , much less from New York .
“ They ’re a cult !
They do n’t believe in science .
They hate art .
They hate literature .
They do n’t pay taxes .
For me , to be a Jew is to be curious , compassionate with others .
These guys only care about themselves . ”
This was something Matty knew from “ personal experience . ”
The Feinmans have three children .
Their son is openly gay .
The Feinmans are very proud of him .
One of their daughters adopted two children of color .
The Feinmans love the kids to death .
Their other daughter , Gitty ’s mother , the former Deborah Feinman , joined the Hasidic movement .
This has been no end of trouble .
“ Deborah is the last person I thought would get involved in this , ” says Carol Feinman .
“ She had such an artistic spirit … but she ’s someone who needs structure .
When she first went with the Hasidim , I thought , well , at least they ’re Jewish . ”
Things went off the track when Deborah brought home Chaim Kalfa , the Lubavitcher who would become Gitty ’s father .
“ A real beauty , that one .
Once , he came in , walked right to the refrigerator , and started throwing things out .
I said , ‘ What are doing ?
I just bought that . ’
They said it was n’t kosher .
Matty had painted this picture of his friend , a black man , in an undershirt .
They wanted us to turn the picture to the wall , that it was n’t modest .
Matty said , ‘ Wait a minute , that ’s my friend ! ’ ”
Matty Feinman picks up the story : “ One night , Chaim says to meet him at Columbus Circle so we can settle this once and for all .
I went on the subway with a chinning bar stuck into my pants .
The cops had to come .
The guy was crazy .
Violent .
Abusive .
Last I heard , he was in Israel riding a donkey , yelling about Rebbe Schneerson being Jesus Christ . ”
Following the dissolution of her marriage to Chaim , Deborah left the Lubavitchers , taking Gitty and her two siblings to join the austere Satmars in Kiryas Joel , where she married Avrum Schwartz and had three more children .
While thankful the Satmars took Deborah in , Matty saw little improvement .
“ The Lubavitchers , they have a joy about them .
The Satmars are nuts .
They tell you the State of Israel should n’t exist because the Messiah has n’t come yet , that the Holocaust was God ’s way of punishing Jews for Zionism .
It makes you sick . ”
Matty and Carol visited their grandchildren in KJ , but it was always an unsettling experience .
“ Once I got up in the night and turned on the light .
I forgot it was Shabbos , ” says Carol .
“ They ’re yelling , ‘ You turned on the light ! ’
‘ I ’m sorry , ’ I said , ‘ I ’ll turn it off . ’
‘ No !
Do n’t turn it off !’ they screamed .
I had to go outside in the dead of winter to flag down one of the cops they hire to do things on Shabbos . ”
Carol and Matty were eventually banned from Deborah ’s house .
On one of their last visits , Matty saw one of Gitty ’s young stepbrothers regarding him warily .
“ The kid says , ‘ Dis is a Yid ? ’
I felt like screaming , ‘ Yeah , for 70 goddamn years ! ’
But it would n’t have done any good . ”
Gitty ’s situation with Esther Miriam has brought back much of Matty ’s rage .
“ They want such big families , but their way of being a Jew has ripped this family apart , ” he says .
“ Deborah has gotten the worst of it . ”
In the past few years , Gitty ’s brother and sister — Chaim ’s other two children — have also left KJ .
“ She ’s lost three children because of this . ”
Now the pain had extended to another generation .
Carol and Matty sigh .
No one really wants to go over these sad memories again .
Carol Feinman has one last thing to say .
“ There was this one Hanukkah , ” she says evenly .
“ We were going to have a party and invited Deborah .
I did n’t think she ’d come , but she sounded excited about it .
I was really hopeful .
Then she calls back with a lot of questions about who ’s going to be there , if there were going to be any non-Jews .
I said , ‘ Probably . ’
She comes , and everyone is happy to see her … but at dinner , she does n’t join us at the table .
She ’s got her face to the wall , and she ’s praying .
This is what the Satmar rebbe told her to do if she had to sit down with non-Jews :
Face the wall and pray .

“ That ’s when I knew I ’d lost my daughter .
That she was gone . ”
Deborah Feinman Schwartz stands on her back porch in Kiryas Joel holding open the kitchen door .
In different circumstances , the two of us , Deborah and me , from the same generation of New York Jews , might have had things to talk about .
“ She was a real hippie , ” Gitty says of her mother .
You could see it , too , through the haphazard turban on her head , the blanketlike smock over her shoulders , and red-rimmed eyes : the young Deborah Feinman , getting off the IND at West 4th Street , one of those girls with a guitar and an unavailable look .
Deborah , however , was not of a mind to discuss her life story .
Communication came in fits and starts .
Once , after hearing Gitty talk about Matty and Carol , Deborah replied , “ Sure , Bubbe and Zaidy are great , until they start making you take all those music lessons . ”
Her parents , Deborah said , “ never accepted my path . ”
Another time , leaning in the car window , inquiring why a married man of 60 was hanging out with her 23 - year - old daughter , Deborah stopped in mid-sentence .
“ Elvis Presley , ” she said .
I had n’t even noticed “ Are You Lonesome Tonight ? ” playing , at low volume , on the iPod .
But right then , Avrum , Gitty ’s stepfather , pulled up in his van , stopping all conversation .
“ See my mother just shut up ? ” Gitty said later .
“ She ’s under his thumb .
She does everything he says . ”
My invitation to Deborah ’s kitchen was a product of much negotiation .
Gitty wanted to come upstairs , but again , in the spirit of her stubborn , unfinished rebellion , she was wearing pants .
It was decided that I would go upstairs , get a skirt , and bring it down so Gitty could modestly walk the 50 steps from the parking lot to the apartment door .
“ Wait here , ” Deborah said , leaving the room .
The Schwartz family kitchen was in a transitional state .
Foodstuffs , on their way in or out depending on their “ kosher for Passover ” status , sat on counters and in open cabinets .
Three stoves were arranged at odd angles .
In the adjacent living room was a dark - wood cabinet with a sparse selection of prayer books on the shelves .
While her brothers studied Torah at the yeshiva as much as fifteen hours a day , Gitty often did her homework here , memorizing the tenets of concepts like yichud , or “ aloneness , ” such as when it was appropriate for an unmarried Satmar male to be alone in the presence of an unmarried Satmar female .
It was also in school , looking at textbooks with large sections blacked out , that young Satmars learned there was no such thing as evolution , that dinosaur bones are nothing but G - d ’s inference of an inaccessible past world , and that stars in the skies are not stars at all but pinpricks of light in a vast scrim placed by G-d for the Jews to gaze upon as they made their passage through the profane world , a world due to expire with the coming of the seventh Hebrew millennium , now 232 years away .
Gitty ’s formal schooling ended when she became engaged to Yoely .
In the KJ tradition , she now was ready to raise a family .
Deborah returned to the kitchen after about fifteen minutes .
Making a point of looking around her apartment , the manifestation of her life in KJ , she leveled her gaze at me .
“ People make choices , ” Deborah said , handing me the skirt .
Back at the car , Gitty wanted to know what took so long .
Then , she frowned .
“ My mother hemmed the skirt ! ” she exclaimed .
You see , Gitty had worn the skirt before .
It was long enough to reach the floor , which seemed to fulfill every criteria of tznius except one : “ I looked good in it , ” Gitty said .
“ See where my mother hemmed it ?
At the ugliest possible length this skirt could ever be . ”
This was the essence of the KJ aesthetic , Gitty said .
Deborah says Gitty ’s decision to talk about her life in Kiryas Joel is “ the act of a disgruntled , ungrateful kid , someone we tried to help but refused help . ”
Questioning Gitty ’s maturity , Deborah says , “ My daughter is not a mensch .
Instead of stepping on everyone else ’s head , she should take responsibility for herself . ”
Asked if there was any place for Gitty in KJ if she was not religious , Deborah says , “ She should stop blaming religion and trying to make us monsters . ”
Hearing this , Gitty says , “ just pisses me off . ”
Nonetheless , she ’ll always love her mother no matter what , even if much of that love is mixed with rachmonus , which is Yiddish for pity .
“ I know what she goes through , ” Gitty says , recalling the time when she was 10 and Deborah took her , along with her brother and sister , and left KJ .
“ She was running away , ” Gitty says .
“ We stayed a couple of weeks at a time in different places , like refugees . ”
Eventually , they came to a Far Rockaway shelter , where they remained for several weeks .
Photo : Clémence de Limburg
For Gitty , Far Rockaway was a turning point .
“ My stepfather told me not to chew gum because ‘ only horses and goys chew gum . ’
In Rockaway , I met Jews who were n’t religious , blacks , Catholics — they did n’t seem so bad .
On my brother ’s birthday , they gave him a party , sang ‘ Happy Birthday . ’
In KJ no one sang ‘ Happy Birthday . ’ ”
The hemmed skirt was like that , one more reason for rachmonus .
Only a few weeks before , Gitty saw several of the drawings Deborah had done as a teenager .
“ They were so beautiful . ”
Her mother also had a fabulous singing voice .
Gitty says for a long time she tried to get her mother to sing “ Somewhere Over the Rainbow ” from The Wizard of Oz , one of Matty and Carol ’s favorite films .
For a while Gitty thought Deborah would n’t sing the song because “ we were taught when a rainbow appears in the sky it meant G-d was angry with the Jews .
G-d once destroyed the world with a flood but he promised never to do it again .
So now , instead of a flood , he leaves a rainbow , as a warning .
You see a rainbow , you ’re supposed to repent .
They always make me anxious . ”
The real reason her mother is reluctant to sing , Gitty adds , is that in KJ a man is not supposed to hear a woman singing , especially if she has a beautiful voice .
It distracts him from thinking about G-d .
With that , Gitty tossed the skirt into the backseat of the car .
At the end of the day , it was just too ugly to wear .
“ Great , huh ?
Some old rabbi looking at your panties with a magnifying glass ? ”
Gitty says .
“ This was so embarrassing to me .
I just would n’t do it anymore . ”
Sometimes , primping her cut - short black hair , applying eyeliner , or staring into space , a curl of cigarette smoke slinking from her poutish mouth , Gitty will strike a pose reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor , in her Cat on a Hot Tin Roof phase .
Gitty , who , of course , has no idea who Elizabeth Taylor is , and who does n’t know that the star once married that putz Eddie Fisher , which made her a little Jewish , before Richard Burton at least , asks , “ Is that good ? ”
Told this was “ good , ” Gitty cocked her heart - shaped head and smiled with the knowingness of the great - looking girl .
But more than that , tell her she looks hot in the high - waisted shorts she picked up at Fulton Street Mall for $ 14 , and Gitty reveals , more than anything else , relief .
For , if the mysterious gift of human beauty likely requires a lucky swerve in the DNA , Gitty ’s father , the crazed Chaim , repository of dark and brooding Sephardic blood , did her a great favor , genetically speaking .
He gave her a way out of KJ .
Gitty claims she had little hint she might be beautiful before her marriage .
“ You did n’t think about it .
Some KJ houses do n’t even have mirrors .
Boys are n’t allowed to look in them .
It ’s vain . ”
The issue of Gitty ’s attractiveness never came into play until Yoely Grunwald said his friends were congratulating him on scoring such a hot babe .
Gitty says she was happy enough to marry Yoely .
“ I wanted out of my parents ’ house .
Marriage meant more freedom . ”
Plus Yoely seemed relatively liberal .
He kept his beard trimmed , wore his peyos behind his ears .
In retrospect , however , Gitty says , her marriage was doomed from the start .
“ In KJ , you ’re supposed to screw on your wedding night , ” says Gitty .
“ If you do n’t , then the marriage is n’t consummated . ”
The night before , Gitty says , “ they get you a kallah helper ” — literally , a bride helper — “ who tells you what you need to know about sex , because you know nothing .
I was such an innocent virgin , you have no idea . ”
While dispensing with the old story about the sheet with the hole as a myth , Gitty explains many other birds - and - bees facts of KJ life , “ like how sleeping with your husband on Friday night is twice as good as any other night .
But you ca n’t look at him .
The room has to be pitch dark .
There ’s no foreplay .
This is totally about reproduction .
You ’re supposed to be thinking about G-d the whole time .
“ A lot of grooms faint on their wedding nights , ” Gitty continues .
“ You see — before you get married , they keep you apart .
You talk to the person once or twice .
On your wedding night , you ’re supposed to get it on with this total stranger .
It is really bad for guys .
Hasidic men are told all their lives if they masturbate they go to hell .
Spilling the seed — that ’s the biggest sin .
At school , a lot of the boys had their pockets sewn up so could n’t poke around with their hands .
Then , all of a sudden , they ’re with this naked woman and they think if they do n’t screw her and produce more Jews , G -d is going to get really , really mad at them .
That is a lot of pressure .

“ I wanted to make our marriage something special .
But in KJ , everything is tradition .
You walk in the footsteps of your parents .
So we never solved a problem between us .
Yoely called his mother . ”
Eventually , Gitty pushed back .
“ I started slow .
I really believed if I broke the rules , G -d would punish me .
I wore stockings without seams up the back , then a denim skirt .
In KJ , what really matters is what people say .
Do something wrong , everyone is talking about it .
That ’s how they keep you in line .
When Yoely heard someone saw me with my hair showing , he said , ‘ You ’re making me look bad , you ’re making my whole family look bad . ’ ”
The critical battleground in the War Between the Grunwalds would prove to be niddah , or “ separation , ” i.e. , when the menstruating female is considered “ impure ” and kept apart from her husband .
“ It is n’t just your period , ” Gitty says .
After a woman stops bleeding , she has to wear white underwear for seven days , checking constantly to see if there ’s any discharge .
Should spotting occur , the woman takes her underwear to a special rabbi who examines the color , shape , and density of the stain .
It is he who divines when it is safe for the woman to immerse herself in the mikvah ( ritual bath ) and be reunited with her husband .
“ Great , huh ?
Some old rabbi looking at your panties with a magnifying glass ? ”
Gitty asks .
“ This was so embarrassing to me .
In KJ , everything is about sex — this idea of sex made up by men from 300 years ago . ”
“ I would n’t do it anymore .
I stopped counting , wore black underwear .
I walked around the house in shorts , because when you ’re impure , your husband ca n’t touch you or even look at your arm .
Yoely would hide his eyes and start crying , ‘ Put on your turban , please put on your turban . ’ ”
Asked if she was torturing
Yoely by showing him her body , Gitty says , “ Maybe .
But he was torturing me .
He saw me hug my grandfather and started yelling how it was a sexual hug .
We tortured each other . ”
Yoely made some compromises .
He miscalculated , however , when he wired his home with Internet access .
“ He thought , If I give her this , then she ’ll shut up and be satisfied , ” Gitty says .
“ Once I read blogs from people who had gotten out of places like KJ , there was no turning back .
Yoely begged me to stay .
It is humiliating for a Satmar man to have his wife leave him .
But it was too late , ” says Gitty , who would start her own blog , 1 Beautiful Stranger , where she wrote about her misplaced life in Kiryas Joel .
It is another mid-spring Friday afternoon in Kiryas Joel .
Gitty drove up hoping to see Esther Miriam , but when she arrived , Yoely had changed the plan .
Now if Gitty wanted to see Esther Miriam before Shabbos , she would have to ask , in writing , by Wednesday .
“ He ca n’t say that … on Friday ! ” Gitty fumed .
Gitty called Yoely at the car dealership , but he would n’t come to the phone .
Gitty knew the game .
Yoely would stall her until the Shabbos siren , and then there would be nothing she could do .
Gitty said it would be interesting to see the men go to Friday - night services , so a couple of hours later we were parked across from the huge , fortresslike building that serves as KJ ’s main shul .
Not wishing to be seen , Gitty secreted herself under a jacket in the passenger seat , peeking out to offer an often irreverent Who ’s Who on the passing worshippers .
On Friday nights in Jerusalem , the black hats surge dancing toward the Western Wall .
In KJ , the procession is a quieter , more stately affair .
With the full moon rising above the roof of the shul , grandfathers came accompanied by sons , who in turn brought their sons , some as young as 3 and 4 , peyos dangling from the sides of their heads .
As I watched the generations climb the synagogue ’s heavy stone steps , it was easy to think this was what the Baal Shem Tov meant when he compared his followers to a vast and deathless tree with every Jew “ a limb of the Divine Presence . ”
Then , with a start , Gitty ducked down below the dashboard .
“ Shit . It ’s Aaron Teitelbaum . ”
And there he was , no more than twenty feet away : the rebbe and spiritual leader of Kiryas Joel .
In a full - length black satin overcoat , walking with a silver - handled cane , the 60 - year - old Teitelbaum was accompanied by a dozen followers , several sporting shtreimels , the layer - cake - size sable - fur hats often worn by Satmar men .
“ Know how much they cost , those shtreimels ? ” Gitty spat .
“ Five thousand dollars … maybe $ 6,000 .
Families go bankrupt buying those hats . ”

It was assumed that Aaron , oldest son of the Satmar rebbe Moses Teitelbaum , would become the group ’s leader .
In 1999 , however , the elder Teitelbaum split the realm between Aaron and his younger brother , Zalmen .
In the biblical - style birthright schism that followed — which many said was more about real - estate money and power than religious piety — Zalmen wound up with Williamsburg , the crown jewel , leaving Kiryas Joel to Aaron .
Gitty peered through the yellowed glass of the shul windows .
Men were starting to pray in there , their heads lurching back and forth , looking like silhouettes in their black coats .
“ I envy them sometimes , ” Gitty said .
“ They never have to make another decision in their whole lives . ”
After she left Kiryas Joel , Gitty fell in with the crowd of Hasidic “ dropouts ” and “ rebels , ” people who , like her , had fled places like Kiryas Joel or been kicked out .
“ In KJ , I was a freak , ” Gitty says .
“ The rebels told me I was cool .
I felt like I ’d just gotten out of prison .
If there was a party that night , I might think about going . ”
This was the beginning of the wild times , making the rounds of pads in Monsey and the Lower East Side , hanging out with artists , people trying to make something beautiful , not ugly .
When Esther Miriam was snatched , Gitty became a scene celebrity .
Everyone knew the story of Gitty and her baby .
In the end , however , Gitty decided the scene had too much “ damage ” for her .
Here were these brilliant , ruined people , floating from place to place , homeless , stoned out of their minds half the time .
Last Purim , one of the rebels OD ’d on coke and ground - up Xanax , a typical ex-Hasid drug concoction .
The rebels were stuck between two worlds , Gitty thought , a dangerous place to be .
“ First I loved it , then it scared me , now it makes me sad , ” said Gitty one early spring afternoon , standing on the edge of a pond near South Fallsburg , not far from the now - shuttered Pines Hotel , once a Borscht Belt standby .
The rebels had gotten hold of a country campsite , a wild A - frame house heated only by a wooden stove .
Everyone was hanging out , some on acid , playing Hasidic songs , wrapping each other in prayer shawls , shouting praises of the Baal Shem Tov , and screaming they were “ the new hippies . ”
There was a fine , doomed romance in the moment , but Gitty was unimpressed .
Watching stoned rebels paddle across the half - frozen lake , she said , “ Do n’t they know if they fall in they ’ll freeze to death ? ”
Driving back that night , Gitty asked me my impressions of KJ .
It was a vexing question because how can you really know about a place without living there ?
Still , we were dealing with impressions , and even if the Satmars were famous for their chesed , or charity , KJ did not strike this traveler as a very haymishe place .
On Lee Avenue in Williamsburg it was no big deal to get a smile and a hearty “ zeit gezunt ” from a shtreimel - wearing Satmar .
These were city people , Americans ; they lived in the world .
In the KJ boondocks , among these Hebrew hillbillies and their fundamentalist idea of chosen - peopleness , ask someone “ Which way to Route 17 ? ” and they ’d often just turn their backs on you .
The message was clear :
Here , you are Other .
The results of most beth din arbitrations are accepted in civil court , but judgments in child - custody cases are not binding .
What it comes down to , one matrimonial lawyer says , is “ the interpretation of the term ‘ in the best interests of the child . ’
In rabbinical court , that means in best spiritual interests of the child . ”
Such was the case in her hearing , contends Gitty .
“ They told me if I gave Yoely a get , a Jewish divorce , they ’d help me get custody , but it was all lies .
They said Esther Miriam should stay with my ex until I settled down .
I thought I had settled down .
I had an apartment , a job .
For them , that meant I had to be religious again . ”
Gitty ’s subsequent civil - custody case did not begin more auspiciously .
Attired in a fanny - hugging skirt , spike - heel boots , hair slicked down like a post - punk flapper , Gitty was optimistic as she entered the Orange County courthouse in Goshen for her first hearing .
These hopes were soon dashed , however , when Yoely ’s lawyer demanded Gitty take an immediate “ hair follicle ” drug test .
A hair - follicle test can detect drug use over several months .
Obviously , this was Yoely ’s plan from the start , Gitty said .
He knew about the rebels , that Gitty had hung out with them .
Gitty ’s lawyer , Daniel Schwartz , offered his client only cold comfort .
“ You fail that test , and you can kiss custody good - bye , ” he told her .
“ You ’re sunk . ”
“ I smoke a joint months ago and that gives them the right to take my daughter away ? ”
Gitty moaned .
An hour later , she was in a Nanuet headshop full of skull - shaped bongs and Day - Glo Bob Marley posters looking for a shampoo her rebel friends said might help her beat the test .
“ Nettles and sassafras , ” Gitty read haltingly from the list of unfamiliar ingredients .
“ This is never going to work . ”
Gitty ’s test came up positive , as she knew it would .
But contrary to Daniel Schwartz ’s prediction , she is not sunk .
Not yet .
But court dates take time , something Gitty does not have .
She knew Yoely , with his get from the rabbinical court , had remarried .
Soon he ’d be starting a new family .
As daughter of Chaim , stepdaughter of Avrum , Gitty knew what that meant .
Soon , very possibly , Esther Miriam would become nothing more than an afterthought , the bad memory of her ex-husband ’s first , terribly failed marriage .
She ’d be the older stepsister charged with the care of her younger , favored siblings , a drudge cleaning between the floorboards for weeks before each Passover , someone who saw beautiful rainbows and felt only dread .
This was the ultimate nightmare : Esther Miriam married off at age 17 , bearing a dozen children to an indifferent KJ guy she ’d never love .
From Gitty ’s point of view , there could be no worse next chapter in the New York Jewish generational saga that began with Matty and Carol Feinman .
Meanwhile , Gitty is trying to “ be normal . ”
Mostly she ’s been looking for a job , which is difficult since , like most KJ dropouts , she has no GED and few skills .
She ’s checked the lower - Manhattan restaurants , hoping to catch on as a waitress , but has no experience .
“ Even in the diner they want experience , ” she says .
The fact is , even if she ate dim sum for the first time and pronounced it “ totally trayf , totally good , ” Gitty ’s expertise in non-kugel cuisine is spotty .
The other day , she had to ask what a lobster was .
Her best employment prospects seem to be as a home aide for the elderly , a field where fluent Yiddish can be a major plus .
This is not considered a thrilling option by Gitty , who fancies herself more in the line of an actress or fashion designer .
But she ’s doing her best to “ remain positive . ”
Recently , her beloved younger brother , Sruli , came to New York from Toronto , where he received a scholarship to art school after fleeing KJ .
They stayed at Matty and Carol Feinman ’s house and went to the Met .
Little by little , Gitty has been filling in what she calls “ my cluelessness . ”
The other day , dialing through my iPod , Gitty said , “ Oh , Billie Holiday .
My grandmother loves Billie Holiday . ”
A moment later , when “ What a Little Moonlight Can Do ” punched up on the box , Gitty said , “ Wow , Billie Holiday is a woman ? ”
As the case drags on , some of Gitty ’s friends have attempted to console her , saying she ’ll have more babies and the pain she feels over Esther Miriam will go away .
“ I hear that and I want to punch in the face of those people , ” she says .
Gitty knows nothing will ever be right without Esther Miriam .
A couple weeks ago , after the usual hassle , Yoely agreed to let Gitty see Esther Miriam at Deborah ’s house .
Gitty arrived to find the Barbie dolls she ’d bought Esther Miriam wrapped in duct tape .
“ They were idols , my parents said , ” Gitty recounted .
“ Then Esther Miriam started to sing , so they called the rabbi about the halachas about whether men could hear the voice of a 4 - year - old . ”
A few days later , Gitty was in Williamsburg , but not the Satmar Williamsburg .
Red baseball hat on her head , looking good in a grayish T - shirt with cutoff sleeves , she was in a Brazilian restaurant under the Williamsburg Bridge , eating some fish stew she never knew existed before .
Recalling the details of her weekend , she said , “ I must have a head made out of metal not to go crazy from all this . ”
Then Gitty ’s cell phone rang .
It was Esther Miriam .
The call was court - ordered , ruled by the Orange County judge after hearing that Yoely ’s family refused to pick up when Gitty called to talk to her daughter .
“ Mommy , ” came the high - pitched voice , audible even with the J train rumbling on overhead .
“ Esther Miriam ! ” Gitty replied .
When Esther Miriam asked when she would see her mother again , Gitty brushed a stray tear from her eye and said , “ Soon … very soon . ”

PEJ Campaign Coverage Index June 9 - 15 , 2008
In the first official week of the general election , the differences between Barack Obama and John McCain on issues ranging from the economy to Iraq constituted the media ’s main campaign narrative .
Together , the debates over several key issues accounted for almost one - third — 29 % — of the campaign newshole , as measured by PEJ ’s Campaign Coverage Index for June 9 -15 .
But that did n’t mean there was n’t a fair amount of attention paid to some controversies and gaffes .
Led by coverage of the resignation of Obama ’s vice - presidential search leader James Johnson , a handful of controversies finished second behind the issues ( at 18 % ) as a narrative theme last week .
Trailing in third place ( at 13 % ) was coverage of the candidates ’ efforts to heal the wounds left by the primary battles — particularly the bruising Democratic contest .
In a relatively light week of campaign coverage , Obama topped McCain in the race for exposure .
The Democrat appeared as a significant or dominant newsmaker in 77 % of the week ’s campaign stories compared with 55 % for the GOP candidate .
The week also represented the moment that Hillary Clinton appeared to finally recede from center stage .
A week removed from her withdrawal speech , Clinton was a significant or dominant factor in only 10 % of the stories .
Those numbers reflect the media ’s full pivot away from the long Democratic primary battle to a one - on - one general election competition .
A week earlier , Clinton registered in 60 % of the coverage while McCain was at 21 % .
One other change was the focus on potential First Ladies .
In that previous report , Michelle Obama registered at only 1 % ; last week , she accounted for 6 % .
With the general election race perhaps heading into something of a summer plateau , campaign coverage last week accounted for only 24 % of the overall newshole , according to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index for June 9 - 15 .
That marks the second - lowest total for all of 2008 , trailing only the week of April 7 - 13 — which was part of the long run-up to the Pennsylvania primary — when it filled 23 % of the newshole .
Even on a relatively slow week , however , the election was the No. 1 story in four of the five media sectors , with the Midwest flooding finishing as top story on network TV .
And once again , cable news led the way , devoting 39 % of the airtime studied to the campaign .
The focus on issues last week may mark a shift in the campaign , at least for now , away from the horse race — will Clinton drop out , will there be reconciliation — toward the emphasis on the two party nominees trying to contrast themselves .
Those policy questions were led by the economy ( 18 % of the newshole ) , and also included gas prices ( 6 % ) , Iraq ( 5 % ) , and health care and immigration ( both less than 1 % ) .
In general , our sense was that this coverage distributed fairly evenly between the two candidates .
But an examination of the second category of narratives last week — campaign controversies and gaffes — helps explain , at least in part , Obama ’s advantage in exposure .
Here , Obama made most of the news .
The situation involving James Johnson , who resigned amid questions about his business dealings , was the biggest brouhaha .
By itself it accounted for 11 % of the week ’s campaign coverage .
Stories about Obama rumors — including his campaign ’s decision to start a web site to combat false allegations — and his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright accounted for another 5 % .
McCain made news too , but to a much smaller extent .
Coverage of his relationship with controversial pastor , Rev. John Hagee , and questions about his ethics accounted for 2 % of the coverage .
On the subject of healing primary wounds and uniting their parties , it was Obama and the Democrats again getting most of the headlines .
Coverage of the suspension of Clinton ’s campaign ( 6 % ) , the divided Democrats ( 3 % ) , the post - mortem on Clinton ’s loss ( less than 1 % ) and questions about Bill Clinton ’s role ( less than 1 % ) and the superdelegates ( less than 1 % ) accounted for 10 % of the newshole .
McCain ’s attempts to unite his party accounted for 3 % .
So while Obama dominated the coverage last week , some of that was clearly unwelcome — the result of an embarrassing flap over Johnson and the continuing fallout from a tough and polarizing primary fight that left many hard feelings .
The Campaign Coverage index is an addition to PEJ ’s NCI report , which tracks what stories the media covered in the previous week .
The CCI offers a greater level of detail of the campaign coverage .
That includes the percentage of stories in which a candidate splayed a significant role ( as a subject of between 25 % and 50 % of the story ) or a main newsmaker role ( making up at least 50 % of the story ) .
The Index also identifies the key narratives in the reporting and the “ Line of the Week , ” a statement from a journalist or source that in our researchers ’ estimation seems either to capture the story or is particularly colorful .
PEJ ’s News Coverage Index will not disappear .
It will come at the bottom of the CCI .
Last week ’s campaign week began with coverage of the Republican and Democratic candidates exchanging charges over the economy .
“ Barack Obama attacked John McCain for advocating corporate tax cuts at a time big oil is making record profits , ” declared Katie Couric on the June 9 CBS newscast .
The “ McCain camp fired back , accusing Senator Obama of voting for Vice President Cheney ’s energy bill , which included billions in tax subsides for oil companies … ”
The next day , the Arkansas Democrat Gazette featured a front page that included a story about gas hitting four dollars a gallon , a story about how high gas costs are impeding state road repairs , and a story about McCain and Obama arguing over economic policy .
“ The centerpiece of McCain ’s economic plan ‘ amounts to a full - throated endorsement of George Bush ’s policies , ’ Obama told about 900 people in Raleigh , N.C. , ” the article reported .
“ McCain pushed back , saying Obama ’s bid to end the Bush administration ’s tax cuts for upper - income Americans would only worsen the already struggling economy . ”
Some coverage of Iraq policy differences revolved around McCain ’s June 11 appearance on NBC ’s Today show .
When host Matt Lauer ’s asked if he had a better sense of when U.S. troops could return from Iraq , McCain said , “ No , but that ’s not too important .
What ’s important is the casualties in Iraq . ”
That brought a quick response from the Obama campaign with his surrogate , Senator John Kerry , charging that those remarks showed McCain to be " unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs and concerns of Americans . "
Although that exchange illustrated substantive policy differences between the two candidates , it was also examined for its potential political impact on programs such as the June 11 edition of MSNBC ’s Hardball .
There the rough consensus of the pundit panel seemed to be that McCain had not chosen his words wisely , but that he benefited from any discussion of national security .
Yet the controversy over Obama aide James Johnson also boiled for a good part of the week .
The veteran Washington insider left Obama ’s vice presidential search team on June 11 after what the New York Times called “ days of intense scrutiny ” from the media and Republicans over favorable mortgages he received from Countrywide , “ a central player in the subprime lending crisis . ”
Johnson ’s departure , the June 12 Times story declared , “ highlights the difficulties ” Obama has “ in trying to live up to his promises to remain independent of the Washington establishment and the special interests that populate it . ”
The challenges Obama faces in his search for a VP were not limited to the Johnson story last week .
A June 9 CNN.com piece discussing the reluctance of some Clinton voters to support Obama cited a poll indicating that only 60 % said they would vote for him in November .
“ Some of Clinton ’s top supporters , ” the story went on to note , “ say the best way to get the New York Senator ’s 18 million voters behind Obama is by putting Clinton on the ticket . ”
And now , in the rest of the week ’s news :
Aside from the campaign , flooding in Iowa , the sudden death of a television news icon , and a major Supreme Court ruling were among the top stories last week , according to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index for June 6 - 15 .
The violent Midwestern storms , the No. 2 story , filled 10 % of the newshole last week .
Rising gas and oil prices came next at 7 % .
That was followed by coverage of the June 13 death of NBC Washington bureau chief and Meet the Press host Tim Russert , at 5 % .
Due to extensive tributes and remembrances , especially on MSNBC where he frequently appeared , Russert ’s passing filled 18 % of the cable airtime examined last week .
And the Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 ruling that terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay had the right to challenge their detention , viewed as a rebuke of the Bush administration , rounded out the top 5 stories , also at 5 %

NEW YORK , July 3 ( Reuters ) - Colombian President Alvaro Uribe was greeted with cheers , folk dancers and banners clamoring for his re-election when he stepped off a helicopter for a community meeting in Colombia last month .
After Wednesday 's spectacular rescue of FARC hostage Ingrid Betancourt and three Americans , the U.S. ally may have gained even more support to run for a third term if he wants , with admirers saying he is the man to take on the Marxist rebels .
Already hugely popular because of his U.S. - backed crackdown on the FARC guerrillas , Uribe has been cagey about whether he is mulling seeking re-election .
But the idea of a third term is worrying critics concerned about democracy and even some on Wall Street , which has openly backed him .
Uribe recently pushed the idea of a vote on to the agenda by calling for a referendum on re-running his 2006 re-election after a court found the vote may have been tainted by corruption .
Foes worry he will use his popularity to muscle through a vote and bypass the country 's institutions .
They say a re-run of the 2006 election -- while touted as strictly to confirm the legitimacy of that vote -- would promote acceptance of him staying in power if supporters managed to push through a constitutional reform removing a ban on a third successive term .
" The temptation , of course , will be to parlay that surge in popularity into support for the proposed referendum on new elections , " said Cynthia Arnson at the Woodrow Wilson center .
" Even Colombians supportive of Uribe have questioned the idea of a third term , and the danger is that presidential hubris will ride roughshod over Colombia 's judiciary and political institutions . "
Uribe , a studious - looking attorney first elected in 2002 , is known for his tough work ethic and unflinching opposition to the FARC rebels who killed his father , says he will only run again in case of " disaster . "
He says he wants to keep alive his " Democratic Security " policy to help drive back rebels and draw in more foreign investment .
His re-election in 2006 followed a contested reform of the constitution to allow a second term .
Supporters are now collecting signatures to change the constitution again .
A referendum proposal on such a change would have to be reviewed by Congress and by the Constitutional Court before a vote .
TWO PATHS AHEAD
Uribe , who turns 56 on Friday , has been put on the defensive by the scandal over the 2006 re-election and probes into more than 60 lawmakers for ties to former paramilitary death squads who carried out massacres before handing in their weapons under a peace deal with his government .
But with the Andean country 's economy growing strong and more Colombians able to travel freely in a country where illegal armed groups once roamed at will , Uribe 's popularity is soaring at around 80 percent , according to a recent poll .
For opponents , everything points to a consolidation of authority by a president they say already uses his high popularity to bully the country 's institutions .
" The president can choose one of two paths : stay in power , because no one is going to contradict him , or finish his second term and go down in history as the man who brought the FARC to its knees , " said opposition lawmaker Gustavo Petro .
Still , critics who question his government 's human rights record cannot cast doubt on his government 's success in dealing blow after blow to Latin America 's oldest leftist insurgency .
Once a mighty force of 17,000 fighters able to choke off cities , set bombs in upscale neighborhoods and kidnap at will , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC has been reduced to around 9,000 combatants .
The guerrillas have lost three top commanders this year and hundreds have deserted from its ranks prompted by military pressure and government rewards .
Betancourt , a former senator kidnapped during her own presidential election campaign in 2002 , appeared to back a Uribe re-election .
" I have always been in favor of re-elections perhaps I have been influenced by French democracy , where the concept of re-election exists , " Betancourt , a dual French - Colombian citizen , said after her release without giving more details .
But Wall Street , which has applauded Uribe 's investment policies , has been skittish over another constitutional reform to allow Uribe 's re-election .
Several Uribe allies are touted as possible candidates and opposition parties talk about a loose alliance to counter a new Uribe run .
Still , no clear alternative candidates have emerged .
Some experts believe Uribe is keeping his cards close to his chest to avoid becoming a lame duck in the waning two years of his second term .
" It would be good to have someone that is not Uribe carrying on the same policies for that would be a great sign of institutional maturity , " said Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs .
" If there is no one out there to carry on successfully the same policies , an eventual third term by Uribe would be the best second - best alternative for it would guarantee no policy reversal , " he said .
Even before the rescue of the hostages , there was no doubt in the minds of hardcore Uribe supporters such as Isidora Julio , who are already calling for him to rewrite the constitution to be able to run again .
" He 's the only one who wears the pants , " she said at one of Uribe 's weekly town hall meetings where supporters flock to hear him manage problems such as building roads and schools .
" Now we can go anywhere without fear . "

Last year , we wrote about the case where Universal Music sent a takedown notice to YouTube when a woman posted a short ( 29 - second ) video of her toddler running around with a Prince song ( barely audible ) in the background .
Universal backed down when challenged on the takedown notice , but the woman ( with the help of the EFF ) hit back and have sued Universal Music for a false takedown .
The DMCA has provisions for a copyright holder to assert ownership , at which point the service provider needs to takedown the content .
Whoever posted the content can protest that the content was legally posted -- which is exactly what happened in this case .
However , the DMCA also says that filing a false DMCA notice opens one up to damages from those whose content was taken down .
This was in an effort to discourage false DMCA notices .
This provision was used last year against Viacom for its false takedowns on satirical clips of the Colbert Report .
The question then , is whether or not filing a takedown notice on content that is used in a way consistent with " fair use " is a misuse or not .
Universal Music 's claim is that it is not reasonable for the copyright holder to take fair use into consideration before sending a takedown notice .
At a first pass , it sounds like the judge agrees
As ridiculous as this whole situation is , the judge and Universal Music may be correct under the existing law .
There is n't anything in the law that says the copyright holder needs to take into account the user 's defenses .
It just says they need to be the legitimate copyright holder ( which Universal Music is ) .
The real problem , then , in this story is n't Universal Music 's actions ( though Universal was acting in a rather heavy handed manner in getting the video taken down ) , but with the DMCA itself that forces a takedown before the user gets to respond with a defense .
It 's this " notice and takedown " provision that 's a problem .
If , instead , we had a " notice and notice " provision that allowed the user to respond before the takedown occurred , it would be a lot more reasonable and would avoid ridiculous situations such as this one .

The winner was the person who held out the longest .
A clear path to a muddy deal on the EU budget
One of the challenges inherent in following the EU is the presence of multi-lingual and multi-institutional noise .
The two always come together in perfect disharmony during EU budget negotiations .
If you thought that the recovery fund was the big European controversy this year , you could not be more wrong .
The more difficult issue relates to what is known as the rule - of - law mechanism : the idea that the EU can withhold funds from member states if they are deemed to be not respecting the principles of EU law .
As we keep reminding ourselves and our readers , the EU is very good at deal - making .
You should never lightly bet against a compromise .
But sometimes a deal takes longer , and delays can be costly .
If the EU 's 2021 - 2027 budget is not agreed before the end of this year , there may be delays in the disbursement from the recovery fund , which is part of the budget .
Viktor Orbán rejects any rule - of - law provisions that would affect him .
Art. 7 of the Treaty on European Union is the nuclear bomb version of a rule - of - law clause .
It allows a country to be sanctioned , but the procedure requires unanimity among all the other members .
The rule - of - law linkage to the EU budget aims to give the EU a more finely - tuned instrument to deal with the likes of Orbán .
Orbán , of course , is only too aware of this , and has the stronger hand .
The EU budget is subject to a national veto .
Mehreen Khan just published the latest German EU presidency draft on the rule of law .
The German draft looks as though it was hand - written by Orbán himself .
It is instructive to study this document in some detail .
All previous references to generalised deficiencies in the rule of law have been changed to breaches , a much higher hurdle .
Article 17b is new .
It gives Orbán an emergency brake .
Should the EU ever try to cut him off , he can refer the matter to the next European Council .
This is a procedure similar to the one Mark Rutte obtained for the recovery fund .
Another similarity is the reversal in qualified majority voting : the Council would have to find a qualified majority to act against Orbán .
In a previous draft , Orbán would have needed a qualified majority in his favour .
The German proposal effectively turns the rule of law controversy into an issue for the courts .
This is very typical for Merkel .
She is using a similar strategy in the upcoming national decision on whether to grant Huawei a 5G telecoms licence .
But remember , this is just a draft .
European Parliament will not be happy about it , and will seek further changes .
The Netherlands will also raise objections .
The issue clearly has the potential to intrude into the Dutch elections , which will be held in March .
By December , when the decision for the 2021 - 2027 EU budget must be made , we will already be in the middle of the Dutch election campaign .
Our downside scenario for the EU budget is not a total breakdown , but a delay .
The EU would still function if no budget were agreed by the end of the year .
But the longer the stalemate continues into 2021 , the higher the political costs .
We do not think that the EP has the stomach for a fight that would risk the recovery fund .
But we know that Orbán does .
Orbán would happily compromise and let the EU establish new theoretical legal principles that have no concrete impact on his own situation .
If there is a deal , we are sure it will be of the usual spin-doctored variety .
Orbán wins on substance , the European Parliament gets its fluffy language , and uncritical EU fanboys hail the deal as yet another step in the direction of closer political union .
This analysis is consistent with the revealed preferences of decision - makers .
We know that Angela Merkel prioritises unity over everything else .
This is why Fidesz , Orbán 's party , is still in the EPP .
Southern European governments and MEPs prioritise the recovery fund .
Northern states that raise objections can be bought off with rebates or pork - barrel spending projects .
We see a clear path to a muddy deal .
A prolonged budget crisis with a delayed recovery fund is our worst - case scenario .
The more likely scenario is that the EU will sacrifice the rule - of - law principle , for the sake of unity and a short - term public - relations triumph .
If it were up to us , we would sacrifice unity , take this to the brink , and organise the recovery fund , minus disbursements to rule - of - law infringers , as a temporary multilateral project .
This would be similar to how the ESM got started .
But , to be clear , this is not what we expect will happen .

New Democratic Party Deputy House Leader Libby Davies delivers a Parliamentary Petition signed by over 500 Canadians demanding a new 9/11 investigation , in Canada ’s House of Commons during Routine Proceedings at 1:10 pm on June 10 , 2008
Here is the full text of the petition , available to sign at http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/canada911truth/
PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED
We , the undersigned citizens of Canada draw the attention of the House to the following :
THAT , scientific and eyewitness evidence shows that the 9/11 Commission Report is a fraudulent document and that those behind the report are consciously or unconsciously guilty of covering up what happened on 9/11/2001 .
This evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that World Trade Center Towers 1 , 2 and 7 were brought down by demolition explosives and that the official theory of the towers collapsing from the airplanes and the ensuing fires is irrefutably false .
We further believe that elements within the US government were complicit in the murder of thousands of people on 9/11/2001 .
This event brought Canada into the so - called “ War on Terror , ” it changed our domestic and foreign policies for the worse , and it will continue to have negative consequences for us all if we refuse to look at the facts .
THEREFORE , your petitioners call upon Parliament to :
(1) Immediately launch its own investigation into the events of 9/11/2001 on behalf of the 24 Canadian citizens murdered in New York City .
(2) Act lawfully on the findings of its own investigation by helping to pursue the guilty parties in the international courts .
Committed to truth and accountability ,

Middle - aged male teacher sacked after bizarre striptease in front of stunned class
By Andrew Levy for the Daily Mail
The secret of being a good teacher is said to be finding a way to get the children 's attention
But stripping off in front of a class of unruly pupils is not one of the recommended techniques .
The bizarre striptease was performed by a chubby supply teacher who threatened to punish misbehaving 13 and 14 - year - olds by making them look at his body .
When the teenagers continued playing up , he stayed true to his word and pulled off his shirt .
Hysterics :
The teacher struggles to put his shirt back on .
His teenage pupils can be heard screaming with laughter on the YouTube video of the impromptu striptease .
The prank misfired , however , after a pupil at Sudbury Upper School and Arts College in Suffolk secretly filmed him with a mobile phone and forwarded the 53 - second clip to other children .
Before the day was out the headteacher had seen the footage of the bearded , balding and bespectacled English teacher and ordered him to leave the 1,185 - pupil school and never return .
Adding to the his embarrassment , the clip was later posted on video sharing website YouTube under the heading ' Teacher Strip ' .
A message accompanying the footage , which has been viewed more than 800 times , reads : ' make sure your not eating when ur wachin this [ sic ] . '
The unidentified man 's teaching career is now in doubt after Suffolk County Council banned him from working again at any of its 357 schools .
A pupil at the mixed comprehensive said : ' Kids were playing up in class and his way of dealing with it was to tell everyone to be quiet or he would take his shirt off and show his man boobs .
' He was quite overweight and it was a sight that nobody really wanted to see .
Everyone thought he was joking and people carried on messing around - but then he really did take his shirt off .
' It was quite shocking but pupils thought it was hilarious . '
Another added : ' It was hilarious .
People were goading him saying " I bet you have n't got muscles " .
He told us all " I 'll show you " and started taking off his shirt .
' We all thought he was pretending but he took his shirt off and started flexing his muscles .
Then he said : " Look , I told you " .
' He put his shirt back on but he was still buttoning it up when he was teaching .
Everyone was killing themselves laughing .'
Will Theobald , 17 , who posted the clip on YouTube , said : ' About a quarter of the students had the clip on their phone .
Everyone called him Gimli after the character in Lord of the Rings .
' I do n't know what he was thinking .
You can't do stuff like that and get away with it .'
During the strip , pupils can be heard laughing , cheering and screaming .
One girl shouts out " Oh my god ! " followed by " Bless him " .
The teacher was hired for the day from UK Teaching Agency in Radlett , Hertfordshire .
No one from the company was available to comment yesterday .
A Suffolk County Council spokesman said : ' It was not planned or part of a lesson .
It was just his reaction to a behaviour situation .
' As soon as the headteacher was made aware of the incident , the supply teacher in question was asked to leave the school premises immediately .
' The matter was also reported immediately to the supply agency employing him as well as the council .
' He will not be allowed to teach in Suffolk again .
I do n't know whether there will be any more professional disciplinary action against him . '
The spokesman added : ' The protocol and vetting of teachers who work for these agencies is controlled by the Department for Children , Schools and Families .
' Schools should be confident and expect that people who are supplied are of the required standard . '
An Ofsted report last month concluded teaching standards at the school were ' satisfactory ' .
It added : ' Most [ pupils ] behave well but there are occasions , especially in lessons where there is inconsistency in the quality of teaching and management of behaviour , when some students are not engaged in learning . '
Headteacher David Forrest yesterday said the teacher had not taught at the school before the incident two months ago .
He refused to name him , adding : ' Disciplinary matters are private between the school , the man concerned and his employer . '
NOTE : Some readers may find the text and images on this list disturbing .
For most of our readers , the biggest troubles in their lives are petrol prices , long working hours , and increasing food costs .
For many women in the world , these are the least of their concerns .
Terrible atrocities are committed against untold numbers of women around the world every day and for most of these women , justice will never be served .
This is a list of the worst of the atrocities .
In no particular order :
7 Bride kidnapping
Bride kidnapping is a common practice in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan .
When it is time to get married in Kyrgyzstan , a man or his family will pick a woman and she will be kidnapped .
The prospective groom and his male relatives or friends or both abduct the girl ( in the old nomadic days , on horseback ; now often by car ) and take her to the family home , where the older women of the family try to get her to accept the marriage .
Some families will keep the girl hostage for several days to break her will .
Others will let her go if she remains defiant .
The kidnapped woman ’s family may also become involved in the process , either urging the woman to stay if the marriage is believed to be socially acceptable or advantageous for the prospective bride and her family , or opposing the marriage on various grounds and helping liberate the woman .
In Ethiopia and Rwanda it is quite brutal , where the man kidnaps the woman and rapes her .
The family of the woman either then feels obliged to consent to the union , or is forced to when the kidnapper impregnates her , as no one else would marry a pregnant woman .
6 Honor Killing
Honor Killing is a punitive murder , committed by members of a family against a female member of their family whom the family and / or wider community believes to have brought dishonor upon the family .
A woman is usually targeted for : refusing an arranged marriage , being the victim of a sexual assault , seeking a divorce ( even from an abusive husband ) , or committing adultery or fornication .
These killings result from the perception that any behavior of a woman that “ dishonors ” her family is justification of a killing that would otherwise be deemed murder .
UNICEF has reported that in India , more than 5,000 brides are killed annually because their marriage dowries are considered insufficient .
As of 2004 , honor killings have occurred within parts of various countries , such as Albania , Bangladesh , Brazil , Canada , Denmark , Ecuador , Germany , India , Iraq , Israel , Italy , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Sweden , Uganda , United Kingdom and the United States .
5 Bride burning
Bride Burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in parts of India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and other countries located on or around the Indian subcontinent .
In bride burning cases it is alleged that a man , or his family , douses his wife with kerosene , gasoline , or other flammable liquid , and sets the woman alight , leading to death by fire .
4 Acid attacks
Acid Attacks are a violent phenomena that primarily occur in Afghanistan .
Perpetrators of these attacks throw acid at their victims ( usually at their faces ) , burning them .
The consequences include permanent scarring of the face and body as well as potential blindness .
Acid attacks are sometimes referred to as vitriolage .
3 Female genital mutilation
Female genital mutilation refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural , religious or other non-therapeutic reasons .
FGM is practiced throughout the world , with the practice concentrated most heavily in Africa .
There have been many concerted efforts by the WHO to end the practice .
Among practicing cultures , FGM is most commonly performed between the ages of four and eight , but can take place at any age from infancy to adolescence .
The procedure , when performed without anesthetic , can lead to death through shock from immense pain or excessive bleeding .
2 Human trafficking
Since the fall of the iron curtain , the impoverished former Eastern bloc countries such as Albania , Moldova , Romania , Bulgaria , Russia , Belarus and Ukraine have been identified as major trafficking source countries for women and children .
Young women and girls are often lured to wealthier countries by the promise of money and work and then reduced to sexual slavery .
It is estimated that 2/3 of women trafficked for prostitution worldwide annually come from Eastern Europe , three - quarters have never worked as prostitutes before .
The major destinations are Western Europe ( Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Spain , UK and Greece ) , the Middle East ( Turkey , Israel , the United Arab Emirates ) , Asia , Russia and the United States .
An estimated 500,000 women from Central and Eastern Europe are working in prostitution in the EU alone .
1 Ritual servitude
In parts of Ghana , a family may be punished for an offense by having to turn over a virgin female to serve as a sex slave within the offended family .
In this system of slavery of ritual servitude , young virgin girls are given as slaves in traditional shrines and are used sexually by the priests in addition to providing free labor .

For the first time , UCLA researchers have discovered that people with sleep apnea show tissue loss in brain regions that help store memory .
Reported in the June 27 edition of the journal Neuroscience Letters , the findings emphasize the importance of early detection of the disorder , which afflicts an estimated 20 million Americans .
Sleep apnea occurs when a blocked airway repeatedly halts the sleeper 's breathing , resulting in loud bursts of snoring and chronic daytime fatigue .
Memory loss and difficulty focusing are also common complaints .
Prior studies have linked the disorder to a higher risk of stroke , heart disease and diabetes .
" Our findings demonstrate that impaired breathing during sleep can lead to a serious brain injury that disrupts memory and thinking , " said principal investigator Ronald Harper , a distinguished professor of neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
The study focused on structures called mammillary bodies , so named because they resemble small breasts , on the underside of the brain .
The UCLA team scanned the brains of 43 sleep apnea patients , using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to collect high - resolution images of the entire brain , including slices of the mammillary bodies .
The structures ' small size and proximity to bone and fluid make them difficult to measure by conventional MRI .
So the researchers manually traced the mammillary bodies from the high - resolution scans and calculated their volumes from the hand - drawn outlines .
advertisement
When they compared the results to images of 66 control subjects matched for age and gender , the scientists discovered that the sleep apnea patients ' mammillary bodies were nearly 20 percent smaller , particularly on the left side .
" The findings are important because patients suffering memory loss from other syndromes , such as alcoholism or Alzheimer disease , also show shrunken mammillary bodies , " said lead author Rajesh Kumar , a UCLA assistant researcher in neurobiology .
" Physicians treat memory loss in alcoholic patients with massive amounts of thiamine , or vitamin B1 , " he added .
" We suspect that the dose helps dying cells to recover , enabling the brain to use them again . "
The scientists ' next step is to determine how sleep apnea causes tissue loss in the mammillary bodies .
Harper hypothesizes that repeated drops in oxygen lead to the brain injury .
During an apnea episode , the brain 's blood vessels constrict , starving its tissue of oxygen and causing cellular death .
The process also incites inflammation , which further damages the tissue .
advertisement
" The reduced size of the mammillary bodies suggests that they 've suffered a harmful event resulting in sizable cell loss , " Harper said .
" The fact that patients ' memory problems continue despite treatment for their sleep disorder implies a long - lasting brain injury . "
In a future study , Harper and Kumar will explore whether taking supplemental vitamin B1 helps restore sleep apnea patients ' memory .
The vitamin helps move glucose into the cells , preventing their death from oxygen starvation .
" UCLA researchers used sophisticated imaging technology to identify brain lesions associated with impaired memory in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea , " said Elizabeth G. Nabel , director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , which funded the study .
" These results underscore the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of sleep - disordered breathing , which can have long - term effects on patients ' health and well - being . "
Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the throat , soft palate and tongue relax during sleep and sag , narrowing the airway .
The tongue slides to the back of the mouth , blocking the windpipe and cutting off oxygen to the lungs .
The sleeper wakes up , gasping for air , and falls back into a fitful sleep .
The cycle can repeat itself hundreds of times per night .
Study co-authors included Bramley Birrer , Paul Macey , Mary Woo and Frisca Yan - Go of UCLA , and Rakesh Gupta from the Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences , India .
BILOXI , Mississippi ( CNN ) --
Prisons in Mississippi got coffee makers , pillowcases and dinnerware -- all intended for victims of Hurricane Katrina .
People check out the second story of a home sitting on the ground in Biloxi , Mississippi , after Katrina in 2005 .
The state 's Department of Wildlife , Fisheries and Parks took more coffee makers , cleaning supplies and other items .
Plastic containers ended up with the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration .
Colleges , volunteer fire departments and other agencies received even more .
But the Mississippi hurricane victims who originally were intended to receive the supplies got nothing , a CNN investigation has found .
Watch victims tell why they need the items »
" It 's scary to know that there are supplies that they are harboring and people [ are ] in need right now as we speak today , " said Sharon Hanshaw , director of Coastal Women for Change , a nonprofit group helping storm victims .
Last month , CNN revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had stored $ 85 million worth of household items in warehouses for two years .
Instead of giving the supplies to victims of the 2005 hurricane , FEMA declared them surplus and gave them all away to federal agencies and 16 states in February .
The state of Louisiana -- the most hard - hit by the storm -- had not asked for any of the supplies , prompting outrage in the community after the original CNN report .
CNN 's investigation showed that Mississippi was one of the 16 states that took the FEMA supplies , but it did not distribute them to Katrina victims .
Jim Marler , director of Mississippi 's surplus agency , failed to return repeated phone calls over several months to explain what happened .
Agency spokeswoman Kym Wiggins said , " There may be a need , but we were not notified that there was a great need for this particular property . "
That does n't sit well with most aid groups in Mississippi .
" You would have to be living under a rock not to know there is still a need , " said Cass Woods , the project coordinator of Coastal Women for Change .
Wiggins said that nonprofit organizations must meet federal guidelines and register with the state and that no such groups helping the needy or homeless were registered with Mississippi 's surplus agency .
" There is no specific designation outside of a disaster period that says we have to have sustained properties going to the disaster area , " Wiggins said .
CNN interviewed the leaders of eight nonprofits helping Katrina victims at a Biloxi , Mississippi , church used as a staging area for community groups .
All said they had no idea these items were available , and most had no idea the surplus agency existed .
" We work so hard to help people in our community when the government is holding back stuff that we can use to give people , " said Glenda Perryman , director of United Hearts Community Action Agency .
Roberta Avila , director of the Mississippi Coast Interfaith Disaster Task Force , said , " It 's needed even more now than right after the storm . "
Records show Mississippi's surplus agency received household supplies , including dinnerware sets , towels , shirts , pants , shoes and cleaning items .
Those are the kind of household items that Howard and Gloria Griffith said they could have used since the storm and still need .
The Griffiths said they spent every penny to rebuild their home .
But they can't afford to finish it , so they 're still living in a FEMA trailer on their property in Biloxi with their teenage son .
" I 've never seen none of it , " said Gloria Griffith after CNN showed her photos of some of the supplies that FEMA had kept in storage .
FEMA said it was costing more than $ 1 million a year to store the supplies , but officials have not been able to answer why the agency did n't get the supplies to Katrina victims .
Both FEMA and the General Services Administration said the items originally were purchased or donated for victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
In the wake of the CNN investigation , a FEMA official said the agency was launching an internal probe into the storage of the household supplies .
Bill Stallworth , executive director of the Hope Coordination Center in Biloxi that helps rehouse Katrina victims , said he 's astounded that the supplies were given away .
Stallworth and other community leaders said if they had known the FEMA items were available , they would have begged for them .
" And when I hear people stand up and just beat their chest and say we 've got everything under control , that 's when I just want to slap them upside the head and say , ' Get a grip , get a life , ' " said Stallworth , who is also a Biloxi city councilman .

I ’ve spent a lot of time thinking about starting businesses , helping people start businesses , and trying to start my own .
When I was 7 years old I started my first business – “ Loans Incorporated ” – it went like this ….
I never got an allowance , but for some reason I got an obscene amount of lunch money , $ 3 dollars a day .
My Persian Jewish father Nuri Nazar seemed to be overly concerned that I should buy the best lunch food the cafeteria could offer , and woefully under concerned that I should have a fixed allowance to budget .
So being the toddler capitalist I was , I would loan out $ 2.00 a day to my classmates and have them sign a sample contract I drafted up .
( I wish i still had one of those original handwritten ones ) .
In return my classmates had to give me back $ 0.25 the next day plus my two dollars .
I really had no idea at the time that I was teaching myself about finance and getting a better return compounded yearly than the Google IPO .
The first few weeks were so successful that I remember when my friends Sammy , Jack , and Hootan were at my house , I put thumbnail tacks on different parts of my World Map , telling them all the locations we were going to open up Loans Incorporated Branches .
( Hootan started crying because he said he was supposed to go into the family jewelry business ) .
However , as fate would have it , my plans were dashed when the principal had to get in the middle of a dispute between a “ customer ” not paying me back ( I think her name was Jenny ) .
Who knew loan sharking was illegal .
When all was said and done though , I did start my first business in the 2nd grade .
And “ starting ” is 90 % of the battle in my mind .
Most business do n’t fail because they fail … they fail because they were never started .
If I had a nickel for every time someone told me “ I had that idea first ” , I could re-capitalize Loans Incorporated and would have completely self financed docstoc .
My strong advice – stop talking and get in the game .
I tried to put my thoughts in a bitting and humorous presentation .
So here is my advice on Mistakes People Make Before Starting a New Business .

The following is a closed caption transcript of Pete Williams ' report .
WILLIAMS : this is a development in the investigation and the subsequent fallout of those anthrax mail attacks that followed after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 .
those anonymous mailings that went out and eventually caused serious disruption here in washington in addition to injuries and deaths of postal workers .
one of the people who was caught up in the investigation was a former army scientist named steven hitfill describe bid the attorney general as a person of interest in the case .
his lawyers have long said that he had nothing to do with it .
hatfill , himself , made a number of tearful public statements says he was wrongly accused .
just within the last few hours , the department of justice , the united states government reached a legal settlement with steven hatfill in which the government will pay him over $ 5 million if suggesting he was a person of interest .
now , the settlement says that the government does not admit any fault .
this is sort of standard legal settlement language .
this should not be construed , the government said .
the admission of liability or fault of any employees .
you can safely say , steven hatfill is no longer a person of interest in the anthrax case .
they would not reach a legal settlement on friday and charge them with the crime the next week .
the united states government has formally watched its hands of steven hatfill as a suspect in the anthrax case or a person of interest .
this was the settlement agreement signed today .
there is the signature of a government lawyer .
right under it is the signature of steven hatfill agreeing to the settlement .
under the terms of the legal agreement , the government is going to pay him over $ 2.8 million and buy an annuity contract for him worth $ 3 million .
you but put the two together , roughly $ 5.8 million as a result of the government one time calling steven hatfill a person of interest .
you may recall the federal agents were tailing him , searched his house , residents he had , carted things away .
search an apartment , followed his car .
had blood hounds go to a restaurant where he had once been .
he also complained he had gotten , after he had difficulty finding a job in washington , he had gotten a job as a consultant to the university , the u.s. government , the justice department call the university and suggested he would not be a good person to train people to work with hazardous materials .
this is a big development in the an thax investigation .
the government reaching a settlement with one - time person of interest , steven hatfill in the an thax investigation .
an investigation that still goes on .
as of just , today , law enforcement officials tell nbc news they do n't believe any indictments are imminent .
this is not a sign somebody else is about to be charge .
it 's the sign that the government has washed its hands of steven hatfill and will pay him over $ 5 million .

You 've no doubt heard much about the recent protests of the Olympics , with pro-Tibet activists and curmudgeons of all stripes disrupting ceremonies to try to send the Chinese hosts a message .
" Oh , but the Olympics are n't supposed to be political ! " we hear .
For the record , I do admit it 's kinda messed up that a post - Communist police state should have the honor of hosting an event created in the spirit of international friendship and brotherhood .
( The same goes for countries that like to beat up their brothers , like most of the West , or Africa , or the Mideast -- oh screw it , it 's a whole orgy of sibling rivalry . )
That said , I too find myself inclined to join in the chorus of woe ; the politicization of the Olympics shows how politics consumes almost everything in society like a bacterial illness .
Consider boycotts ( like Moscow in 1980 and L.A. in 1984 ) and terrorist attacks ( Munich in 1972 and Atlanta in 1996 ) , governments refusing in some circumstances to let " their " athletes and " their " teams participate ( Teheran forbids athletes from competing against their Israeli counterparts ) , controversy over the " international " Games mostly being held in rich and powerful Western nations , and of course the constant grandstanding by various elected and un-elected officials .
We call ourselves " free " , yet so much in our everyday lives is determined by politics .
( Politics , of course , we define as channeling the coercive force of the State to achieve one 's own personal ends . )
The State apparently knows better than you what to eat , what drugs you ought to be taking , how to manage your medical care , who should marry whom , how to dispose of your trash , what you ought to learn in school , when you should start or stop working , blah blah ...
There 's a law for this and a law for that , tax breaks for the privileged , and plenty of government departments to make our lives miserable .
Your economic standard of living is affected by policies crafted by politically connected power brokers .
Even the kind of language you use is a matter for political intervention .
Will you be allowed to live your life in peace or will you be forced to don a uniform , take up arms and shoot some foreigner who never had anything to do with you -- or at least be compelled to pay for it ?
This too is a matter for politics to decide .
Yes , some will decide , others will fight to be able to do the deciding , all will suffer obedience .
And all will grow secretly resentful and try to one - up the other in a fruitless quest for power .
Yet one look at " Yankees versus Red Sox " will show you that division and rivalries are part of our human nature , not simply a bastard spawn of politics and Statism .
We cannot fully escape from this , even if we can and should work to minimize the kind of destructive , artificial divisions we get through Statism .
Indeed , it will be a long time before we are fully able to " live free or die " as long as our lives and society are shaped by such political conflict and power - mongering .
Yet I am reminded of the " Christmas Day Truce " of World War I , a moment of peace and shared brotherhood in the midst of a horrible conflict .
The Olympics , at their best , were meant to serve as a similar moment when coercive , discordant politics could be dismissed and people could find the opportunity to expend their energies on other things -- a celebration of man at the height of his ability and prowess as shown by the Olympic athletes ; a celebration of merit over privilege ; a celebration of the kind of heights man can achieve ( at least in the physical realm ) ; a celebration of true heroism ( not the kind that involves bombing poor people for the Nation ) .
By contrast , coercive politics and Statism , more then merely causing fights at the Seder table , is based on a view of man as something to be corralled , controlled , stifled and held in contempt , in favor of some vague , false " common good " .
Forgive me if I sound a bit corny or even Randian here , but I tell you this : the kind of flourishing stateless society we wish to develop would depend on a certain spirit of lofty aspiration , which the current state of things would suggest is sorely lacking .
It would also depend on the kind of human solidarity shown by the " Aryan " Luz Long to the " Negro " Jesse Owens in front of a glowering Hitler at the 1932 Games .
If the Olympics ( and especially the Special Olympics ) can promote this positive spirit , then that makes them inherently non-political and even anti-political .
So I say , " Let the Games be the Games . "
Leave your placards and boycotts and petty political posturing at the door .
Let the Senators and the Presidents and royalty stay at home .
Let them be forgotten -- ignored even !
The Olympics should be a truce , albeit brief , to let us focus on less petty and more humanly significant things .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Golf and tennis not challenging enough ?
Some of today ’s hardest - charging technology executives are turning to 100 - mile bike races , marathons and high - endurance athletics for the kicks they crave .

The day - to - day thirst for success does n’t end when CEOs and other business leaders leave the boardrooms of their billion - dollar companies , according to guests at the Reuters Global Technology , Media and Telecoms Summit this week .
“ It is usually not a six - or seven - hour day , so part of it is you probably want something to keep you mentally and physically in shape , ” said Enrique Salem , chief operating officer of software maker Symantec Corp .
“ You want to do something that is challenging , that is n’t about running a business . ”
Salem owns a Giant TCR C1 bike , which retails for over $ 3,000 , and last year completed a charity ride around California ’s Lake Tahoe twice -- the second time in under 4 hours .
His sojourns do n’t stop there .
“ I skied 19 days last year .
When I ’m on the slopes , I ’m trying to avoid trees and other skiers .
So I am not thinking about what it takes to run Symantec .
I think it ’s a bit of mental relief , ” he said .
Long - distance running offers the same meditative reward for Hulu Chief Executive Jason Kilar , whose five marathons include Iceland , Portland , Seattle and New York , twice .
“ I love setting goals , ” said the head of the video website owned by News Corp and General Electric Co’s NBC Universal .
“ Life is more interesting when you set goals that are not easy , and having a goal of a marathon ... is a very fun thing that focuses you in a way that just running 3 miles or 6 miles a day does not , ” Kilar added .
They are not alone .
In fact , Denver - based CEO Challenges runs sports competitions designed for top executives , including Triathlons , Ironman , Fishing , Sailing and Tennis Challenges .
HOUR CLUB
Dave DeWalt , CEO of security software maker McAfee Inc , described his goal for the grueling Mount Diablo Challenge , a 10.8 - mile bike ride up 3,240 - feet to the peak in the San Francisco Bay area .
“ There is a race from the bottom to the top , ” said DeWalt , who also wrestled in college and had been invited to Olympic trials .
“ I can only compete in the over 200 - pound class because there are some really fast riders .
But there is the “ hour club ” -- if you can do it in one hour or less , there is a special club .
I ca n’t quite crack it yet but I am working on it . ”
To be sure , golf courses , tennis courts and myriad other sports -- beloved by leaders of all stripes -- wo n’t go out of business any time soon .
For example , the crop of presidential hopeful has diverse taste in athletics .
Sen . Hilary Clinton owns her own bowling ball , Sen. Barack Obama loves basketball , and Sen. John McCain likes to hike around the hills of his Sedona , Arizona , ranch .
Some business leaders aspire to adrenaline - driven jaunts , but are willing to leave the serious challenges to more adventurous peers . ”
“ I do n’t have a lot of athletic bones in my body .
I wish I had more , ” said AT&T Inc Chief Financial Officer Rick Lindner .
“ We ’ve got ( two ) boats ... that we keep on Lake Travis .
I will still jump on the water skis from time to time . ”
“ Once or twice a year when conditions are perfect , the sun is shining , it ’s 90 degrees , the water is smooth .
I get up , do a circle , come around and have a beer and say , “ By God , I can still do it . ” ”

Bush administration stacked Justice Department with right - wingers
By David Walsh
27 June 2008
A report issued jointly by the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility , both of the US Justice Department , lifts the lid on one of the numerous efforts by the Bush administration to fill the American government with right - wing ideologues .
Political appointees in the Justice Department in 2002 and especially in 2006 screened candidates for its Honors Program , the only means by which the department hires law school graduates and judicial law clerks without prior legal experience , and its Summer Law Intern Program ( SLIP ) , on the basis of political and ideological criteria , in violation of department rules and federal law .
Alleged “ leftists ” and liberals were routinely excluded by two members of the screening committee in 2006 , one of whom attended a fanatical Christian college in Florida .
The “ politicization ” of these hiring practices is entirely in line with Bush administration policy as a whole , and , specifically , the firing of eight US attorneys and the forced resignation of numerous others in 2005 - 2006 in what was clearly a politically motivated purge .
The eight were dismissed because they prosecuted Republicans or failed to pursue charges against Democrats on various corruption charges .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez and a number of subordinates were forced to resign in part because of this episode .
The Office of the Inspector General is conducting a separate investigation into the hiring practices of the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division .
Bradley Schlozman , a senior political official in the division from 2003 to 2006 , including five months as its acting assistant attorney general , is accused of inappropriately considering the political loyalties of candidates for the voting and appellate sections .
A number of the same names , right - wing Bush administration appointees , come up in both the fired attorneys scandal and the Honors Program / Summer Law Intern Program controversy .
A centrally organized plan is obviously at work .
The overall aim of the administration ’s hiring practices has been to flood the federal government with individuals who are hostile to civil and workers ’ rights , pro-business and sympathetic to Christian fundamentalist and other right - wing currents .
The joint Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) - Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) report , issued June 24 , was carried out in response to complaints that “ political and ideological affiliations were considered as factors in evaluating candidates ” for the Honors Program and SLIP from 2002 to 2006 .
One of the allegations came in the form of an anonymous letter to Congress signed by “ A Group of Concerned Department of Justice Employees ” in April 2007 .
In 2002 the Honors Program and SLIP hiring process was fundamentally changed by an Attorney General ’s Working Group “ to enable the Department ’s senior leadership to have more input into the selection of candidates , ” according to the OIG / OPR study .
( John Ashcroft was Attorney General at the time . )
This was clearly the opening shot in the “ politicization ” of the process .
Prior to that time , career employees within each of the Justice Department ’s components administered the interview and selection process .
Beginning in 2002 , a Screening Committee composed primarily of politically appointed employees from the department ’s “ leaderships offices ” had to approve all Honors Program and SLIP candidates for interviews by the various divisions .
The various department components — Federal Bureau of Prisons , Drug Enforcement Administration , Executive Office for Immigration Review , etc. — would still do their own hiring , but the candidates would be centrally processed .
The highly political Screening Committee thus could determine the pool out of which the various divisions chose their personnel .
As the report notes , it is permissible for the Justice Department to consider political and ideological affiliations when hiring for political positions .
However , department policy and civil service law prohibit discrimination in hiring career positions on the basis of political ideology .
The analysis done by the OIG / OPR revealed that the 2002 Screening Committee ‘ deselected ’ ( i.e. , removed from the list of possible candidates ) 80 percent of the applicants with liberal affiliations , but only 4 percent of those with conservative affiliations ( and 29 percent of those with neutral affiliations ) .
All seven applicants who indicated they were members of the liberal American Constitution Society were struck from the list of possible candidates , while only 2 of the 29 applicants who indicated membership in the ultra - right Federalist Society were deselected .
Among the most highly qualified candidates , more than half of those with Democratic affiliations were thrown out , while none of the Republican - affiliated candidates were rejected .
Candidates for the summer intern program faced the same sort of political discrimination .
Some 84 percent of the prospective interns with liberal affiliations were deselected , whereas only 3 percent of those with right - wing affiliations were rejected .
When interviewed recently by investigators , the four members of the 2002 screening committee indicated that the screening process “ was a very small part of their work duties , and because of that and the passage of time ... they had difficulty recalling with specificity anything about their work on Honors Program and SLIP hiring . ”
The OIG / OPR investigators note , “ While we are unable to prove that any specific members made deselections based on the prohibited factors , the data indicated that the Committee considered political or ideological affiliations when deselecting candidates . ”
For whatever reason , perhaps because the Bush administration was focused on the war in Iraq and other matters , there seems not to have been any political interference in 2003 - 2005 .
In 2006 , however , officials in the Justice Department set about politically vetting candidates for jobs and the summer intern program with a vengeance .
Two of the three members of the 2006 screening committee ( the third , David Fridman , apparently did his job conscientiously ) had an obvious ax to grind .
The chair of the committee , Michael Elston , then Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty ’s Chief of Staff , has an impressive track record .
He reportedly worked on early drafts of the Patriot Act , the blueprint for an American police - state , and , as Assistant US Attorney , worked on the prosecutions of John Walker Lindh , the American youth who fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan , and Zacarias Moussaoui , the alleged Al Qaeda operative whose flight school training the FBI peculiarly refused to investigate in 2001 .
Elston also helped carry out the firings of seven US attorneys in 2006 and “ was accused of threatening at least four of the eight US attorneys to keep quiet about their ousters ” ( Associated Press , June 16 , 2007 ) .
Both McNulty and Elson resigned from the Justice Department in 2007 as part of the fall - out from the US attorneys scandal .
The third member of the Honors Program / SLIP screening committee in 2006 was one Esther Slater McDonald .
Like a number of other youthful Bush appointees at the Justice Department , McDonald is a graduate of one of the Christian fundamentalist ‘ institutes of higher learning , ’ in her case apparently the most repressive and extreme .
She attended Pensacola Christian College in Pensacola , Florida .
The school , which is not accredited , has strict rules on male - female relationships , according to the Chronicle of Higher Education :
“ At Pensacola any physical contact between members of the opposite sex is forbidden .
...
There are restrictions on when and where men and women may speak to each other .
Some elevators and stairwells may be used only by women ; others may be used only by men .
Socializing on particular benches is forbidden .
If a man and a woman are walking to class , they may chat ; if they stop en route , though , they may be in trouble .
Generally men and women caught interacting in any ‘ unchaperoned area ’ — which is most of the campus — could be subject to severe penalties . ”
McDonald , explains Kate Klonick of Talking Points Memo , “ who arrived at DOJ [ Department of Justice ] in September 2006 , was part of the crowd of young DOJ hires who came in during the second Bush term after Alberto Gonzales moved from White House counsel to attorney general .
They had limited experience , fierce loyalty to President Bush and sterling conservative credentials . ”
McDonald was hired by Monica Goodling , another figure involved in the fired prosecutors scandal , who resigned from the Justice Department in April 2007 .
Goodling , at 33 , served as the link between Attorney General Gonzalez and the White House .
Also a product of Christian institutions , she was an undergraduate at Messiah College in Pennsylvania and obtained a law degree from Pat Robertson ’s Regent University in Virginia .
According to Elston ’s comments to the OIG / OPR investigators , when he told Goodling that the new hire , McDonald , was to be on the screening committee , Goodling “ seemed pleased that Esther had been picked and said something to the effect ‘ well , she ’s had experience in this sort of thing . ’ ”
It would be interesting to know what Goodling had in mind , because McDonald apparently spent much of her time checking the Internet to see if the prospective candidates were “ leftists ” of one sort or another .
The OIG / OPR inquiry observes , “ We were able to determine that , among other things , McDonald searched for organizations to which candidates belonged , read blogs by or about candidates , and searched Westlaw , school websites , and school newspapers for articles by or about candidates . ”
A November 29 , 2006 email from McDonald about one candidate ’s affiliations provides some flavor of her concerns : “ Poverty & Race Research Council actively works to extend racial discrimination through increased affirmative action and , while there , [ the candidate ] helped draft document arguing that federal law requires recipients of federal funding to seek actively to discriminate in favor of minorities ( racial , language , and health ) rather than merely to treat all applicants equally ; Greenaction is an extreme organization founded by Greenpeace members and promoting civil disobedience and engaging in violence in protests , and the organization adheres to the Principles of Environmental Justice , which are positively ridiculous ( e.g. , recognizing ‘ our spiritual interdependence to the sacredness of our Mother Earth ’ and ‘ oppos[ing ] military occupation , repression and exploitation of lands , peoples and cultures , and other life forms ’ ) ; [ the candidate ] also is / was a member of Greenpeace ; [ the candidate ’s ] essay is filled with leftist commentary and buzz words like ‘ environmental justice ’ and ‘ social justice . ’ ”
The third member of the committee , David Fridman , remembered McDonald objecting to one candidate because he was allegedly an “ anarchist ” ; she would also circle or identify troubling items on a candidate ’s application : having a clerkship with a liberal judge , or having worked for a liberal member of Congress or law professor .
McDonald had concerns about one candidate because he was a member of the Council on American Islamic Relations , although he was top of his class at Harvard .
Candidates were rejected by McDonald and Elston who had had internships with organizations such as Human Rights Watch or the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , or who had assisted in defending someone held at Guantánamo Bay .
All in all , 55 percent of candidates whose applications indicated liberal affiliations in 2006 were deselected , compared with 18 percent of those with right - wing links .
Forty percent of liberal - minded students with excellent academic qualifications were excluded , against only 6 percent of the conservative students with equivalent credentials .
Among the prospective summer interns , 82 percent of those with liberal affiliations were struck off the list , while only 13 percent of the students with conservative ties suffered the same fate .
The behavior of the majority of the screening committee in 2006 was so egregious that it caused something of an uproar in the divisions of the Justice Department who had had hundreds of their choices rejected .
Accusations of political interference surfaced , culminating in the anonymous letter of April 2007 .
Elston resigned from the department over another scandal in June , McDonald quit one day before OIG / OPR investigators were to interview her in October 2007 .
The investigation concludes : “ We believe that McDonald ’s and Elston ’s conduct constituted misconduct and also violated the Department ’s policies and civil service law that prohibit discrimination in hiring based on political or ideological affiliations . ”
In fact , the Bush administration attempted , and succeeded in large measure , in transforming a major federal government department into an instrument for the pursuit of extreme right - wing policies .
( CNN ) --
The 19 - year - old woman whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case is recovering well and wants to see the ocean and a pop concert , her doctors and a family lawyer said Wednesday .
Dr. Albert Reiter , who treated Kerstin , is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time .

She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life , they said .
Kerstin Fritzl , whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure , is now well enough to speak , stand and walk with assistance , her doctors said .
Doctors said that " little novelties " such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives .
Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams , said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger , director of the clinic where the family is living .
He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down .
It was then , Kepplinger said , that doctors became confident Kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally .
Her immune system has improved , and she is continuing to have physiotherapy , including strengthening exercises , he said .
Watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes »
The two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement , like Kerstin , and those who lived above ground , apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again , the doctors and the family 's lawyer said .

Incest dungeon girl wakes from coma
" We are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far , " said lawyer Christoph Herbst , who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near Amstetten , west of Vienna , where Kerstin and her family are recovering .
Kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between Elisabeth , 43 , and Elisabeth 's father , Josef Fritzl , 73 , according to police .
He is awaiting trial .
Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly , fathering seven children with her .
Six of the children survived .
Kerstin fell unconscious in April , and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention .
Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten , where staff grew suspicious and called police , who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse .
Kerstin was suffering from kidney , lung , and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital , said Dr. Albert Reiter , director of the hospital .
Doctors were able to turn her health around , but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks , he said .
Doctors started reducing Kerstin 's medication May 12 , allowing her to emerge from the coma , he said .
Three days later , she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers , he said , and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat .
Her mother was at Kerstin 's bedside regularly , and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin 's health improve .
On Sunday , Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them , he said .
Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby .
" It was a special moment where , walking , we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life , " Reiter said .
Kerstin and two of her brothers , ages 18 and 5 , had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother , never seeing daylight .
A television was their only contact with the outside world .
The other three children Josef Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife , who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive .
In recent weeks , the wife and the three children have had several meetings with Kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement .
The doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other .
" It is clear that [ the two sides ] have a different temper of life , " Kepplinger said .
" These different ways of living , the two parts of the family , still have to come to some agreement . "
Still , the entire family is " very happy " to be reunited , Herbst said .
" This is an incredible drawing - near to each other .
There is incredible joy among them , " he said .
" It is wonderful to see the way they are living together . "
He appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy .
There continues to be " big ambivalence " about the " grandfather issue , " as Kepplinger called it , and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with Fritzl , who is now behind bars .

After my review of do - it - yourself - Arch , I wanted to test a distro with a totally different philosophy , one that aims to give you a complete desktop system from the start .
The problem was , I did n’t want to test Ubuntu , OpenSuse , Mandriva , Mint … those are too well known .
I ’ve installed them many times before and , well , by now I think they ’re a bit boring 🙂
Pardus is a relatively new kid on the block , but it has been gathering positive reviews .
These are my impressions .
Introduction and Goals
Pardus is a Turkish Linux distribution , founded in 2003 .
The first version , Pardus 1.0 , came out at the end of 2005 .
It comes as a single , installable CD , but not a LiveCD , which is a bit unusual in this day and age .
The name is derived from the scientific name of the Anatolian leopard ( Panthera pardus tulliana ) .
Consequently , the distribution ’s icon is a rather serious looking leopard .
Another thing about Pardus is that it can safely be called “ the official OS of Turkey ” .
According to Wikipedia , it ’s “ developed by [ the ] Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology ( UEKAE ) , which is under the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey ( TÜBİTAK ) . ”
That ’s a nice guarantee for some professionalism right there .
Pardus is nothing if not ambitious .
For starters , it is n’t based on an existing distribution , but comes with its own installer , configuration center , even its own package manager , etc .
A full list of its projects can be found at their website .
If that does n’t convince you , take a further look at the About page available there .
It ’s all very official .
One of the reasons that Pardus came into existence is the requirement of “ [ a ] n operating system [ … ] on which critical applications can work for the purpose of national defense , security and savings , which supports an open and standard data structure , whose source code is open as to allow for security monitoring and which can be deployed without suffering any financial burden ” , and one of the goals is “ [ t ] o ensure that it is an operating system which can be installed and used more easily than the existing Linux distributions and other competitive operating systems . ”
Lofty goals indeed .
Let ’s see how it measures up .
Pardus 2008 was installed and tested on a machine with a Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Duo CPU E6550 @ 2.33GHz , 2 GB of RAM , and a nVidia 8600 GT graphic card .
Installation
As I said , Pardus is n’t available as a LiveCD .
There was a non-installable LiveCD version of Pardus 2007 , but I guess they just decided that it was n’t necessary for 2008 .
I tend to agree …most of the time , a LiveCD does n’t tell me much about the performance or even the look of the installed product , since I need the nvidia drivers which are never included by default anyway .
On booting up , the first thing I noticed was how nice the Pardus leopard faded into view .
I may be easily impressed , but I never saw that before in a GRUB install .
The installer itself is in Turkish , but a quick push on the F2 button reveals a choice of other languages .
English is one of them , but I picked Dutch .
I was curious how good the translation would be .
The system then booted into a very nice and professional looking installer called YALI ( Yet Another Linux Installer ) .
Yes , there are some very cutesy icons , which can or cannot be your thing , but the information is easily understood and the layout is pleasing to the eyes .
Two thumbs up .
First , you have to agree to the GPL , and then there ’s a possibility to check the CD integrity , which is always a good idea .
After that , you set up the keyboard layout ( with a possibility to check if you ’ve chosen the right one ) , select your time zone , and add your users .
There ’s a checkbox here , asking if you want to grant the new user administrative privileges .
I ’d suggest checking it , because if you do n’t , you wo n’t even be able to su into your root account .
Setting up that root account is next , then the host name , and then there ’s a friendly partitioner waiting for you , with Linux partitions having cute penguin faces , and that leopard staring at you again when you select the Pardus partition .
After that , you just have to specify where you want the bootloader installed , and lean back for about half an hour while your system is installing .
I say half an hour because that ’s the installer ’s own estimation , but things only took 20 minutes on my system .
This part is very Windows like , with screens that tell you about the awesomeness of the system you ’re about to use .
Configuration and Documentation
Upon rebooting I found a very nice looking GRUB menu waiting for me , which would have been great if I had asked to install GRUB in the MBR .
I had n’t , because I did n’t want to erase my previous GRUB installation .
Seemed like the installer ignored my wishes there .
Fortunately , Arch was listed and booted just fine .
After the first boot , a wizard called Kaptan popped up .
Besides configuring your mouse and network , it also lets you choose the default look of your Pardus installation .
It provides some default panel styles ( with completely arbitrary names like NextGeneration and Transparent ) , and a choice of circus - themed backgrounds .
It also lets you add the contrib repository to the package manager .
It ’s a nice way of personalising your desktop right from the start .
Still , you ’ll probably want to fire up TASMA afterwards , which is the Pardus Configuration Center , to do some heavy duty configuring .
It ’ll probably seem very familiar to you , since it ’s essentially the KDE Control Center , with some added , original modules .
If you ’re used to the plethora of KDE configuration possibilities , be sure to check “ Extra modules ” under Preferences , since some of them are hidden by default .
There are no surprises here … with such a solid base , TASMA works very well .
Of course , when you ’re learning / configuring a new system , you ’ll probably want to have the documentation close by .
I ’ve learned a long time ago that simply fiddling around can be a recipe for disaster .
I ’m sorry to say that I find Pardus seriously lacking here .
First of all … where is the documentation ?
There ’s no link to any recent documentation on the main page .
I checked Distrowatch to see if they even existed , and sure enough , there ’s a wiki and a forum , they ’re just very well hidden .
Maybe that ’s because neither is of very high quality .
When the busiest topic at the forum is the wishlist ( with 145 topics ) , you can hardly speak of buzzing activity .
Considering the wiki , well … I do n’t want to sound bigheaded here , but this blog has seen more visits in a month than the entire Pardus wiki in three years , and there ’s a reason for that .
There ’s not much information here , many pages are “ under construction ” , and other links just tell you you have to login in order to edit , even if you just want to read the article .
It ’s a mess , and even worse , it ’s an outdated mess .
There ’s an Installation guide on the main page , but it ’s meant for Pardus 2007 .
The most recent article in the “ Documents ” section is dated 28/06/2006 .
The page that ’s supposed to give you some screenshots of Pardus 2008 still points to 2007 .
The screenshots of the project page are outdated too .
It ’s a shame , really .
Let me give an example here .
After the install , I wanted to install the nvidia drivers .
According to the wiki , I have to download a number of packages , then run nvidia - xconfig .
First of all , those packages do n’t exist anymore .
I found the right ones , but nvidia - xconfig resulted in a black screen and a “ nvidia module not found ” error .
Manually editing xorg.conf did n’t help either .
I found the solution in the forums :
There ’s a Display Manager in TASMA which configures xorg .
conf for you .
All you have to do is point it to the nvidia driver .
It works brilliantly , but how am I supposed to know that , especially when the wiki tells me otherwise ?
Using Pardus
Once I had my nvidia drivers installed , I found that there was n’t much configuration left .
I do have to add that I do n’t have a wifi network card , or even a printer .
From other reviews , I gathered that there are n’t any problems in those areas , with one review noting that wifi configuration was even easier than in Ubuntu .
Since Pardus has its own networkmanager , that ’s entirely possible .
It certainly did n’t have any problems with my wired connection , but I never came across a Linux distribution that does .
Installing packages was easy enough .
Pardus comes with its own package manager called PiSi , which stands for Packages installed Successfully , as intended ( it also means kitten in Turkish , which explains the sick looking cat I guess … ) .
It certainly lived up to its name , because I had no problems with it whatsoever .
You can use it from the command line , or the GUI .
Multimedia support in Pardus is top of the bill .
I could play DVDs , audio CDs , Youtube movies and Apple trailers out of the box , plus all my audio and video files .
Even the Apple trailers that throw an error in my Arch installation , played well here , probably because Pardus does n’t use the mplayer plugin , but the gecko - mediaplayer plugin .
Whatever the reason , things worked well .
The only issue I had was KsCD throwing an error when I inserted an audio CD .
It complained about the rights on / dev/cdrom , but the CDs played just fine in Kaffeine .
The look overall is pleasing to the eye .
I was a little surprised that yellow , which is abundantly used in the installer and the KDM login screen , is n’t present in the KDE theme and the icons , where blue is the dominating color .
That ’s not nearly as distinctive , since blue has been the default KDE color since forever .
The icon theme is custom made by the way , and is called Tulliana ( there ’s that leopard again ) .
There are some minor and less minor annoyances though .
For one , Pardus does n’t seem to remember some preferences .
Also , whenever I boot up , the time ’s always two hours off , whether I use NTP or not .
Then , some application windows do n’t remember their position when I close them .
And I have to check “ Extra Modules ” in TASMA over and over again .
Another thing , which apparently is a known issue , is the fact that mplayer is still in Turkish , no matter what language you chose at the beginning of the installation .
Pardus tries to get around this by providing KMplayer and Gnome Media Player , but that ’s not the way to do it .
Lastly , GTK integration simply sucks .
Why is this important in a KDE distribution ?
Well , it would n’t be , but Pardus 2008 comes with Firefox 3 as the default webbrowser , which uses the GTK toolkit .
Some browsing around unearthed talk of a “ Tullifox ” Firefox theme which would match the Tulliana icons , but apparently it never happened .
Now it just looks plain and ugly , compared to everything else .
It gets even weirder if you know that Pardus installs a couple of GTK - styles ( like QTcurve ) , but forgets about the gtk - qt - engine , so you have no way to use them .
Even worse , the hicolor - icon - theme and gnome - icon - theme packages are n’t installed either .
As a result , GTK applications do n’t integrate at all with the rest of the desktop .
Gnome Media
Player even lacks a volume button .
It ’s a real shame , and because everything else looks so slick and professional , this particular issue stands out even more .
Here ’s a side - by - side comparison of Firefox and Konqueror .
Gnome Media
Player is visible too .
Conclusion
There ’s no doubt that Pardus 2008 is one of the better Linux distributions out there .
In the week I tested it I found not much wrong with the way it works , apart from an annoying tendency to forget some settings .
It ’s been reliable , stable , and relatively speedy .
However , there is some work to be done before it can compete with the likes of Ubuntu , like providing an even more polished look , especially when it comes to the integration of GTK applications .
It also needs better and more up - to - date documentation .
Pardus is a very ambitious project , and so far , it does n’t quite attain its goals just yet .
I have no doubt however that it ’s just a matter of time .
In the meantime , it ’s a viable alternative for anyone who is n’t satisfied with the offerings of the big - name distributions .

Signs are emerging of a possible alliance this fall between Ron Paul , the libertarian - minded rebel Republican , and Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party 's presidential nominee .
Paul was the Libertarian nominee in 1988 , and many of his supporters are libertarian - minded on economic and social issues .
Just before formally ending his presidential bid Thursday night , the Texas congressman praised Barr , and in a statement yesterday , Barr reciprocated .
" Congressman Ron Paul has fought tirelessly in both the Libertarian Party and the Republican Party to minimize government power and maximize individual liberty , " said Barr , a former six - term GOP congressman from Georgia .
" I want to thank him for all that he has done for liberty in this nation , and encourage him to continue his fight through whatever avenues he sees fit . "
The Libertarian Party plans to get Barr on the ballot in 48 states in November , and Barr could get a significant boost if a sizable number of the 1.1 million people who voted for Paul during the Republican primaries go his way .
Some analysts say Barr could be a spoiler , taking votes away from presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in key swing states , including Colorado , Nevada , and his home state of Georgia .
Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader also began courting Paul voters yesterday .
" Ron Paul was a lightning rod for millions of Americans against the war in Iraq and for the protection of personal liberties that the two major parties have turned their back on - by continuing to support the illegal criminal war and the PATRIOT Act , " the Nader campaign said in a statement .
" There is a clear choice for those who want to support a candidate who will stand up against the war and stand up for personal liberties and privacy . "
On Thursday night , Paul told supporters attending the Texas Republican Party convention in Houston that he was ending his campaign and starting the group Campaign for Liberty to help elect libertarian - leaning Republicans .
Paul hopes that at least 11,000 of his supporters fill a Minneapolis arena for a counter - convention on Sept. 2 , timed to coincide with the Republican National Convention in neighboring St. Paul .

For those who want to test the chicken - keeping waters before diving in , the company lets customers try out its Eco -Coop package and see how it goes for as much as six weeks ( or even longer by arrangement ) before they commit to keeping it .
Included in the AUD 360 package are a chicken coop and two hens along with feeder , waterer , food and straw .
Customers can try it out and see how well keeping chickens fits in with their lifestyle and garden ; if they decide to return the package , they get back AUD 260 of the money they paid .
For those who decide to keep the set , on the other hand , benefits include fresh , free - range eggs ( up to six per chicken per week , the company says ) and an environmentally sustainable pet that eats scraps , removes weeds and turns compost .
( Rentachook 's coops , incidentally , are also made as sustainably as possible , using Australian grown plantation pine and wheels from old prams . )
Delivery and setup ranges from AUD 50 to AUD 80 , depending on location .
In a world with skyrocketing food costs and growing interest in organic and sustainable methods , there 's plenty of reason for consumers far and wide to produce their own .
Make it easier for them — such as by reducing the up - front commitment — and you just may be rewarded with some golden eggs yourself !

Cops arrest woman in alleged restaurant rat scheme
While historians debate whether George W. Bush has been the worst president in U.S. history , a global consensus that he inspires the least confidence of all the world ’s major leaders appears to have emerged .
An average of two out of three respondents in 20 nations whose combined population make up 60 percent of the world ’s population said they either had " no " or " not too much confidence " in Bush " to do the right thing regarding world affairs , " by far the highest negative rating of eight leaders featured in a new survey [ . pdf ] released Monday by WorldPublicOpinion.org ( WPO ) .
The lack of confidence in Bush ’s leadership was particularly strong in the greater Middle East , Latin America , and among Washington ’s traditional allies in Western Europe , including two of the nations visited by Bush in his valedictory tour of " Old Europe " during the past week  Britain ( 77 percent negative ) and France ( 85 percent negative ) .
Indeed , in 16 out of 19 countries polled , not including the U.S. , majorities or pluralities rated Bush negatively .
Only two countries , Nigeria and India , gave him positive ratings overall , while views were roughly evenly split in Thailand .
Of the world ’s leaders , only Pakistan ’s president , Pervez Musharraf , was perceived negatively in more countries  a 37 percent plurality of Chinese respondents said they had " a lot " or " some confidence " in his leadership  but his overall negative rating , 54 percent , was not as low as Bush’s .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad received the next most negative rating at 52 percent .
But pluralities in three Asian countries  China , India , and Indonesia  said they had a lot or some confidence in his " doing the right thing in world affairs . "
The survey , which was conducted between January and May , was overseen by the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) , WPO ’s parent organization .
The 20 countries included the U.S. , Argentina , and Mexico in the Americas ; Britain , France , Spain , Ukraine , and Russia in Europe ; Iran , Egypt , the Palestinian Territories , Azerbaijan , Jordan , and Turkey in the greater Middle East ; Nigeria in Africa ; and China , India , Indonesia , Thailand , and South Korea in Asia .
As poorly as Bush performed in the survey , no other major national leader , including Chinese President Hu Jintao , Russian President Vladimir Putin , French Nicolas Sarkozy , and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , among others , enjoyed the confidence of most respondents or even of majorities or pluralities in more than half of the countries polled .
Of all the leaders featured , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon received more positive than negative ratings in nine countries , three more than the next most positive performance , by Britain ’s Brown , who was rated positively in six countries overall .
Still , an average of only 35 percent of all respondents said they had a lot or some confidence in Ban , compared to 38 percent who said they had no or not too much confidence .
Nonetheless , that was the highest rating of any world leader .
" While the worldwide mistrust of George Bush has created a global leadership vacuum , no alternative leader has stepped into the breach , " said WPO ’s director , Steven Kull .
" Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin are popular among some nations , but more mistrust them than trust them .
Also , the nations that trust them are not organized into any clusters that have the potential to be a meaningful bloc . "
The poll ’s findings largely echo those of another major international survey of 24 countries , including 15 that were also covered by WPO , just last week by the Pew Global Attitudes Project here .
It found that , for the first time since Bush became president , attitudes toward the U.S. has improved modestly during 2007 , but that negative views toward Bush himself remained strong , especially in Western Europe , Latin America and the greater Middle East .
In only three of the 24 countries  Tanzania ( which Bush had personally visited just two months before the survey was conducted ) , Nigeria , and India  did majorities say they had a lot or some confidence in Bush to do the right thing in world affairs .
Indeed , the director of the Pew poll , Andrew Kohut , told reporters that the improvement of Washington ’s image appeared to be due more to anticipation of the end of Bush ’s term and the accession of a new president next January than to any other factor .
The poll , which was carried out during April this year , also found that significantly more respondents who said they were paying at least some attention to the U.S. election in all but two countries  the U.S. and Jordan  of the 24 surveyed voiced confidence in Democratic Sen.
Barack Obama than in his Republican rival , Sen. John McCain .
" McCain is probably associated with President Bush , " Kohut suggested when asked to explain the much greater confidence in Obama expressed by respondents .
While Bush ’s negative ratings in the WPO survey were significantly greater than those of the other leaders , he performed better on the positive side of the ledger than either Musharraf or Ahmadinejad .
An average of 23 percent of all respondents said they had at least some confidence in Bush compared to 22 percent for Ahmadinejad and a mere 18 percent for Musharraf .
An average of 28 percent of respondents ( not including China ) gave Hu positive ratings , while 43 percent gave him negative ratings .
His highest ratings came from South Korea ( 56 percent ) , Iran ( 52 percent ) , Egypt ( 47 percent ) , Azerbaijan ( 37 percent ) , and Mexico ( 34 percent ) .
Most negative ratings came from the Palestinian Territories ( 82 percent ) , the U.S. ( 79 percent ) , Jordan ( 59 percent ) , and Turkey ( 58 percent ) .
Putin received an average of 32 percent positive and 49 percent negative ( not including Russia ) .
His most positive assessments came from Asia , particularly China ( 75 percent ) and South Korea ( 54 percent ) .
Ukraine also gave him high marks ( 59 percent ) .
Most negative , on the other hand , were Palestinian ( 85 percent ) , French ( 76 percent ) , and U.S. ( 71 percent ) respondents .
Brown positive and negative ratings were 30 and 43 percent , respectively .
Support was strongest in the U.S. , Nigeria , South Korea , and China , and most negative in the greater Middle East .
Aside from Bush ’s low ratings , Sarkozy ’s were perhaps the most interesting , particularly in light of a succession of surveys over recent years that have shown widespread approval of France and French policies , especially in the Muslim world .
Not including France itself , Sarkozy ’s average positive ratings were only slightly higher than Bush ’s at 26 percent , while 49 percent of respondents gave him a negative score .
In contrast to his predecessor , Jacques Chirac , Sarkozy is widely perceived as having tried to move French policy , especially in the Middle East , closer to Washington’s .
Last month , Bush , who has repeatedly claimed that history will vindicate his more controversial policies , notably his decision to invade to Iraq , earned the highest public disapproval ratings in the history of the Gallup poll , which dates back to the 1930s .
In an informal survey of more than 100 U.S. historians earlier this spring , only two thought his administration would be judged a " success , " while a strong majority  about two out of three  said he would be assessed as the " worst president ever . "

The Tunguska event was caused by a space rock tens of metres across
At 7:17 am on 30 June 1908 , an immense explosion tore through the forest of central Siberia .
Some 80 million trees were flattened over an area of 2,000 square km ( 800 square miles ) near the Tunguska River .
The blast was 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and generated a shock wave that knocked people to the ground 60 km from the epicentre .
The cause was an asteroid or comet just a few tens of metres across which detonated 5 - 10 km above the ground , 100 years ago today .
Eyewitnesses recalled a brilliant fireball resembling a " flying star " ploughing across the cloudless June sky at an oblique angle .
Tunguska reminds us that these impact events have occurred in the relatively recent past
Prof Richard Crowther , STFC
The plume of hot dust trailing the fireball gave rise to descriptions of a " pillar of fire " , which was quickly replaced by a giant cloud of black smoke rising over the horizon .
" The sky split in two and fire appeared high and wide over the forest .
The split in the sky grew larger , and the entire northern side was covered with fire , " one local remembered .
" At that moment I became so hot that I could n't bear it , as if my shirt was on fire I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down , but then the sky slammed shut .
A strong thump sounded , and I was thrown a few yards . "
This eyewitness was lucky , but an elderly hunter who was much closer to the explosion died after being flung against a tree by the blast .
That the airburst did not cause more casualties was in large part due to the remoteness of the area .
Bright light
To many , this event - the biggest space impact of modern times - serves as a reminder of the continuing threat posed to our planet by objects from space .
Leonid Kulik found vast areas of forest had been levelled If the Tunguska " impactor " had exploded over a major city such as London , the death toll would have been up in the millions .
" Everything within the M25 would have been wiped out , " Dr Mark Bailey , director of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland , told BBC News .
The effects of Tunguska were not limited to Siberia .
In London , it was possible to read newspapers and play cricket outdoors at midnight .
This is now thought to have been due to sunlight scattered by dust from the fireball 's plume .
The Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik visited the region in 1921 , interviewed local eyewitnesses and soon realised that a meteorite must have been the cause .
He persuaded the Russian authorities to fund an expedition to the region in 1927 , during which he was able to explore the vast zones of fallen trees .
Scientific expeditions to Tunguska continue today
Enlarge Image
An aerial survey was carried out in 1938 , revealing how the flattened trees were angled away from the epicentre of the explosion over a 50 km - wide zone which formed a butterfly shape .
Trees at the epicentre were charred and stripped of their branches and bark , but were left standing , which would lead to them being coined " telegraph poles " .
Some researchers think a comet would have been too fragile to have caused the Tunguska event , and that an asteroid is therefore the most likely candidate .
But Mark Bailey thinks some comets could contain chunks of tough material that could survive the plunge through Earth 's atmosphere .
Meteor shower Indeed , one theory proposes that the Tunguska object was a fragment of Comet Encke .
This ball of ice and dust is responsible for a meteor shower called the Beta Taurids , which cascade into Earth 's atmosphere in late June and July - the time of the Tunguska event .
Does Lake Cheko have anything to do with the Tunguska blast ?
The absence of any crater connected with the Tunguska event has left the door open for some outlandish alternatives to the meteorite theory .
A lump of anti-matter , a colliding black hole and - inevitably - an exploding alien spaceship have all been proposed as the possible source of the blast .
But in 2007 , Giuseppe Longo , from the University of Bologna , Italy , and his colleagues , suggested they might have found something Leonid Kulik had missed all those years ago .
Lake Cheko does not appear on any maps of the area made before 1908 ; it also happens to lie North - West - West of the epicentre , on the general path taken by the impactor as it plummeted to Earth .
To Dr Longo , a radar signal from beneath the lake is suggestive of a dense object , possibly part of the Tunguska meteorite , buried about 10 m down .
The team plans to conduct an expedition to the area in 2009 , to investigate this possibility .
" We have no positive proof it is an impact crater , we have come to this conclusion [ about Lake Cheko ] through the negation of other hypotheses , " Dr Longo told BBC News last year .
But other researchers , including Gareth Collins and Phil Bland of Imperial College London , cast doubt on the idea Lake Cheko has anything to do with the Tunguska event .
They point to trees older than 100 years which are still standing around the rim of the lake ( and , they say , should have been levelled by the impact ) and the features of the lake itself , which , the researchers argue , are inconsistent with an impact origin .
Rock search
One hundred years on , the Tunguska event remains a vibrant area for study , especially in Russia .
Last week , researchers gathered in Moscow for a scientific conference arranged to coincide with the anniversary .
Felled trees can still be seen today at the Tunguska site Topics on the agenda were the continuing search for pieces of the space rock , the comet versus asteroid debate and the relationship of the event to the Beta Taurid meteor shower .
Dr Longo and colleagues presented a new tree - fall map , which they say is suggestive of two separate objects exploding in the atmosphere over Tunguska on 30 June .
The conference also heard presentations on other historic and prehistoric cosmic impacts and current strategies for tackling an asteroid headed for Earth .
An asteroid on the order of one kilometre in diameter hits the Earth roughly once every 100,000 years .
Kulik used this hut on his expeditions in the first half of the 20th Century Space rocks about 10 m across - roughly the size of the Tunguska object - are thought to hit our planet about once every 3,000 years .
But Mark Bailey suspects they might be more frequent than that .
He has investigated another event in 1930 known as the " Brazilian Tunguska " .
This little - known event was apparently caused by three large meteorites in the upper reaches of the Amazon .
The fires it caused continued uninterrupted for weeks and depopulated hundreds of kilometres of jungle .
And in June 2002 , US military satellites detected an explosion in the Earth 's atmosphere with the energy of 12 kilotonnes of explosive .
The event has been attributed to an asteroid which remained undetected as it approached our planet and plummeted through the atmosphere .
' Nuclear winter '
The international Spaceguard survey programme has been working to identify the Near - Earth Objects larger than 1 km - the class of object could cause a " nuclear winter " if one were to strike the planet , possibly threatening civilisation .
A totem to local thunder god Agby stands at the Tunguska epicentre Objects the size of the one that caused the Tunguska impact are too small to be seen by present - day surveys .
But there is no guarantee the next object will explode over the sea or a sparsely populated wilderness .
This raises an obvious question : how prepared are we for the next one ?
Dr Richard Crowther is head of the United Nations Near Earth Object ( Neo ) programme .
He told the BBC News website : " Tunguska reminds us that these impact events have occurred in the relatively recent past .
" The surveys suggest that objects of this size are numerous enough to anticipate similar events in the relatively near future . "
Many observers are concerned by what they regard as a lack of action to counter the threat posed by near - Earth asteroids .
California - based space advocacy group the Planetary Society recently awarded an Atlanta - based aerospace company $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) to design a spacecraft which could rendezvous with and track the path of the asteroid 99942 Apophis .
In 2029 , this 270 m - wide chunk of cosmic debris will closely approach the Earth - so close , in fact , it will be visible with the naked eye .
If this primordial behemoth passes through a precise region in space , or " keyhole " , several hundred metres wide during this pass , it will strike Earth in 2036 .
Asteroids larger than 1 km have the potential to end civilisation on Earth
The Planetary Society initiated its tagging mission because , it says , Earth - based observations might not be sufficient to rule out an impact in 2036 .
There are several technologies that could be used currently to tackle an asteroid heading on a collision course with Earth .
One proposal is to use nuclear weapons to completely vapourise the object .
Another is to use a spacecraft to " push " the asteroid off course .
This would involve a craft either slowing down or speeding up the object to ensure that it misses its appointment with the Earth 's surface .
If , for some reason , the asteroid is not spotted in time , or the deflection mission arrives at its target too late , it might be necessary to nudge the space rock just enough so that it strikes the ocean , or a remote , thinly populated area on Earth .
Dr Crowther , who is based at the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , comments that Neos " do not recognise national boundaries " .
For this reason among others , he said , it was important that any policy framework established to counter the asteroid threat " should encourage nations to work together to share data , expertise and resources to assess and mitigate the risk of a future impact " .

Sneaking Cyclone News
Out of Myanmar to Facebook Myanmar people and aid workers risk jail to sneak disaster photos to West .
WASHINGTON , May 14 , 2008  --
A half - clothed baby 's body entangled in brush .
Rows of lifeless children lying on the muddy ground , the face of one of them blue .
Survivors crouching close together in mud under tarps .
These are images from the disaster caused by Cyclone Nargis that the military regime that rules Myanmar does not want you to see , but they have found their way out of the repressive country on Facebook.com .
The social networking Web site is accomplishing what Myanmar authorities have tried to prevent Western journalists from doing , by barring them from visiting refugee camps and keeping them away from the few aid workers who have been allowed into the country .
Relief workers and survivors inside Myanmar , formerly Burma , are sending e-mail updates and photos to friends and contacts outside the country to be posted on Facebook .
This one was posted May 13 , 8:29 a.m. :
" Most health issues we encountered were cuts and injuries ( all of them with some degree of serious infection ) , water borne diseases .
There were two people with serious infections and one of them for sure will have to amputate her arm .
The other one may be ok if he can get to the hospital in time .
We left them money to be taken to Yangon Hospital ASAP but not sure if they will go .
The doctors in our group saw more patients in half a day 's time than one week 's practice in Yangon . "
Another one , titled " Fwd : Situation in Burma , May 12 , 2008 , Generals Making Fortune by Stealing Aid for the Victims " reads :
" Plenty of relief materials , provided by UN and INGOs for the cyclone victims , are being sold at some markets in Rangoon .
Some shop owners said that they bought them from soldiers and they are now reselling .
As instructed by the military junta , some business companies are also distributing relief assistance , but they are not trained to make relief effort and their way of delivery is not professional .
In some cases , a truck with Htoo Companies Logo arrived at the waiting victims and threw the food packages to the crowd from the car , without setting foot on the ground .
Many packages were damaged .
" Meanwhile , the junta 's press scrutiny board is instructing journalists to cover the story of soldiers helping the victims , generals visiting disaster areas and distributing aid to the victims , and asking the people to vote for the constitution , etc . "
Since the cyclone hit 11 days ago , already there are more than a dozen online groups on Facebook devoted to Nargis - related news and relief efforts with thousands of members .
One of the groups called Support the Relief Efforts for Burma ( Myanmar ) Cyclone Disaster Victims has more than 6,500 members .
Its creator , Sophie Lwin , is the director of Burma Global Action Network and a Burmese native who lives in the United States .
Lwin said since the Facebook group has gained popularity , more people with eyewitness accounts have come forward with pictures and updates on conditions from inside disaster area .
There are now more than 90 pictures on the group 's page , including many that are not from news organizations .
Lwin said they were getting firsthand accounts from their contacts inside Myanmar by phone , e-mail and instant messaging .
She added that it was a risky practice .
" If the junta finds someone who is corresponding information with any foreign entities , those individuals face 10 [ years ] to 15 years in prison , torture , with their families ' lives at risk , " Lwin said .
" No fair trial , no defense . "
According to Lwin , any foreigners caught sending photos abroad would be " blacklisted , deported immediately and will never be allowed back in the country , fined and have their media related items confiscated . "
Jason Slack , an administrator for the page , said that " for their security and so the junta can't counteract the means by which it comes out , " the less said about how the group is receiving the information , the better .
" At the moment , what information is coming out is through the carefully guarded and difficult - to - trace means that they 've been using for a long time , " Slack said .
He said that after the Saffron Revolution -- a Buddhist - monk - led protest in September 2007 that ended in a violent government crackdown -- activists were worried that Myanmar people featured in protest pictures would be hunted down and arrested .
" So we 're more careful with what we use now , " Slack said .
Freedoms of speech have been restricted by the ruling military junta since it seized power in 1962 .
The current regime came to power in the late 1980s as the State Law and Order Restoration Council , which later changed its name to the State Peace and Development Council .
The SPDC ignored the results of the country 's first democratic elections in May 1990 , which delivered a resounding victory to the opposition National League for Democracy , and arrested its leaders , including Aung San Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Price winner who is the daughter of a slain national hero .
Since then , Suu Kyi has been mostly under house arrest .
The regime refuses to address political reconciliation and remains under heavy U.S. economic sanctions .
Freedoms of speech are still heavily restricted , and the country once dubbed " the rice bowl of Asia " is now plagued with poverty , disease , crime and corruption .
Cyclone Nargis threatens the country 's more than 45 million people who are already living a precarious existence .
A nationwide referendum was scheduled for May 10 , on a constitution drafted by the SPDC .
The elections were expected by Myanmar experts to be " free but not fair . "
The junta refused to postpone the elections as the country 's people struggled with the aftermath of the cyclone .
With the junta attempting to block foreign reporting on the extent of the damage and on the government 's response , Web sites like Facebook may become a more important source of news and information .
There are still some restrictions -- you must be a member of Facebook to see the group 's page .

Yesterday , Josh Marshall wrote :
" Obama has been saying for almost a year that more troops are needed in Afghanistan .
McCain has said that was n't the case , that Iraq was the central battleground in the war on terror .
Moreover , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says that we need more troops in Afghanistan but we none are available unless we pull substantial numbers out of Iraq -- which McCain is ruling out .
So let 's all say it out loud : McCain is now copying Obama 's position on Afghanistan .
And with troops that he does n't have since he 's against pulling any out of Iraq . "
He 's right .
A bit of documentation :
December 2006 :
" Asked if the U.S. would send more troops to Afghanistan , McCain responded , " The British have said that they will be sending additional troops , taking troops out of Iraq and into Afghanistan .
" If it 's necessary , we will , and I 'm sure we would be agreeable , but the focus here is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police , as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence . " "
July 6 , 2008 :
" Barack Obama and John McCain are proposing sharply different strategies to seize the initiative from a resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan , positions that underscore the two leading presidential candidates ' competing visions of how to wage the war on terrorism . (...)
If elected , Obama says , he would immediately withdraw thousands of ground troops from Iraq and send them to Afghanistan to help undermanned US forces defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda . (...)
However , McCain , a former fighter pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war , says Iraq , not Afghanistan , is the " central front " in the war on terrorism .
He believes that NATO and Pakistan must do more in Afghanistan until the United States can draw down its commitment in Iraq - a position which tracks Bush administration strategy .
McCain 's advisers say that if he becomes president he would build on President Bush 's decision to rely on NATO forces - which now have about 20,000 troops in Afghanistan - and would prod Pakistan to take on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters camped inside its borders . "
December 2007 ( in Foreign Affairs ) :
" Our recommitment to Afghanistan must include increasing NATO forces , suspending the debilitating restrictions on when and how those forces can fight , expanding the training and equipping of the Afghan National Army through a long - term partnership with NATO to make it more professional and multiethnic , and deploying significantly more foreign police trainers .
It must also address the current political deficiencies in judicial reform , reconstruction , governance , and anticorruption efforts . "
February 2008 :
" John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for November 's US presidential race , is to launch a diplomatic offensive to push France and Germany to do more to help British forces in Afghanistan .
Mr McCain has told The Sunday Telegraph that he plans to bang European heads together .
" I 'll go over there and sit down with them , " he said , to discuss what he sees as " Nato 's failure to do the heavy lifting in Afghanistan " . "
July 9 , 2008 :
" While John McCain has vociferously supported the surge strategy in Iraq , he has been less vocal about the ongoing war in Afghanistan .
He called on NATO and other allies of the U.S. to send more troops today , but stopped short of advocating additional American soldiers be deployed to the region until he spoke with commanders on the ground .
“ I would like to have our allies make a bigger commitment , both in personnel and other ways , ” he said .
“ I ’d like to hear from our military leaders , our chairman of the joint chiefs , as well as the military commanders there . ” (...)
McCain ’s rival , Barack Obama , has made sending additional troops to Afghanistan one of the cornerstones of his foreign policy . "
" Just one week ago " :
" McCain said just one week ago that the way to solve the situation in Afghanistan was to look at " a broad variety of areas " -- none of which were an increased troop presence , but instead included some things that were absent from his speech today , including " the effectiveness of the Karzai government , ungovernable areas , ungoverned , uncontrolled areas of the Afghan - Pakistan border . " "
Until yesterday , McCain has only advocated sending NATO troops .
This may be because as long as we stay in Iraq , we have no additional troops to send .
( Though McCain also thinks that " Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq . "
Oddly enough , there 's also this : " The most " critical " difference between the two candidates , McCain said , is Obama 's belief that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are disconnected . "
All very confusing . )
Democrats have been saying for years that we need more troops in Afghanistan , and that one of the huge costs of invading Iraq was that it diverted attention and resources from Afghanistan .
Offhand , the first time I can think of that Obama said this was in his speech opposing the invasion :
" You want a fight , President Bush ?
Let ’s finish the fight with Bin Laden and al - Qaeda , through effective , coordinated intelligence , and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism , and a homeland security program that involves more than color - coded warnings . "
Or this , from 2007 :
" Moreover , until we change our approach in Iraq , it will be increasingly difficult to refocus our efforts on the challenges in the wider region - on the conflict in the Middle East , where Hamas and Hezbollah feel emboldened and Israel 's prospects for a secure peace seem uncertain ; on Iran , which has been strengthened by the war in Iraq ; and on Afghanistan , where more American forces are needed to battle al Qaeda , track down Osama bin Laden , and stop that country from backsliding toward instability . "
Or this , from 2006 :
" Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over - the - horizon force .
This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war , consolidate gains in Northern Iraq , reassure allies in the Gulf , allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist , and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region .
Perhaps most importantly , some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan , where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there .
The President 's decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive , a spike in terrorist attacks , and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control .
Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government , we are backsliding towards chaos .
By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan , we will answer NATO 's call for more troops and provide a much - needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism . "
Just so it 's clear who took what position before yesterday .
For the first time , DNA from an extinct animal has been resurrected inside a living creature .
The donors in this were four 100 - year - old Tasmanian tiger specimens preserved in ethanol at the Museum Victoria .
The large , doglike marsupial last made history in 1936 , when the only remaining tiger died in captivity .
Receiving the DNA were mice in the laboratory of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center geneticist Richard Behringer , who partnered with researchers from the University of Melbourne .
The study describing their paleogenetic wizardry appeared yesterday in Public Library of Science ONE .
Behringer 's mice do n't look unusual .
The inserted DNA does n't actually code for Tasmanian tiger characteristics , but is needed to switch on genes controlling bone formation .
But hybrid Tasmanian tiger - mice could someday be created , said the researchers , and DNA from creatures like woolly mammoths and neanderthals revived .
Why would scientists want to do this ?
Of all the DNA that 's ever existed , only one percent is presently in circulation .
The rest is lost to history , along with the insights it might provide .
By bringing back lost genes , scientists can see what they do .
Could scientists actually bring back entire animals ?
It 's highly unlikely .
The Tasmanian tiger DNA was painstakingly cobbled together with fragments taken from each of the specimens ; creating an entire organism would require patching together tens of thousands of genes , then packaging them in the correct order .
Modern - extinct hybrids are all we 're going to get , though study co-author Andrew Pask told the
Herald
Sun that putting pterodactyl wings on a mouse might be possible .
A question , Wired Science readers : of animals driven to extinction by man , which would you like to see studied in this fashion ?
I nominate the aurochs , the giant ancestor of modern European cattle .
People have tried to breed them back into existence , but the originals were far larger .

NET .
In order to facilitate that , Microsoft has recently released several resources for both new and experienced SharePoint developers .
In order to make SharePoint projects easier to start , Microsoft has created Visual Studio Extensions for SharePoint .
The VS 2005 edition was released in February and the 2008 edition just a few days ago .
The User Guide , Samples , and Walkthroughs for the VS 2005 edition ( version 1.1 ) are currently available .
The documentation for the VS 2008 edition ( version 1.2 ) is expected later this month .
Microsoft has also launched a new SharePoint site dedicated to bringing developers up to speed with the relevant technologies .
The site is still under construction with a lot of interesting topics listed as stubs without much content .
When complete it appears that each topic will include a virtual lab , webcast , screencast , quickstart guide , whitepaper , and downloadable hands - on lab .
The Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama showcased his diverse musical taste , ranging from Bob Dylan to Jay - Z and Bruce Springsteen , after revealing the playlist on his iPod .
In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine , to be published this Friday , the Illinois senator said he had " pretty eclectic tastes " .
The list of bands reads like the acts at a summer music festival , with the Rolling Stones , Sheryl Crow and Ludacris all in the mix .
Obama said that , growing up , he listened to Elton John and Earth , Wind & Fire but that Stevie Wonder was his ultimate musical hero during the 70s .
The Stones ' track Gimme Shelter topped his favourite songs from the band .
His selection also contained 30 songs from Dylan .
" One of my favourites [ for ] the political season is [ Dylan's ] Maggie 's Farm .
It speaks to me as I listen to some of the political rhetoric . "
In the song , Dylan sings about trying to be himself , " but everybody wants you to be just like them " .
The jazz legends Miles Davis , John Coltrane and Charlie Parker were also included in the compilation .
Many of the musicians on Obama 's iPod , such as Bruce Springsteen , are supporting his White House bid .
Earlier this month , Dylan said he believed Obama was redefining politics in the US and could bring change to a nation in upheaval .
" I 've got to say , having both Dylan and Bruce Springsteen say kind words about you is pretty remarkable , " Obama said .
" Those guys are icons . "
Obama said he had not met Springsteen but that the two had talked over the phone .
" Not only do I love Bruce 's music , I just love him as a person , " Obama said .
" He is a guy who has never lost track of his roots , who knows who he is , who has never put on a front . "
He added that , when speaking to the singer , he addressed him by his moniker the Boss .
" You 've got to , " Obama said .
The candidate said he thought rap music was also helping to break down barriers within the music world .
Indeed it was reported last month that Obama will make a cameo performance on the rap singer Q - Tip 's next album .
However , he expressed concern over his daughters – Malia , nine , and Sasha , seven – listening to some rap songs .
" I am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics , " he said , " but I think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music . "
He said the hip - hop mogul Russell Simmons and the rappers Jay - Z and Ludacris were " great talents and great businessmen " .
" It would be nice if I could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves , " he added .
Obama appears on the cover of the Rolling Stone issue .
The magazine endorsed him for president in March .
Every April , New York 's proud Scottish - Americans celebrate their heritage with the Tartan Day Parade , processing up Sixth Avenue in a sea of kilts , to the noble blare of the bagpipes .
If you are thinking of attending the festivities next year , however , you might want to keep quiet about having read " The Invention of Scotland " ( Yale University Press , 304 pages , $ 30 ) , a punchy new book by the late historian Hugh Trevor - Roper .
For as Trevor - Roper points out with ill - concealed glee , tartan and kilt , those universal badges of Scottishness , are about as authentic as Disneyland .
Until the 18th century , no one north of the Tweed had ever seen a kilt ; nor did the clans , as legend has it , distinguish themselves by the pattern of their tartans , until they were taught to do so by an enterprising clothing manufacturer .
The Scottish costume is , Trevor - Roper shows , simply the latest example of an ancient national habit : the forging of tradition .
Click Images for Slideshow YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS Ossian , in reverie , in an 1813 painting by Jean - Auguste - Dominique Ingres .
The word forging , however , can be taken in two senses .
There is the fraudulence of the forger of documents , but there is also the honest labor of the forger of steel ; and while Trevor - Roper focuses on the first of these meanings , he does not exclude the second .
He recognizes that the invention of Scottish history was a creative act , which helped Scotland to emerge as a cohesive and peaceful modern nation .
" The creation , and re-creation , of myth requires a continuous capacity for invention , " he writes , " and its formalization can be seen as a ritual adjustment , a formal accommodation of barbarism to civility . "
Because Trevor - Roper was a leading historian of Nazi Germany , he is especially appreciative of the benign forms that Scottish mythmaking took : " In Germany , the ancient barbarisms of the race were revived in all their savagery .
... Ritualization would have been better . "
" The Invention of Scotland " was left unfinished when Trevor - Roper died in 2003 , but it does not read like a collection of fragments .
In fact , these eight chapters , based on essays and lectures that the historian wrote in the 1970s , fall neatly into three related sections , each dealing with an important episode in the " forging " of Scottish history .
The first , titled " The Political Myth , " explores the way Scottish scholars of the 16th century  above all , the great Renaissance man George Buchanan  advanced a grossly erroneous version of Scotland 's history , the better to serve their contemporary political purposes .
The second , " The Literary Myth , " is a feat of documentary detective work , in which Trevor - Roper untangles one of the most famous frauds in literary history : the invention of the ancient bard Ossian by James Macpherson .
Finally , and most playfully , Trevor - Roper turns to " The Sartorial Myth , " offering the surprising truth about how and why the kilt and tartan became Scottish institutions .
The Scots ' continual resort to mythmaking , from medieval times down to the 19th century , seems to Trevor - Roper to demonstrate an essential truth about the Celtic mind , as opposed to the Anglo - Saxon .
Drawing on an old but resilient stereotype , he contrasts English prosiness with Celtic imagination .
Yes , he admits , the English " have created one of the great literatures of the world .
Yet , have they a single myth that they can call their own ? "
Surely it is no accident that all the great mythic heroes of the British Isles , from Cymbeline to King Arthur , were invented by the Celtic peoples  the Welsh , Scots , and Irish  who inhabited the land before the Anglo - Saxon invasion .
Much of what has passed for the truth about Scottish history , Trevor - Roper suggests , is actually the product of this same mythopoetic impulse .
Consider the case of Hector Boece , a 15th - century scholar and humanist from Dundee who wrote a hugely influential " History of the Scots . "
Boece was not content with the truth about the Scots  that they were an Irish people who migrated to western Scotland in the fifth century C.E. ( " Scotus , " in Latin , originally meant " Irish . " )
Jealous of the alleged antiquity of the English , who traced their descent to Aeneas and the Trojan Wars , Boece elaborated a rival myth , according to which the Scots were descended from an ancient Greek hero , Gaythelos , and his wife Scota , an Egyptian princess who was the daughter of the biblical pharaoh .
Because Boece alleged that their descendants  who took the names Gael and Scot in their memory  arrived in Scotland in the fourth century B.C.E. , he was faced with a 900 - year gap in the historical record .
He filled it by inventing 40 kings , whom he not only named but provided with what Trevor - Roper calls " elaborate and detailed biographies . "
Among them were many wicked monarchs , " a set of human monsters , vicious , violent , and frightening "  such as Lugtacus , who " repeatedly raped his aunts , his daughters , his sisters and their daughters . "
As befit a moralistic historian , Boece showed these evil kings receiving due punishment , as their suffering subjects deposed and executed them .
Little did he suspect that , in inventing these fables , he was handing powerful ammunition to the real - life rebels who arose during the troubled reign of Mary Queen of Scots .
Among these was George Buchanan , whose career and personality Trevor - Roper discusses in detail .
Toward the end of his life , Buchanan  " by universal consent the greatest Latin writer , whether in prose or verse , in sixteenth - century Europe "  emerged as one of the chief apologists for the noble conspirators who deposed Mary in 1567 .
In order to convince the world , and especially Queen Elizabeth of England , that the nobles had acted legally , Buchanan wrote a pamphlet arguing that the Scottish constitution had always allowed for the removal of kings .
As proof , he cited Boece 's made - up tyrants , whose fictional punishments were now used as precedent for the deposition of Mary .
In this way , the myths about Scottish history invented by Hector Boece turned into a genuine historical force , making them immune to debunking .
Trevor - Roper shows that when another historian , the Welshman Humphrey Lluyd , published a work proving that Boece 's 40 kings had never existed  thus destroying the historical basis for Buchanan 's political theory 
Buchanan responded by launching a " pathological " personal attack on Lluyd .
Buchanan must have known that his theory about the Scottish constitution was disproved , yet he refused to acknowledge Lluyd 's evidence .
Trevor - Roper issues what is , for a historian , the most damning of verdicts : " Buchanan knew that Boece was historically worthless and could not be safely followed or openly cited ; but since he depended on him for his essential thesis , he secretly used his work ...
The old fabrications were presented to the learned world in a more acceptable form . "
Protected by Buchanan 's authority , the " forty kings " became an unchallengeable article of faith among the Scots for another two centuries , even as the English were discarding their old myths and embracing a scientific approach to history .
The next episode in Trevor - Roper 's study , the invention of Ossian , did not have such important historical consequences .
But it was deeply telling about the enduring Scottish need to believe in the antiquity and cultural superiority of their race .
As Trevor - Roper writes , " when a society renounces politics , it can find other ways of expressing its identity , " and after the 1707 Union of Scotland and England , Scottish nationalism took on cultural and literary expression .
In 1761 , when an obscure schoolmaster named James Macpherson announced that he had discovered and translated an ancient Gaelic epic called " Fingal , " by a warrior - bard named Ossian , the literati of Edinburgh reacted with explosive enthusiasm .
Ossian was hailed as a Scottish Homer , proof that the ancient civilization of the Scots was equal in genius to that of the Greeks .
Even better , as Trevor - Roper notes , " Fingal " conspicuously lacked all the features that the 18th century was beginning to find uncouth in the Iliad : " Here were no human sacrifices , no petty thieving , no princesses washing knickers in the river .
Indeed there was nothing common , or even concrete , at all .
All was high - minded humanity , sensibility , chivalry . "
So perfectly did Ossian reflect the taste of the age that his epic  which today , as Trevor - Roper says , seems " totally unreadable "  numbered Goethe , Napoleon , and Thomas Jefferson among its devotees .
Yet right from the start , there were critics  mainly English  who smelled a rat .
How did Macpherson , who barely knew Gaelic , manage to find and translate a 1,500 - year - old poem ?
Why did so many phrases from " Fingal " seem to echo the Bible , Shakespeare , and Milton ?
Above all , why could Macpherson not produce the original manuscript of the poem , despite numerous requests ?
Samuel Johnson concluded that the works of Ossian
never existed in any other form than that which we have seen .
The editor , or author , never could show the original ; nor can it be shown by any others .
To revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted , and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt .
Yet even once English opinion unanimously rejected Ossian as a fraud , the Scots continued to have faith .
It was easier to believe Macpherson 's fantastically complex lies , which Trevor - Roper has great fun exposing , than to accept that the Scottish Homer was an impostor .
After all this , it is hardly a surprise to learn that the kilt and tartan , too , are not quite the Scottish traditions that they seem .
Sad to say , the kilt was invented by an Englishman , Thomas Rawlinson , who came to Scotland in the 1720s to manage an ironworks in the Highlands .
Rawlinson observed that while the actual native costume of the Highlanders  the long belted cloak called the plaid  might have been suitable for rambling over hills and bogs , it was " a cumbrous , inconvenient habit " for men working at a furnace .
So he hired the tailor of the local army regiment to make something more " handy and convenient for his workmen " by " separating the skirt from the plaid and converting into a distinct garment "  the kilt .
This symbol of Highland tradition , as Trevor - Roper notes , was " bestowed ... on the Highlanders , not in order to preserve their traditional way of life , but to ease its transformation : to bring them off the heath and into the factory . "
As with so many of the tales Trevor - Roper has to tell , the truth may not be as romantic as the legend , but its irony makes it no less compelling .

Word is leaking , painfully , out of the Ron Paul commune today that the Good Doctor is ending his candidacy for the presidency , three days after he was mathematically eliminated from the Republican nomination .
There ’s nothing quite like choosing your own moment to exit , regardless of circumstance , and Dr. Paul holds true to form until the very end : nothing , not even reality , is going to stop the Ron Revolution .
" We are acknowledging that Ron will not be the nominee and that we are winding down the campaign , " said Jesse Benton , the Paul campaign 's communication manager .
Benton is right in suggesting that the campaign might require a “ winding down ” process — there are a lot of haphazardly strewn Paul signs and banners in misbegotten parks , interstate medians and overpasses that will need to be collected and recycled to fuel Paul ’s impending congressional run .
It ’s “ winding down ” because you ca n’t just shut down crazy .
Craziness and obsession need to be slowly talked back from the precipice .
You ca n’t just go cold - turkey off this campaign kool - aid .
Paul leaves a legacy of zippy debate one - liners and a masterful domination of the internet — his record online fundraising and massive YouTube campaigns galvanized his small , but utterly devoted following to develop viral messages and attack ads that cost nothing and reached wide .
He holds the record for most eye - rolls and groans from other candidates who scoffed at his policies of abolishing the Federal Reserve , overturning the Patriot Act and withdrawing from Iraq that shamed those Grand Ol ’ Party frontrunners .
“ Elections are short - term efforts , ’’ Paul said in his YouTube farewell video .
“ Revolutions are long - term projects . ’’
Paul said he ’s continuing the fight through his congressional campaign , and promised to visit any state where liberty still exists .
He might start here in Colorado , where Paulites have clearly taken up the call .
This from Paul ’s website :
The Revolution in Colorado
The latest word from a Ron Paul supporter in Colorado :
My fellow Ron-Paul - supporting precinct caucus winners from Denver County and I went to the County Convention on Saturday morning and all voted for one another and , as a result , most of us were elected to the state convention and some of us may have been elected to the District conventions ( those results have not yet been tabulated ) .
Delegates to the RNC are selected at those two upcoming conventions
In addition , a series of eight resolutions excerpted directly out of Ron Paul 's platform were passed overwhelmingly by the committee of the whole and , of the resolutions that were not Ron Paul resolutions , the Ron Paul supporters controlled the vote and voted them up and down as philosophically appropriate .
More news from Colorado
Thanks to reader Colette for sharing this e-mail with the Daily Dose : I just attended my county Republican convention this weekend and I have to say , I was very pleased by what I saw there .
First off , the lawn outside the convention center was carpeted by campaign signs from all of the candidates .
I am pleased to say that Ron Paul signs dominated the landscape !
I would say that for every sign a candidate had up , we had at least three .
Kudos to Carl Brunning for equipping the supporters in this region to get the word out !
As I went into the convention ( I am a county and congressional delegate ) to be seated , I saw a lot of local politicians had booths .
What I did not see was McCain very well represented .
Ron Paul 's booth was big and informative ( there was always a group standing there ) .
Huckabee also had a booth , but it was not as well attended .
The first person who got up to speak was Marilyn Musgrave , Congresswoman from the 4th Congressional District in Colorado .
She really tried to sell everyone there on the idea of John McCain as the nominee .
Funny thing is , it did not look like her heart was in it .
She was merely towing the party line .
People in the audience were actually standing up and denouncing her words ( not too rudely , but vocal none the less ) .
Other than Musgrave , there was only one person who got up and spoke for McCain and I think he was the last minute / only choice of speaker for McCain .
This man got up and actually used words and phrases like " Constitution , " and " return to conservative values , " when referring to McCain .
He said he was upset that he was the only one who wanted to get up and speak for McCain .
Poor , deluded man …
What really lifted my hopes was when Carl Bruining got up and spoke for Dr. Paul .
Every time he spoke of Dr. Paul 's platform , the room erupted in applause .
Here is why my hopes are up …
As I sat there , I realized that most of the delegates in that room were Ron Paul supporters .
We had pulled off what nobody yet realizes …we had the majority of delegates !
I cannot wait for State and Congressional …and the National convention !
If this is an indicator , we are in the calm before the storm .
When the convention in Minneapolis happens , the world will be stunned .
Why ?
Because we have quietly infiltrated the party and we are taking it over .
Hang in there folks … the battle seems to have been lost , but the war is far from over .
While they think we are in defeat , we are marshaling our forces for the great battle to be fought in Minnesota .
The fight that will take back our party and ultimately , our nation .
You ’ve got to hand it to Ron Paul .
What a strategy .
Playing like he ’s out of the race , like he ’s moving on ... all the while he ’s marshaling his forces for the great battle in Minnesota ... lying in wait ... quietly infiltrating the party via YouTube , creepy college campus recruiters and frequent , strongly - worded message board postings .... covering the convention center lawn with Paul posters ... controlling the vote on critical local resolutions with supporters voting for each other to ensure complete domination of the possible chance to maybe move on in theory to the district and national conventions .
So as we customarily bid adieu to most candidates when they barely register in national polls and delegate counts and their spokespeople say that they are withdrawing from the race , I ’m obviously holding off on Paul .
In fact , I ’d like to wish him well on the next phase of the campaign .
Project Infiltration has begun .
I do n’t think it ’s coincidence that the National Convention is in St. Paul .
Sainthood and the Presidency are next on the Hope for America express .
Enjoy the costly campaign , Senators Obama , Clinton and McCain .
Enjoy “ speaking to the press . ”
Have fun at those “ well - attended campaign rallies . ”
Good luck chartering planes to “ meet with people in different parts of the country . ”
Tell us how those “ national polls ” and “ issue debates ” treat you while the silent Paul army sweeps you into the glorious new future .
We ’re all a part of the Revolution .
We just do n’t know it yet .

Some of Apple 's top executives , including Steve Jobs , have once again been accused of bad faith in backdating company shares .
Simultaneously , Mac web share is nearing eight percent in one report , K - 12 educational material has reached iTunes U , and Microsoft has shipped the second edition of Remote Desktop Connection for Mac .
Apple faces backdating scandal once again
Some of Apple 's key senior officials are once again being taken to task for alleged stock manipulation .
Although Apple has successfully had its most high - profile case dismissed last year after a combination of internally - run and US Securities and Exchange Commission investigations , Apple shareholders Kenneth Mahoney and Martin Vogel late last week filed a new lawsuit that charges co-founder Steve Jobs , executives , and board members with damaging the company 's share value through backdating , triggering a 14 percent drop in the company 's stock value during 2006 that wiped out about $ 7 billion of Apple 's worth on the market in just two weeks .
By knowingly dating stock options for executives to dates that were n't revealed to shareholders and falsifying records , the Apple officials were aware of fraud and what the manipulation could do to other shareholders , according to the claim .
While Apple ultimately adjusted its income to address the questionable actions , the move is said in the lawsuit to have given Jobs " instant paper profit " of more than $ 83.8 million in 2000 , and $ 20.3 million in 2001 , that was n't properly accounted for .
In addition to Apple 's CEO , the suit also brings further action against former chief finance officer Fred Anderson and general counsel Nancy Heinen , both of whom were directly blamed for the irregularities that prompted the earlier US government action .
The long - serving board members accused in the suit include Intuit chief William Campbell , J. Crew head Millard Drexler , Genentech 's Arthur Levinson , and Harwinton Capital 's Jerry York .
Mac web share seen nearing 8 percent
Continuning its upward climb , Mac share on the web is now at 7.94 percent , according to June 2008 results from Net Applications .
The group 's over 40,000 tracked websites showed Mac OS X gaining a full tenth of a percentage point from month to month while Windows declined two tenths to 90.89 percent of all visitors .
A significant gain by Linux from 0.68 to an even 0.8 percent of all web views is also credited with the shift .
i Phone web share remains flat at 0.16 but is still at an all - time high , and is the most successful mobile or console operating system in the rankings .
K - 12 school material reaches iTunes U
Previously reserved just for college and university material , iTunes U is now opening its doors to content suitable for students between kindergarten and grade 12 as well as their parents and teachers .
Like the post - secondary material , the iTunes material for K - 12 includes audio and video podcasts as well as text that gives students additional course material and adults more information about school programs .
The initial launch lineup includents content from school departments in Arizona , Florida , Maine , Michigan , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Utah .
Microsoft ships Remote Desktop Connection Client 2
Microsoft on Wednesday released Remote Desktop Connection Client 2 , its long - awaited update to its utility for connecting to and controlling Windows PCs .
The new version is more Mac - like and includes several crucial additions , including the ability to reach multiple Windows systems at the same time , to create custom shortcuts for common actions , and to print content from the Windows system through the Mac 's existing printer management interface .
WE need a plan that is big enough , bold enough and fair enough to deal with the nation ’s foreclosure crisis .
For starters , federal aid should be directed toward those communities with the heaviest concentrations of foreclosures and homeowners at risk .
Aid should help cover public safety costs imposed by vacant homes .
It should help defray budgetary shortfalls for public schools that lose property tax revenue .
Second , a federal loan modification program for struggling homeowners should prohibit the replacement loan ’s principal balance from exceeding the property ’s appraised value .
It should convert the terms to a long - term , fixed - rate and fully amortizing loan .
It should limit monthly mortgage payments , including taxes and insurance , to an amount based on the homeowner ’s ability to repay .
Third , for those homeowners who do not have the income to qualify for new financing , a federally financed land bank should buy the property from the lender at a steep discount and rent it to the former homeowner .
At a Glance : Remember that part at the end of " Boogie Nights " when Marky Mark stood staring at his giant fake dong in the mirror ?
What if he had two of those fake dongs ?
And what if they were fused to his hands ?
And what if they ejaculated giant fountains of liquid ?
Well , then " Boogie Nights " would have been " Edward Penishands " and in my estimation a much finer movie for it .
I admire the work of Paul Thomas Anderson , but he just can't hold a candle to a Johnny Depp look - alike with dick hands stalking around a house with oversized Trident gum labels on the wall and spraying corn syrup all over mega - haired early nineties porn starlets .
" Bionic marital aids !
Now why did n't I think of that ? "
The porn industry has a notorious penchant for parodying Hollywood blockbusters .
This practice gives porn directors a ready - made plot that they usually ignore entirely and provides them with a marketable title that might attract that little extra bit of attention sitting next to " Filthy Chode Gulping Grannies Volume 75 " on the shelf of the video store .
One of the most legendary parodies of the early 90s is " Edward Penishands , " a conceptually amusing takeoff of the Tim Burton hit " Edward Scissorhands . "
Unlike most porn parodies Edward Penishands actually puts some degree of effort into following the plot of the original movie .
The movie begins with a well - dressed businesswoman named Patricia walking around the poorly - lit interior of a warehouse that is supposed to be a castle .
She is there trying to unload some marital aids on the bats and empty suits of armor that generally inhabit grainy matte photos of a castle .
Instead she finds a half - mute bewigged Edward in the attic gingerly cradling his penis hands , forgotten by a world that has no use for a man with arms that terminate in a giant drape - ruining finger .
Patricia is not as closed minded as the rest of the world and she eagerly embraces Edward .
A bit too eagerly in my estimation .
If someone 's only usable digit was a perpetually erect penis would you immediately plunge it into your mouth ?
Patricia does and she has no idea where those things have been !
He can't even turn on a faucet with them , but there she goes suctioning off the collection of dirt , food , and dry leaves that have probably encrusted Edward 's cockhands .
Patricia spends a long time putting all of Edward 's most private appendages through the paces before finishing up with a three gun salute that could wash out a levy somewhere .
Following their handshake deal Patricia invites the lonely Edward to accompany her back to her house .
The prospect of escaping the warehouse / castle is appealing and Edward agrees by screwing up his face and saying " yes " in a robotic monotone .
At least they got the Johnny Depp acting technique down exactly !
I kid , I kid .
I love Depp .
He was great as that pirate woman in " Pirates of the Caribbean . "
Susanne and chum unleash hell .
Patricia takes Edward back to her house , which has a mysteriously high ceiling and an even more mysterious comically oversized Trident gum wrapper on the living room wall .
Edward pays no heed to the interesting décor and homes in on a portrait photo of Patricia 's mega - maned daughter Susanne .
Meanwhile , Susanne and her friend have discovered Patricia 's trunk full of marital aids in a room that looks like the inside of a Pepto Bismol bottle .
Like any 30 - year - old women pretending to be teenagers they immediately begin stuffing themselves and each other full of dildos .
Actually before they get to the dildo fencing they attack themselves , which leads to a dream - like ten minute long loop of them licking their lips and moaning .
Keep in mind this movie was made back in 1990 when each video camera used cassettes made out of diamonds and platinum .
Having multiple coverage with cameras was n't made economically feasible until 1998 .
With Susanne and friend wrapping things up in the mauve bedroom Edward stares thoughtfully into the bathroom mirror .
He ponders what I assume is the woman who created him and then got old and then died leaving him all alone in the castle / warehouse .
Edward remains lost in thought as Susanne rushes around trying to replace all the dildos in the suitcase so Patricia does n't catch her .
She spots a dildo lying on the counter in the bathroom and grabs it to put it back in the suitcase only to realize it's one of Edward 's horrifying dickhands !
Edward and Susanne both react with delightfully exaggerated horror .
Patricia then introduces her daughter and her husband to their new house guest .
This segues into the best scene in the movie .
The whole family is gathered around the dinner table enjoying a hot meal of spaghetti .
Edward , having no fine - motor control of his penishands , is having more than a little difficulty scooping noodles into his mouth .
This amuses Susanne 's father and grosses out Susanne until she leaves the table in disgust .
Patricia scolds them both for being mean to poor Edward .
Chef Boyardee is gyrating his hips in his grave .
Guests arrive to buy dildos from Patricia but when they spot Edward they decided to borrow him instead .
Much to Patricia 's chagrin the two ladies drag Edward off to some sort of tiled bathroom right outside the front door and put him to use as a genital scratching pole .
Proving that penishanded automatons are colorblind Edward robotically plunges his digital throbbers into the black and white woman simultaneously .
Several minutes of thrashing and grunting later and he bastes them both with the fruit of his forearms .
While Edward is away Patricia has sex with her husband on the kitchen table but honestly who cares ?
We 're not here to see some monotonous by - the - numbers sex .
By God , we came for dickhands !
Later that night Edward is back at home sitting on his bed .
In one of the most bizarrely homoerotic scenes in film history Edward uses his penishands to masturbate his real penis while looking at the portrait of Susanne .
Just as his hands are fountaining into the air Susanne enters the bedroom and is obviously disgusted .
Edward flees in the sort of terror that only a man caught ejaculating from his hands by the woman he loves can truly know .
Susanne realizes that he was ejaculating over HER and tastes some of his leavings and suddenly everything is great and she loves him .
I would like Susanne to write Judge Atwater a letter about that experience because I think it might help me beat this indecent exposure charge .
If only my next door neighbor had the common courtesy to lick my semen off her window she might have realized the profundity of my love and reciprocated .
Edward reflects on his past .
The symbolism is subtle .
Anyway , Susanne follows Edward to his castle / warehouse .
She asks him to hold her and he warns " I cant , I 'll squirt . "
Susanne cares not , for her love transcends the bounds of squirting .
She embraces Edward and in slow motion she begins spinning beneath the ceaseless eruptions from his dickhands .
Romantic music plays and it is all very touching .
Then , somewhere else in the castle where clothing is optional , she tends to Edward 's non-hand penis .
Love really does conquer all .
The Horror : I would like to be able to say that the scene where Edward uses his penishands to masturbate wins out , but it does n't .
The horror award in this movie easily goes to the spaghetti dinner scene .
Nothing in the movie is more grotesque than eating food , especially something like spaghetti , with cockhands .
On a somewhat related note , this scene is also the winner in the " best " and " funniest " categories .
The Bottom Line : Edward Penishands is more than just a surreal parody of a Hollywood blockbuster ; it 's also an entertaining time capsule of early 1990 's porn .
The hair , the production values , even the women themselves are at a perfect intermediary point .
They 're caught between the chubby , overly hairy , slightly unattractive eagerness of the 1980's and the slimmed , shaved , surgically sculpted , white washed wooden professionalism of late 90's and contemporary porn .
Can you imagine a modern multi-angle gonzo POV porno that has a set with giant Trident gum wrappers on the wall ?
Me neither .

B - 2 Crash at Andersen Air Force Base Accident Report
6/6/2008 - LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE , Va. ( AFPN ) -- Distorted data introduced by a B - 2 Spirit 's air data system skewed information entering the bomber 's flight control computers ultimately causing the crash of the aircraft on takeoff at Andersen Air Force Base , Guam , Feb. 23 , according to an Air Combat Command accident investigation report released June 5 .
Moisture in the aircraft 's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration distorted the information in the bomber 's air data system , causing the flight control computers to calculate an inaccurate airspeed and a negative angle of attack upon takeoff .
According to the report , this caused an , " uncommanded 30 degree nose - high pitch - up on takeoff , causing the aircraft to stall and its subsequent crash . "
Moisture in the PTUs , inaccurate airspeed , a negative AOA calculation and low altitude / low airspeed are substantially contributing factors in this mishap .
Another substantially contributing factor was the ineffective communication of critical information regarding a suggested technique of turning on pitot heat in order to remove moisture from the PTUs prior to performing an air data calibration .
The pilot received minor injuries , and the co-pilot received a spinal compression fracture during ejection .
He was treated at Tripler Army Medical Center , Hawaii , and released .
The aircraft was assigned to the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base , Mo .
The cost of the lost aircraft is about $ 1.4 billion .
UN humanitarian organisations operating in Darfur belatedly acknowledged this week that conditions are poised to deteriorate rapidly for some 4.3 million conflict - affected persons in the vast western region of Sudan , which for five years has been the site of genocidal counter - insurgency warfare .
A " perfect storm " of threatening developments is brewing , warned UN humanitarian coordinator Mike McDonough on Sunday , and there can be little quarrelling with his grim assessment .
Most ominously , the UN's World Food Programme reduced daily food allowances for beneficiaries in Darfur by almost 50 % at the beginning of May .
Now , the WFP and other UN agencies are warning that " at least 2.7 million people will be affected by a reduction for at least the next two months . "
These next two months , unfortunately , are in the middle of the rainy season , which largely coincides with the traditional " hunger gap " between spring planting and fall harvest .
Malnutrition rates are rising even as heavy rains will soon turn much of Darfur 's terrain into a sea of mud and a network of raging torrents , making food deliveries to many locations impossible by ground transport .
What prompted the WFP to cut rations to Darfur 's long - suffering civilians ?
Unsurprisingly , given the region 's increasingly violent character , the answer is insecurity , an issue that both UN and nongovernmental humanitarian organisations have repeatedly raised in the most urgent of terms .
Food truck convoys , which must make the long trip from Khartoum through Kordofan Province and into Darfur , face the constant threat of hijacking .
Drivers are beaten , robbed and too often killed .
According to the UN , this year alone there have been 160 vehicle hijackings in Darfur , and eight humanitarian workers have been killed .
As a result , WFP drivers increasingly refuse to make the dangerous trip , and only approximately half the required food tonnage is reaching Darfur .
The regime in Khartoum should of course provide military escorts for these critical , though highly vulnerable , convoys .
But the National Islamic Front ( National Congress party ) comprises the very men responsible for orchestrating the Darfur catastrophe .
Although they have mouthed various commitments about protecting food convoys , they have in fact done nothing of significance .
Militarily , the regime is still responding to the ill - conceived attack on Omdurman , Khartoum 's twin city , in early May by the Justice and Equality Movement rebel faction .
A proxy war against Chad , which has supported JEM , seems of considerably greater urgency to Khartoum .
But massively reduced food deliveries , while critical , are only part of a deteriorating humanitarian picture in Darfur .
The fall harvests in both North and South Darfur ( three - quarters of the region 's population ) were disasters , and there is no evidence that this year will be better , given the terrible insecurity in rural areas .
Indeed , the UN notes that 180,000 people were displaced from their homes in the first five months of 2008 .
And yet camps are already over - crowded , and in many the water tables are falling dangerously low .
Both water and sanitation services are overstretched , the UN agencies note , and " diseases such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in the forthcoming rainy season will be more severe if people are weakened by a shortage of food . "
Khartoum bridles at public use of the word " cholera " , but both cholera and dysentery epidemics loom threateningly if people resort to drinking ground water .
Yet another problem is simply ignorance .
Khartoum has compelled the UN organisations to suppress their own malnutrition studies , as well as those of nongovernmental organisations , thus making the most efficient targeting of resources impossible .
Last fall , the last time nutrition studies were widely promulgated , malnutrition among children under five was above emergency thresholds .
The UN now asserts that malnutrition is in line with what was observed last year at this time , but so much of Darfur is inaccessible ( approximately 60 % at any given time ) that it is hard to know how to quantify the " spikes " in malnutrition reported .
And the very fact that Khartoum has suppressed 11 studies , and has worked to limit the ability of humanitarians to gather new data bearing on malnutrition , reveals all too much of the regime 's attitude toward the people of Darfur and humanitarian efforts generally .
Shamefully , the UN organisations have been reduced to pleading , declaring that the monitoring of malnutrition and sanitation " can only succeed if aid agencies are able to undertake and release the results of surveys and assessments in a timely manner and without restrictions . "
Without any tool or leverage to secure compliance , these organisations can merely state that " the government of Sudan must urgently enact its agreement to release the results of technically cleared humanitarian surveys - including nutritional and crop surveys . "
But unless a four - year pattern of humanitarian obstruction is addressed meaningfully by the UN security council , pleading is all that will be left to aid workers .
Conscious of the impending rainy season , the UN organisations speak for the broader " humanitarian community in Sudan , " which is " warning that limited time remains to safeguard against an increasingly precarious situation . "
But time is decidedly not on the side of the humanitarians .
Recent regional weather forecasts predict that heavy seasonal rains will soon reach Nyala ( pdf ) , the capital of South Darfur and a humanitarian hub .
Much of the area affected by the rains , which gradually move northwards , peaking in August and September , will soon be impassable .
The pre-positioning of food that has taken place in the past as a response to transport challenges during the rainy season is woefully inadequate this year .
How to improve humanitarian access ?
How to protect WFP convoys ?
How to provide the minimum security that will allow aid workers to continue ?
How to police the camps for displaced persons , which have become tinder - boxes of rage , despair , and too often ethnic tensions ?
Some argue that because there is no peace to keep , it makes no sense to have sent a UN peace support operation to Darfur .
And to be sure , the UN / African Union " hybrid " mission for Darfur ( Unamid ) , authorised by the UN security council last July , has proved barely distinguishable from its weak and ineffectual African Union predecessor .
The shift to a UN command at the beginning of this year has been followed by deployment of only a few hundred additional personnel for a mission that was to have included more than 6,000 civilian police and more than 19,000 troops , all meeting UN standards for training and equipment .
Altogether , only about 9,000 troops and police have actually deployed , and Darfuris are fast losing any confidence they may have had that this UN force would make a difference .
Let us be very clear , however , about the consequences of refusing to muster the international will and courage to make of the UN - authorised mission a success : humanitarians will leave , food distribution will come to a halt and massive starvation and disease - related deaths will occur in the near term .
Glib declarations that there is " no peace to keep " in Darfur skirt the true questions :
Are we really prepared to see the world 's largest humanitarian effort collapse amid insecurity ?
Are we really prepared to accept the consequences of a precipitous end to international aid operations in Darfur ?
Are we really prepared to countenance the agonising deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians ?
There are no more urgent questions in the world today .
SYDNEY ( AFP ) - Australia on Wednesday unveiled a new code of conduct to regulate online and mobile phone content which will call for classifications similar to those for films , a government spokesman said .
All content likely to be rated as for viewers aged over 15 will need to be assessed and classified under the code , the Australian Communications and Media Authority said .
" This code assists both children and their parents to make informed choices about what is , or is not , suitable for viewing online or on mobile phones , " it said .
The code of practice has been developed by the Internet Industry Association , a body representing most of the leading Internet content providers in Australia .
It only affects online content originating in Australia .
A spokesman for the authority said it would be binding on members of the association .

For those of you following Treyarch 's sequel to Infinity Ward 's excellent Modern Warfare , we have a treat for you in the form of screenshots and details concerning the Pacific Front - flavored FPS .
A more detailed post is coming soon from our very own Nick Chester , but in the meantime we have plenty for you to be getting on with , including pictures of torture , flamethrowers and scary Japanese people .
Yes , Call of Duty : World at War has the three best things ever invented .
Hit the jump for all the hot details .
If you 've been following this game at all , you should know by now that World at War is going to be using the same engine as Modern Warfare , though it has been adapted to allow for environmental changes .
The much - lauded flamethrower , for example , can be used by players to to burn away cover and leave " a charred battlefield -- and foes -- in their wake . "
World at War will also be the first game in the series to include co-op play and goes by the mantra of " No One Fights Alone . "
Up to four players will be able to take it to the Japanese forces online , while two can fight alongside each other in a split - screen mode .
The single - player campaign will include challenges , rankings and online stats for co-op play .
You 'll be taking on the role of U.S. and Russian soldiers as they fight against enemies " that employ lethal new tactics and know no fear , no mercy , nor the rules of war . "
The game 's various battles are said to be fought on multiple fronts and will serve " the grittiest , most chaotic and cinematically intense experience to date . "
I do n't think cinematically is a word , by the way .
As far as the multiplayer goes , Treyarch again intends to build on CoD4 's foundations .
The focus on squad teamwork is going to be increased with party systems that favor those working together .
Both infantry and vehicles will be present in the multiplayer , and the perk system , as we already know , is returning .
Among the more intriguing inclusions are kamikaze fighters , ambush attacks and banzai charges .
The team is setting out to make the Japanese forces intimidating and scary opponents , and promise a harrowing experience for all .
Treyarch is setting some lofty goals and really hopes to prove itself with World at War .
These details promise a lot , and one can but hope they deliver , because Call of Duty : World at War will be something really special if it meets its expectations .

[ In this opinion piece , game commentator Duncan Fyfe takes a look at how and when games end - citing titles from BioShock to Portal and beyond to ask how to set expectations and deliver on them for game endings . ]
In video games , the ones that tell the player a long , linear story , the ending is usually an uncertain proposition .
Prose and film teach an audience to expect three - act structures and considered pacing in storytelling .
Instead , games have what Warren Spector calls the second - act problem ; where act one is the intro movie , act three is the outro movie , and in between is the game .
Games are structured less like a novel and more like an anthology ; an arbitrary number of assembled vignettes , thematically united in post - production .
A collection of missions and quests that exist because one designer had a cool idea for a boat chase sequence and another designer had an awesome idea for a stealth mission .
It 's a problem of pacing , and it relates directly to the presupposed need for games to have fifteen - hour narratives .
I think this issue is compounded by another : players do n't know how long a game is .
You can hold a novel in your hands and feel the weight of the pages .
An album has its track listing printed on the back .
A television season consists of a predetermined number of episodes with those episodes at a fixed length .
A movie is somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes .
No such guidelines with video games .
They lack an intuitive metric : it 'll fall between one and one hundred hours .
If players do n't know when to expect the real ending then they 'll have to guess .
Maybe after this mission in GTA we 'll get to the endgame .
Wait , no , one more thing .
One more thing after that .
With these interminable games that try for an engrossing narrative , players just get tired .
Will it ever actually end ?
Fallout is based on the premise that the player must find this water chip .
It takes a long time , it 's an exhausting journey , you find it and return home victorious .
And then ... one more thing ... and you 're actually only halfway through .
Objectively , there 's nothing wrong with the content .
But expectations frame experience , and the game had just prepared the player to say goodbye , not to enjoy another ten hours .
Having to take a game at its word , players feel betrayed and jerked around .
We react to a piece of content differently if we know it 's the ending .
When we watch the season finale of a TV show , we know that this time the characters are really in danger .
With a video game the player has no idea .
Is this thing going to go on for another hour ?
Or five ?
Or ten ?
Where the hell am I in this story ?
I 'm not sure many developers are aware that this can be a problem ; like how Ken Levine has said he did n't anticipate the ugly comedown from the stratospheric highs of BioShock 's Andrew Ryan scene .
Expectations are everything .
The movie Gone , Baby , Gone has a fake ending at about the 70 - minute mark , but the audience does n't start leaving the theater .
They know how long a movie is and they 're mentally prepared for the remainder of the film .
I do n't think Fallout players would be as bummed out if they found the water chip at the 70 - minute mark .
But no one knows how long Fallout is , like how no one knows if Return of the King 's running time is three hours and two minutes or three hours and four minutes .
The movie continues long past the point where anyone was interested .
One more thing .
One more mission , one more quest , one more rung in a ladder carved from monotony and you have only the vaguest of assurances that the ladder ever stops .
I wonder why people do n't finish games .
Oblivion 's core story is paced terribly , which is to say it 's paced like a video game .
One more thing .
One more lost object to find .
That 's at least consistent with Oblivion 's general M.O. as a treasure - hunting smorgasbord , and Mass Effect does n't handle that dichotomy nearly so well ; instead redefining ' sidequest ' as a repetitive grind existing at the periphery of the story .
BioWare dumps a whole lot of extra content on the player for the purposes of making Mass Effect long enough to count as a conventional video game .
It dilutes the tightly focused , very linear narrative that they 're trying to showcase .
It 's also why games like GTA that measure game completion with a percentage stat do n't really work , since it can take players five times as long to get from 76 % to 77 % as it can from 1 % to 2 % .
Subquests aside , Mass Effect is able to manage player expectations of length .
After act one , you get on the spaceship and you 're given a certain number of planets to visit .
Those are goalposts ; checkpoints by which the player can measure their progress in the second act , and theoretically the third act should be as long as the first .
See ?
Easy .
Knights of the Old Republic did that , Monkey Island 2 did that .
No unpleasant surprises and the player is never unintentionally misled through poor design .
Some games telegraph their length with exceptional results .
Right up front , Portal tells you : 19 rooms .
Indeed there are , and so the player never thinks that room 15 might actually be a plot- critical gameplay escalation instead of a puzzle chamber .
Portal continues after 19 , of course , but here it works .
It capitalizes on the players ' perception that the game is over ; the " epilogue " comes as an intentional surprise more of the same .
When you anticipate player psychology as Valve clearly does , then you can work with it .
You know how everyone in the world is able to pinpoint the exact moment that A.I. should have ended ?
Spielberg kept telling the viewer " one more thing " , and the more times he said it , the worse the movie got .
Unless you 're Portal , unless you know what you 're doing , when players think a game is ending , they should be right .
If a game prompts players to say goodbye , then , one way or another , they will .
LONDON , July 4 ( UPI ) -- A British official who promoted a limited response to youth crime says he has been attacked by those he sought to protect .
Danny Kruger , who worked on Conservative Party head David Cameron 's " hug a hoody " campaign , said he was punched in the face while trying to stop several teenagers from allegedly attempting to steal a scooter , The Times of London reported Friday .

The " hoody " campaign was focused on a softer approach to British youth crime , typified by perpetrators wearing hooded sweatshirts .
Kruger said when he and the scooter 's owner attempted to stop the alleged thieves from taking it , they both were beaten .
" When we caught up with the pedestrians , we received between us a black eye ( owner ) and cut lip ( me ) , and no moped , " he said of the London incident .
The Times said Kruger 's view of youth crime appeared a bit different following the incident .
" My main memory is the spit - filled mouth of the little rat - faced boy who punched me , " the official said .
Distress turns to anger as residents of one town blame cost- cutting and poor workmanship for the collapse of several buildings in the quake
' This is not a natural disaster - this is done by humans '
Tenderly , she eased the clean fleece over her little boy 's hand and up around his plump shoulder .
He did n't look alarmed or frightened , but dirt and blood were caked on his forehead .
She touched his hair and then they pulled up the zipper on the body bag and carried him away .
Only her husband marked her howls .
The whole street was seething with misery and anger .
She had seen her son , at least ; most of the children still lay in the rubble of Xinjian elementary school .
Four hundred and fifty pupils , aged between just six and 12 , were here when the quake hit yesterday at 2.28 pm .
A fortunate few were pulled out within hours by anxious parents scrabbling at the wreckage with bare hands .
A handful more were saved overnight , after troops arrived to take over the rescue effort .
Doctors were unsure how many had been rushed to hospital - perhaps 15 , perhaps 50 .
What was certain was that hundreds more remained trapped and that hope was ebbing by the moment .
" There 's a slight chance they could save a few more now ; probably not very
many , " said a white - coated doctor .
Even the medics were raw - eyed and anxious .
The sobs , wails and shouting
were mixed with sirens and the steady patter of rain .
Under bright umbrellas ,
parents and relatives stood in whatever they grabbed when the shock hit :
dressing gowns , slippers , straw hats .
Some bore the bruises and scars of
the previous day .
One man showed his raw , filthy hands .
He did n't want to give his name but
said his 12 - year - old son Futian still lay in the wreckage .
" Before the troops came we found more than 10 people .
I saved two students and one teacher but I did n't get my own child out , " he said .
" I 'm already 39 and he 's 44 .
We had only one child .
Why should I live on now ? " demanded his wife .
Like many parents here , their mood was turning from raw grief to fury as they waited for further news .
Twenty - four hours after the quake hit , they were losing hope and only rage was left .
They blamed everyone : soldiers for coming too late , the builders for cutting corners , officials for – they claimed - siphoning off cash .
" The contractors can't have been qualified .
It 's a ' tofu ' [ soft and shoddy ] building .
Please , help us release this news , " the husband said .
" About 450 were inside , in nine classes and it collapsed completely from the top to the ground .
It did n't fall over ; it was almost like an explosion . "
The distraught couple 's neighbour , still half - hoping for a sight of her daughter , burst out angrily : " Why is n't there money to build a good school for our kids ?
Chinese officials are too corrupt and bad .
" These buildings outside have been here for 20 years and did n't collapse - the school was only 10 years old .
They took the money from investment , so they took the lives of hundreds of kids .
They have money for prostitutes and second wives but they do n't have money for our children .
This is not a natural disaster - this is done by humans . "
Intravenous drips , cigarette butts and scraps of children 's clothes were trodden underfoot as families surged forward , trying to force their way through the lines of paramilitary police and troops guarding the site .
" They have n't told us anything .
They wo n't even let us see the place now , " spat out one mother , trying not to cry .
A man with a red umbrella paused to watch the scene .
" My neighbours had two kids here , " he said quietly .
" One was on the first floor and ran out when the earthquake happened , but was hit by a falling brick and died .
The other one is still in there . "
Despite criticism from parents whose children were trapped in the rubble , a massive relief effort was under way across Sichuan .
Residents of Dujiangyan know that other places were even worse affected .
Most of the buildings in the town are still standing but no one dared to enter them , and many bore long cracks down their sides .
Tiles and glass lay smashed in the streets and concrete balconies dangled .
The squares and roadsides were packed with residents huddling under tarpaulin , carpets and anything else they could salvage .
Too scared to go back into their homes , they had spent the night in the open .
As the day wore on , a mass exodus began .
People clustered by the roadside to hitch lifts , wait hopefully for buses or simply tramp along the long road to Chengdu in the hope of finding shelter .
Those without umbrellas had covered their heads with plastic bags , towels and books in a vain attempt to stay dry .
Some held bulging cloth bundles or backpacks ; others had fled without anything .
A woman with a cast on her left arm struggled along in improbable heels , while another had only a huge blue teddy bear for luggage .
Around them , the plate glass windows of hotels had shattered ; Adidas shoeboxes spilled out of a collapsing store .
Dummies sprawled across shop windows , expensive sunglasses askew .
Dujianyang was a thriving town until yesterday , and the debris hinted at its previously prospering life .
Now , all anyone wanted was to find safety and find those they loved .
Not far from Xinjian school , at the Long Tan Wan housing compound , a young couple stared dazed at the remains of their apartment block : a pitiless jumble of tin basins , curtains , books , chairs , slabs of concrete and the twisted metal that used to be window frames .
Their one - and - a - half - year - old daughter Xixi was somewhere inside .
Her father drew the back of his hand across his eyes .
" I tried to get to her myself , but it all started falling down and I could n't carry on , " he said .
" I called the police , but they would n't come .
They said they had bigger disasters . "
When bad things happen , it ’s always nice to have a scapegoat .
So , with Americans furious about soaring oil prices , Congress has gone in search of someone to blame .
There are a number of usual suspects to choose from , depending on your politics — OPEC , greedy oil companies , lily - livered environmentalists opposed to oil drilling — but now Congress has seized on another set of villains : commodity speculators .
“ Excessive market speculation , ” in the words of Senator Joseph Lieberman , has supposedly inflated the price of oil and other commodities beyond reason .
Curb speculation , as a raft of proposed laws intend to do , and oil prices will soon return to earth .
Illustration by Seymour Chwast
Speculation has been a favorite target of politicians looking to mollify anxious voters since the time of ancient Greece , when the orator Lysias protested that wheat traders had reduced Athens to a “ state of siege . ”
Even in market - friendly America , there is a long tradition of denouncing speculators as dishonest , unproductive parasites ; the nineteenth - century preacher Henry Ward Beecher decried their “ cool , calculating , essential spirit of concentrated avaricious selfishness . ”
And not unreasonably : the past century is full of examples of avaricious selfishness leading to the manipulation and corruption of markets .
In the twenties , speculators banded together in “ stock pools , ” trading a particular stock among themselves to create the illusion that its value was rising — in March , 1929 , a stock pool succeeded in pushing up RCA ’s stock price by almost fifty per cent in less than two weeks — and then dumping the stock when outside investors bought in .
In the late seventies , a speculators ’ pool led by the Hunt brothers mounted an attempt to corner the world ’s silver market , and at one point controlled an amount equivalent to an entire year ’s global production .
Given this history , and the fact that recent years have seen a huge flood of speculative money entering the commodity markets — assets in commodity indexes , by some calculations , increased twentyfold between 2003 and the spring of this year — it ’s not unreasonable to wonder if there might be something nefarious behind the sharp run-up in oil prices .
But there ’s little convincing evidence that the oil market is being significantly manipulated .
Whatever chicanery is occurring — and we can assume there is some — has only a marginal effect on prices at the pump .
Congress is not , though , just attacking illegal market manipulation ; it ’s also taking aim at perfectly legal speculation , namely the buying and selling of futures contracts , which are effectively bets that oil prices will go up ( or down ) .
Futures contracts can be used by oil sellers ( like OPEC ) or oil buyers ( like the airlines ) to hedge their risks by agreeing to sell or buy oil in the future at a set price .
Speculators , by contrast , mostly use futures contracts to gamble on oil prices , and have no interest in buying or selling real barrels of oil .
These gambles can be tremendously lucrative , but they do n’t directly determine the real ( or “ spot ” ) price of oil .
That ’s set by the people who are buying and selling actual barrels of petroleum .
Although speculators could directly distort oil prices by turning their futures contracts into oil and then taking it off the market to drive up prices , a look at oil inventories shows no sign that this is happening .
If speculators are n’t at fault , why have oil prices spiked so high ?
Fundamental reasons are n’t hard to find .
Between 2000 and 2007 , world demand for petroleum rose by nearly nine million barrels a day , but OPEC has been consistently unable , or unwilling , to significantly increase supply , and production by non-OPEC members has risen by just four million barrels a day .
The prospect of military action against Iran , which would disrupt global supply , seems greater than it did a few years ago .
And the plunging value of the dollar has meant that the cost of oil has jumped more in the U.S. in the past year than it has in countries with healthier currencies .
But there ’s also something else at work , which the oil guru Daniel Yergin calls a “ shortage psychology . ”
The price of oil — more than that of many other commodities — is n’t based solely on current supply and demand .
It ’s also based on people ’s expectations about future supply and demand , because those expectations determine whether it makes sense for oil producers to sell their oil now or leave it in the ground and sell it later .
Currently , the market is assuming that oil will become scarcer , and that global demand will keep rising , especially in rapidly developing countries like China and India .
As a result , producers are asking very high prices to pump their oil .
Now , it could be that these assumptions are all wrong — that the supply of oil will not be constricted going forward , that concerns about the Middle East are exaggerated , and that higher prices will lead people to cut back on energy consumption , shrinking demand .
In that case , oil would turn out to have been hugely overpriced .
But that wo n’t be because of sinister speculators ; it will be because oil producers and oil users collectively misread the future .
The difficulty for Congress , of course , is that none of the problems that have driven up the price of oil lend themselves to a quick fix , and most , like the boom in global demand and the inaccessibility of certain oil fields , are n’t under our control at all .
That ’s what makes speculators a perfect target : by going after them , Congress can demonstrate to voters that it understands their pain , and at the same time avoid doing anything that might require real sacrifice from Americans .
Our dependence on foreign oil , together with the fiscal fecklessness that has helped reduce the value of the dollar , means that there is no easy way out of where we are .
But in an election year that ’s hardly a message that anyone in Washington is going to deliver . ♦
The truth is , it 's basically a crapshoot .
Some Olympic parks become ruins , while others are reborn .
Perhaps the most depressing example of the former is Athens , the birthplace of the Olympics .
Of the 22 venues built for the 2004 games , only the badminton stadium , transformed into a theater , remains open .
The other 21 venues have fallen into disrepair and have to be watched by security guards to prevent vandalism .
Other former Olympic host cities have fared better with the venues and infrastructure they built .
The area around Sydney Olympic Park , the site of the 2000 Summer Games , was intended to undergo an urban renewal project before Sydney won the bid for hosting , and since then many of the original development plans have been carried out on the site .
A mix of commercial and residential construction has been completed and more is planned , including office buildings , a school , hotels and apartment buildings .
The Olympic venues themselves host some 1,800 events annually , including the MTV Australia Awards , Australian Rugby League games and the Big Day Out music festival .
Centennial Olympic Park , the site of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta , has similarly found a variety of uses and spurred development in the surrounding area .
The park is the site of the On the Bricks summer concert series and Atlanta 's Independence Day concert and fireworks display .
Recent development close to the park includes the World of Coca - Cola museum and the Georgia Aquarium .
While that 's all encouraging , does the continuing use of the facilities actually do any good for the host cities ?
According to the researchers at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh , it does .
The university 's Technical Assistance Center released an economic impact statement in 2006 that showed the New York Olympic Regional Development Authority ( ORDA ) in Lake Placid , site of the 1980 Winter Games , generated more than $ 356 million in revenue across New York state in 2004 - 05 .
Some $ 310 million of that came from spending by tourists who visit Lake Placid to ski , snowboard , bobsled , etc. in the Olympic venues .
Not all of Lake Placid 's former Olympic park is open to tourists , though .
In the mid 70's , Camp Adirondack opened on the old site of New York 's first state - operated tuberculosis sanatorium .
The prison camp was home to a program where inmates performed various jobs for the state 's Department of Environmental Conservation , from constructing campsites to maintaining buoys on the lake .
When Lake Placid was chosen to host the 1980 Games , the inmates constructed the Olympic ski trails .
Once the games began , they were relocated to other prisons while the camp facilities housed Olympic staff and two hundred acres of camp land were used for the construction of athlete housing .
After the games were over , Camp Adirondack became Adirondack Correctional Facility , a medium - security prison , and the former athlete dorms became the site of the Federal Correctional Institution , Ray Brook .

We here at Jalopnik know you want to get out on the open road this summer to make some memories , so we 've chosen our favorite fuel - sipping road trip vehicles for those of us who may be hit by a little thing called " the skyrocketing price of gas . "
Yes , unlike the other " road trip lists " we 've seen lately , these are for you , the cost - conscious consumer .
And , since we 're living in an increasingly globalized economy , we decided to go the extra mile and take a look at what the entire world has to offer .
We 're new to this whole " dealing with expensive gas " thing in America , but most everyone else got used to it years ago .
But , we could n't just pick any old hypermilling - for - the - masses vehicles ; they also had to embody some of that adventurous road trip spirit as well — with a little bit of Jalopnik rolled in for good measure .
The rules and the list await you below the jump .

2. ) Have a degree of iconic style , so that when you 're looking back at snapshots of the trip , you have that warm and fuzzy feeling of nostalgia
3. ) Be equipped with at least four doors — how else can you do a Chinese Fire Drill at a stoplight ?
With that in mind , we submit to you , in no particular order , the World 's Best Road Trip Vehicles .

Alfa Romeo 159 Sportwagon JTD

Because most vacations are supposed to be a getaway from hectic everyday life , why not have a car with the same philosophy ?
You do n't need to go to Italy , Italy can come to you !
The Alfa offers the same sort of romance you 'd get from a Maserati , but with more practicality and a fraction of the cost .
With the 1.9 - liter turbo diesel , you 'll get nearly 39 MPG , or you can get a 2.4 - liter version with a bit more power .
But above all , it 's beautiful .
No need to go out of your way sightseeing , because the Alfa will make every stop a photo - op , even without a scenic vista in the background .
Peugeot 308 HDi

With fuel economy the name of the game , you can't ignore the Peugeot 308 HDi .
This was the car of choice for the Guinness Book of World Records hypermiling inductees , who averaged over 75 MPG in their unnecessary quest to use as little fuel as necessary .
Of course , to get those kind of MPGs , you 'll have to travel at a snail 's pace , but remember , it 's all about the journey !
The little French miser is also available in 3 - door hatch or station wagon body styles , and comes with either a 1.6 - liter or 2.0 - liter turbo - diesel engine .

Fiat Panda 100HP

This is the perfect example of a practical , efficient and fun - to - drive European small car .
And by small we mean that it's not even as long or wide as a Chevy Aveo ; however , it is taller , and thus has good head and leg room for both front and rear passengers .
Despite its boxy shape , the Panda is anything but boring .
That 's because the 100 HP model has key features , like a 6 - speed gearbox and grippy tires , in keeping with the tradition of Euro superminis known to be true driver 's cars .
If your budget road trip involves carving through twisty country roads , the Panda will deliver roller - coaster thrills , eliminating the need to buy tickets to the amusement park .
Best of all , that 16 - valve 1.4 - liter engine will easily return over 30 MPG , even with spirited driving .

Volkswagen California

So , you want to save cash by avoiding hotels , but you do n't want to cross the continent in an RV the size of a blue whale ?
May we suggest a modern camper van such as the VW California ?
Coming from the factory with a pop-up roof and a pull - out awning , it even saves you from having to buy a tent .
Do n't want to spend money eating at roadside restaurants ?
No problem : the California even has a kitchen .
Of course , this being a VW van , the kitchen is essential for any , ahem , baking that goes on .
Most importantly , the 2.5 - liter inline - five turbo - diesel engine gets about 27 MPG , which is n't bad for a studio apartment on wheels .

Volkswagen Citi Golf

Remember the good ol ' days of motoring simplicity ?
Yeah , maybe they were n't so good .
But if you do n't mind rekindling memories of cramming into a tiny hatchback with your buddies during the original gas crisis of the early ' 70s , look no further than the VW Citi Golf .
Yes , this is a new car , and no , your eyes do not deceive you :
The Citi is essentially the original Mk.1 Golf / Rabbit , and it has continued to roll off an assembly line in South Africa for decades .
The fuel - injected 1.4 and 1.6 - liter gasoline engines will return around 38 MPG on the highway , and prices start at the equivalent of under $ 10,000 .
Renault Espace

The people carrier of choice in Europe , the Renault Espace gives a view of the road to all seven passengers that a full - size SUV can only dream of .
Sure , you do n't tower over people like you might in an Expedition , but you do n't have the horrible fuel economy either .
What you do get is an interior available with any entertainment option you could want , surrounded by big panoramic windows and a massive available sunroof .
The entire package merely sips fuel , to the tune of a gallon every 31 miles or so if you opt for the 2.0 - liter diesel .
Geely TX4 London Taxi

A staple of England , and a novelty to the rest of the world , the London Taxi now has a version being cranked out by Chinese automaker Geely .
Powered by a 2.4 - liter diesel engine , the cab is sure to be economical .
Plus , if you find yourself running dry on cash along the way , why not just pick up a fare and charge a premium ?
If 28 Days Later was any indication , these things should be great in the event of a Rage virus outbreak , meaning the TX4 is the perfect car if you come across hitchhikers or zombies .
Just not both .

So , no matter where you are in the world , there are great vehicles in which to embark on a road trip — and most of them are better choices than what we 've got here .
These are just a handful , but what do you want to take on your next Fantasyland road trip ?
So , to clarify AP ’s headline “ McCain appears cancer free , healthy ” – they really meant “ this month . ”
Nice .
From AP :
McCain ’s most recent exams show a range of health issues common in aging :
He frequently has precancerous skin lesions removed , and in February had an early stage squamous cell carcinoma , an easily cured skin cancer , removed .
He had benign colon growths called polyps taken out during a routine colonoscopy in March .
McCain is n’t cancer - free if he had cancer 3 months ago .
What a ridiculously sloppy AP headline , and now this will be the story – McCain is cured !
( Except that he had cancer as recently as 3 months ago – hey , maybe Pastor Parsley healed him ? )
Anybody else troubled that candidate McCain was running for the GOP nomination , went for cancer surgery , and did n’t bother telling anyone ?
What else is n’t he bothering to tell us , and wo n’t he tell us in the future ?
If this is McCain ’s standard for disclosure about his medical condition , we ’d need weekly document dumps of his medical files because McCain clearly has a policy of hiding his true medical condition while running for president .
The calculus changes when higher - ranking females are around because they are likely to attack the caller and break up the fun .
To avoid incest , young females leave their home group and try to integrate with neighbors by offering themselves to socially important males .
But the resident females tend to be obstructive , perhaps because they see them as competitors for male protectors and desirable feeding areas .
A similar use of copulation calls could once have existed in the human lineage but if so , it may have lost its evolutionary advantages when human societies developed their distinctive system of pair bonding and made intercourse a largely private activity .
Dorothy Cheney , an animal behavior expert at the University of Pennsylvania , said that copulation calls usually occurred in primate species where the females have visible sexual swellings during their receptive period .
Because swellings do not occur in humans , it is hard to speculate about the relevance of chimp sexual calls to human behavior , Dr. Cheney said .
Though human vocalizations during intercourse have not been much studied , they do have “ a quite elaborate acoustical structure , which suggests some kind of communicative function , ” said Dr. Townsend , who is at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
Copulation calls are not a feature of public life in Western societies , but the situation could be different in hunter - gatherer groups , which enjoy little privacy .
“ I can imagine that these sort of signals may still be very much perceived by other group members and give a female a high degree of control over her willingness to copulate or let others know her sexual state , ” said Dr. Zuberbühler , also of the University of St. Andrews .
The female primate ’s strategy of blurring paternity could be useful in human societies , too , especially when the rate of illegitimacy is high .
“ Whether or not this happens in humans I do n’t know , ” he said .
“ I would n’t be surprised if something similar went on . ”
Female chimpanzees have sexual swellings that remain visible for several days , but they ovulate on just one day .
A female gives her copulation calls throughout the period , concealing her most fertile time from the males .
“ If she was truly interested in meeting with the best males , she should do all her calling during that narrow window when it matters , ” Dr. Zuberbühler said .
“ But she does n’t .
She conceals the time of ovulation by calling throughout her cycle . ”

I used to write for a website and pretty much put stories up as they happened , and it kills me that the place is down now ( and very little of it accessible through archive.org ) , because I know there 's a ton that I 'm forgetting .
- One night , the KKK actually came in .
Seriously .
It was some sort of Klan gang , ten or fifteen huge guys with tattoos of swastikas and lynchings and all sorts of white supremacist symbols .
They were bringing in their matriarch , or whatever she was , an old lady showing symptoms of a stroke .
Apparently someone in this group had seen a TV show about stroke and had it all set in his mind what was supposed to take place in the first 40 minutes to " cure " the patient , and these guys were hellbent on making sure it happened .
Their way of doing this was posting one guy near each place they figured something important was going on .
That was back when I was working registration , and this huge guy was just stationed in front of the desk , arms crossed , staring us down .
Another one was following the triage nurse , another posted himself at the ACC ( unit clerk ) desk , and one literally followed the physician right into other patients ' rooms , I guess to intimidate him into ignoring everyone else in favor of Momma .
We pressed the emergency security buzzer under the desk , but I was a bit disappointed in them ... they just sort of stood around , like the Klansmen , and acted like they could n't do much ( our security guards were off - duty cops and were very conservative about putting themselves on the line ) .
It was a standoff for a long time , then the woman was transferred upstairs and I guess they all went up there to intimidate the unit people .
It was really , really fucking freaky , though .
I still remember the t- shirt of the guy posted by me ... it had a lynching on it , with the victim depicted all cartoony - racist with his tongue hanging out .
It was pretty horrible .
- We had a lot of people who watched medical shows and thought that made them experts .
One lady came tearing in with her kid bobbing limply in her arms ( that happened a lot , usually the kid had a low - grade fever ) and screeched that he needed " 50 units of CC STAT . "
God , it was all we could do to keep a straight face .
- We had two unrelated patients come in after a car accident , and the family all had to wait in the waiting room through most of the workup .
They got really , REALLY comfortable out there .
So comfortable , in fact , that they rearranged all of the waiting - room furniture into a big group and ordered pizzas on the waiting room phone .
They actually sat out there , ate their pizzas , and had a grand old time , and nurses had to keep coming out and asking them if they 'd like to check on their family members now .
They were actually waved off ...." yeah , yeah , in a minute " !
- I loved when Scrubs came up with " The Ass Box " .
It 's so true , although we 'd never have kept a box .
People came in with the damnedest stuff up their asses .
You could always tell , too ... it was usually a middle - aged guy who walked in funny and refused to tell anyone what was wrong with him unless it was a male physician .
Most of the time it was a vibrator and they just waited for the battery to run down , but there were also shot glasses , mini - shampoo bottles , balls of every variety but the anatomical one , vegetables , and so on .
There was even a lightbulb , and I think it was delivered with ky jelly and a pair of forceps .
I vaguely , vaguely remember a guy who had filled his ass with cement and then it set up , but I do n't remember if that was in our hospital or something someone repeated as happening to them elsewhere .
- The absolute BEST story ever did n't take place in our ER at all .
It was told to a stunned Medical Ethics class by our professor , who was giving a lecture on confidentiality .
You ready for it ?
The professor was on the Ethics board of an inner-city hospital and this was a case referred to him .
A hooker kept presenting to te ER with an infected colostomy opening .
They kept treating it and discharging her , and she kept showing up with a raging infection again .
Finally , someone thought to ask her why .
Her response ... " I can charge more for that hole . "
We all just sat there , horrified .
The teacher said , " How many of you think that 's the most disgusting story you ever heard ? "
Everyone raised their hands .
Then he said , " And how many of you will never repeat it ? "
Nobody raised their hands .
Re : the suturing question ... I do n't know , but I think it might be because the nurse had previous bad experiences with people wanting to watch work done on themselves , and she did n't want to take a chance on making the job harder than it already was .
Oh , I have lots and lots of storiesI used to write for a website and pretty much put stories up as they happened , and it kills me that the place is down now ( and very little of it accessible through archive.org ) , because I know there 's a ton that I 'm forgetting .

One of Ninetendo's marketing images for the Fit game depicting a young player
Obesity experts today slammed Nintendo after its Wii Fit game told a 10 - year - old girl she was fat .
They fear the game could damage children 's body image and called on the company to warn parents it is not suitable for their offspring .
The £ 69 game , which sold out within hours when it went on sale in Britain last month , uses an electronic " balance board " to monitor a player 's weight .
Once the player has entered their height , the game uses BMI , a measure of body fat based on an adult 's height and weight , to calculate their level of obesity , placing them in categories such as " underweight " and " fat " .
Players can then be guided through yoga exercises or play games to improve their balance .
However , a father from the South - East spoke today of the embarrassment when his stepdaughter played the game and was labelled fat .
" She is a perfectly healthy , 4ft 9in tall 10 - year - old who swims , dances and weighs only six stone , " said the father , who did not want to be named for fear of embarrassing the girl further .
" She is solidly built but not fat .
She was devastated to be called fat and we had to work hard to convince her she is n't .
Scroll down for more ...
Potentially damaging : the BMI chart that appears on screen during the Ninendo Wii game
" I know it is just a game but we already have to worry about young girls starving themselves to look like magazine models and now we have a game that tells them they 're fat .
This to me is very worrying . "
Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum called for children to be banned from playing the game , claiming the BMI measurement was misleading .
" I 'm absolutely aghast that children are being told they are fat , " he said .
" BMI is far from perfect but with children it simply should not be used .
" A child 's BMI can change every month and it is perfectly possible for a child to be stocky , yet still very fit .
" I would be very concerned if children were using this game and I believe it should carry a warning for parents . "
Nintendo said today it would not be placing a warning on the game .
A spokesman said : " Nintendo would like to apologise to any customers offended by the in - game terminology used to classify a player 's current BMI status , as part of the BMI measurement system integrated into Wii Fit .
Wii
Fit is still capable of measuring the BMI for people aged between two and 20 but the resulting figures may not be entirely accurate for younger age groups due to varying levels of development . "

This article as written assumes a sequentially consistent model .
In particular , the code relies on specific order of instructions in both Consumer and Producer methods .
However , without inserting proper memory barrier instructions , these instructions can be reordered with unpredictable results ( see , for example , the classic Double - Checked Locking problem ) .
Another issue is using the standard std::list <T >.
While the article mentions that it is the developer responsibility to check that the reading / writing std:: list < T >:: iterator is atomic , this turns out to be too restrictive .
While gcc / MSVC ++2003 has 4 - byte iterators , the MSVC + +2005 has 8 - byte iterators in Release Mode and 12 - byte iterators in the Debug Mode .
The solution to prevent this is to use memory barriers / volatile variables .
The downloadable code featured at the top of this article has fixed that issue .
Many thanks to Herb Sutter who signaled the issue and helped me fix the code .
-- P.M.
Queues can be useful in a variety of systems involving data - stream processing .
Typically , you have a data source producing datarequests coming to a web server , market feeds , or digital telephony packets at a variable pace , and you need to process the data as fast as possible so there are no losses .
To do this , you can push data into a queue using one thread and process it using a different thread a good utilization of resources on multicore processors .
One thread inserts data into the queue , and the other reads / deletes elements from the queue .
Your main requirement is that a high - rate data burst does not last longer than the system 's ability to accumulate data while the consumer thread handles it .
The queue you use has to be threadsafe to prevent race conditions when inserting / removing data from multiple threads .
For obvious reasons , it is necessary that the queue mutual exclusion mechanism add as little overhead as possible .
In this article , I present a lock - free queue ( the source code for the lockfreequeue class is available online ; see www.ddj.com/code/) in which one thread can write to the queue and another read from it at the same time without any locking .
To do this , the code implements these requirements :
There is a single writer ( Producer ) and single reader ( Consumer ) .
When you have multiple producers and consumers , you can still use this queue with some external locking .
You cannot have multiple producers writing at the same time ( or multiple consumers consuming the data simultaneously ) , but you can have one producer and one consumer ( 2 x threads ) accessing the queue at the same time ( Responsibility : developer ) .
) and single reader ( ) .
When you have multiple producers and consumers , you can still use this queue with some external locking .
You cannot have multiple producers writing at the same time ( or multiple consumers consuming the data simultaneously ) , but you can have one producer and one consumer ( 2 x threads ) accessing the queue at the same time ( ) .
When inserting / erasing to / from an std:: list < T> , the iterators for the existing elements must remain valid ( Responsibility : library implementor ) .
, the iterators for the existing elements must remain valid ( ) .
Only one thread modifies the queue ; the producer thread both adds / erases elements in the queue ( Responsibility : library implementor ) .
) .
Beside the underlying std::list < T> used as the container , the lock - free queue class also holds two iterators pointing to the not - yet - consumed range of elements ; each is modified by one thread and read by the other ( Responsibility : library implementor ) .
used as the container , the lock - free queue class also holds two iterators pointing to the not - yet - consumed range of elements ; each is modified by one thread and read by the other ( ) .
Reading / writing list < T >:: iterator is atomic on the machine upon which you run the application .
If they are not on your implementation of STL , you should check whether the raw pointer 's operations are atomic .
You could easily replace the iterators to be mentioned shortly with raw pointers in the code ( Responsibility : machine ) .
Because I use Standard C++ , the code is portable under the aforementioned " machine " assumption :
template < typename T> struct LockFreeQueue { LockFreeQueue ( ) ; void Produce ( const T& t ) ; bool Consume ( T& t ) ; private : typedef std::list < T> TList ; TList list ; typename TList : : iterator iHead , iTail ; } ;
Considering how simple this code is , you might wonder how can it be threadsafe .
The magic is due to design , not implementation .
Take a look at the implementation of the Produce ( ) and Consume ( ) methods .
The Produce ( ) method looks like this :
void Produce ( const T& t ) { list.push_back(t ) ; iTail = list.end ( ) ; list.erase( list.begin( ) , iHead ) ; }
To understand how this works , mentally separate the data from LockFreeQueue < T > into two groups :
The list and the iTail iterator , modified by the Produce ( ) method ( Producer thread ) .
iterator , modified by the method ( thread ) .
The iHead iterator , modified by the Consume ( ) method ( Consumer thread ) .
iterator , modified by the method ( thread ) .
Produce ( ) is the only method that changes the list ( adding new elements and erasing the consumed elements ) , and it is essential that only one thread ever calls Produce ( ) it 's the Producer thread !
The iterator ( iTail ) ( only manipulated by the Producer thread ) changes it only after a new element is added to the list .
This way , when the Consumer thread is reading the iTail element , the new added element is ready to be used .
The Consume ( ) method tries to read all the elements between iHead and iTail ( excluding both ends ) .
bool Consume ( T& t ) { typename TList : : iterator iNext = iHead ; ++iNext ; if ( iNext != iTail ) { iHead = i Next ; t = * iHead ; return true ; } return false ; }
This method reads the elements , but does n't remove them from the list .
Nor does it access the list directly , but through the iterators .
They are guaranteed to be valid after std::list < T > is modified , so no matter what the Producer thread does to the list , you are safe to use them .
The std::list < T> maintains an element ( pointed to by iHead ) that is considered already read .
For this algorithm to work even when the queue was just created , I add an empty T( ) element in the constructor of the LockFreeQueue < T> ( see Figure 1 ) :
LockFreeQueue ( ) { list.push_back ( T( ) ) ; iHead = list.begin( ) ; iTail = list.end ( ) ; }
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Consume ( ) may fail to read an element ( and return false ) .
Unlike traditional lock - based queues , this queue works fast when the queue is not empty , but needs an external locking or polling method to wait for data .
Sometimes you want to wait if there is no element available in the queue , and avoid returning false .
A naive approach to waiting is :
T Consume ( ) { T tmp ; while ( ! Consume ( tmp ) ) ; return tmp ; }
This Consume ( ) method will likely heat up one of your CPUs red - hot to 100 - percent use if there are no elements in the queue .
Nevertheless , this should have good performance when the queue is not empty .
However , if you think of it , a queue that 's almost never empty is a sign of systemic trouble :
It means the consumer is unable to keep pace with the producer , and sooner or later , the system is doomed to die of memory exhaustion .
Call this approach NAIVE_POLLING .
A friendlier Consume ( ) function does some pooling and calls some sort of sleep ( ) or yield ( ) function available on your system :
T Consume ( int wait_time = 1/*milliseconds */) { T tmp ; while ( ! Consume ( tmp ) ) { Sleep ( wait_time/*milliseconds */ ) ; } return tmp ; }
The DoSleep ( ) can be implemented using nanosleep ( ) ( POSIX ) or Sleep ( ) ( Windows ) , or even better , using boost : : thread : : sleep ( ) , which abstracts away system - dependent nomenclature .
Call this approach SLEEP .
Instead of simple polling , you can use more advanced techniques to signal the Consumer thread that a new element is available .
I illustrate this in Listing One using a boost : : condition variable .
#include < boost / thread.hpp > # include < boost / thread/ condition.hpp > # include < boost / thread / xtime.hpp > template < typename T > struct WaitFreeQueue { void Produce ( const T& t ) { queue .
Produce(t ) ; cond.notify_one ( ) ; } bool Consume ( T& t ) { return queue .
Consume(t ) ; } T Consume ( int wait_time = 1/*milliseconds */) { T tmp ; if ( Consume ( tmp ) ) return tmp ; // the queue is empty , try again ( possible waiting ... ) boost ::mutex::scoped_lock lock ( mtx ) ; while ( ! Consume ( tmp ) ) // line A { boost : : xtime t ; boost : :xtime_get ( &t , boost :: TIME_UTC ) ; AddMilliseconds(t , wait_time ) ; cond.timed_wait( lock , t ) ; // line B } return tmp ; } private : LockFreeQueue <T> queue ; boost : : condition cond ; boost : : mutex mtx ; } ;
I used the timed_wait ( ) instead of the simpler wait ( ) to solve a possible deadlock when Produce ( ) is called between line A and line B in Listing One .
Then wait ( ) will miss the notify_one ( ) call and have to wait for the next produced element to wake up .
If this element never comes ( no more produced elements or if the Produce ( ) call actually waits for Consume ( ) to return ) , there 's a deadlock .
Call this approach TIME_WAIT .
The lock is still wait - free as long as there are elements in the queue .
In this case , the Consumer ( ) thread does no waiting and reads data as fast as possible ( even with the Producer ( ) that is inserting new elements ) .
Only when the queue is exhausted does locking occur .
Last week we ran a short news item about a syndication deal for a little blog called TechCrunch .
We pointed out how odd it seemed that the Washington Post , one of the nation 's most trusted and revered newspapers , would run stories written by an ex-lawyer who admits he may advise or invest in companies that are covered on his site .
In journalistic circles , that 's what we call a conflict of interest .
Admittedly , we dripped a little snark , though , which prompted a Tourettes - like reaction from TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington and plenty of colorful comments from readers .
All in a day 's work .
We were happy to let the matter go until Arrington said he planned to organize a " Wired burning party " because he had n't gotten a " response " from Wired .
( We 're not sure who he tried to contact , or what sort of " response " he was expecting to " Fuck you , " but whatever . )
So we sent him our thoughts :
" I know that you disclose your investments , which is fine , but the very fact that you invest in companies you may write about goes against the longstanding set of ethical standards that have governed newspapers for decades , " we wrote last week .
And we did n't hear back .
We threw the question out to the Washington Post .
Does Arrington 's practice of investing in companies he may write about break with the newspaper 's ethical policy ?
We contacted the ombudsman , the business editor and a company spokesperson , but we have n't gotten a response .
We 're happy to update this post if and when someone there sees fit to reply .
In the meantime , here is an old copy of the Washington Post 's Code of Standards and Ethics , which clearly states that the company has pledged to " avoid conflict of interest or the appearance of conflict of interest , wherever and whenever possible .
We have adopted stringent policies on these issues , conscious that they may be more restrictive than is customary in the world of private business . "
We asked Peter Sussman , who serves on the Ethics Committee of the Society of Professional Journalists , for his take on the situation .
" The one thing that newspapers still have over new online outlets is the brand , the name and the standards .
They 've told readers that by the mere presence of a story on the Washington Post , that it 's been through a rigorous analysis or edit and it is up to their standards .
The assumption is that unless you hear otherwise , the content you see in the Post has gone through that ethical screening . "
Just to reiterate :
We have nothing against Arrington .
We do n't think journalism is some sacred activity that should be studied and practiced by a select few who are chosen by an even more select few .
We heart blogs .
But , this we do believe :
There are some basic ethical standards that should be followed when you are a journalist .
And that includes avoiding conflicts of interest .
The trust imperative of a news organization – or anybody who considers him or herself a journalist – is pretty straightforward :
Find information , report it accurately , leave yourself ( or your investments ) out of the story .

The AP 's disharmony with bloggers may have only just begun , as the alternative it's now offering to being served with takedown notices involves paying an up - front sum for excerpting online articles -- as few as five words .
A meeting between the Associated Press ' Vice President for Strategic Planning Jim Kennedy and Robert Cox , who heads the Media Bloggers Association , is now planned for Thursday of this week .
The subject at hand is the AP 's attempt to find a new way of sharing AP content , which now involves a fee per excerpt based on its word length .
On the heels of a blogosphere revolt last week because of its harsh actions against social news site The Drudge Retort , the AP regrouped over the weekend to take a less litigative -- but more bureaucratic -- approach to dealing with those who wish to quote its material .

Where the group had previously invoked the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and sent cease - and - desist orders to at least one blogger , seeking the removal of excerpted content ( in some cases as few as 17 words in length ) , now the press service has attached an " Excerpt for Web Use " charge for passages as short as five words in length .
The pricing scale for excerpting AP content begins at $ 12.50 for 5 - 25 words and goes as high as $ 100 for 251 words and up .
Nonprofit organizations and educational institutions enjoy a discounted rate .
This scale is likely only a temporary solution , as it raises a truckload of questions .
For instance : Suppose a news source holds a press conference , and makes a statement to several attendees including an AP correspondent .
Does the citation of that quote count as an excerpt of an AP story ?
What if Reuters cited the same quote ?
Or worse , what if Reuters cited the quote differently , and a blogger noticed the difference and excerpted both for comparison ?
If the AP citation turned out to be in error , would the blogger still owe ?
Also , should " boilerplate " words count towards the fee ?
For example , a phrase common among news stories is " [ Name ] had this to say : " for prefacing a published statement or quote .
If the AP runs a story with this phrase , will it therefore cost anyone else $ 12.50 to use this 10 cent expression ?
US COPYRIGHT ACT , Chapter 1 , § 107 .
Limitations on exclusive rights : Fair use Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A , the fair use of a copyrighted work , including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section , for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research , is not an infringement of copyright .
In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include -- ( 1 ) the purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ; ( 2 ) the nature of the copyrighted work ; ( 3 ) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ; and ( 4 ) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors .
How about one more :
It 's an unspoken fact that subscribers to the AP publish stories that use the AP 's facts and that give the AP credit , though which are rewritten by their own staff on - hand , sometimes for length .
If a blogger cites a rewritten but credited AP piece , whom does he owe , the AP or the newspaper or online service that rewrote the AP ?
The Associated Press ' Web
Use excerpt system is powered by the ubiquitous iCopyright , whose own name ironically smacks of another popular trademark .
BetaNews has been checking the link to the iCopyright service today , and has noted it 's been down periodically .
In its " do 's and don'ts " list , iCopyright warns would - be copyright infringers by saying , " Do n't buy the ' I am using it for the public good ' argument .
That is a weak justification for infringement and sends the wrong message to students and employees . "
The idea of buying a brand - new car can be a real dream for some people .
Having something that no one else has owned that is so new can be so appealing and many people cannot afford to contemplate this and so always have to go for a second - hand car .
A brand - new car will lose value as soon as you drive it away from the dealers as the fact that it is new means that more is charged for it .
So , if you sold it the day after it would be worth at least a few thousand less .
However , this is not enough to put many people off their dream if a new car but the cost is .
The cost of the car
A new car will be a lot more expensive than a second hand one .
However , that cost will vary between models .
There are some new cars that are cheaper than second hand ones ; it all depends on the specific model that you want to buy .
If you just want a new car and are not that fussy which type then this could mean that you could just buy a small one and achieve your dream .
For some people , even a cheap car is out of their budget or they want a specific model which is more expensive .
Even so , it is worth comparing prices of cars and making sure you get good value for money .
Some dealers may give you a better deal than others and you will need to think about whether you want extras on the car and how much you might be prepared to pay for those .
Finding a way to afford it
If you have savings then you could put these towards the cost of the car .
It might even be sensible to try to add to them until you have enough to buy it outright .
This could take a long time , but it will be a much cheaper option than borrowing the money .
If you are really motivated to buy the car , then it should not feel too much of a burden to put some money away each month so that you can save up .
Put it in a savings account and it will earn interest which will add to your pot .
It is best to set up a direct debit so that money is transferred into your savings account regularly , just after you get paid .
Then you will not be so tempted to spend it .
This idea may work for you well , but some people may not have had success at saving and may feel it will not work .
If this is the case then you need to make sure that you are really determined about doing it .
Try to motivate yourself by pinning up pictures of your dream car and concentrating on your goal of owning one .
This could help you to leave the savings untouched and make sure that you budget properly so that you can save what you need to .
An alternative option is to get a loan .
There are different options for borrowing such as a car loan form a dealer and a bank loan .
It is worth comparing both to see how much each will cost you and whether they have terms that will suit you .
Consider the price and whether you are prepared to pay more for one than the other .
Look carefully at the repayment amounts and think about whether you will be able to afford them .
It is so important to check this out because if you do not make the repayments you could end up with your vehicle being repossessed and that would be a very nasty end to your dream .
Also , this would show on your credit record so you would have difficulty in borrowing money to buy another one and that could mean that you have trouble getting to work which may even end in you losing your job .
So , if you take on a loan that is too expensive you could find yourself in all sorts of trouble .
Conclusion
It is not an easy decision to make , but if you have all the figures in front of you it will help .
Make sure you are clear on what your options are and how much each will cost you .
Also know the cost of the car so that you can calculate how much you will have to put by each month , either in a savings account or repaying a loan .
Whether you save or borrow is very much a personal decision , but it needs to be considered really carefully .
It is wise to discuss it with others before deciding on what you will do and they might see things differently and give you other things to think about with regards to whether your preference is the most sensible .
Science Interesting , Physics , Science , SoundChannel , WorldWar2 Shaun McCarthy 4:40 pm
The History :
During World War II [ 1 ] , American pilots were given hollow metal spheres to be used when their planes went down over water .
The spheres , being rather heavy for their small size , did n’t exactly act as great flotation devices .
So why were these pilots given chunks of metal ?
Well , they were told that if they dropped the sphere into the ocean , their current position could be worked out by allies in the region , and they would be rescued .
However , as foreign intelligence was soon to find out , the spheres were just that – hollow metal spheres – no electronics , no radio equipment , no imbued magical properties .
So was the military just playing with it ’s pilots , or was there actually something to these spheres ?
Well , some of the details are still kinda top secret , but with a little physics and an active imagination , it ’s possible to work out how they were used .
Arrgh !
Scary !
I just said the P word .
Do n’t worry , I ’ll try to summarize things without delving to deep into the physics .
Simple Facts : The Ocean
The deeper you go , the colder it gets
The deeper you go , the higher the pressure
Simple Facts : Soundwaves
Sound travels in waves
These waves bend towards where the sound travels _slower_
Sound travels faster in warm temperatures than cold temperatures
Sound travels faster in high pressure than low pressure
Combining the facts :
Normally , the temperature difference of water is quite gradual as you go deeper ; however , there is a zone ( at around 500 m ) where the temperature change is quite rapid .
Therefore , any soundwaves entering this area , will be bent down .
Once you are past this zone , at around 1 km deep , the pressure becomes the dominant effect , and sound will bend upwards .
So , if a sound originates in the sweet spot , between these two areas of bending , it gets trapped , and ends up travelling great distances .
This is called the sound channel :
Note , if a sound originates outside of this channel , it gets deflected somewhat , but does n’t bend back enough to get trapped .
Note also , that the lines here show the path of the wave , not the wave itself .
View each line as a zoomed out version of the wave pictures above .
Keep your eye on the sphere :
So , the spheres that the pilots were dropping into the ocean were of a specific thickness that would be crushed by the ocean pressure at about 1 km deep .
This would cause a “ ping ” that could be detected by underwater microphones thousands of miles away .
By triangulating the sound ( kinda like how GPS works ) the Navy was able to work out where the sphere was dropped and go rescue the pilot !
Implications – LOFAR :
I do n’t believe it – I am about to recommend a Tom Clancy novel , The Hunt for Red October .
Tom goes into details as to how the US Navy took this technology and used it to detect submarines that entered the sound channel .
I ’d totally recommend buying it here for those of you who have enjoyed reading this posting .
Implications – Nature :
It turns out that nature beat us to the punch .
Whales have been using the sound channel for years to communicate with each other over long distance via Whale Song !
Resources :
Notes
[ 1 ] – Ralph Chatman ( a technical editor for Clancy on Hunt for Red October ) suggests that we did n’t know enough about the sound channel during World War II to have used it .
Thanks Ralph for pointing this out .
This goes somewhat counter to what Robert Muller suggests in his UC Berkley Course on Physics for Future Presidents ; however , I am more interested in the physics rather than the history so I ’ll leave it for you two to sort out who ’s right 🙂

The latest Survey USA state poll of Washington finds Barack Obama with a commanding lead over John McCain 56 % - 39 % .
Obama leads McCain among all age groups and races .
He leads McCain 59 % - 36 % among 18 - 34 year olds and 56 % - 40 % with those 50 - 64 years old .
Not surprisingly , McCain runs best with older voters .
Among voters over age 65 , Obama leads McCain 49 % - 46 % .
Obama has an 18 point lead with voters 18 - 49 , and leads McCain by 11 points with voters over 50 .
The Republican leads with voters in the state who say that they regularly attend religious services , 51 % - 45 % .
Obama leads by 8 points with voters who say that the economy is their number one issue .
He blows away McCain on the issues of healthcare ( 66 % - 29 % ) , the environment ( 81% - 19 % ) , Iraq ( 82 % - 14 % ) , and education ( 76 % - 21 % ) .
The candidates ran about even on Social Security ( 50 % - 47 % ) , and McCain ’s best issues were terrorism ( 93 % - 7 % ) , and immigration ( 72% - 21 % ) .
Washington is a state that Al Gore won by five in 2000 , and John Kerry won by seven in 2004 , so it is a place that Obama should do very well in .
The state has not voted for a Republican since 1988 .
The interesting aspect of this poll is that it is evidence of an early trend in this race that voters seem to see these candidates in very strict terms .
Except for the issues of the economy and Social Security , one candidate is strongly favored over the other .

I would n’t put too much stock in any poll taken this early .
Most voters have n’t started thinking about the general election yet .
If you think of the polls as a series of before and after snapshots of the nation ’s political mood , than this one definitely belongs in the before category , this poll provides a peek at where the voters in one state stand right now .
Anyone who has been around presidential elections for a while knows that these polls will shift like crazy .
We probably wo n’t get reliable data until October , but the early polls are still fun to look at and talk about .
You can check out the full results right here .
BUCKMINSTER FULLER ’s 1933 Dymaxion , a streamlined pod on three wheels , is one of the lovable oddballs in automotive history .
Three were built , fawned over by the media and by celebrities , but the car pretty much disappeared after one crashed , killing the driver .
Only one of the cars survives , and New Yorkers will get a chance to see it this summer in an exhibition opening June 26 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York called “ Buckminster Fuller : Starting With the Universe . ”
The car , a nonrunning shell , has been lent by the National Automobile Museum in Reno , Nev .
“ The Dymaxion was the zenith of the first wave of semi- scientific streamlining , ” said Russell Flinchum , a design historian .
It showed up in newsreels and magazines , along with teardrop designs drawn by Norman Bel Geddes , the futurist .
It helped lead to public acceptance of streamlined cars like the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr .
The Dymaxion appealed to the era of the Depression , when people dreamed of radical new technological solutions to solve overwhelming problems .

The number of young adults in the United States who were hospitalized with health conditions related to diabetes increased by 38 percent between 1993 and 2004 , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and published in the journal
While diabetes , Type 2 in particular , generally affects the older segment of the population , the prevalence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes among children in the United States has been rising .
To determine whether diabetes - related hospitalizations among youth are also increasing , researchers examined data on hospital stays by people under the age of 29 who had been diagnosed with diabetes .
Between 1993 and 2004 , the overall hospitalization rate for the study population increased by 38 percent .
When broken down by age , the researchers found that the hospitalization rate for those between the ages of 20 and 29 increased significantly every year , while there did not appear to be any changes among those younger than 20 .
Researchers found that females were more likely to be hospitalized than males , and that the increase in hospitalization rates was also greater for females than males .
While 29 percent more diabetic males under the age of 29 were hospitalized in 2004 as compared to 1993 , 42 percent more diabetic females were hospitalized .
According to the researchers , the rates of diabetes - related hospitalization are expected to keep rising , since the prevalence of the disease increases every year .
Diabetes rates continue to increase among the U.S. population in general , rising at such a rate that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has termed it an epidemic .
According to the American Diabetes Association , 20.8 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with diabetes , 6.2 million remain undiagnosed and 41 million are prediabetic .
According to the World Health Organization , approximately 171 million people around the world are diabetic .
Looks excellent , and if it works that would be outstanding for those of us that normally have one specific pneumatic job we need to complete .
However , my experience with small tank compressors has not been particularly good in the past ( having to wait for the compressor to catch up to me ) .
But , once again — if it works well , it sounds great .

BCCI Oil Money
The first of many G.W. Bush business ventures eventually bailed out or liquidated before bankruptcy was his oil company Arbusto Energy .
In 1977 , Bush received a $ 50,000 investment from James R. Bath , a Houston businessman who " made his fortune by investing money for [ Sheikh Kalid bin ] Mahfouz and another BCCI - connected Saudi , Sheikh bin Laden " according to Time correspondents Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne .
Of special note is that Sheikh bin Laden is widely believed to be the father of Osama bin Laden , terrorist bomber of two U.S. embassies in 1998 .
Bath , who had no funds of his own , is believed to have acted as the American representative for Saudi Arabian sheikhs who , as Hatfield describes it , used " their enormous financial resources to influence U.S. policy . "
As son of the recent director of the CIA , G.W. Bush and his oil startup were a perfect opportunity to buy influence .
Ironically , it was with money allegedly tied to the family of Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wall Street Journal - Page A1 Thomas Petzinger Jr. , Peter Truell and Jill Abramson December 6 , 1991
Two years ago , Talat Othman did n't have the president 's ear .
But since August 1990 , the Palestinian - born Chicago investor has attended three White House meetings with President Bush to discuss Middle East policy .
Mr. Othman 's political access coincides with the remarkable ascendance of a little Texas oil company on whose board he serves alongside George W. Bush , the president 's oldest son .
That company , Harken Energy Corp. -- though it had never drilled a single well overseas or in water -- recently won the rights to drill potentially lucrative offshore wildcat wells in a contract bestowed by the government of Bahrain .
When the Harken deal was announced in January 1990 , it attracted only perfunctory notice .
More recently , a number of publications have written about the case , raising questions about whether Bahrain might have chosen Harken in part because a presidential son sat on its board .
Now , George W. Bush is emerging as a principal adviser to his father .
He was a lead player in the campaign to oust White House Chief of Staff John Sununu , and was cited by his father yesterday as among those who will play " key roles in the reelection effort . "
Thus , the issues surrounding the Harken deal take on fresh importance .
The White House says there is nothing questionable in this story of petroleum , politics and the presidential son .
" There is no conflict of interest , or even the appearance of conflict , in these business arrangements , " says spokesman Marlin Fitzwater .
The matters had been reviewed and disclosed , he said , adding , " They are legitimate business undertakings . "
Indeed , an investigation by this paper has not revealed evidence of wrongdoing or influence - peddling by George W. Bush or anyone else connected to Harken .
Yet what does emerge is a complex pattern of personal and financial relationships behind Harken 's sudden good fortune in the Middle East , raising the question of whether Bahrainis or others in the Middle East may have hoped to ingratiate themselves with the White House .
Even more intriguing , there are numerous links among Harken , Bahrain and individuals close to the discredited Bank of Credit & Commerce International , a banking empire that used Mideast oil money to seek ties to political leaders in several countries .
The mosaic of BCCI connections surrounding Harken Energy may prove nothing more than how ubiquitous the rogue bank 's ties were .
But the number of BCCI - connected people who had dealings with Harken -- all since George W. Bush came on board -- likewise raises the question of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presi- dential son .
Among those relationships :
-- Sheik Khalifah bin-Salman al - Khalifah , the prime minister of Bahrain and a brother of the country 's ruling emir , is identified on an October 1990 shareholder list as one of the 45 investors who own parent company BCCI Holdings ( Luxembourg ) S.A .
The emir played a role in approving the Harken transaction .
-- Sheik Abdullah Bakhsh , a major Harken shareholder represented by Mr. Othman on the company 's board , has been a co-investor in Saudi Arabia with alleged BCCI front man Ghaith Pharaon , and used Khalid bin-Mahfouz , until recently a principal BCCI shareholder , as his banker .
-- Harken 's investment bankers helped BCCI gain its foothold in U.S. banking , and they also arranged for a Swiss bank to help rescue Harken from its debt woes in 1987 -- a Swiss bank that was at the time a joint - venture partner with BCCI .
-- Harken 's consultant on the Bahrain deal counts Kamal Adham , a principal owner of BCCI , as a close friend and has had a long acquaintance with BCCI 's Mr. Pharaon .
As a candidate and later in the White House , President Bush vowed to avoid even the appearance of any conflicts of interest in his administration .
He instructed Secretary of State James Baker to cable all U.S. embassies to warn against the appearance of preferential treatment for Bush family investments overseas .
The president has also moved to distance himself from the BCCI scandal , denouncing a former aide who recently went to work as a lawyer for BCCI 's Mr. Adham , and who resigned in the ensuing furor .
George W. Bush , a managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team , declined to be interviewed .
He did provide brief responses to written questions through an intermediary .
Asked whether his involvement with the Dallas energy company lent it added credibility in the Arab world , he said to " ask the Bahrainis . "
Every individual involved denies any influence peddling .
Mr. Othman , George W. Bush and people involved in setting up the White House meetings on the Mideast say the president 's son had nothing to do with Mr. Othman 's being included among the Arab - Americans invited .
" Not by any stretch of the imagination , " Mr. Othman says .
And Harken investor Mr. Bakhsh rejects any suggestion that his links , past and present , to Messrs .
Pharaon and binMahfouz mean he is in any way associated with BCCI .
He says through his New York lawyer that he bought Harken stock ( in 1987 ) because it looked like a good investment in a depressed industry .
Harken officials say they resent any suggestion their company somehow has ties to BCCI .
They dismiss the circumstantial links to it as purely random and say they were shocked to learn of them .
And , in fact , BCCI has proved adept at insinuating itself into centers of influence without the knowledge of those occupying the seats of power .
Harken says it won the Bahrain drilling deal purely on merit , through painstaking geological research and deft negotiating .
It says Mr. Bush played no role in clinching the deal .
As for Bahrain , it says it chose tiny Harken partly because it did n't believe a large company would be so fully committed to the project .
Other Harken officials , while denying that the Bush name played any specific role , acknowledge that having him on their board is an asset .
" You 'd have to be an idiot not to say it 's impressive , " says Alan Quasha , former Harken chairman and its second - largest shareholder .
( The largest , with 24.5 % , is a Harvard University investment fund . )
Mr. Bush 's affiliation with Harken came at the end of a failed attempt to follow in the footsteps of his father .
Like him , George W. launched a career in the oil business in Midland , Texas , and like his father he chose a Spanish name for it : Arbusto Energy Inc. " Arbusto " is Spanish for " bush " ; the president 's company was Zapata Petroleum Co .
Among George W.'s investors was James R. Bath , a Houston aircraft broker who had a flourishing aviation business with sheiks of the Saudi peninsula .
Mr. Bath owned a piece of a Houston bank in which Mr. Pharaon , the BCCI front man , had been a controlling shareholder .
Mr. Bath also invested money in the U.S. for Mr. bin-Mahfouz , the Saudi banker who would go on to become a leading shareholder in BCCI .
According to Mr. Bath 's personal financial statements , produced in unrelated litigation , Mr. Bath invested $ 50,000 with George W. Bush , becoming a 5 % partner in Arbusto .
Mr. Bush says he was aware Mr. Bath was representing Saudi investors but that at the time " had never heard of BCCI . "
In the oil - patch depression of the mid1980s , Mr. Bush 's company merged with another concern , becoming Spectrum 7 Energy Corp .
But its fortunes did n't improve .
" We lost a lot of money in the oil business , " says Philip Uzielli , a director of Spectrum 7 and friend of Mr. Bush .
" We had a lot of dry wells .
. . .
Things were terrible .
It was dreadful . "
Finding a buyer was n't easy .
But in September 1986 , Harken Energy swapped some of its own shares for the shares of Spectrum 7 .
Mr. Bush 's cut was worth roughly $ 600,000 .
" Getting Harken stock at that point turned out to be very good , " Mr. Uzielli recalls .
In addition to becoming a Harken stockholder , Mr. Bush became a director and a consultant at $ 120,000 a year , later reduced to $ 50,000 .
( In mid-1990 , Mr. Bush sold two - thirds of his Harken holdings at a significant profit ; his remaining stake could still be worth millions if Harken hits a gusher in Bahrain . )
What looked like a dull investment soon looked brighter .
The company needed a cash infusion , and Mr. Bush , whose consulting contract listed " equity placements " among his duties , was there when Harken officials got together with Little Rock 's Stephens Inc. , one of the largest U.S. investment banks outside of Wall Street .
He needed no introduction to Jackson Stephens , having known him since the 1980 Reagan - Bush campaign .
Mr. Stephens 's wife , Mary Anne , would soon become Arkansas co-chairman of the Bush for President campaign , while Mr. Stephens would donate $ 100,000 to Team 100 , a GOP group that collected money for the campaign .
Stephens Inc. kicked in another $ 100,000 to the Bush dinner committee last May .
But on that spring day in Little Rock , cash for Harken was the topic .
Ultimately , Stephens put a rescue plan in motion : Union Bank of Switzerland , which ordinarily did n't invest in small U.S. firms , would make an exception , giving Harken $ 25 million in exchange for a stock interest .
At the time , UBS was a joint - venture partner with BCCI in a Geneva - based bank .
And although Harken officials , including Messrs .
Bush and Quasha , say they were unaware of it , Mr. Stephens was also well acquainted with BCCI .
In fact , he suggested to BCCI in the late 1970s that it try to take over what is now Washington , D.C. 's biggest bank company , First American Bankshares Inc. , according to court records produced in connection with the takeover attempt .
Mr. Stephens was among the defendants in that suit , aimed at preventing a First American takeover by BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi , BCCI principal Kamal Adham and Abdullah Darwaish , chief financier for the royal family of Abu Dhabi .
Mr. Stephens declined to be interviewed for this article .
The Harken financing Stephens was arranging hit a last - minute snag .
To comply with U.S. banking laws , the deal assumed a complex new structure , and UBS decided to unload its shares to a third party at the first chance , according to Mr. Quasha .
UBS says it planned to sell the shares all along .
In any case , Stephens brought in a new patron : a real - estate magnate from Jedda , Saudi Arabia , who bought most of Union Bank 's Harken shares .
He was Abdullah Bakhsh .
Mr. Bakhsh for several years was chairman of Saudi Finance Co. , a Luxembourg - based holding company for Swiss and French financial enterprises .
He sold his interest in 1983 .
Who bought it is n't clear , but corporation records in Geneva show that by 1989 it had come partly under the control of the Gokal family , Pakistani shipping magnates who were early BCCI shareholders and who , according to BCCI 's auditors , have failed to service more than $ 700 million of borrowings from BCCI .
Mr. Bakhsh has had business dealings with some of the most prominent people in Saudi Arabia , including , according to a friend , former Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani and current oil minister Hisham Nazer .
One of his co-investors in the U.S. says he believes the sheik has also invested with members of the Saudi royal family .
But Mr. Bush , Mr. Quasha and other Harken officials evidently knew little about their new partner .
Mr. Quasha did a background check and says he found that Mr. Bakhsh was a very private person of great integrity who had already received regulatory approval for other U.S. investments .
Mr. Bakhsh , though listed as Harken 's third largest stockholder with a 17.6 % stake , has met with company officials on only a few occasions , and George W. Bush says through his intermediary he has never spoken to him .
Instead , Harken officials deal with him through Mr. Othman , who sits on the Harken board .
In the wake of the company 's new Persian Gulf backing came a much bigger Gulf breakthrough .
It might be called the Dream Deal .
Bahrain , a small emirate with strong ties to Saudi Arabia , had n't made a significant new oil find since 1932 .
But high - tech seismic surveys detailed a large geological formation under the sea , between two of the greatest oil and gas fields on the planet .
The company picked to drill exploratory wells would have to put up a lot of cash -- $ 12.7 million just for the first of several wells .
But it would get a lucrative share of any oil found .
The payoff could total in the billions .
Amoco , vitally interested , started negotiating with the Bahrainis in 1987 .
( Three other companies also entered into talks , according to Bahrain , which did n't identify them . )
As negotiations advanced , Amoco grew hopeful of a contract .
Then , in January 1990 , it heard startling news :
The contract had just been awarded to tiny Harken .
" We were disappointed , " says Patricia Wright , an Amoco spokesman .
" We thought we might get this one . "
Why did Harken get it instead ?
" It was not some sort of fix , " says Mr. Quasha , the former Harken chairman .
Harken says George W. Bush did n't play any role in clinching the deal , and even expressed doubts that Harken had the financial resources for it .
Mr. Quasha also points out that all the connections in the world wo n't help Harken find oil in Bahrain , which the Bahrainis know as well as anyone .
" I do n't see where they gain from dealing with a relative of George Bush 's who futzes up . "
Bahrain says the Bush connection could n't have been a factor .
" We were not aware when Harken was chosen of any prominent American or Arab who was connected with the company , " says Bahrain 's oil minister , Yousuf Shirawi .
However , Monte Swetnam , Harken 's exploration chief , says , " I 'm sure they were aware " of Mr. Bush 's involvement with the company .
" I talked about our exploration advisory board and our board of directors .
George 's name comes up twice .
It was n't a secret . "
So , then , why Harken ?
Harken officials , in extensive interviews , maintain that Bahrain wanted a small company that would devote full attention to the project , a point Bahraini Oil Minister Shirawi confirms .
To find one , he turned to a longtime friend , Michael Ameen , a Houston oil consultant who had worked in the Mideast for Mobil Corp. and Arabian American Oil Co. ( Aramco ) .
Mr. Ameen represents yet another BCCI notation in the Harken story .
As the head of government relations for Aramco , he says he had close - up dealings for years with the Saudi royal family and its advisers , including Mr. Adham , the BCCI principal , who is also a former Saudi intelligence chief .
Mr. Ameen was close enough to the Pharaon family that he recalls meeting a young Ghaith on his graduation from college .
Mr. Ameen had been a friend for 25 years of Mr. Bakhsh , the large Harken shareholder .
But he says that when faced with having to recommend to Bahrain one small oil company out of the hundreds to choose from , he chose Harken out of pure serendipity .
Within 10 minutes of discussing the matter by phone with Bahrain 's oil minister , Mr. Ameen says , he got a call from one of Harken 's investment bankers at Stephens in Little Rock .
Before long , Mr. Ameen was leading Harken delegations to London and Bahrain , where , according to the company , Harken officials displayed keen knowledge of the region 's geology and disarmed the Bahrainis with their open negotiating style .
In the midst of Harken 's talks with Bahrain , Mr. Ameen -- simultaneously working as a State Department consultant -- briefed the incoming U.S. ambassador to Bahrain , Charles Hostler .
Mr. Ameen ultimately received a fee of about $ 100,000 from Harken .
Ambassador Hostler , a San Diego real - estate investor who is a $ 100,000 Republican contributor , says through an embassy official that he never discussed the Harken deal with authorities in Bahrain .
Harken officials say they met with him only after their contract was secured .
Mr. Hostler does say that he has long known , and from time to time given financial counsel to , Mohammad Hammoud , who was described in recent Senate testimony as a " flexible front for BCCI . "
Mr. Hammoud is also listed as a significant BCCI shareholder .
Once negotiated , the Harken contract was reviewed and approved by several Bahraini officials , including , lastly , Sheik Isa bin-Sulman al - Khalifah , the ruling emir .
His younger brother , Prime Minister Sheik Khalifah bin-Sulman al - Khalifah , appears in BCCI records as a shareholder , along with Mr. Adham , several members of Persian Gulf royalty , and others .
" His highness the emir has no personal opinions " about Harken or anyone else associated with the transaction , says Mr. Shirawi , the oil minister .
" There is a possibility he 's a shareholder , but we never heard of it , " a Bahrain embassy spokesman says .
If the prime minister does have BCCI holdings , the spokesman points out , the shareholding is n't large .
The drilling deal went through even though Harken admitted it could n't begin to finance the exploration on its own .
Bahrain agreed to let Harken bring in a partner .
It was the hottest ticket in town ; two dozen oil companies expressed interest in coming into the deal .
Harken chose Bass Enterprises Production Co. of Fort Worth , Texas , a company controlled the politically active billionaire Bass family .
Members of the Bass family have contributed more than $ 200,000 to the GOP in recent years .
A Bass company official declines comment .
At the signing ceremony in January 1990 , a celebratory delegation from Harken traveled to Bahrain , including Mr. Quasha , Mr. Othman and another Harken executive .
The first well broke ground last month and is scheduled for completion by the end of January .
Within six months Mr. Othman saw his political status , as well as his company 's position , enhanced .
His name was added by the White House to a select list of 15 Arab - Americans chosen to meet with President Bush , Mr. Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft in the White House two days after Iraq 's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
Mr. Othman and others involved in setting up the White House meeting say his three invitations are explained by his membership in the Arab - American Council on the Middle East , a group of business and political leaders who are close to ousted Chief of Staff Sununu .
" Talat was recommended to us by many people in the Arab - American community , " says one administration official .
Mr. Othman was most recently present at a White House gathering last month of President Bush and Arab - American leaders .
" George W. Bush has nothing to do with it , " Mr. Othman says of the White House meetings .
" This is an invitation from the White House . "

Thomas Jefferson 's original rough draft of the Declaration of Independence , written in June 1776 , including all the changes made later by John Adams , Benjamin Franklin and other members of the committee , and by Congress .
When he penned the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Thomas Jefferson had an inkling of the consequences it held for the 13 colonies , who were announcing their intention to break free from the shackles of British rule .
What he and the other signers may not have anticipated , however , were the widespread effects the powerful words would also have around the world .
The promise was evident in the famous phrases scrawled near the top of the document :
" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . "
The Declaration of Independence did n't just change the course of American history , but created a ripple effect that nudged a host of other nations toward independence , making a revolutionary poster boy of Jefferson in the process .
The Enlightenment
Britain's vast army was already on its way towards New York Harbor when Jefferson sat down to compose the Declaration in June of 1776 , beginning :
" When in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . "
This depiction of the Declaration of Independence is a painting by John Trumbull .
It shows the five - man drafting committee presenting their work to the Congress .
The painting hangs in the U.S. Capitol rotunda .

The ideas Jefferson expressed , which justified the reasons for revolt with a list of charges against the British king , were n't original .
A number of global texts written during the highly charged Enlightenment years of the 17th and 18th centuries included similar ideals about liberty and the right to self - determination , and Americans throughout the colonies were already promoting the progressive worldview in newspapers and schoolbooks .
It was the fiery political climate into which the Declaration was born that made Jefferson 's words so important .
When his final draft was edited and adopted by Congress on July 4th , the statement signified independence , but it also solidified the path to all - out war , and not just in the new United States .
Liberty gets going
Immediately after it was printed , the Declaration sparked worldwide debate on the legitimacy of colonial rule .
Several countries used the document as a shining beacon in their own struggles for independence and adopted Jefferson as their figurehead .
Jefferson himself predicted that American independence would be a catalyzing force — a " ball of liberty , " he called it — that would soon make its way across the globe .
First came France , whose revolution in the 1780s and 90s drew upon the American experience and literature for inspiration .
Jefferson happened to be a minister to France at the time and became an ardent supporter of the revolutionaries , even helping to draft a charter of rights in support of a new republic , eerily similar to the one he 'd written just over a decade prior .
With its mother country France in disarray , another colony inspired by the American Revolution sought independence in the late 18th century .
Haiti had been a profitable sugar and coffee colony for centuries , known as one of the cruelest plantation islands in the Caribbean .
Led by freed slave Toussaint L'Ouverture , who quoted both France and America 's declarations to stir the uprising , Haiti achieved its own liberty in 1804 .
Ironically , former slaves in Haiti had used the Declaration of Independence as a model in their fight for freedom while the document gave no such rights to slaves in the United States .
In the years that followed , themes from the Declaration were sourced and reinterpreted for further independence movements in Greece , Poland , Russia and throughout South America .
A world of empires was gradually turning into a world of sovereign states .

gov :
IN CONGRESS , July 4 , 1776 .
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America ,
When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
-- That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
-- Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a candid world .
He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good .
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them .
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature , a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only .
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their public Records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures .
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly , for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people .
He has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected ; whereby the Legislative powers , incapable of Annihilation , have returned to the People at large for their exercise ; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without , and convulsions within .
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States ; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither , and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands .
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice , by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers .
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone , for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries .
He has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people , and eat out their substance .
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power .
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation : For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us :
For protecting them , by a mock Trial , from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States :
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world :
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent :
For depriving us in many cases , of the benefits of Trial by Jury :
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province , establishing therein an Arbitrary government , and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies :
For taking away our Charters , abolishing our most valuable Laws , and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments :
For suspending our own Legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever .
He has abdicated Government here , by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us .
He has plundered our seas , ravaged our Coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people .
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation .
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country , to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their Hands .
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless Indian Savages , whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions .
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms :
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which , would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence .
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity .
We must , therefore , acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our Separation , and hold them , as we hold the rest of mankind , Enemies in War , in Peace Friends .
We , therefore , the Representatives of the united States of America , in General Congress , Assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies , solemnly publish and declare , That these United Colonies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to levy War , conclude Peace , contract Alliances , establish Commerce , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do .
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes and our sacred Honor .

US - contracted ship fires on Iranian boat : report Nick Juliano

This US military personnel aboard a cargo ship traveling into the Persian Gulf fired nearly a dozen warning shots at Iranian speed - boats Thursday , according to several breaking news reports .
Reports of the incident prompted a nearly immediate spike in oil prices , which jumped $ 3 per barrel .
The ship was contracted by the U.S Military Sealift Command , which delivers supplies to US troops overseas .
The showdown involved a cargo ship known as Westward Venture and several Iranian speedboats , reported MSNBC's Jim Miklaszewski .
" Since it is chartered by the US military it then essentially becomes a US military vessel , with the necessary armaments on board to protect the cargo and the crew on board , " he reported .
The cargo ship apparently was sailing into the Strait of Hormuz , site of a showdown between US Navy warships and Iranian speedboats in January .
More than one Iranian " fast boats ... were approaching this vessel at a high rate of speed , " in the Persian Gulf , MSNBC 's Pentagon correspondent said .
US military personnel on board fired eight .50 - caliber rounds and three warning shots from M - 16s when the boats got within 100 yards of the cargo ship .
After the shots were fired , the ships veered off , according to MSNBC .
Miklaszewski said the military believes the Iranians were mostly trying to harass the ship and perhaps see how close they could get before being fired upon .
He said those types of boats could not do much damage unless they got nearly right up next to the ship and were packed with explosives .
Last month , another US cargo ship fired on an Egyptian boat that was coming towards it in the Suez Canal .
Egyptian officials said on man on the boat was killed , although the US Navy claimed it just fired warning shots .
The speedboat that was fired on apparently carried local merchandise which the Egyptian men sold to sailors on larger ships .
The latest incident is also the second showdown with Iran in the Persian Gulf .
It follows a January showdown in which the US Navy said Iranian speedboats threatened its ships in the Strait of Hormuz .
That incident was later revealed to have been overblown , and some saw echoes of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that drew America deeper into Vietnam .

The checkpoint in this video was nearly 50 miles north of the Mexican border , so it would have been utterly pointless in stopping illegal immigration .
The real purpose of these checkpoints is to condition Americans to get used to the police state .
People who tool around in hulking , big - ol sport utility vehicles have been getting dissed a lot lately , but no one has raked them over the coals like the people who sold them the SUVs in the first place .
The multbillion - dollar auto industry does extensive research into its customers , and lately that research has focused quite a bit on the people who buy SUVs .
Investigative reporter Keith Bradsher of the New York Times has looked into the SUV phenomenon for years .
He 's read marketing reports meant only to be seen within the industry ; he 's interviewed marketing executives from the car companies and from outside research firms .
The industry has come to some unflattering conclusions about the people who buy SUVs .
As summarized by Bradsher :
" They tend to be people who are insecure and vain .
They are frequently nervous about their marriages and uncomfortable about parenthood .
They often lack confidence in their driving skills .
Above all , they are apt to be self - centered and self - absorbed , with little interest in their neighbors and communitites ...
" They are more restless , more sybaric , and less social than most Americans are .
They tend to like fine restaurants a lot more than off - road driving , seldom go to church and have limited interest in doing volunteer work to help others . "
One of General Motors ' top engineers spoke of the difference between minivanners and SUVers : " SUV owners want to be more like , ' I 'm in control of the people around me . ' "
He went on :
" With the sport utility buyers , it 's more of an image thing .
Sport utility buyers tend to be more like , ' I wonder how people view me , ' and are more willing to trade off flexibility or funtionality to get that . "
The executive VP for North American auto operations at Honda revealed : " The people who buy SUVs are in many cases buying the outside first and then the inside .
They are buying the image of the SUV first , and then the functionality . "
Jim Bulin , a former Ford strategist who started his own marketing firm , told Bradsher : " It 's about not letting anything get in your way and , in the extreme , about intimidating others to get out of your way . "
Daniel A. Gorell , who also used to market for Ford and now has his own firm , says simply that SUV drivers are " less giving , less oriented towards others . "
Defenders of SUVs have attacked Bradsher for reporting these things , but they always forget the crucial point : Bradsher is n't the one slamming the SUV owners - it 's the auto industry itself .
The modern Olympic ideals differ dramatically from the way the games were actually played in ancient Greece , says a University of Maryland classicist who has heavily researched the Olympic past .
The ancient games featured professionals with a “ winning is everything ” philosophy .
“ Ancient Olympiads were more like the modern PGA golf circuit than the amateur ideal advanced for most of the 20th century , ” says Hugh Ming Lee , a professor of classics at the University of Maryland .
“ The Greeks and Romans awarded honors to the most accomplished athletes and paid them for their efforts .
These professionals traveled a competitive circuit .
The Vince Lombardi notion of winning is much closer to the original Olympic spirit . ”
Ancient athletes resorted to various “ potions ” to gain a competitive edge .
“ The dung of a wild boar was honored for the powers it conferred on charioteers , ” Lee points out .
“ Even the emperor Nero tried it . ”
Modern - day ‘ Ultimate Fighting ’ resembles the Greek ’s pankration , where almost everything short of eye - gouging and biting was permitted .
“ If it were n’t for the nudity , the ancient games would have played well on modern TV , ” Lee says .
The ancient Greeks played the games under a flag of truce to give athletes safe passage .
The games offered a respite from war , according to Lee .
The athletes ran the final race of the Olympiad in armor , perhaps to acknowledge the coming end of the truce .
The resolution called for sanctions on Mugabe and 13 other officials Britain and the US have condemned Russia and China for vetoing a draft UN Security Council resolution to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe 's leaders .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the veto was incomprehensible .
The US said it brought into question Russia 's reliability as a G8 partner .
Zimbabwe and its main ally South Africa welcomed the result .
Russia and China defended their stance , saying the situation in Zimbabwe posed no threat to international stability .
The proposed measures had included an arms embargo and a travel ban for President Robert Mugabe and 13 of his key allies .
Zimbabwe 's Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu described the resolution as a Western plot and welcomed its rejection .
" We are happy that the United Nations principle of non-interference with member states of the United Nations has been brought to the understanding of the whole world , " he said .
" Russia and China have only observed the principles of the United Nations .
We ... would like to thank those who helped defeat international racism disguised as multilateral action at the UN . "
International security
There has been growing international criticism of Zimbabwe since the re-election of Mr Mugabe in a run-off boycotted by the opposition .
The opposition 's Morgan Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change party say they had faced a campaign of violence by Mugabe supporters , which left dozens dead and thousands injured and forced from their homes .
Russia and China said they opposed the resolution because the situation in Zimbabwe did not threaten international stability .

The US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , said Russia 's veto raised " questions about its reliability as a G8 partner " .
Mr Miliband said Moscow and Beijing had sent mixed signals about their intentions - with Russia using its veto despite a promise by President Dmitry Medvedev to support the resolution when it was discussed at this week 's summit of the G8 group of industrialised nations .
" The vote yesterday showed that , in the end , the Russians and the Chinese - I would n't quite say put two fingers up - but effectively they blocked action , " he told the BBC , adding that Britain would be keeping up its pressure .
The resolution had the support of nine council members , the minimum required to pass in the 15 - member council .
But the veto of any of the five permanent members - which include Russia and China - is enough to defeat a resolution .
UN mandate A BBC correspondent at the UN , Andy Gallacher , says the failure of the resolution is a major blow for the United States and Britain .
The UK ambassador to the UN said after the vote that the UN had failed in its duty to offer the people of Zimbabwe some hope .
UN SANCTIONS VOTE FOR
Belgium
Burkina Faso
Costa Rica
Croatia
France
Italy
Panama
UK
United States AGAINST
China
Libya
Russia
South Africa
Vietnam ABSTAINED
Indonesia
Mugabe survives despite pressure However , Russia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said sanctions would have taken the UN beyond its mandate .
China 's Foreign Ministry 's chief spokesman Liu Jianchao said sanctions would complicate conditions in Zimbabwe and would not help to encourage the various factions engage in political dialogue and negotiations .
South Africa - which is hoping that President Mugabe and the opposition can reach a deal on a power - sharing - voted against sanctions , leading to accusations from the US that it was protecting Mr Mugabe .
But South Africa 's representative , Dumisani Kumalo , said sanctions would interfere with dialogue that would lead to improvements in the humanitarian and economic situation .
Post - poll violence Violence in Zimbabwe is said to have increased after the disputed presidential elections .
The MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai won the first round of Zimbabwe 's presidential elections on 29 March , but official results gave him less than the 50 % share needed to avoid a run-off .
He pulled out of the run -off poll after many of his supporters were targeted , assaulted and even killed , leaving Mr Mugabe to win unopposed in the second round at the end of June .
The MDC says 113 of its supporters have been killed , some 5,000 are missing and more than 200,000 have been forced from their homes since March .

Vx32 : portable , efficient , safe
execution of untrusted x86 code
Bryan Ford
Russ Cox
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
About
Vx32 is a user - mode library that can be linked into arbitrary applications that wish to create secure , isolated execution environments in which to run untrusted extensions or plug-ins implemented as native x86 code .
Vx32 is similar in purpose to the Java or .NET virtual machines , but it runs native x86 code , so plug-ins can be written in ANY language , not just Java or C# .
Vx32 runs on unmodified x86 FreeBSD , Linux , and Mac OS X systems without special permissions , privileges , or kernel modules .
It also runs on x86 - 64 Linux systems .
Ports to x86-64 FreeBSD and Mac OS X should not be difficult .
A port to Windows XP should also be possible .
Documentation
The USENIX 2008 paper “ Vx32 : Lightweight , User - level Sandboxing on the x86 ” explains how vx32 works and gives performance results for running various programs under vx32 .
Some programs even execute faster under vx32 than they do natively !
There are no manual pages for libvx 32 yet .
To get started writing new vx32 applications , the best idea is to look at the sample programs vxrun and vxlinux in the vx32 distribution , below .
Applications
Vx32 has been used to build a variety of interesting applications .
The first was VXA , a future - proof archive format that embeds x86 decompressors into archives so that they can be extracted in the future without needing to worry about whether the tools of the future know that particular compression algorithm .
VXA runs decompressors safely and efficiently , using vx32 .
VXA is described in detail in the FAST 2005 paper “ VXA : A Virtual Architecture for Durable Compressed Archives . ”
Another is Chris Lesniewski-Laas 's Alpaca , a proof - carrying authorization scheme based on an interpreted proof language .
In Alpaca , high - level concepts such as X.509 certificates and RSA encryption are implemented in the proof language rather than taken as primitives , so that an Alpaca deployment can gracefully adapt when the world switches to new authentication mechanisms .
While number theory - based algorithms like RSA are very efficient to specify in a mathematical language , iterative round - based hash functions like SHA1 or MD5 are not .
Instead , Alpaca allows the introduction of new computations , using vx32 to execute untrusted x86 implementations safely and efficiently .
To run the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks on a variety of systems , we used vx32 to write a tiny little user - level operating system that runs statically linked x86 ELF binaries and implements enough of a POSIX - like system call interface to handle the variety of SPEC programs .
This program , called vxrun , could be adapted to create a specialized execution environment that presented a portable interface no matter what the host operating system .
It would be ideal for implementing secure distributed computations in a SETI @Home kind of setting .
Vxrun is described briefly in the USENIX paper and is included in the libvx 32 distribution below .
Inspired by writing a fake operating system , we decided to port a real one .
Plan 9 VX ( aka 9vx ) is a port of the Plan 9 kernel to user - level mode on Linux , FreeBSD , and OS X. 9vx runs unmodified x86 Plan 9 binaries by invoking vx32 to simulate user - mode execution .
It implements all the standard low - level operating system features — processes , shared memory , demand paging , preemptive scheduling — using standard OS interfaces like mmap , setitimer , and sigaction , with a healthy dose of vx32 to provide the user - mode execution that ties everything together .
Source Code
Latest version
This is the most recent version of libvx 32 .
It also includes source code for vxrun and 9vx .
If you just want to try 9vx , see the binary distribution here .
Vx32 is also available via Mercurial :
hg clone http://hg.pdos.csail.mit.edu/hg/vx32/
Changes to vx32 since version 0.10 are documented in the mercurial change history .
VXA and Alpaca are available as part of UIA , the Unmanaged Internet Architecture .
They build against an older version of the vx32 library , also included in UIA .
That version approximately matches vx32-0.01 below .
They have not yet been converted to the new interface .
Older versions , for reference only :
vx32-0.02.tar.bz2 ( used for USENIX 2008 paper )
vx32-0.01.tar.bz2 ( used for FAST 2005 paper )
Cross compilers
Libvx32 is an x86 execution library .
It does n't require a particular binary format , but it does provide a simple interface for loading ELF binaries if you care to use ELF .
VXA , Alpaca , and vxrun all expect ELF binaries .
We have prepared a version of the gcc toolchain that generates ELF binaries compatible with vx32 .
On x86 ELF systems like Linux and FreeBSD , you can usually get by with the host compilers .
On non-ELF systems like OS X , you will need to build the cross -compiler toolchain to generate ELF binaries .
To build the compilers :
cd binutils - 2.18-vx32 ./configure --target=vx32 make make install cd gcc-4.1.2-vx32 ./configure --enable-languages=c --disable-libssp --target=vx32 make make install
Pre-built binaries are also available :
The binaries were compiled in the vx32-0.01 days .
They should still work with newer vx32's , but we have n't tried them recently .
Licenses
Libvx32 itself is made available under the terms of the Lesser GNU Public License ( LGPL ) .
The sample programs and supporting C library are made available under a traditional MIT license .
9vx , because it is derived from Plan 9 , is made available under the terms of the Lucent Public License 1.02 .
The source code archive contains more details .
Warning !
Vx32 is a stable research prototype , but it has not been through any formal security audits or any other verification .
Such a review would be essential before trusting vx32 to handle malicious code in the wild .

He replied in character saying : " Since the 2003 Tuleyakiv reforms , Kazakhstan is as civilized as any other country in the world .
Women can now travel on inside of bus , homosexuals no longer have to wear blue hats , and age of consent has been raised to eight years old .
Controversy has exploded in Greenwich , Conn. , where a group of teenagers built a Wiffle ball field in a vacant lot and are now at the center of a massive feud concerning liability issues on the property , drainage problems , and the value of the land where the diamond now sits .
The story clearly touches a chord within people who wonder how , exactly , a modern kid is supposed to be a kid .
Sometimes I wonder the same thing .
One of the kids who helped clear the weeds and tall grass out of the field , and built and painted a mini-Fenway - esque “ Green Monster ” in the outfield summed up the nature of the controversy in the sullen , delightfully succinct way that only teenagers can when he commented to the New York Times , “ People think we should be home playing ‘ Grand Theft Auto . ’ ”
And that ’s when your heart breaks .
You ca n’t read this story without imagining what led up to the field ’s construction : the handful of kids kneeling down in a weedy lot , scratching bug bites and hatching a plan , discussing where they could find wood scraps , whose father ’s lawnmower they could borrow , how much allowance money they could pool for paint .
They built it ; they started something .
More kids showed up to play .
And it looked like it was turning out to be a very good summer .
But the bland reality of adulthood intruded , when neighbors of the Wiffle ball field complained it had become too noisy , and they did n’t buy their houses anticipating some teenage melee underway every evening when they returned home from work – not to mention the estimated value of the lot : $ 1.25 million in one of New York City ’s wealthiest suburbs .
Now Greenwich ’s city government is compelled to get involved and lawyers may need to be called and the New York Times is writing about the Wiffle ball field Vincent Provenzano and Justin Currytto started , for pete ’s sake .
The lingering uneasiness of what ’s happening to these kids derives , for me , from the notion that there are some places where kids are n’t allowed to be idle anymore – that wandering around a vacant field and putting something together with a bunch of other kids who do n’t have anything to do either is simply not a situation that arises too often .
The idea that kids might have the summer time to themselves , to do with what they please , may be becoming an increasingly romantic idea .
As if relics of some previous era , our culture romanticizes idle childhood now , with movies like The Sandlot and Stand By Me and Calvin and Hobbes cartoons given over to lengthy musings on summer ’s long hours and how to fill them .
I think most people recognize that if those hours become too filled , or regarded as somehow not valuable , some unspoken but essential part of growing up in this country dissolves .
When I was 12 or 13 , a bunch of my friends and I discovered a rotting wooden quarter - pipe ramp on a weed - choked , deserted tennis court tucked up in the woods where some old summer camp once stood .
You could see the court from the road in the winter , but in the summer , with the leaves on the trees , it was hidden .
We spent a few days sweeping and shoveling the court , and refurbishing the ramp as best we could , and much of the rest of the summer was given over to launching off that ramp with whatever we could think of : rollerblades , skateboards , bicycles .
We fixed up the court and , in our eyes , the work we put in gave us some ownership over it .
It was fun because it was ours , but it was also fun because it was something for which we did n’t have to join an organization or sign a registration or a safety waiver .
No one would give us trophies evaluating our performance and we were n’t necessarily going to learn anything from it .
I had n’t thought about that old court in years , but I did when I read this story .
Fox alters photos of New York Times reporters

Fox News 's morning show crew apparently is a little thin - skinned when they 're reminded of the network 's sagging ratings .
While still No. 1 among total viewers , Fox 's prime - time lineup is essentially tied with CNN for viewers in the advertiser - coveted 25 - to 54 - year - old demographic .
New York Times media reporter Jacques Steinberg pointed this out last week .
In response , the Fox & Friends dynamic duo of Steve Doocy and the other guy called in the wahmbulance and accused the Times of perpetrating a hit - job on their rarefied network .
Just whining was n't enough for the pair , though , as Media Matters pointed out .
The network digitally altered photos of Steinberg and his boss Steven Reddicliffe to uglify the offending journos .
Steinberg 's nose , chin and ears were enlarged , and Reddicliffe was given a more pronounced receeding hairline ; both men's teeth appear to have been yellowed , as well .
The oh - so - clever Fox folks also displayed a mockup of Steinberg 's face on a poodle 's body on a leash being held by Reddicliffe .
Steinberg was supposed to be his " attack dog , " get it ?
Perhaps Doocy and Co. would be better off just sticking with the New York Post .
Media Matters released the following comparisons of the photos with their originals :

The Jurassic Period 's Archaeopteryx is famous as the world 's first known bird , but now - extinct reptiles such as pterosaurs and kuehneosaurs were flying as far back as 225 million years ago , during the Triassic and before large dinosaurs roamed the Earth .
A lot of strange creatures took to the air back then .
Some large flying reptiles fed on dinosaurs .
One early dinosaur appears to have been the first biplane .
Other small reptiles that seemed to have wings had remained largely mysterious , however .
Now scientists say the smaller creatures soared between trees on strange fly - like wings and parachutes .
They glided like today 's flying dragons , small lizards that can extend membranes attached to movable ribs to glide short distances between trees .
The new study of kuehneosaurs , by scientists from the University of Bristol , England , shows that smaller reptiles used extraordinary extensions of their ribs to form large gliding surfaces on the side of the body .
The results are detailed in the July 15 issue of the journal Palaeontology .
Kuehneosaurs , up to two feet ( 70 centimeters ) long , were first found in the 1950s in an ancient cave system near Bristol .
Their lateral wings were always assumed to be some form of flying adaptation , but their aerodynamic capability had never been studied before .
Koen Stein , who did the work while a graduate at Bristol University , has shown that of the two genera found in Britain , Kuehneosuchus was a glider ( it has elongated wings ) , while Kuehneosaurus , with much shorter " wings , " was a parachutist .
As the two forms are so alike in other respects , it is possible that they are males and females of the same animal .
" We did n't think kuehneosaurs would have been very efficient in the air , but all the work up to now had been speculation , so we decided to build models and test them in the wind tunnel in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Bristol , " Stein said .
" Surprisingly , we found that Kuehneosuchus was aerodynamically very stable , " Stein said .
" Jumping from a five - meter [ about 5.5 yards ] tree , it could easily have crossed nine meters [ about 10 yards ] distance before landing on the ground .
The other form , Kuehneosaurus , was more of a parachutist than a glider . "
To work out how these creatures controlled their flight , the researchers had to model different skin flaps over the wing area .
" We also built webbed hands and feet and had an extra skin membrane between the legs on the models , but these made the flight of the animals unstable , suggesting that they probably did not have such features , " Stein said .

The federal Bureau of Land Management wants to make it easy for the fossil fuel industry to siphon oil out of the Rocky Mountains – but it's not clear whether this would work , and it could be an environmental disaster if it does .
On Tuesday , the BLM proposed cutting the royalties it charges on oil shale from about 15 percent to five percent .
According to Department of the Interior chief Dirk Kempthorne , shale deposits in the Rockies could yield 800 billion barrels of oil .
That 's enough to meet current U.S. oil demands for a century .
But as the * Red , Green and Blue* blog explains , nobody knows if commercial oil shale development is viable ; even fossil fuel giant
Shell is getting cold feet .
And if oil shale works out , extracting it will require from 100 million to 300 million gallons of water per day – enough to meet the daily water needs of about two million Americans .
And if there 's one thing the western United States is already short of , it 's water .
As if that was n't enough , there 's the greenhouse gas issue .
Should we really be making it easier and cheaper to run America on oil for another 100 years ?

Global financial markets open this week still in shock from Friday ’s dramatic surge in oil prices and plunge in stock prices -- and facing new doubts about the U.S. consumer ’s ability to help spur a recovery in the struggling economy .
Asian stock markets were falling early today and the battered dollar continued to lose ground against other major currencies as investors braced for Wall Street ’s starting bell .
There was a bit of relief in energy prices : Crude oil futures slipped $ 1.14 a barrel to $ 137.40 in electronic trading Sunday evening in New York .
But that was just a sliver of the $ 10.75 - a - barrel jump Friday to an all - time high of $ 138.54 .
And in another reminder of what unprecedented oil prices are doing to Americans ’ pocketbooks , AAA on Sunday said the nationwide average price of gasoline crept up to a record $ 4 a gallon -- a level California already had surpassed .

The latest tumult in energy prices and financial markets is likely to focus a harsher spotlight on this week ’s economic reports , including the number of contracts signed to buy existing homes in April , May consumer price inflation and the first June survey of consumer confidence .
“ It should n’t be a surprise that the economy is weak .
The question now is whether it ’s accelerating to the downside , ” said Don Rissmiller , chief economist at investment research firm Strategas Research Partners in New York .
That was the message some investors took away Friday after the government reported a fifth straight month of job losses in May and a leap in the unemployment rate to 5.5 % from 5 % in April -- the biggest one - month jump in 22 years .
Robert Brusca , head of Fact and Opinion Economics in New York , said that although the rise in the jobless rate was blamed on an increase in teenage unemployment , “ the fact is that unemployment -- for just about every category -- [ was ] up in May , just not as sharply as for teenagers . ”

On Wall Street , where stocks have rallied since mid-March on hopes that the economy would improve in the second half of the year , some investors quickly threw in the towel Friday , driving shares down sharply at the start of trading .
The losses were soon compounded by dire news from the commodities market , where crude prices rocketed after pulling back earlier in the week .
The buying frenzy was fueled in part by brokerage Morgan Stanley ’s prediction that oil could hit $ 150 a barrel by July 4 .
The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down almost 400 points , or 3.1 % , to 12,209.81 , its largest one - day drop since February 2007 .
A major fear in the markets is that a vicious circle is underway :
As weak economic data further undermine the value of the dollar , that helps drive up prices of commodities such as oil as global investors look for alternatives to U.S. assets .
Higher oil prices , then , slam the consumer , posing a graver threat to the economy and driving more investors away from the dollar .

In Asian trading early today the euro was at $ 1.578 , up from $ 1.577 on Friday and the highest in nearly three weeks .
Asian stock markets opened lower today , although the drop was n’t as sharp as some analysts had expected after Friday ’s tumble on Wall Street .
At midday , Japan ’s Nikkei - 225 index was down about 2 % , as were stock indexes in South Korea , Taiwan and Singapore .
Markets in Australia , China and Hong Kong were closed today for public holidays .
Record oil prices , of course , pose a threat to growth around the globe .
Asian countries including Indonesia and Taiwan , and more recently India and Malaysia , have announced fuel - subsidy cuts to reduce the strain on government budgets .
Rising crude , combined with burgeoning costs for food , has contributed to much higher inflation , triggering unrest in the streets and forcing central bankers to grapple with whether to raise interest rates at a time of slowing global growth .
Advertisement
Against that backdrop , “ volatility will remain high ” in markets , warned Tim Condon , an economist at ING Financial Markets in Singapore .
Still , analysts note that despite the gloomy May employment report , other recent data suggest the U.S. economy has n’t fallen off a cliff .
Gary Schlossberg , senior economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco , said he expected this week ’s economic reports to reinforce that idea .
“ It ’s not like we ’re going to get a wave of positive data , but I think most of it is going to be consistent with what we have been seeing , ” Schlossberg said .
That is an economy that ’s not crashing but is n’t growing either , he said .

For consumers , however , a key risk now is a continuing dive in stock prices .
If the market falls below its lows reached in March -- when the Dow bottomed at 11,740 -- it would deal a fresh blow to the value of millions of Americans ’ retirement savings accounts .
With stock portfolios losing value and home prices continuing to drop , particularly in California , it ’s going to be hard for consumers to spend freely enough to end the economic doldrums , said Stephen Levy , director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
Until recently , Levy had predicted the California economy would pick up steam going into 2009 because of a rebound in construction , as well as tourism and exports , both helped by the weak dollar .
He now believes that lower household wealth and higher energy costs will slow things down for a year .
“ It may be not a technical recession , ” he said , “ but an extended period of the blahs . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
No offense to the red - skinned , gun-wielding , cigar - chomping demon , but he had to rely on several real - life heroes before “ Hellboy 2 : The Golden Army ” could make it to the screen .

The movie , which Universal opens Friday , is the only franchise in recent memory that began at one studio -- in this case Columbia -- that ended up at another , for which credit goes to the perseverance of filmmaker Guillermo del Toro and producer Larry Gordon .
While the occasional TV series ( “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer , ” “ Scrubs ” ) has jumped from one network to another , film studios virtually never let a franchise go to a competitor .
Created by artist Mike Mignola , “ Hellboy ” was first published in 1993 by Dark Horse Comics and quickly gained attention in Hollywood .
Then - fledgling Mexican filmmaker Del Toro expressed interest in an adaptation , which had Gordon attached as a producer .
But while the comic influenced the lighting in Del Toro ’s American debut “ Mimic , ” that movie do n’t set the box office on fire .
When Gordon and Dark Horse publisher Mike Richardson began shopping Del Toro ’s first “ Hellboy ” screenplay in 1998 , they met with plenty of resistance .
Why does he have to be red ?
Does he need to have a tail ?
Can we call him something other than Hellboy ?
Although they managed to set up the project at Sony - based Revolution Studios , the project continued to face an uphill battle .
Executives were reluctant to make the film without a star , pushing such actors as Bruce Willis and Vin Diesel on the filmmakers .
With the project stuck in development hell , Del Toro hopped on New Line ’s “ Blade 2 . ”
A week after that action horror movie opened to $ 32.5 million in March 2002 , Revolution greenlighted “ Hellboy . ”
Just more than two years later , “ Hellboy , ” starring Ron Perlman as the demon , hit screens .
It cost around $ 60 million and made around $ 60 million .
Even -steven .
Del Toro wanted to do a sequel but Columbia , which had a say in any follow - up under the terms of Revolution ’s Sony pact , was n’t interested .
So Del Toro busied himself with other projects , flirting with “ Halo ” at Universal and “ Killing on Carnival Row ” at New Line .
Not wanting to give up on “ Hellboy 2 , ” Gordon urged Revolution chief Joe Roth to pry the title out of Columbia ’s hands .
That set in motion a series of moves : Revolution owned the title but had to formally check whether the studio wanted to exercise its right to make a sequel .
Since Columbia was uninterested , Roth asked permission to let Gordon take the project elsewhere .
Columbia , after more meetings , eventually let the title go , thinking that any sequel would only enhance the value of the original “ Hellboy . ”
None of the other studios were quick to bite , though .
“ It was not an immediate battle to get it , ” Del Toro said .
The story would have ended right there and then if it were n’t for one thing : “ Pan ’s Labyrinth . ”
Del Toro ’s passion project began building buzz in mid-2006 , and execs started jockeying for his next project .
And what did he want to do ?
That sequel to “ Hellboy . ”
“ He was so dedicated to making a second movie , ” said a source close to the production .
“ If you wanted to be in business with Guillermo , you had to make that film . ”
Del Toro shrunk the budget to $ 85 million and circulated it again .
This time , Universal -- especially eager to work with international filmmakers -- bit .
The studio struck a first - look deal with Del Toro and the new “ Hellboy ” wound up with a trio of owners : Revolution , which retained a small piece , and Gordon and Universal , which split the rest .
“ We knew we were doing ‘ Hellboy 2 ” after ‘ Pan ’ came out , ” one source close to both movies said .
The sequel set up shop in the Czech Republic last spring and summer , taking advantage of the country ’s film rebate .
Del Toro , in an unusual move , fought hard to shoot everything using only first unit photography .
“ To have the scope we wanted , at 85 ( million dollars ) , was a f--- ing pain in the ass , ” Del Toro said .
“ It meant really brutal hours , six - day weeks on a 130 - day shoot . ”
Del Toro and creator Mignola have an idea for a third movie , but that will depend on several factors , not least of which are box office performance and Del Toro ’s timetable :
The filmmaker is spending the next four to five years working with Peter Jackson on the two “ Hobbit ” movies .
Summing up the experience of making the sequel , Del Toro was his usual charming and blunt self .
“ It was hard as f--- , ” he said .

In 1998 Osama bin Laden complained that Americans have stolen $ 36 trillion from Muslims because they purchased oil from Muslim nations at low prices .
Interestingly , he said that oil should cost $ 144 a barrel , which is just what it costs now .
So what did bin Laden have to do to get the price of oil to increase 13 times in the last 10 years ?
One month after 9/11 , the New York Times wrote about nightmare scenarios that would do this , and one of them included the US attacking Iraq .
Also contributing to the high price of oil is the collapsing of the value of the US dollar , encouraged by the economic policies of the Bush administration .
In testimony to Congress a month ago , the co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security put it this way :
I would like to impress upon this Committee that $ 144 a barrel oil will be perceived as a victory for the Jihadist movement and a reaffirmation that the economic warfare component of its campaign against the West is a resounding success .
There is no need to elaborate on the implications of such a victory in terms of loss of U.S. prestige and our ability to prevail in the Long War of the 21st century .
Or , to put it in far blunter terms , Osama bin Laden can now say “ Mission Accomplished ” .

Dolphins found dead off Cornish coast ' committed suicide ' , wildlife expert claims
A leading scientist has compared the deaths of 26 dolphins in Cornwall to a " mass suicide " - a natural phenomenon found in the species .
Veterinary wildlife pathologist Vic Simpson , who has examined the bodies , says the animals died after they inhaled debris and mud that clogged their insides .
He said the scenes in the River Percuil , where 26 dolphin carcasses were washed up on Monday , looked like " some sort of mass suicide " .
Post mortem : Scientists have so far failed to explain why 26 common dolphins died after beaching themselves
Experts say dolphins have been known to take their own lives whilst living in captivity after becoming distressed and confused at their conditions .
In several cases the creatures repeatedly slammed their head against sides of a pool - or simply stopped coming up for air .
The largest known cases of dolphin suicide was in September and October last year when 152 striped dolphins washed up on the coast of southern Iran .
Locals who battled to save them by taking them back out to sea were distraught when the dolphins refused and persistently re-beached themselves to die .
Grim task :
The recent heatwave caused a massive bloom of algae in shallow waters which attracts bait fish , but the dolphins may have become confused in rivers and shallow estuaries
The best known case of dolphin suicide is that of a dolphin named Cathy , one of the bottle nose dolphins that performed in the television series Flipper .
She is said to have died of self induced asphyxiation in the presence of her trainer Richard O'Barry .
Mr Simpson , who founded the Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre in Truro , is still working at the scene on behalf of the Zoological Society in London .
He said : " On the face of it , it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question is why ?
" The dolphins had swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary .
Their lungs and stomachs were full of it .
That is very bizarre indeed .
" We have seen strandings on beaches , sometimes with five to seven dolphins - but never on a scale like this .
" It could be a bacteria or viral infection that we 're dealing with .
Some algae produce toxins that can prove fatal .
But it is really far too early to say . "
Despite the efforts of marine experts , volunteers , fire crews and coastguards , 26 common dolphins died in the worst incident of its kind in the UK for 30 years .
Tests have so far revealed the mammals were well - fed and that there were no obvious signs of disease or poisoning - causing experts to consider other possibilities .
British Divers Marine Life Rescue ( BDMLR ) said many of the dolphins had no fish in their stomach , which adds weight to the theory that they were panicked by an underwater disturbance .
A common reason for the animals being stranded is when they are chasing fish - but if they were feeding , there would be clear evidence of it , a BDMLR spokesman said .
The Royal Navy has admitted it was carrying out a live exercise in Falmouth Bay prior to the stranding but has denied it would have affected the dolphins because it was a short - range device .
Experts continued to examine the dolphins
An MoD spokesman said : " A survey vessel was conducting trials using a high definition , short - range side scan sonar for sea bed mapping trials approximately 12 nautical miles off the coast of Falmouth at the time of the incident .
" It is considered extremely unlikely that this operation could have affected the mammals in any way . "
Officials also denied reports that the Navy was carrying out gunnery practice at the time of Monday 's mass beaching in the Falmouth Bay area .
Several residents reported hearing loud explosions late on Sunday .
Other theories are that the dolphins died chasing fish or escaping a natural predator , possibly a killer whale .
Possible theory : Killer whales could be to blame for the shocking deaths
In all , more than 100 deep - sea - dwelling common dolphins strayed into Falmouth Bay .
More than 30 became stranded and dozens more became distressed in shallow water , in one of the worst scenes to confront coastguards and animal rescue groups for years .
Although many dolphins were saved , 24 died and two were put down .
Some dolphins did survive on the Percuil river in Cornwall yesterday
The creatures ' innate sense of family could have made the situation worse .
Gill Bell , of the Marine Conservation Society , said : ' If one of them was sick and stranded itself after getting disorientated , they would have gone after it to try to assist . '
Alan Knight , chairman of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue organisation , said : ' We can find no conclusive evidence as to why the stranding took place or why they stranded in such numbers at different locations .
' My personal conclusion is that there was some sort of disturbance that has caused the animals to panic . '

Lenders retreat as housing market plummets
Credit crunch leads to drop in equity lending .
Chronicle Graphic Credit crunch leads to drop in equity lending .
Chronicle Graphic Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Lenders retreat as housing market plummets 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
As the nation 's housing market swoons , lenders are tightening their grip on their money .
Last month , that credit crunch reached Brent Meyers .
To all appearances , he 's an unlikely victim .
A well - paid chief executive of a small consulting firm , he owns a substantial investment portfolio and a million - dollar house in Moraga .
He pays his bills on time and has no credit card debt .
His credit score , he says , is around 800 , a rating more or less in the stratosphere .
But in mid-March , Bank of America cut off his home equity credit line of a little more than $ 180,000 , citing a decline in the value of his property .
Meyers , 40 , is now scrambling to come up with $ 75,000 to pay for a major landscaping project and is canceling other big spending plans .
" My wife would like a new car , but that 's going to have to wait , " he said .
" We 're taking a $ 75,000 cash - flow hit , and I want to boost savings . "
The credit crunch made big news last month when brokerage giant Bear Stearns Cos. was forced to sell itself on the cheap after it was unable to borrow money to cover losses in its portfolio of mortgage securities .
But the chill in the credit markets is not something that 's hitting just big banks and securities firms .
In thousands of ways big and small , across the Bay Area and the nation , lenders are retreating after booking losses in the mortgage market .
Households and businesses are suffering the consequences as money becomes tougher to get and more expensive to borrow .
That in turn spells bad news for the economy .
Credit is the grease that lubricates the economic engine by giving individuals and businesses the means to spend .
Borrowed money pays for everything from new outfits at the clothing store to house purchases and major home improvement projects .
When individuals and entrepreneurs can't get loans at interest rates they can afford , they spend and hire less .
Tight credit ripples through the economy .
The result is a slowdown , and , if severe enough , a contraction of economic activity , in other words , a recession .
Households , which gorged themselves on easy credit for most of the past decade , are bearing the brunt of lender caution .
In a wide variety of consumer loan categories , particularly those backed by real estate , lenders are cutting back on loan amounts , charging higher interest and stiffening qualifications .
Take home equity loans .
In the past decade , borrowing against the value of their homes became the money source of choice for homeowners who wanted large sums to pay for such items as home improvements , college tuition or luxury spending .
By 2004 , Americans were taking out $ 180.5 billion in home equity loans , according to the Federal Reserve .
Much of that cash was pumped right back into the economy , buying cars and furniture , renovated bathrooms and kitchens , airline tickets and hotel rooms .
' Unprecedented ' conditions
But as home prices started to sink , homeowners had less equity to draw on .
Lenders including Bank of America , Washington Mutual and Countrywide Financial cut back on home equity loans to reduce their exposure to the housing market .
" These are unprecedented market conditions , " said Bank of America spokesman Terry Francisco .
By the last three months of 2007 , home equity borrowing dropped to an annual rate of $ 26 billion , the Fed calculates .
And home equity borrowing has undoubtedly fallen further in 2008 .
Cutbacks in home equity loans and other forms of consumer credit are one of the factors behind a stall in retail spending .
Total retail sales fell 0.6 percent in February , according to the U.S. Commerce Department , led by slumping car and truck purchases .
Forecasters predict consumers will barely boost spending above the rate of inflation this year , the worst performance in more than a decade .
Consumer spending represents about 70 percent of all economic activity in the United States .
" For the economy to expand , it will have to come from the other 30 percent , " said Carl Steidtmann , chief economist at the consulting firm Deloitte Research .
Warren Leiber , Brent Meyers ' landscaping contractor , sees the spending slowdown every day .
Leiber Landscape Services , his Walnut Creek business , serves an affluent corridor from Benicia to San Ramon .
A typical job comes in at $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 .
He estimates that 80 percent of his clients used home equity loans or mortgage refinancings to pay for his services .
Now , with that tap choked off , his strapped clients are backing off , knocking $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 off their work orders , if they go ahead at all .
" Things started to really go south back in October , " Leiber said .
" We would get to the point of reviewing proposals , and people would say , ' That 's great .
Looks terrific .
But it 's more than we can spend right now . '
" It was n't like it used to be when people were n't worried .
People just do n't feel wealthy and secure , like they used to . "
Meyers began his landscaping project in January , expecting to draw on his home equity loan to pay Leiber .
When Meyers took out the credit line in November 2006 , his home was valued at $ 1.475 million .
With less than $ 1 million in principal outstanding on his first mortgage , he had a comfortable equity cushion to cover the line .
A few weeks ago , Meyers got a letter from Bank of America informing him that the line had been suspended in its entirety .
When he called to ask why , he was told that his house had dropped to an estimated $ 1.09 million in value , which left insufficient equity to cover the line .
He insists his house has not lost that much value .
He 's asked the bank to reconsider .
His appeal is pending .
For its part , Bank of America is reducing home equity lines for some customers " in areas of the country that are experiencing consistent and significant home value declines , " Francisco said .
The bank is acting when customers " have used home equity lines beyond newly updated home values , " he added .
Deferring expenditures
Meyers is n't exactly a hardship case .
Unlike some who have had their credit cut off , he has other resources to fall back on .
He intends to complete his landscaping project and will sell stock to pay for it .
" If I were n't able to pay cash , I would toss ( Leiber ) and his five - man crew out on the curb , " he said .
Still , losing the credit line is prompting him and his wife , Deborah , to retrench .
" I 'm going to change my spending behavior because I lost access to $ 180,000 , " he said .
" We 're going to be deferring other expenditures to build a pot of money to replace what Bank of America took away . "
For example , the couple had planned to remodel the master bathroom once the landscaping work was finished .
Now that 's out the window .
And any vacation this year for Meyers , his wife and their kids , Julia , 7 , and Justin , 3 , will be within driving distance of the Bay Area to save on airfare .
Economists stress that there are other factors besides tight credit behind the slump in consumer spending .
Ordinary Americans have been slammed by a series of blows to their pocketbooks .
Wages are growing too slowly to keep up with rapidly rising prices , particularly those for necessities such as food and fuel .
Homes and stock portfolios are dropping in value .
Many people feel they 're falling behind .
And they can't borrow easily to fill the gap .
That witch 's brew - stagnant incomes , rising prices , evaporating wealth and reduced access to credit - is fostering a fundamental change in attitude and behavior , economists say .
" We 've seen a significant shift over the last year , " said Richard Curtin , director of the Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers .
" People are more cautionary minded .
They want to increase their reserve funds and decrease the amount of money they spend . "
In essence , the borrow - and - spend game that sustained American households - and boosted economic growth - reached its limit .
By the fourth quarter of 2007 , households devoted a record 14.2 percent of their incomes just to service debt , according to the Federal Reserve .
That " record debt servicing burden ... is affecting people 's ability to feed their families , make their utility bills and to discharge their health and education responsibilities , " Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg wrote in a recent report .
Hence , the newfound reluctance of lenders to lend coincides with growing consumer disinclination to borrow .
" We are seeing signs of a major sea change taking place , " Rosenberg wrote .
" Debt is now being viewed as a four - letter word at best , a ball and chain at worst . "
Watching labor costs closely
Meanwhile , Leiber is starting to worry about his business and his seven full - time employees .
Spring is the busy time in the landscaping business , and Leiber has enough work to keep his crew fully employed .
But he 's nervous about what will happen when the seasonal surge is over .
" I 'm going to be watching our labor costs very closely , " he said .
" If things slow down , the very first thing that will go will be labor costs . "
So far , no clients have shut down a project because they ran out of money .
But there are straws in the wind .
" Some of our clients have not been paying on time , " he said .
" I have quite a few clients who owe me various amounts of money .
There were just a few at first , but it 's growing .
" People have their pride , " he added .
" They wo n't say they 're having a hard time .
That 's started to concern me . "

...... • Philosophy as Creative Repetition •
......... Alain Badiou
I shall begin by referring to one of my masters , the great Marxist philosopher , Louis Althusser .
For Althusser , the birth of Marxism was not a simple thing .
It was composed of two revolutions , two major intellectual events .
First , a scientific one .
This event was Marx 's creation of a science of history , the name of which is " historical materialism " .
The second event was of a philosophical nature .
It was the creation , by Marx and others , of a new trend , the name of which is « dialectical materialism » .
We can say that a new philosophy is required to clarify and assist the birth of a new science .
Plato 's philosophy was likewise required by the beginning of mathematics , or Kant 's philosophy by the Newtonian physics .
There is after all no difficulty in all of this .
In this framework it is possible to say two things about the development of philosophy .
1 . This development was dependent on new facts in some fields which are not immediately of a philosophical nature .
Particularly on facts in the fields of science .
Such as mathematics for Plato , Descartes or Leibniz , physics for Kant , Whitehead or Popper , history for Hegel or Marx , biology for Nietzsche , Bergson or Deleuze .
As far as I am concerned , I quite agree that philosophy depends on some non- philosophical fields .
And I have called these fields the " conditions " of philosophy .
I would simply like to say that I do not limit the conditions of philosophy to the progress of science .
I propose a much larger set of conditions , under four possible types : science , but also , politics , art , an love .
So my own work depends , for instance , on a new mathematical concept of the infinite , but also on new forms of revolutionary politics , on the great poems of Mallarmé , Rimbaud , Pessoa , Mandelstam or Wallace Stevens , on the prose of Samuel Beckett , on the new ways of love which have emerged in the context of psychoanalysis and the complete transformation of all questions concerning sexuation and gender .
It would therefore be possible for me to say that the development of philosophy is the gradual adaptation of philosophy to the change in its conditions .
Then you could say : Philosophy is always behind !
Philosophy is always trying to catch up with non- philosophical novelties !
And I would have to say : correct !
That was in fact Hegel 's conclusion .
Philosophy is the bird of wisdom , and the bird of wisdom is the owl .
But the owl flies off only when the day is over .
Philosophy is the discipline which comes after the day of knowledge , the day of experiences , at the beginning of the night .
And apparently our problem , the problem of the development of philosophy , is solved .
There are two cases .
First case : a new morning of creative experiences in science , politics , art or love is coming .
And we shall have a new evening for philosophy .
Second case : our civilization is exhausted , and the only future we can imagine is a dark one , a future of perpetual dusk .
So the future of philosophy will be its slow death , its slow death in the night .
Philosophy will be reduced to what we can read at the beginning of a beautiful text by Samuel Beckett , Company : " A voice is speaking in the dark . "
A voice without meaning , without destination .
And in fact , from Hegel and Auguste Comte to Nietzsche , Heidegger or Derrida , not to mention Wittgenstein and Carnap , we can find the philosophical idea of a probable death of philosophy , in any case in its classical form , the metaphysical one .
I could stop my lecture here , and say with my hair standing straight up on my head like a singer in the Punk style : no future !
After that we would all drink the alcohol of nihilism .
But there remain some little difficulties .
The first one , which is perhaps too formal , perhaps a sophistry , is that the idea of the end of philosophy has been a typical philosophical idea for a long time .
Moreover , it is often a positive idea .
For Hegel , philosophy is at its end because philosophy can finally understand what an absolute knowledge is .
For Marx , philosophy as an interpretation of the world can be replaced by a concrete transformation of this same world .
For Nietzsche , the negative abstraction of old philosophy has to be destroyed to liberate a true vital affirmation , a big " Yes ! " to all that exists .
And for the analytical current , metaphysical sentences , which are pure nonsense , have to be deconstructed in favor of clear propositions and arguments under the paradigm of modem logic .
In all these cases we see that the great declarations concerning the death of philosophy in general , and of metaphysics in particular , are most probably a rhetorical means of introducing a new way , or a new goal , into philosophy itself .
The best means of saying : I am a new philosopher , is probably to say : philosophy is finished , philosophy is dead .
So I propose to begin something absolutely new .
Not philosophy , but thinking !
Not philosophy , but vital potency !
Not philosophy , but a new rational language !
In fact : not old philosophy , but my own new philosophy .
So there is a possibility that the development of philosophy must always be in the form of resurrection .
The old philosophy , like the old man , is dead , but this death is in fact the birth of the new man , the new philosopher .
But as you know , there is a close relationship between resurrection and immortality , between the greatest change we can imagine , the change from death into life , and the most complete absence of change we can think of , when we are in the joy of salvation .
Maybe the repetition of the theme of the end of metaphysics and the correlative repetitive theme of a new beginning of thinking is the sign of a fundamental immobility of philosophy as such .
Maybe philosophy has to put its continuity , its repetitive nature in the form of the dramatic couple of death and birth .
At this point we can return to the work of Louis Althusser .
Because Althusser , who maintains that philosophy is dependent on science , also maintains something very strange , which is that philosophy has no history at all , that philosophy is always the same thing .
In this case , the problem of the development of philosophy is an easy one : the future of philosophy is its past .
It sounds nearly like a joke to see the great Marxist Althusser as the last defender of the old scholastic conception of a philosophia perennis , of philosophy as pure repetition of the same ; philosophy in the Nietzchean style as an eternal return of the same .
But what is this " same " ?
What is the sameness of the same , which returns in the a-historical destiny of philosophy ?
Behind this question we naturally find an old discussion about the true nature of philosophy .
There are roughly two main tendencies .
For the first one philosophy is essentially a reflexive knowledge .
The knowledge of truth in theoretical fields , the knowledge of values in practical fields .
We have to organize learning and the transmission of knowledge .
And the appropriate form of philosophy is that of a school .
The philosopher is a professor , like Kant , Hegel , Husserl , Heidegger and so many others . , including myself , when you address me under the name of " Professor Badiou " .
The second possibility is that philosophy is not really a knowledge , that it is neither theoretical nor practical .
It lies in the direct transformation of a subject , it is a kind of radical conversion , a complete change of life .
And consequently it is very near religion , but by exclusively rational means ; very near love , but without the violent support of desire ; very near political engagement , but without the constraint of a centralized organization ; very near the potency of artistic creation , but without the physical means of art ; very near scientific knowledge , but without the formalism of mathematics , and without the empirical and technical means of physics .
For this second tendency philosophy is not by necessity a matter of school , learning , transmission and professors .
It is a free address of anybody to everybody .
Like Socrates speaking to young men in the streets of Athens ; like Descartes writing letters to Princess Elizabeth ; like Jean - Jacques Rousseau writing his confessions ; or also the Nietzsche or the novels or Sartre plays ; or like , if you forgive me for a narcissistic touch , my own novels and plays .
The difference is that philosophy is no longer knowledge , or knowledge of knowledge .
It is an action .
One could say that what identifies philosophy is not the rules of a discourse , but the singularity of an act .
It is this act that the enemies of Socrates called : " the corruption of young people " .
And because of that , as you know , Socrates was sentenced to death .
" To corrupt young people " is after all not a bad name for the philosophical act .
If you properly understand " to corrupt " .
Here " to corrupt " means to teach the possibility of refusing any blind submission to established opinions .
To corrupt is to give to young people some means of changing their minds about all social norms ; to corrupt is to substitute discussion and rational criticism for imitation , and even , if the question is a question of principles , to substitute revolt for obedience .
But this revolt is neither spontaneous nor agressive inasmuch as it is a consequence of principles and rational critics .
In the poems of the great trench poet Arthur Rimbaud we find the strange expression : " Logical Revolts " .
That is probably a good definition of the philosophical act .
" Logical Revolts " .
It is not by chance that my friend , the very good philosopher Jacques Rancière created a very important magazine in the seventies , the title of which was precisely : " Logical Revolts " .
But if the very essence of philosophy is an active one , we can have a better understanding of the reason why , for Louis Althusser , there does not exist a real history of philosophy .
In his own work Althusser himself proposes to say that the function of philosophy is to introduce a division into opinions .
And more precisely , into opinions about scientific knowledge , or , more generally , into theoretical activities .
What kind of division ?
Ultimately , the division between materialism and idealism .
And since he was a Marxist , Althusser thought that materialism is the revolutionary framework for theoretical activities , and that idealism is the conservative one .
So his final definition was : philosophy is like a political struggle in the theoretical field itself .
But apart from the Marxist conclusion , we can observe two points :
First .
The philosophical act is always in the form of a decision , a separation , a clear distinction .
Between knowledge and opinion , between correct opinions and false opinions , between truth and falsity , between Good and Evil , between , wisdom and madness , and so on .
Second .
The philosophical act always has a normative dimension .
The division is also a hierarchy .
In the Marxist case materialism is the good term and idealism the bad term .
But more generally , it always appears that the division of concepts or the division of experiences is in fact the act of imposing , perhaps , on young people , a new hierarchy .
And negatively , the result of the act is the reversal of an established order , or of an old hierarchy .
So we have effectively something invariant in philosophy , something like a compulsive repetition , or like the eternal return of the same .
We can summarize this matrix , which is not unrelated to the notorious series of the Matrix movies .
Philosophy is the act of reorganizing all theoretical and practical experiences , by proposing a new great normative division , which reverses an established intellectual order , and promotes new values beyond the common ones .
The form of all this is a more or less free address to everybody , but first and foremost to young people , because a philosopher knows perfectly well that young people have to make decisions about their lives , and that they are often better disposed to accepting the risks of a Logical Revolt .
All this explains why philosophy is in some sense always the same thing .
Naturally , every philosopher thinks that his or her work is completely new .
That 's only human .
And many historians of philosophy have introduced absolute ruptures .
For instance , after Kant , classical metaphysics was said to be impossible .
Or , after Wittgenstein , it was no longer possible to forget that the study of language is the core of philosophy .
So we have a rationalist turn , a critical turn , a linguistic turn ...
But in fact , nothing in philosophy is irreversible .
There is no absolute turn .
Many philosophers can find today , in Plato or in Leibniz , some points which are for them more interesting , more active than similar points in Heidegger or Wittgenstein .
It is because their own matrix is largely identical to that of Plato or Leibniz .
The fact that philosophy is largely a repetition of its act clarifies the immanent affinities between philosophers .
Deleuze with Leibniz and Spinoza ; Sartre with Descartes and Hegel ; Merleau - Ponty with Bergson and Aristotle ; I , myself , with Plato and Hegel ; Slavoj Zizek with Kant and Schelling ...
And maybe , for almost three thousand years , everybody with everybody .
But if the philosophical act is formally the same , and the return of the same , we have to take into account the change of the historical context .
Because the act takes place under some conditions .
When a philosopher proposes a new division and a new hierarchy for the experiences of his time , it is because a new intellectual creation , a new truth , has just appeared .
It is in fact because , in his eyes , we have to assume the consequences of a new event in the real conditions of philosophy .
For example , Plato proposed the division between the sensible and the intelligible under the condition of geometry and of a post - Pythagorean concept of number and measure .
Hegel introduced history and becoming into the Absolute Idea , because of the striking novelty of the French revolution .
Nietzsche developed a dialectical relationship between Greek tragedy and the birth of philosophy in the context of the tumultuous feeling caused by the discovery of Richard Wagner 's musical drama .
And Derrida transformed the classical approach of rigid metaphysical oppositions partly because of the growing and irreducible importance , in our experiences , of their female dimension .
That 's why we can speak finally of a creative repetition .
There is something unchanging in the form of a gesture , a gesture of division .
And there is , with the pressure of some events and their consequences , the necessity for transforming some aspects of the philosophical gesture .
So we have a form , and we have the variable form of the unique form .
That 's why we clearly recognize philosophy and philosophers , despite their enormous differences and despite their violent conflicts .
Kant said that the history of philosophy was a battlefield .
Yes , it is so !
But it is also the repetition of the same battle , on the same field .
Perhaps a musical image may help .
The development of philosophy is in the classical form of theme and variations .
Repetition , the theme , and constant novelty , the variations .
But both theme and variations come after some events in politics , art , science , love , events which provide the necessity for a new variation for the same theme .
So we , philosophers , are working during the night , after the day of real becoming of a new truth .
I am reminded of a beautiful poem of Wallace Stevens , Man carrying thing .
Stevens writes : " We must endure our thoughts all night . "
Alas !
That is the destiny of philosophers and philosophy .
And Stevens continues : " Until the bright obvious stands motionless in cold . "
Yes , we hope , we believe , that one day , the " bright obvious " will " stand motionless " .
The " bright obvious " of the Idea will stand like a fixed star in the sky , " motionless in cold " .
It will be the final stage of philosophy , the absolute Idea , the complete revelation ...
But that will never happen .
On the contrary , when something happens in the day of living truths , we have to repeat the philosophical act , and to create a new variation .
So the future of philosophy is , like its past , a creative repetition .
We must endure our thoughts all night forever .
The philosopher is useful , because he or she has the task of observing the morning of a truth , and of interpreting this new truth over against old opinions .
If « we must endure our thoughts all night » , it is because we must correctly corrupt young people .
When we feel that a truth - event interrupts the continuity of ordinary life , we have to say to others : " Wake up !
The time of new thinking and acting is here ! "
But for that , we ourselves must be awake .
We , philosophers , are not allowed to sleep .
A philosopher is a poor night watchman .

Jun. 28 –China wants to have 100 of Westinghouse Electric Co. ’s nuclear reactors in operation or under construction by 2020 — more than double what was anticipated , according to the company ’s incoming CEO .
Aris Candris , who will lead the Monroeville - based firm beginning Tuesday , said Chinese officials shared those plans with Westinghouse during a mid-May meeting .
“ It is huge , ” Candris said in an interview Thursday with the Tribune - Review .
“ Originally we were thinking somewhere around 40 . ”
“ This is the beginning of the nuclear renaissance , ” he said .
“ Growth is good , but it ’s also a management challenge . ”
He succeeds Steve Tritch , who is retiring after 37 years with the company , the past six as CEO .
Tritch remains chairman of the board of Westinghouse , a global leader in reactor engineering , construction and maintenance .
Westinghouse ’s technology is the basis for nearly half of the world ’s 440 nuclear power plants , including 62 of the 104 in the United States .
Candris , 57 , who joined the company in 1975 and most recently ran the fuel business , takes over as the industry enjoys renewed support and federal subsidies meant to promote a cleaner alternative to coal - burning plants .
Its AP1000 reactor , which can generate enough power to electrify 700,000 homes , is the technology of choice for half of the 30 reactors planned for the United States .
This spring Westinghouse signed deals for four domestic reactors , the first such contracts to be signed in this country in 30 years .
Last year the company beat out French rival Areva to win a $ 5.3 billion contract to build four AP1000s in China .
Although Westinghouse will transfer the technology to Chinese licensees over the next few years , Candris said , it will build several additional plants with partner The Shaw Group , of Baton Rouge , La .
Westinghouse books higher revenue from plants it actually builds , but the licensing strategy frees the company to pursue research and development .
“ There are a number of entities over the years that we have licensed — Areva , Mitsubishi in Japan , Doosan in Korea .
In all cases , those became long - term relationships , with long - term benefits for both , ” Candris said .
Design will begin this year on a 1,700 - megawatt reactor , he said , that could be targeted to energy - hungry China and eventually India .
Plans for domestic reactor construction are moving briskly .
Candris said contracts for two AP1000s each at three Southeastern U.S. utilities will be signed in the next nine months ; the first deal is likely by summer ’s end .
He said he was not worried that soaring costs of steel , copper and cement would hurt his industry , because those costs equally affect construction of other kinds of power plants .
Growth has prompted Westinghouse to hire nearly 3,000 people worldwide over the past three years , he said , and the Monroeville office is at capacity .
About 350 instrumentation and control staffers last month moved to rented space in Cranberry , adjacent to a Westinghouse headquarters under construction .
The 2,000 or so Monroeville staffers are to relocate next June .

Another large factor has been the decline in urban violence .
As the historian Rick Perlstein documents in his terrific new book “ Nixonland , ” America ’s hard right turn really began in 1966 , when the Democrats suffered a severe setback in Congress  and Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California .
The cause of that right turn , as Mr. Perlstein shows , was white fear of urban disorder  and the associated fear that fair housing laws would let dangerous blacks move into white neighborhoods .
“ Law and order ” became the rallying cry of right - wing politicians , above all Richard Nixon , who rode that fear right into the White House .
But during the Clinton years , for reasons nobody fully understands , the wave of urban violence receded , and with it the ability of politicians to exploit Americans ’ fear .
It ’s true that 9/11 gave the fear factor a second wind : Karl Rove accusing liberals of being soft on terrorism sounded just like Spiro Agnew accusing liberals of being soft on crime .
But the G.O.P. ’s credibility as America ’s defender has leaked away into the sands of Iraq .
Let me add one more hypothesis : although everyone makes fun of political correctness , I ’d argue that decades of pressure on public figures and the media have helped drive both overt and strongly implied racism out of our national discourse .
For example , I do n’t think a politician today could get away with running the infamous 1988 Willie Horton ad .
Unfortunately , the campaign against misogyny has n’t been equally successful .
By the way , it was during the heyday of the baby boom generation that crude racism became unacceptable .
Mr. Obama , who has been dismissive of the boomers ’ “ psychodrama , ” might want to give the generation that brought about this change , fought for civil rights and protested the Vietnam War a bit more credit .
Anyway , none of this guarantees an Obama victory in November .
Racial division has lost much of its sting , but not all : you can be sure that we ’ll be hearing a lot more about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and all that .
Moreover , despite Hillary Clinton ’s gracious , eloquent concession speech , some of her supporters may yet refuse to support the Democratic nominee .
But if Mr. Obama does win , it will symbolize the great change that has taken place in America .
Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics  but we ’re now a different , and better , country .
Creationism .
It ’s been finding its way into schools by hiding behind the facade of intelligent design .
We ’ve written about it in the past .
One argument in particular seems to appeal to all the rational , open minded people out there .
The Creationists ask , why ca n’t we tell both sides of the story ?
We can teach the controversy and let people make up their minds for themselves .
This sounds nice and democratic and all but the argument has several fatal flaws :
We do n’t teach Chinese in Spanish class because , although Chinese is great and kids should be able to learn it if they want , Chinese is not Spanish .
Creationism posits that there are supernatural , unexplainable causes for things and that ’s the exact opposite of the scientific method .
There is no controversy to teach .
Among anyone who has actually studied biology or genetics there ’s really no controversy .
The controversy is between virtually all the experts on one side and a very loud group of non experts on the other .
To go back to the Spanish example , would you let someone write the Spanish language text book if they admitted they do n’t speak the language , had never spent any time in a Spanish - speaking country , and they disagreed with what native speakers say is the proper grammar ?
We separate church and state for a reason .
No one ( in the U.S. ) ever talks about teaching Hindu creationism or Navajo creationism in public schools .
Teaching from one religion ’s beliefs and not another ’s in discriminatory .
Other that counting the warm bodies in the pews , how can we judge which mythical creation story is worth teaching and which is n’t ?
Some religions have books older than the Bible .
Creationism is an intellectual dead end .
If the conclusion to every mystery is “ God did it , ” where can we go from there ?
We certainly can’t discover DNA , decode the genome , create new drugs and therapies , use evolutionary techniques to create computer algorithms , fight drug - resistant bacteria , etc .
To beat a dead horse , it ’s like a Spanish class where the teacher answers questions about conjugating verbs in the past tense by saying “ it ’s too hard , it ’s unknowable , you ca n’t learn it unless God reveals it to you . ”
The list goes on .
There ’s one argument I generally do n’t like to make , which is the slippery slope argument – that is , if we allow one thing to happen , that will set society on a slippery slope toward some crazy scenario that no one would be happy with .
I do n’t think creationism in public schools puts us on an inevitable path to the Middle Ages .
But let me ask you this : do you really thing the very religious people leading the intelligent design movement will stop at Creationism ?
Exhibit 1 : Geocentricity .
That ’s right , the old notion that the Earth was at the center of the Solar System / Universe ( the two were conflated together at the time ) .
There are people actively campaigning in favor of geocentrism , even writing books !
Of course to do so , you would have to throw out hundreds of years of observations , experiments , technologies , etc .
I suppose if we ’re already doing that in the case of evolution , maybe it ’s not so bad .
Wow , those Apollo astronauts sure were lucky to get to the moon and back while being so completely wrong about the structure of Universe .
Exhibit 2 : The Earth is Flat .
You do n’t find mainstream churches teaching that the earth is flat but for some Bible inerrantists , it ’s a strongly held belief .
If the Bible is literal and always true , then when it mentions the four corners of the world , it means that the world is flat and square .
I do n’t think I have to even mention the problems with this one .
But hey , teach the controversy , right ?
Exhibit 3 : Faith Healing .
My guess is that the belief that prayer can heal a person from a sickness or injury is even more widespread than belief in creationism .
And in many cases , prayer can be a conduit for things that do have benefits for patients like hope , social support , etc .
I certainly would n’t throw the chapels out of the hospitals if they help people deal with loss .
But , and this is a big issue , there are plenty of people who profess that faith alone can heal , that modern medicine is a sham or unnecessary .
Given the huge gains in life expectancy , recovery from injury and disease , lower infant mortality , etc. , I would hate to live in a world where faith healing is considered worth teaching to potential doctors and scientists in school .
Faith had thousands of years to cure Polio and make breast cancer survivable .
There are more examples we could give .
HIV / AIDS denial in Africa is a particularly nasty one .
I ’d hate to have the creationist misunderstanding of thermodynamics put into textbooks .
If you ’ve run across any you ’d like to share feel free to post in the comments below .
I think the pattern is pretty clear – creationism is a wedge into public schools and public discourse .
And they ’re not going to stop there .

Rawstory — Republican presidential candidate John McCain was asked Thursday his opinion of an attempt to impeach President Bush .
His answer should n’t surprise anyone .
If nothing else , the fact that a question was even asked shows that McCain ’s campaign does n’t do as rigorous a job as President Bush ’s handlers do in weeding out unfriendly questioners from town hall meetings .
“ I appreciate this opportunity , Mr. McCain , to ask you a question , ” said a man attending the town hall meeting at Xavier University in Ohio .
“ Part one is in regards to the articles of impeachment brought up by Kucinich for Bush .
What your stance is on that as far as manipulated intelligence to form the policy .
And then the second is Professor Gatsby from Arizona was outside your office for sixteen days and did n’t eat solid foods .
I was wondering if you agreed to meet with him for the two hours he requested or does he have to be a corporate owner with multi-million dollars to meet with you . ”
The Republican senator laughed .
“ I do not agree with quote ‘ articles of impeachment , ' ” McCain said , in reference to a resolution introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .

How Old Is The Internet ?
The early Internet was born in 1968 out of NASA and Stanford 's ARPAnet .
However , the Internet did n't reach the general public until the late 1980s with public services like Prodigy and CompuServe .
Tim Berners - Lee created the World Wide Web in 1993 .
Barton first defines the genre , insofar as one is able to do so , explaining that a CRPG generally includes elements such as : a system of statistics to track characters ( ability scores and skills ) ; the ability to advance characters via experience points ; and randomized combat .
Barton further attempts to define the genre by comparing CRPGs to what they are not , including JRPGs ( Final Fantasy ) , MMORPGs ( World of Warcraft ) , Adventure Games ( Zork ) , and Strategy Games ( Warcraft ) .
A bit later , he explores the origins of the CRPG , listing Baseball Simulation Games ( such as Strat - O - Matic ) , Tabletop wargames ( Chainmail ) , Tolkien , Colossal Cave Adventure , and ( of course ) Dungeons & Dragons as having had an impact on the creation and evolution of the genre .
The next nine chapters of the book are devoted to the history of the CRPG , which Barton breaks down into six phases , somewhat akin to Hesiod 's Five Ages .
The Dark Age covers the period of time from 1974 through the end of the decade , and includes PLATO and Mainframe games such as pedit , Dungeon , dnd and DND ( not to be confused with each other , or with D&D or D&D ) , Oubliette , Moria , Avatar and Orthanc .
Also included here , somewhat out of chronological order , are a discussion of Rogue and Rougelikes ( Hack , Moria and Angband ) and MUDs all the way through to 1989's TinyMUD .
The Bronze Age of the CRPG begins in 1979 with the publication of Lord British 's Akalabeth : World of Doom ( which would go on to sell thousands of copies , making it the first commercially successful CRPG , if not exactly the first ) and includes a host of obscure titles , including Wizards Castle , Eamon , Space and Empire , The Tarturian , Odyssey : The Complete Apventure , and Dunjonquest : Temple of Apshai .
In 1983 , Bronze turns to Silver with the appearance of the Ultima and WIzardry trilogies , games which truly began to lay the groundwork for all that came after .
Also mentioned in this chapter are less well - known games such as Sword of Fargoal , Dungeons of Daggorath , Tunnels of Doom , Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves , and Universe .
The Golden Age dawns in 1985 , bringing with it the refinement of prior ideas and the perfection of the genre 's underlying systems .
Barton divides coverage of this age into three chapters .
The first covers the Early Golden Age , beginning with the console crash of 1983 and ending with the arrival of the NES in 1985 .
The CRPG market survived the crash rather unscathed , and in fact flourished thanks to games such as Phantasie , The Wizard 's Crown , Ultima IV , and Autoduel .
Most notable of all , of course , was 1985 's The Bard 's Tale , which spawned two sequels ( three , if you count 2004's " spiritual sequel " starring Carey Elwes ) , both of which also receive some attention here .
It is here where the book 's structure begins to drift a bit .
By Barton 's own admission , progress in the CRPG industry is " neither linear nor orderly , " and in fact the attempt to align CRPG titles , trilogies and series along a single timeline almost necessarily breaks down .
The Bard's
Tale trilogy seems as if it would more properly be discussed in the next chapter ( The Golden Age Part I ) .
Instead , Barton calls it " The Dawn of the Golden Age " and places it about a third of the way into the " Early Golden Age " chapter , where it somewhat loses some of its impact .
Further confusion surrounds the inclusion here of Might and Magic Book I : Secrets of the Inner Sanctum ; published in 1986 , it is not only followed by a discussion of Alternate Reality : The City ( published in 1985 ) , but is preceded by a lengthy discussion of several games which came after it , including The Magic Candle ( 1989 ) and Bloodstone ( 1993 ) .
While the author has thematic reasons for covering these games here , one wonders if a strict chronological order would have served better .
Even Barton seems a bit off track when he invites the reader to " turn to the second half of the Golden Age , " which runs from 1987 to 1993 ( for those not keeping track , the first " half " only ran from 1983 to 1985 ) .
I do n't mean to nitpick over throwaway segue lines , but in a book with a historical focus , the time - shifting is just a bit disconcerting .
Regardless , " The Golden Age Part I " covers the period of time that many consider to be the era of the CRPG , when companies like SSI , Origin , Interplay , and New World Computing dominated not just the CRPG industry , but the computer game industry as a whole .
Ample coverage is justifiably given to SSI 's Gold Box games , including Pool of Radiance , Curse of the Azure Bonds , Secret of the Silver Blades , and Pools of Darkness .
Somewhat curious ( to me ) is the omission here of any discussion of AD&D Second Edition , which was released in 1989 and officially introduced the concept of THAC0 ( which appeared in Pool of Radiance ) .
Other titles covered in this lengthy chapter include : SSI 's Krynn trilogy and Savage Frontier games ; the original Neverwinter Nights on AOL ; Ultima V , VI and VII ; Wizardry VI and VII ; Might and Magic II , III and so on ; Neuromancer ; and Interplay 's Wasteland .
The next chapter , " The Golden Age Part II , " is devoted to JRPGs and groundbreaking CRPGs with real - time 3d graphics that appeared alongside the aforementioned CRPGs .
Covered here in the JRPG category are games such as : The Legend of Zelda and its sequels ; The Dragon Warrior series ; Final Fantasy ; Chrono Trigger ; Super Mario RPG ; and the Phantasy Star series .
The chapter also covers Sierra On - Line 's Quest for Glory series ; the SSI Black Box games ( including Eye of the Beholder ) ; Dungeon Master ( " the most successful Atari ST game ever released " ) and its many clones ; and other notable genre - bending games including Beyond Zork and Star Saga .
Here again , we fall into a small hole in the timeline , for The Golden Age ends in 1993 and the next age does n't begin until 1996 .
The chapter covering this black hole is called " The Bigger They Come , " as if suggesting that Barton was unwilling to give a name to this second Dark Age of CRPGs .
Here we see coverage of a variety of bad CRPGs , including Interplay 's Descent to Undermountain , Ultima VIII and IX , and the Gothic series ( which surely deserves more than the two paragraphs it gets ) .
Covered in more depth is SSI 's fall from grace following the publication of an assortment of sub - par D&D titles ( including Spelljammer , Dark Sun , Al Qadim , and others ) and the ensuing loss of their license with TSR .
Some attention might have been paid to the " fall from grace " of TSR itself , which suffered financial ruin in the years that followed and was ultimately purchased by WOTC in 1997 .
Ever the optimist , Barton instead moves rapidly into The Platinum Age , which covers the period of time from 1996 to 2001 and includes " the best CRPGs ever made . "
Covered here in some depth are games such as Planescape : Torment , Icewind Dale and its sequel , Dungeon Siege , Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss , Might and Magic : The Mandate of Heaven , Dungeon Keeper , Arx Fatalis , Bethesda 's Elder Scrolls series , Interplay 's Fallout and Fallout 2 , and Troika 's Arcanum .
The bulk of the chapter , however , is devoted to two games and their sequels : Blizzard 's Diablo and Diablo II , which the author treats with noteworthy disdain , and Bioware 's Baldur 's Gate and its sequel , which Barton believes is " the best CRPG ever made .
" While both games receive more or less equal time , it is a bit hard to swallow Barton 's dislike for Diablo in the context of a historical overview ; nowhere else does he editorialize quite so much , or so vividly .
While at first he simply declares that Diablo 's consideration as a CRPG " remains a divisive subject , " he quickly moves on to less thinly - veiled potshots .
At one point , he refers to " hordes of badly behaved teenagers ( and middle - aged men , no doubt ) scampering to Battle.net , ' pwning ' each other and seeking out the latest cheats and hacks to gain an unfair advantage . "
Later , Barton expresses a " pang of regret over the overwhelming triumph of ( the Diablo ) series , since it seems to have come at the expense of the older , more sophisticated CRPGs of past eras . "
He insists that Baldur 's Gate " offers much more strategy than Diablo , " and argues that Baldur 's Gate 's multiplayer " helped the game compete against Diablo , whose Battle .
net servers had become a swirling vortex for Daddy 's money . "
I do n't even know what that means — how can a free service be a vortex for money ?
The entire argument smacks of something one might find in a Penny Arcade comic strip , such as this one or this one .
At the end of the book , Barton goes so far as to predict that " the real - time Diablo and Morrowind - style CRPGs that were so popular throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s seem fated to extinction , usurped by World of Warcraft and other MMORPGs . "
In the wake of all the buzz surrounding Diablo III 's announcement in recent days , this prediction seems slightly premature .
Barton ends the book with a discussion of the Modern Age , " which we are in today . "
The chapter covers Neverwinter Nights and its sequel , as well as Vampire : The Masquerade and Bloodlines , and Knights of the old Republic and its sequel .
After a mention of Fable , Oblivion , more Final Fantasies and Zeldas , and a discussion of why console - based CRPGs seem to be winning out , Barton closes out the book with a look at MMORPGS , from Meridian 59 through WOW and DDO ( and every major title in between ) .
He notes ( quite properly , in my opinion ) that an MMO like WOW has trouble handling a central story and plot as adeptly as a CRPG can , and points out several " emerging trends " concerning CRPGs , including the rise of online gaming , the tendency to announce the death of the standalone , single - player CRPG and — just because we can never have too many digs at Diablo — a mention of the increasing emphasis on action over strategy .
" Whereas Ultima Online stressed role - playing , Diablo emphasized roll - playing , " says Barton .
Of course , it is Barton 's voice which makes the book entertaining ; this is no dry history , but the enlightened point of view of a student of CRPGs , shared with the reader in a casual , accessible manner ; in many ways , it is a bold manifesto in their defense .
Says Barton : " CRPGs are not only the most fun and addictive type of computer game , but possibly the best learning tool ever designed . "
You may disagree with that , but you can never dispute the author 's own dedication to that belief .
Despite the book 's somewhat questionable chronological structuring ( or , more correctly , its occasional deviations from that structure ) , the only major flaw worth noting is that the accompanying artwork is , to put it mildly , hideous .
The original full - color screenshots look wonderful in Barton 's Gamasutra column , but in the book they are mostly reprinted in muddy , blotchy black and white , making it impossible to determine what they depict even with the help of accompanying captions .
The book does contain a color insert after page 208 , but this 4 - page , 8 - picture centerpiece is at best forgettable — I flipped past it entirely while reading , and found that upon further review I had n't missed anything by skipping over it .
Dungeons and Desktops is a mixed bag , somewhat akin to a sack full of Halloween candy .
There are some genuinely good pieces of sweetness in there , as well as a great deal of hidden , forgotten gems and some bits you never knew existed .
Despite a bit of a jumble towards the middle , taken as a whole the book is well worth picking up if you 're a fan of CRPGs or fantasy games in general .
Less die - hard fans might find themselves preferring to stick to Barton 's Gamasutra columns , and Diablo fans might find themselves gritting their teeth at some points , but then every bag of candy 's got a few pieces of black licorice in it , no ?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will step in if necessary to make sure the presidential nomination fight between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama does not reach the Democratic National Convention - though she believes it could be resolved as early as next week .
Pelosi predicted Wednesday that a presidential nominee will emerge in the week after the final Democratic primaries on June 3 , but she said " I will step in " if there is no resolution by late June regarding the seating of delegates from Florida and Michigan , the two states that defied party rules by holding early primaries .
" Because we cannot take this fight to the convention , " she said .
" It must be over before then . "
Pelosi made the comments during a wide - ranging hourlong session with The Chronicle 's editorial board .
She talked about the prospects for the election of a Democratic president this fall , the legacy of President Bush and the California Supreme Court 's ruling legalizing same - sex marriage .
The speaker talked in depth about the party 's dilemma as its primary process comes to a close after Sunday 's Puerto Rico primary , in which 55 delegates are at stake , and Tuesday 's South Dakota and Montana primaries , in which 33 total delegates are up for grabs .
Obama , according to the Associated Press , is within 45 delegates of winning the nomination , a number he could reach by Tuesday .
Pelosi said she is confident the Democratic National Committee 's rules committee , which meets in Washington on Saturday , will resolve the issue of Florida and Michigan .
Magic number
" For now , 2,026 is the magic number " of pledged and unpledged delegates needed by a candidate to win the party 's presidential nomination , she said , but " if they decide to seat ( Florida and Michigan ) this weekend , there will be a new magic number . "
While saying she believes those two states ' delegates should be seated , Pelosi added that it must happen '' in a way that is not destructive to any sense of order in the party . "
" If you have no order and no discipline in terms of party rules , people will be having their primary in the year before the presidential election , " she said .
" So there has to be some penalty . "
She said the party committee will come up with a formula that is " fair and accepted by both campaigns , " perhaps allowing the states 50 percent of their delegates .
But " if the resolution is not appropriate , then it remains for the ( Democratic National Convention ) credentials committee to resolve it , " she said .
Then , " it will have to happen by the end of June " or she will intervene , she said .
The Democrats hold their convention in late August in Denver .
Pelosi said she has not been in contact with the Clinton or Obama campaigns on the matter because " I think it is all going in the right direction " and will be resolved " in an orderly fashion " as early as next week .
' Positive experience '
Despite the prolonged and often divisive primary process , Pelosi said it has been " a very positive experience " for the Democratic Party because of " millions of people who are attracted to this campaign , ...
Hillary and her message , and the same thing for Barack Obama and his appeal . "
" We will benefit from it in November , " she said , predicting the party will be unified behind its standard bearer , whether it is Obama or Clinton .
" People are already saying to me : I 'll be ready - as soon as we have a nominee - to come around . "
" ( They ) know at the end of the day we cannot have a Republican president , four more years of George Bush , tax cuts for the wealthy , a war without end - the list goes on and on , " she said .
Pelosi , the nation 's first female speaker of the House , said she is keenly aware of efforts , reported in The Chronicle this week , of the San Francisco political action committee , WomenCount , which is running full - page newspaper ads headlined " Not So Fast ! " - warning against what it calls premature efforts to push Clinton from the race and crown Obama the party 's nominee .
Susie Tompkins Buell , a longtime Clinton friend and one of the effort 's organizers , said Wednesday the committee has raised $ 400,000 in the past 10 days from women across the country determined to make the case for Clinton all the way to the convention .
" God bless their enthusiasm , " said Pelosi of the effort .
" These women are fabulous , and I know many of them very well . "
But , she said , while " we all want to see a woman president ... they want me to be the chair of the convention , who is neutral .
And yet they want me to be for Hillary Clinton . "
But the speaker said that activist women who make up Clinton 's supporters , blue - collar voters and Obama backers will come together when they realize they " have the most to lose by a Democratic defeat . "
And she said voters , too , will be energized by the party 's " progressive economic agenda to grow our economy , for real initiatives on health care , " education , infrastructure , housing and other key " kitchen - table issues . "
" We just won three special ( House ) elections that the GOP never thought they would lose in a million years , " Pelosi said , referring to recent congressional races in Illinois , Mississippi and Louisiana .
" ( Republicans ) tried to make it about me and San Francisco values .
They do n't have a message , " she said .
" It 's going to be a very bad year for Republicans . "
Assad said he would hold talks with Iran on its nuclear programme Syrian President Bashar al - Assad has said that a military attack on Iran over its nuclear programme would cost the world dearly .
Speaking to French radio , Mr Assad said the United States and Israel in particular would pay the price of such an attack .
He said its consequences could last for years or even decades .
Iran denies it is building a nuclear weapon , but is defying UN demands that it halt uranium enrichment .
Speculation of a strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities has increased following a report that Israel staged an air exercise which was designed as a rehearsal for such an attack .
[ An attack on Iran ] will cost the United States and the planet dear .
Israel will pay directly the price of this war
Bashar al - Assad
Last week Iran tested missiles capable , it said , of hitting Israel .
" It will cost the United States and the planet dear , " Mr Assad told France Inter radio .
" Israel will pay directly the price of this war .
Iran has said so .
The problem is not the action and reaction .
The problem is that when one starts such action in the Middle East , one cannot manage the reactions that can spread out over years or even decades . "
Talks with Iran The Syrian president , who is in Paris for an EU - Mediterranean summit , added that the US administration did not appear to share his fear of the disastrous consequences of an attack .
" This administration is an administration whose doctrine is a warmonger 's doctrine .
It does not reason with our logic , ours and that of most European countries , most countries in the world , " Assad said .
Mr Assad said that , following a request from France , Syria would hold talks with Iran to try and resolve the crisis over its nuclear programme .
" We are going to have discussions with our Iranian friends to get to the heart of the matter , to the details .
This is the first time that we had been asked to play a role . "

When I smoked close to 40 a day , I used to avoid watching or reading anything to do with the tobacco industry , because I knew it would turn my stomach despite being “ powerless ” to quit buying their product .
The sage advice of my soul - mate to simply stop buying them , probably saved my life .
Duncan Bannatyne also quit by simply not buying them anymore .

Audrina Patridge and Lauren Conrad : What Fight ?
Just one day after reports of an ugly spat between The Hills stars and BFFsand , the two were spotted holding hands as they headed to the Crown Bar in West Hollywood Wednesday evening .
The tension started when Conrad came home to find Patridge in the middle of a photo shoot with OK !
magazine .
" She was very , very , very mad , " explains Audrina in the interview .
" She said it ’s her house .
But this is my room .
I said , ' We ’re not taking pictures of your house — do n’t be rude . '
It just adds to the tension .
Now she thinks I ’m sneaky and shady for doing this photo shoot , yet she and her team knew about it .
She wo n’t let it go . "
If the photos below are any indication , and not just a publicity stunt , the two have apparently buried the hatchet .

We read ( and write here ) a lot about gender issues in the scientific arena but usually topics are related to science education and promoting greater equality of numbers at the higher levels .
There are a number of studies detailing the issues women face in a predominantly male science world but a University of Missouri religion professor has found that if the researcher is a male fieldworker studying women , the situation can be just as challenging .
His conclusions about male researchers studying female subjects are based on his extensive observations of the Diola ( pronounced joe - la ) people .
Robert M. Baum , professor of religious studies in the College of Arts and Science has been traveling to southwestern Senegal on the African continent and conducting field research among the Diola communities , approximately 600,000 people , for more than 30 years .
The modern Diola are primarily rice farmers .
Initially , Baum 's work focused on pre-colonial Diola religious history during the era of the Atlantic slave trade , a period when there were male prophets .
Later in his research , Baum studied the work and influence of Diola female prophets who began appearing after the French and Portuguese conquest of Diola lands in the late 1800s .
" The question of whether men can conduct field research on women ultimately will be determined by the quality and type of the data that they gather , " said Baum .
" The subject matter of the field research will profoundly shape the possibilities of success .
For example , access to women 's ritual spaces and esoteric knowledge may be too restricted for male researchers .
Research on female religious leaders whose teachings are designed for both men and women and who preside over mixed congregations will be far more fruitful for men to conduct . "
As he spent time in the Diola culture and grew older , Baum increasingly was given access to male religious elders and their shrines .
Despite his improving social status , he found it was more difficult to study the rites and sacred places of women .
" My participation in the initiation of a new rain priest in January 1975 , and my decision to perform a sacred dance with other men in the community , marked a decisive turning point in my fieldwork , " Baum said .
" This did not , however , provide a similar opening at the various women 's shrines . "
Baum said the most difficult topic to interview the women about was the primary women 's fertility shrine , Ehugna , which was only accessible to women who had given birth .
The most powerful female religious leader refused to be interviewed about anything related to her shrine .
" She told me that the day I give birth to a child , I should come to her and she would explain everything about Ehugna , " Baum said .
" That night , I dreamed I was pregnant .
I told her about the dream ; she laughed and said it was not good enough . "
Baum was able to collect information for his study of the Diola through a gradually widening network of women .
This information was restricted , however , because they taught him only what was permissible for men to know .
" There are limits to this knowledge , " Baum said .
" I could not attend the women 's fertility shrine , which is the focal point of women 's ritual lives .
If I had gone to the maternity house , which is where young women receive their final instruction on what it means to be a woman in Diola society , I would have been ostracized from the men's shrines and societies .
Many Diola consider men visiting the maternity house a serious violation that could result in death . "
When granted the rare interview with a Diola prophetess , Baum was not permitted to take notes or use a recording device , but he had to rely on memory to recall the often hours - long sessions .
The prophetess would speak freely of rain shrines and community oriented teachings , but was not willing to comment on her sacred work associated with Ehugna — no men allowed .
Baum 's study , From a Boy Not Seeking a Wife to a Man Discussing Prophetic Women , A Male Fieldworker Among Diola Women in Senegal 1974-2005 , was recently published in the journal Men and Masculinities .

the bandwidth capacity of a lorry full of backup tapes ( , Fri 18 Jul 2008 , 1:30 , archived ) ( , Fri 18 Jul 2008 , 1:30 ,
I reckon a truck full of DAT tapes could hold about 156 petabytes .
Hella bad latency though .
I guess the actual bandwidth depends on how many trucks can arrive per second .
If they arrive at the rate of one per hour , the bandwidth of a big truck is 347 Terabits per second , or 347,000,000 Mbit/s .
Downloading all the data in the world this way ( or at least all the data in the world in 2006 , according to the New York Times ) would take a month and a half .

He ’s a criminal , but he “ did the right thing ” when it mattered – alerting cops to what he feared was a terror plot the day before the Fourth of July .
At about 5 p.m. yesterday , an unidentified thief with a police record broke into a red van that had been parked at 53rd Street and Second Avenue in Brooklyn ’s Sunset Park for about a month , a source told The Post .
He was stunned when he looked inside – it was filled with gas cans and Styrofoam cups containing a mysterious white substance with protruding wires and switches .
The street is lined with brownstones , and there ’s a ballet studio and a small Muslim school .
So he drove the van 15 blocks to 37th Street and parked it at a desolate waterfront location behind the Costco store and next to some little - used piers .
Then he got out and called a cop he knows from his run-ins with the law .
“ He did the right thing , ” a high - ranking officer said .
“ And he possibly saved a lot of people ’s lives . ”
Another source said cops are unlikely to file charges for the break - in .
The van had Delaware plates that had been issued to another vehicle .
It ’s not clear when its cargo was put inside .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly joined cops from the Bomb Squad and the anti-terror task force at the scene .
Cops shut down three blocks .

The other night I was being interviewed on WGN in Chicago and the one and only topic of conversation was The Dark Knight .
We were basically talking about how great the movie is , how Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar nomination and all that jazz … when the host suddenly said : “ You know , our station Film Critic said the only thing that was really horribly about The Dark Knight was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent ” .
To which I replied : “ Then your station critic is an idiot ” .
Now , I said that sort of as a joke because obviously all film is subjective and I later felt bad because as the conversation went on I forgot to say I was kidding about him being an idiot .
But that ’s not what this post is about .
What that interview highlighted for me was that in the midst of all the praise we seem to be giving The Dark Knight , in the craze of talking about how much Ledger deserves that Oscar nomination , how good the story was yadda yadda yadda … we all ( myself being quite guilty of this too ) have seemed to over look the person I would say was actually the soul of The Dark Knight … Aaron Eckhart .
So right now I ’d like to propose to you 3 reasons why I believe Aaron Eckhart was indeed the soul of The Dark Knight :
# 1 – He Was The Embodiment Of The Hope Of Gotham
Now do n’t misunderstand that statement .
The highlight of the movie was Ledger , the driving force was Bale … but in the midst of this battle of two conflicting world views of the Joker and Batman , Harvey Dent ’s character was the one who embodied and represented US .
He was the manifested spirit of Gotham ’s hope and of what the city COULD be .
In essence he was the tangible realization of Batman ’s dream .
Do you realize how easily other actors could have made the character slip into some cheesy boy scout wannabe ?
# 2 – He Grounded The Film
No one will agree with this at first , but think about it for a moment .
If you remove Harvey Dent and the way Eckhart played him to perfection , The Dark Knight would basically devolve back to simple ( although still really intense ) comic book movie .
It would have just been good vs bad .
Batman vs Joker .
But Eckhart brought an extra dimension .
He really was Nolan ’s secret ingredient that changed the flavor of the whole soup .
He takes the film to another level by making The Dark Knight about he people of Gotham as well as the titans ( Joker and Batman ) of Gotham .
# 3 – The Relatable And Fallible Hero
One of the things that takes the edge off of many movie heroes is the perceived infallibility of the heroes .
Heck , despite some self doubts , even Batman comes off that way most of the time .
Unbeatable , incorruptible , unwavering .
Perhaps those qualities are important for the character and they have to be that way , but it still leaves him being unidentifiable for most of us .
Harvey Dent is a different character .
Completely steadfast in his ideals and beliefs , but when faced with the madness the Joker brings , or with the life of his true love being threatened , he shows that he ’s only too human , that he has weaknesses , that he ’s fallible .
I do n’t think most of us realize how nearly impossible pulling that sort of diversity off can be for an actor in the midst of a movie like The Dark Knight .
Eckhart pulled off both aspects so well , that Dent become our identifiable point in the movie .
He become our anchor .
I ca n’t say enough good things about the job Aaron Eckhart does in The Dark Knight .
I ’d go so far as to say that he nearly does just as well as Ledger does as the Joker ( it ’s just that the Joker is a far more charismatic and extreme character and thus much more noticeable ) .
The fact that Eckhart just blends into the story instead of standing on top of it is a testament to the job he did as an actor .
So for the next couple of years we ’ll all talk about how great Ledger was ( and rightfully so ) , and we ’ll talk about how Bale is the best Batman ever ( and rightfully so ) , but let ’s not forget the job done by Aaron Eckhart , who by his performance gave this great movie it ’s very soul .

Ashcroft booed for Obama - Osama gaffe

Former Attorney General John Ashcroft drew the ire of students at liberal Skidmore College this week when he confused the name of Barack Obama with that of Osama bin Laden .
" All I 'm saying about the Patriot Act , " Ashcroft began , " is that the elected representatives of this country , including Osama ... "
His words were met with a roar of disbelief and disapproval , as he continued stammering , " uh ... you know ... not ... Obama . "
Ashcroft attempted to say " I 'm sorry " but was drowned out by prolonged boos .
" I did not mean to ... I 'm sorry about that ...
I apologize publicly , " Ashcroft went on as the boos gradually subsided .
Ashcroft 's appearance at the highly liberal college , which was arranged by a small group of conservative students , had proved highly controversial even before his arrival .
Liberal blogs have been particularly skeptical of Ashcroft 's characterization of his mistake as accidental .
One suggested , " Hint to reporters : it 's not an accident , it 's a strategy . "
Another explained , " This is a purposeful mistake being done by conservatives to subliminally make the connections with not only the terrorist but with the notion that Obama is somehow ' foreign ' . "

This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , by U.S. Marines , of Hashim Awad , a 54 - year - old disabled Iraqi male national .
In the early morning hours of April 26 , 2006 , Marines arrived at Awad 's home , pulled him from his home , shot him by the side of the road , planted an AK - 47 and shovel on him next to a partially dug hole to make it appear as though he was an insurgent caught burying an Improvised Explosive Devise , and then left .
The Marines initially tried to cover up the incident .
However , after an investigation the story was revealed .
At a series General Courts Martial the following convictions were returned : one Marine was found guilty of Conspiracy to Commit Kidnapping and Kidnapping ; three Marines were found guilty of Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice and Assault ; one Marine was convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap and Murder to include Willfully and Wrongfully Seize and Carry Away Awad Against his Will ; one Marine was convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap , Larceny , and Housebreaking ; and one Marine was convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap , False Official Statement , Premeditated Murder , and Larceny .

19101 - 19173 Navy 4 - Jan -06 Forward Operating Base Camp Korean Village , Iraq " [ REDACTED ] remember when he was struggling on the floor he had a sick white color to his skin .
I also remember we had our interpreter [ REDACTED ] try to [ REDACTED ] talk to him because Abbas [ sic ] was jabbering while kneeling in the front room . "
-- U.S. Marine describing taking Adnan Eid Abbass into custody less than an hour before he was found dead in the back of the military truck he was transported in to Camp Korean Village Army Base in Iraq .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death in U.S. custody of Adnan Eid Abbass , an approximately 50 - year - old Iraqi male national .
Marines were conducting nighttime raids in the early morning hours of January 4 , 2006 .
The last home they went to was Abbass ' located in Ar Rutbah , Iraq .
Upon entering the home the Marines separated the military - aged - men from the woman and children .
According to several Marine statements Abbass was uncooperative and force was used to subdue him .
One Marine noted that Abbass was " struggling on the floor [ and ] he had a sick white color to his skin . "
According to a translator Abbass was upset that his home was being raided and was yelling that there were no insurgents in his home .
Abbass , along with two other detainees , was taken from the home and placed in the cargo area of a Highly Mobile Multi-Wheeled Vehicle ( HMMWV ) .
The Marines then made their way toward Forward Operating Base Camp Korean Village , Iraq .
The ride from Abbass 's home to the base was from 2:05 am to 3:30 am .
The weather outside was cold - it was between 32 F and 55 F .
According to Marine statements Abbass and the other detainees had blankets placed over them in the HMMWV .
The Marine gunners sat in sleeping bags .
Upon arrival at Camp Korean Village it was discovered that Abbass was dead .
After interviewing the Marines and others involved , and conducting an autopsy , NCIS determined that the cause of Abbass 's death was from Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease complicated by Hypothermia and that the manner of death was accidental .
The investigation was closed .

19174-19198 Navy October 28 through 30 , 2005 Nori Ismail Rowais Farm , Zaidon , Al Anbar Province , Iraq " The following Thursday , [ REDACTED ] of the victim , came to the FLT [ Fallujah Liaison Team ] and did not have his lawyer with him .
[ REDACTED ] was angry and his eyes were red .
He remained angry as he told the story , but calmed down once he was paid [ REDACTED ] .
He was upset that [ REDACTED ] had many children and he did not know how they were going to be fed .
Once he was paid , he was not angry at all and he shook my hand and kissed me . " -- Interpreter for U.S. Marines describing paying a claim to the family member of Kahar Fuzah Awad .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , allegedly by U.S. Marines , of Kahar Fuzah Awad , an Iraqi male national .
At approximately 5 pm on or about October 28 through 30 , 2005 , it is alleged that American military members entered Awad 's home , instructed other members of the family to wait outside the home , and then left the home 30 to 60 minutes later .
Allegedly screams and prayers in Arabic were heard coming from the home .
Upon reentering their home Awad 's family members found Awad dead ; his throat was slit and his legs were bound together with an extension cord .
Awad 's body was taken to a local Mosque where he was buried .
U.S. forces became aware of the incident because in March 2006 a lawyer for one of the family members went to the Fallujah Liaison Team with a claims card ( claims cards are given to families of civilians that may have suffered death to a person or damage to property by U.S. forces ) .
This claims card was given to the Awad family by a Staff Judge Advocate .
Apparently a Staff Judge Advocate was in the vicinity of Awad 's home on February 10 , 2006 , investigating another unrelated incident , when family members told the JAG about the Awad death .
The JAG gave the Awad family a claims card .
This claims card along with an alleged picture of Awad with his throat cut was presented to the Foreign Claims Commission at Fallujah .
The claims personnel advised the lawyer that a family member should come in to discuss the incident .
A family member came the following week without the lawyer .
The claim was paid .
The photograph was forwarded to the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner where the examiner indicated that the wound was most consistent with a cutting of the neck and inconsistent with a gunshot wound , but that an autopsy would have to be performed to make a definitive determination .
Attempts to reach the family through the phone number the lawyer provided were unsuccessful .
NCIS determined that the area of Iraq - Zaidon , Al Anbar -- was too dangerous to send an investigative team to .

19199 -19266 Navy 3/15/2005 Between Camp Al Taqaddum and Baghdad International Airport in Iraq " Dear Sir , It has been reported to the Embassy that one of your employee Mr. Sajjad Bashir son of [ REDACTED ] who went to Iraq is missing in that country .
It has also been reported to the Embassy that he died on 15 March , 2005 in a road accident .
His relatives are extremely worried and have requested the Embassy to interview . " -- Letter from Embassy of Kuwait to war contractor Quality Light & Heavy Equipment Co. regarding the death of Saddad Bashir Hussain .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , by a U.S. Marine , of Sajjad Bashir Hussain , a contractor for Quality Light & Heavy Equipment Co. W.L.L. ( a Kuwaiti military contract company ) .
Hussain was a Pakistani male national and a Kuwaiti resident .
On the evening of March 15 , 2005 , Hussain was part of a Marine convoy .
The convoy was composed of approximately four Marine HUMVEEs and approximately 30 contractor vehicles that the Marines were accompanying from Camp Al Taqaddum to Baghdad International Airport .
All the contractor vehicles , except Hussain's , were military style vehicles .
Hussain 's vehicle was a pickup truck .
The route included going past a civilian gas station .
A Marine Gunner on one of the HUMVEEs , who alleged that he did not realize that Hussain 's vehicle was part of the convoy and believed that Hussain was an insurgent trying to infiltrate the convoy , used escalation of force and shot and killed Hussain .
The Marine Gunner believed that the insurgent had entered from the civilian gas station .
( The Marine Gunner first shot the driver side tire , then the engine block , then the passenger side windshield , and then the driver side windshield . )
The convoy did not stop to investigate after Hussain 's vehicle crashed into the side of the highway .
The convoy went on to its destination point .
It was later discovered that Hussain was a part of the convoy ; his body was located at the Ramadi Hospital Morgue .
The NCIS file states that there was initially an investigation by the military contractor Kellogg Brown and Root Services which indicated that Hussain had been shot and killed by a Marine .
An NCIS investigation was then initiated .
( At first it was determined that Hussain 's body would undergo an autopsy - an autopsy that Hussain 's family agreed to - to determine whether Hussain 's death was caused by the wounds he sustained or if his death was the result of bleeding over a period of time due to lack of appropriate medical aid .
Later , it was determined that no autopsy would be performed in order to get Hussain 's body back to his family as soon as possible . )
It appears from the investigation that the Marine Gunner was not briefed that Hussain 's vehicle would be part of the convoy .
Evidence was developed that the Marines involved were derelict in their duties , and had made false statements when questioned about the shooting .
On December 15 , 2005 , a General Courts Martial was convened and one of the Marines pled guilty to making false statements .
A jury found a Marine not guilty of failing to stop to render assistance to Hussain .
The judge dismissed charges against another Marine who was alleged to have failed to brief members of the convoy that Hussain would be part of the convoy .
The investigation was closed .

" After the shooting , a report was made via radio that a MAM [ military aged man ] was engaged .
. . .
During this incident I feared for my life as well as for the members of my team .
We were in known hostile territory surrounded by many high rise buildings .
We left the body on the side of the road because we were told the Iraqi's will take care of the dead in their own customs .
I have never been involved in an incident like this before . "
-- U.S. Marine describing the death and the immediate aftermath of the shooting death of Faisal Kurdi Serhan .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , by U.S. Marines ( Alpha Company , 3rd Battalion 172nd Infantry Regiment ) , of Faisal Kurdi Serhan , an Iraqi male national in his twenties .
At approximately 5:30 pm on October 9 , 2005 , U.S. Marines were advised that occupants of a Black Opel station wagon had just allegedly emplaced an Improvised Explosive Devise ( IED ) in the ground and were fleeing the scene .
The vehicle was cornered by a HUMVEE and Marines exited the HUMVEE and approached the vehicle .
Marines noticed several AK - 47s and IED making components in the backseat of the vehicle .
The occupants of the vehicle were three Iraqi male nationals .
They exited the car and in the process of attempting to arrest the detainees , the Marines shot one detainee - Serhan - and killed him .
Serhan 's body was left in the street .
( According to the investigation , leaving the body in the street and unrecovered was within the Marine unit 's Standard Operating Procedure . )
The two other detainees were arrested and taken to Ar Ramadi Detention Facility .
There the two detainees - in separate interviews with a civilian contractor who had been hired to conduct interrogation for the Department of Defense - stated that the Marines had told Serhan to walk away and that as Serhan was walking away he was shot in the back .
Because their stories matched , an investigation was launched .
The Marines were interviewed and each stated that Serhan had been uncooperative and had attempted to grab a Marine 's weapon .
The Marines stated that Serhan then ran away from the Marines and the Marines shot him because they thought he may have the trigger for the IED devices the Marines had noticed in the vehicle .
The Iraqi cab driver stated that the Syrians were being badly beaten by the IAF and that Doe ran away to avoid the beating .
A second round of interviews with the two detainees revealed inconsistencies in their stories .
One detainee said the instruction to walk away was given in Arabic , the other detainee said it was given in English .
Both detainees acknowledged that they were preoccupied with their own situations and may not have relayed the event perfectly .
The investigation was closed .

Then more American Hummers came in .

- - Iraqi Taxi Driver who was detained along with several Syrian men he was driving into Iraq on the shooting and killing of a Syrian man identified only as John Doe .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , by U.S. Marines ( 3rd Battalion 25th Marine Regiment ) and Iraqi Armed Forces ( IAF ) , of an unidentified Syrian male national ( hereinafter Doe ) .
At approximately 9:30 am on June 26 , 2005 , Marines and IAF were manning a stationary vehicle checkpoint .
A red Opel vehicle with four male occupants approached the checkpoint and was stopped .
The men were asked to exit the vehicle .
According to the witness statements , Marines instructed the IAF to interrogate the men .
IAF beat the men until it was determined that one of the men was an Iraqi male national who was driving the other three who , based on their accents and fake Iraqi passports , were determined to be Syrian nationals and likely foreign fighters .
In order to avoid continued beating Doe ran from the Marines and IAF .
Doe was instructed to stop in Arabic and English .
When Doe did not stop Doe was shot by IAF and the Marines .
In an interview the Interpreter - a Department of Defense contracted linguist - for the Marines alleged that he and IAF ran over to Doe and Doe was still alive .
According to the Interpreter an IAF officer shot three rounds into Doe and when the Marines questioned his conduct the IAF officer stated that " I shoot every fucking Syrian because they are going to blow themselves up . "
The Interpreter also stated that Marines did not beat or harm the detainees .
The IAF officer then asked to shoot the other two Syrian detainees and the Marines would not let him .
The cab driver alleged that IAF then handcuffed the other two Syrian nationals and beat them and that Marines were not involved in the beatings .
The two other Syrian detainees also stated that IAF officers beat them .
( One of the other Syrian detainees identified Doe as Abu Bashir , but the file indicates that this was likely not Doe 's proper name . )
The IAF officers alleged that they were instructed to interrogate the Syrian nationals by the Marines and that it was the IAF officers who refused to shoot the other two Syrian detainees .
The autopsy results were that Doe 's cause of death was two gunshot wounds and his manner of death was homicide .
The autopsy did not reveal the three additional rounds that the Interpreter alleged killed Doe .
An attempt to do a follow - up interview with the Interpreter failed because on July 5 , 2005 , he was injured as a result of an Improvised Explosive Devise and was medical evacuated to his hometown of Baghdad , Iraq .
There were no statements from Marines because upon advice of counsel they invoked their right to counsel .
It was determined that there was no command or Staff Judge Advocate interested in the investigation and that the actions of the Marines and IAF were within the Rules of Engagement and that proper Escalation of Force was used .
The investigation was closed .

-- U.S. Marine describing his knowledge relating to the death of detainee Haskem Shefi Abdullah .
This Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) file involves the death , by a U.S. Marine , of Haskem Shefi Abdullah , a 29 - year - old Iraqi male national .
On September 20 , 2005 , Abdullah was detained by a team of Marines for being a suspected insurgent .
When detainees are apprehended the military has the person undergo retinal scanning .
The scan is then compared to existing scans in a classified database called the Biometric Automated Tool Set ( BATS ) database to determine whether the person had previously been detained and was on the " Black List . "
( Notably , several Marines in their witness statements commented that the BATS system is not always correct , up - to - date or reliable . )
Abdullah showed up as having previously been detained for being an insurgent and had been held at Abu Ghraib prison from February 2005 to July 2005 and that his detainee number had been 169279 .
On September 21 , 2005 , Abdullah was taken to a small wooden building known as a " swahut " to await processing by the Human Exploitation Team ( HET ) .
( HET teams determine whether a detainee should be further held or released . )
While he was in the swahut Abdullah asked for water and to have his handcuffs removed because he was not feeling well .
The Marine watching Abdullah did both .
That Marine then had to leave to check on another detainee and asked a second Marine to watch Abdullah for a short while .
This Marine - who was on the base to meet with a source who was running late - was left alone with Abdullah .
While watching Abdullah - and within seconds of the other Marine 's leaving - the Marine watching Abdullah remembered that his 9 mm gun was not on the proper setting .
The Marine went to reset his gun and as he was doing this , the Marine alleges that Abdullah tried to grab the gun from him .
At 9:45 am the Marine shot Abdullah once in the chest , and at 10:52 am Abdullah died from his wounds .
NCIS agents were on the scene immediately and took pictures and interviewed the Marines .
The Marine claimed he acted in self - defense .
He stated that the Rule of Engagement ( ROE ) required hostile intent and that his conduct be proportional to the situation .
He stated that he believed his conduct was within that range because he acted in self - defense .
He also stated that he had never heard anyone explain what the ROE was for close hand - to - hand combat .
The Marine surmised that perhaps Abdullah had taken the bold step of trying to disarm a Marine because he had been held at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison .
The investigation was closed .
For unstated reasons the investigation was then reopened , was designated as one of " special interest , " and NCIS requested that the Marine undergo a polygraph examination .
The Marine declined to do a polygraph and the investigation was again closed .

Ford 's Microsoft - powered Sync system has been a huge hit with car buyers and the one bit of sunshine in the Blue Oval ’s gloomy outlook .
But with the automaker 's exclusive deal with Microsoft winding down , the software giant has signed a deal with Hyundai and Kia to provide its vehicles with the hands - free navigation , communication and entertainment system .
The Microsoft - Ford marriage ends in November , which is about the same time the Korean automaker will offer Microsoft Auto in its vehicles worldwide .
The crew in Redmond says upcoming versions of Sync will add navigation and emergency response to exclusive features
Ford now offers , such as text messaging and wireless streaming of Internet radio from Web - enabled phones .
Martin
Thall , general manager of Microsoft 's automotive business unit , told the Detroit Free Press the latest version of Microsoft Auto , the operating system Sync is build upon , soon will be available for " general release to the automotive community . ”
What 's that mean ?
Thall said the latest version of OS is being deliverred to some suppliers and an official launch is planned later this month in He expects suppliers already familiar with Microsoft Auto , such as Continental and Alpine , will tweak the operating system to develop innovative features that can be sold to automakers .
Steve Koenig , the Consumer Electronics Association ’s director of industry analysis , says " demand is omnipresent " for the kind of features offered by Microsoft Auto , and he predicts the technology will be ubiquitous within two or three years .
" We see demand … across all income levels , all age levels , " Koenig said .
" It 's really resonating with consumers ' digital lifestyle .
We 're starting to see consumers beginning to demand it and expect it . "
Consumer spending on in - car consumer electronics grew 21.5 % in
2007 to $ 11.4 billion , according to a CEA
study .
The study cites Sync as a turning point for such technology because it is based on software that is easily updated , so the auto industry 's can more easily keep pace with changes in consumer electronics .
Automakers are no longer hamstrung by the four - to five - year development cycles that dominate the industry .
It is n't clear yet just what the second - gen Sync will look like , but
Microsoft says the Hyundai - Kia deal will deliver " a next - generation infotainment system " to the North American market in 2010 and future technology will be similar to a " mini - PC . ”
Microsoft Auto senior product manager Velle Kolde says the companies are developing features that wo n't be ready until fall and suggested they could include navigation and emergency response services similar to those offered by OnStar - two chinks in Sync ’s armor .
" What specific features you see will be tailored toward the types of vehicles they go into , " Kolde says , adding that Hyundai and Kia will adapt features to the needs of customers in countries where their cars are sold .
In addition to the Ford deal , Microsoft formed a partnership with
Italian automaker Fiat to launch the Sync- lite Blue&Me system in
2006 .
Pundits have predicted Microsoft 's influence will dwindle in the computing world , but clearly the company is taking its show on the road and wants to dominate the dashboard .
" Microsoft is certainly raising their level of involvement and their competitiveness in the automotive industry , ” Phil Magney , an analyst at the Telematics
Research Group told the New York Times .
“ It makes it one of the top operating systems that automakers must consider in developing their
‘ infotainment ’ systems . ”

Whitehall was left combing its season ticket loan records this weekend as another set of top secret papers did the rounds of the 5.45 pm from Waterloo .
Just days after a Cabinet Office worker left a stack of top secret anti-terrorist papers – including an analysis of Al Qaeda - on a train to Surrey , it emerged that a second set of papers detailing Treasury Dept efforts to fight financial fraud had gone walkies on another train around the same time .
As well as detailing weaknesses in how the HMRC ’s computer systems can counter fraud , the papers covered government efforts to counter terrorist financing and money - laundering , and ways in which the finance system can be manipulated to finance Iran ’s development of weapons of mass destruction .
Apparently the papers were left on a Surrey - bound train last Wednesday , the same day that the Cabinet Office papers were mislaid on another Surrey - bound train .
The Cabinet Office papers were immediately passed on to the BBC which handed them back to the government – albeit on camera .
The finance papers found their way to the Independent on Sunday , but not apparently until Sunday .
The question of what happened to them in the meantime will cause someone in Whitehall absolute nightmares .
Still , if nothing else , the fact that they were passed on by an Independent on Sunday reader will dramatically narrow the hunt for the picker - upper .
The Surrey - bound civil servants ’ apparent carelessness with top secret papers is just the latest in a tide of government data breaches .
If civil servants are n’t losing CDs with the details of every family in the UK , they ’re leaving laptops chock full of details of servicemen in the pub .
Out of their brains on the 5.15
Whitehall has already launched an investigation into the loss of the Al Qaeda documents , and the civil servant responsible has been suspended .
Home secretary Jacqui Smith has been summoned by MPs to explain how the gaffes might affect the fight against terrorism .
Her department did n’t actually lose any of last week ’s papers .
In fact , Smith is unlikely to ever leave secret papers on a train , given that she rarely walks the streets of London , never mind takes public transport .
According to The Times , a Treasury spokesman said of the latest gaffe , “ We are extremely concerned about what has happened and will be taking steps to ensure it does n’t happen in the future . ”
Sadly , with this government ’s record the surest way of clamping down on civil servants leaving important documents on trains is to let the operating companies jack up train fares so that even Whitehall fat cats have to get on their bikes . ®
June 3 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama achieved the 2,118 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president last night and made history by becoming the first African American to win a major party 's presidential nomination .
Obama , D - Ill. , locked up one of the longest and most closely fought Democratic nomination fights in recent history .
" Tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to America .
Because of you , tonight I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States , " Obama told 30,000 thrilled supporters at an arena in St. Paul , Minn .
" This is our time .
This is our moment , " he said .
He graciously praised Cllinton , despite the sometimes bitter exchanges the two had during the campaign .
" Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign , not just because she 's a woman who has done what no woman has done before , but because she 's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength , her courage , and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight , " Obama said .
" Our party and our country are better off because of her , and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete " with her , he said .
The presumptive Democratic nominee locked up the nomination even before the votes were counted in the party 's final two primaries in South Dakota and Montana last night .
Obama went on to easily win Montana last night by a margin of 57 percent to Sent.
Hillary Clinton 's 42 percent .
But Clinton , D - NY , snatched one last upset victory in South Dakota , with a 55 - 44 percent win .
Nevertheless , Obama picked up enough delegates from those states to pad his margin of victory and saw additional superdelegates rally to his side .
Later , the candidates played some phone tag , ABC's Sunlen Miller reports .
A little after 11 pm , Obama left Clinton a message on an aide 's cell phone , congratulating Clinton on her South Dakota win and asking that she return the call .
ABC 's Eloise Harper reports that some time later , Clinton returned Obama 's call .
The two spoke very briefly and then the cell phone call dropped out .
Clinton called him back and got his voice mail .
The two exchanged a couple more messages and finally spoke just after midnight .
Obama reiterated his invitation from a conversation earlier in the week when he suggested that the two schedule a meeting .
Clinton agreed , but no specific plans were made for a time or place for such a meeting .
Clinton Refuses to Concede Race
For her part , Clinton refused to concede the race tonight .
" This has been a long campaign , and I will be making no decisions tonight , " she told supporters in New York .
" In the coming days , I 'll be consulting with supporters and party leaders to determine how to move forward with the best interests of our party and our country guiding my way , " she said as supporters chanted " Denver , Denver ! " pointing to the party 's convention in August .
Clinton 's campaign has indicated her willingness to challenge a Democratic Party ruling on Michigan and Florida 's disputed delegates all the way to the Denver convention -- a drastic option that would delay the party uniting behind Obama .
However early Wednesday Democratic leaders signaled their unwillingness to go without a nominee before the convention .
" We have come to the end of an exciting primary and caucus process –- the voters have spoken ...
Democrats must now turn our full attention to the general election , " read a joint statement released by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , DNC Chair Gov. Howard Dean , and Democratic Governors Association Chair Gov. Joe Manchin .
The Democratic party leaders urged all remaining uncommitted superdelegates to make their decision known by this Friday .
However , Clinton may be trying to leverage her support for a place on the ticket as Obama 's running mate .
Speaking on a conference call to fellow New York lawmakers earlier today , Clinton said she is " open " to being Obama 's vice presidential candidate if he asks , a source on the call told ABC News ' Rick Klein .
Late tonight , Lanny Davis , a long - time friend of Clinton 's , circulated a petition asking Obama to choose Clinton as his running mate .
Obama Faces Divided Party
The win is a huge accomplishment for Obama , 46 , a first - term U.S. senator , who would be among the youngest presidents in U.S. history if he wins the White House .
With a popular campaign message of hope and change , he attracted huge crowds , celebrity endorsements , and record - breaking campaign contributions .
His candidacy also inspired a record turnout by black voters , and enjoyed wide support from independents , liberals , young voters , and high - income Democrats .
Early on , Obama cast his campaign as a rejection of old - style Washington politics , and painted Clinton as an incumbent .
Obama , McCain Launch Campaign Fight
Standing on the same stage where Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , will accept the Republican Party 's presidential nomination in September , Obama quickly pivoted to the general election , taking a swipe at his Republican opponent .
" John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks , but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan , and Ohio , and right here in Minnesota -- he 'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for , " Obama said .
" Change is a foreign policy that does n't begin and end with a war that should 've never been authorized and never been waged , " Obama said .
" It 's time to refocus our efforts on al Qaeda 's leadership and Afghanistan , and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century -- terrorism and nuclear weapons ; climate change and poverty ; genocide and disease .
That 's what change is . "
Launching the general election fight full - throttle , McCain fired a shot at Obama in a nationally televised speech made before Obama had declared victory .
" I have a few years on my opponent , so I am surprised that a young man has bought into so many failed ideas , " McCain , 71 , told supporters Tuesday night in Kenner , La .
" You will hear from my opponent 's campaign in every speech , every interview , every press release , that I 'm running for President Bush 's third term , " McCain said .
" Why does Senator Obama believe it 's so important to repeat that idea over and over again ?
Because he knows it 's very difficult to get Americans to believe something they know is false .
" Both Senator Obama and I promise we will end Washington 's stagnant , unproductive partisanship , " McCain said .
" But he has n't been willing to make the tough calls , to challenge his party , to risk criticism from his supporters , to bring real change to Washington .
I have . "
Calling Clinton " my friend , " McCain heaped praise on the former first lady , suggesting " pundits " and " Democratic " Party elders " unfairly crowned Obama the Democratic nominee .
" The media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of Americans , and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received , " McCain said .
" As the father of three daughters , I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach . "
Clinton ' Open ' to VP Slot
As the last day of a grueling , five - month Democratic primary battle fight came to a close , Clinton watched as superdelegates flocked to her opponent and told fellow New York lawmakers that she is open to being Obama 's vice presidential candidate if he asks .
A year ago , the former first lady led every Democratic presidential candidate in the polls and was considered the party front - runner with big- money Democratic donors , the support of the Democratic establishment , and the backing of her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
But today , Clinton , trailing Obama in delegates , and with her campaign deeply in debt , spent much of the afternoon calling major donors and supporters from her home in Chappaqua , N.Y. , in a last - ditch effort to gauge her support .
Obama Wins Delegate Race
With only 31 pledged delegates at stake in Tuesday 's final primary contests in Montana and South Dakota , the Obama campaign pressed uncommitted superdelegates Tuesday to announce their support before the polls closed , to allow him to emerge as the party 's nominee without the appearance of it all coming down to the superdelegates .
He saw an avalanche of superdelegates come his way in the last two days before the final primary contests , including former President Jimmy Carter , and renowned civil - rights leader and House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn , D - S.D .
Of the 796 Democratic superdelegates -- party officials , members of Congress and state party leaders free to back any candidate -- less than 200 were still waiting to declare their support for either candidate when the day began .
" We 've known for the last couple of months that even though Obama emerged as the front - runner , he was not going to be able to secure the nomination without the support of superdelegates , " said Nathan Gonzales , political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report .
Superdelegates Make Impact
Clinton faced pressure to drop out of the race , but refused to leave until the last primary states voted .
This afternoon , Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , told reporters that he encouraged uncommitted superdelegates in the Senate to hold off on endorsing immediately and to wait for the results of tonight 's primaries .
" Sen . Clinton needs to be left alone to get through the primary process and let it run its course , " Reid said .
Candidates Woo Undecided Superdelegates
While their phones have been burning up for months with calls from the candidates and former President Bill Clinton , many superdelegates were uncomfortable with their roles as potential kingmakers .
" For senators , you 've got a race here between two of their colleagues , and at least one of them is coming back to the Senate , so I think their reluctance to pick a side is to maintain good relations , " said Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report .
Clyburn , on Tuesday , urged fellow superdelegates to get off the fence .
" Sen . Obama brings a new vision for our future and new voters to our cause .
He has created levels of energy and excitement that I have not witnessed since the 1960s , " read Clyburn 's Tuesday statement .
Many prominent Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , have urged fellow Democrats to vote the way their state does .
Role of Superdelegates Scrutinized
The role of superdelegates may be given more scrutiny after the grueling , neck - and - neck primary battle between Obama and Clinton .
The Democratic Party decided more than three decades ago that party leaders and former Democratic politicians should become the ultimate deciders in a tight race .
After the insurgent outsider campaigns of George McGovern and Jimmy Carter won the Democratic Party nominations in 1972 and 1976 , many party officials felt the need to have a greater role in the nominating process .
Apart from convincing big numbers of undecided superdelegates to back her presidential bid , the only option left to Clinton is to push her fight to the Democratic convention in late August , a move opposed by party leaders eager to stop the infighting and start fighting against McCain .
With her considerable support from voters , Clinton may also be trying to leverage herself to negotiate with Obama on various matters , including a potential spot on the ticket as the vice presidential candidate or influence Obama on policy issues , like health care .
Asked Tuesday by a South Dakota radio station about a potential vice presidential choice , Obama said , of Clinton , " She 's run a magnificent race ...
I 'm sure that we will have ample time to sit down and talk about bringing the party together and make sure that we are focused on November . "
Entering the general election with a Republican president with record - low approval ratings and polls suggesting over 80 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track , Obama has a good shot at the White House .
However , Obama emerges bruised from a bitter Democratic primary battle , and faces the daunting challenge uniting the party .
The Democratic nomination fight exposed Obama 's challenges in gaining support from white , blue - collar voters , Hispanics , women , and older voters who supported Clinton 's candidacy in huge numbers .

More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there , according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday .
That 's 1 in 37 adults living in the United States , the highest incarceration level in the world .
It 's the first time the US government has released estimates of the extent of imprisonment , and the report 's statistics have broad implications for everything from state fiscal crises to how other nations view the American experience .
If current trends continue , it means that a black male in the United States would have about a 1 in 3 chance of going to prison during his lifetime .
For a Hispanic male , it 's 1 in 6 ; for a white male , 1 in 17 .
The numbers come after many years of get - tough policies - and years when violent - crime rates have generally fallen .
But to some observers , they point to broader failures in US society , particularly in regard to racial minorities and others who are economically disadvantaged .
" These new numbers are shocking enough , but what we do n't see are the ripple effects of what they mean :
For the generation of black children today , there 's almost an inevitable aspect of going to prison , " says Marc Mauer , assistant director of The Sentencing Project , a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington .
" We have the wealthiest society in human history , and we maintain the highest level of imprisonment .
It 's striking what that says about our approach to social problems and inequality . "
Numbering in the millions
Justice Department analysts say that experts in criminal justice have long known of the stark disparities in prison experience , but they have never been as fully documented .
By the end of year 2001 , some 1,319,000 adults were confined in state or federal prisons .
An estimated 4,299,000 former prisoners are still alive , the new report concludes .
" What we are seeing is a substantial involvement of the public in the criminal - justice system .
It raises a lot of questions in the national dialogue on everything from voting and sentencing to priorities related to state 's expenditures , " says Allen Beck , chief of correction statistics at the Bureau of Justice Statistics , who directed the report .
Nor does the impact of incarceration end with the sentence .
Former inmates can be excluded from receiving public assistance , living in public housing , or receiving financial aid for college .
Ex-felons are prohibited from voting in many states .
And with the increased use of background checks - especially since 9/11 - they may be permanently locked out of jobs in many professions , including education , child care , driving a bus , or working in a nursing home .
Enfranchisement for ex-felons
More than 4 million prisoners or former prisoners are denied a right to vote ; in 12 states , that ban is for life .
" That 's why racial profiling has become such a priority issue for African - Americans , because it is the gateway to just such a statistic , " says Yvonne Scruggs - Leftwich , chief operating officer of the Black Leadership Forum , in Washington .
" It means that large numbers in the African - American community are disenfranchised , sometimes permanently . "
Some states are already scaling back prohibitions or limits on voting affecting former inmates , including Maryland , Delaware , New Mexico , and Texas .
In addition , critics say that efforts to purge voting rolls of former felons could lead to abuses , and effectively disenfranchise many minority voters .
" On the day of the 2000 [ presidential ] election , there were an estimated 600,000 former felons who had completed their sentence yet because of Florida 's restrictive laws were unable to vote , " says Mr. Mauer of the Sentencing Project .
The new report also informs - but does not settle - one of the toughest debates in American politics : whether high rates of imprisonment are related to a drop in crime rates over the past decade .
The prison population has quadrupled since 1980 .
Much of that surge is the result of public policy , such as the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing .
Nearly 1 in 4 of the inmates in federal and state prisons are there because of drug - related offenses , most of them nonviolent .
Narcotic - related arrests
New drug policies have especially affected incarceration rates for women , which have increased at nearly double the rate for men since 1980 .
Nearly 1 in 3 women in prison today are serving sentences for drug - related crimes .
" A lot of people think that the reason crime rates have been dropping over the past several years is , in part , because we 're incarcerating the people most likely to commit crimes , " says Stephan Thernstrom , a historian at Harvard University .
Others say the drop has more to do with factors such as a generally healthy economy in the 1990s , more opportunity for urban youth , or better community policing .
But no one disagrees that prison experience will be a part of the lives of more and more Americans .
By 2010 , the number of American residents in prison or with prison experience is expected to jump to 7.7 million , or 3.4 percent of all adults , according to the new report .
Gordon Williams says he will appeal against the £ 30 fine A painter and decorator says he is " dumbfounded " after a £ 30 fine for smoking a cigarette in his own van .
Gordon Williams , of Llanafan , Aberystwyth , says he had popped to the shops when he was pulled over by Ceredigion council officials .
" I was told that because my van is my place of work I had broken the smoking laws , " he said .
A council spokesman said Mr Williams had acknowledged the offence and elected to pay the fixed penalty .
" I am dumbfounded - the van is only insured for private use and to get me to and from work , " added Mr Williams , from Llanafan , near Aberystwyth .
" It not my place of work - I decorate houses not vans . "

The grandfather decried the on - the - spot penalty as the " Big Brother state going too far " .
He added : " I respect anyone who chooses not to smoke , but I would also ask for the same respect to have the freedom to smoke in my own private vehicle . "
Mr Williams was driving on the A487 near Aberystwyth in his unmarked blue Suzuki Carrier van when he was pulled over by council officials carrying out spot checks on the safety of vehicles .
He believes it is the first ticket of its kind handed out by the council since the smoking regulations came in last year - the fixed penalty notice was number 0001 .
He was on a shopping errand to pick up teabags for his wife when he was stopped .

This has just gone too far .
I still see people using their mobile phones whilst driving .
Of an evening , I can hear the boy racers driving along the main road , where are the authorities for this ?
These actions could kill someone , having a cigarette in your own vehicle wo n't Janet Hooper , Isle of Wight Mr Williams added : " I take the wife shopping in the van .
It is my private vehicle as well as my work van . "
Mr Williams ' wife Sue has already paid the fine , fearing it would increase if not settled promptly .
But her husband remains defiant , and said he would be challenging the punishment .
" I have appealed against this even though I initially paid the fine otherwise it would have increased to £ 50 .
" I 've sent up my insurance certificate and am awaiting the outcome . "
Simon Clark , the director of smoking freedom group Forest , condemned the fine as " absolutely ridiculous " .
He said : " It smacks of some jobsworth council official interpreting the law to the most extreme level .
" This surely is not what the change in the law was intended for - it was not meant to harass and persecute people going about their ordinary lives .
" It is ridiculous that someone should be fined for smoking in their own private vehicle away from any workplace . "
A spokesman for Ceredigion council said Mr Williams 's vehicle was stopped by police as part of a multi-agency operation .
" A total of 56 vehicles were stopped and inspected during the initiative and , as a result , three fixed penalty notices were issued in connection with contraventions of the smoking in smoke - free places legislation , " said the spokesman .
" All three fixed penalties have been paid .
" When stopped , both Mr Williams and his male passenger were found to be smoking .
' Exposure ' " Based on information received from Mr Williams at the scene , fixed penalty notices were served on both persons .
" Both persons have now acknowledged the offences and elected to pay the fixed penalty rather than having the matter considered by the court . "
The spokesman added the matter was therefore considered to be closed and no record of criminal conviction would be recorded against the individuals concerned .
A Welsh Assembly Government spokesman said : " The smoke - free regulations state that a vehicle shall be smoke - free if it is used for work by more than one person , regardless of whether they are in the vehicle at the same time , to protect everyone who uses the vehicle from the harmful effects of exposure to second - hand smoke , regardless of when they use the vehicle .
" Smoking is permitted in vehicles used for work purposes that are for the sole use of the driver and are not used as a workplace by anyone else , either as a driver or a passenger . "

The origin of menopause has puzzled evolutionary biologists for the last half - century .
Three new studies attempt illumination .
The real question , though , is probably not :
Why menopause ?
Rather , it is :
Why do women long outlive their fertility ?
Human ovaries tend to shut down by age 50 or even younger , yet women commonly live on healthily for decades .
This flies in the face of evolutionary theory that losing fertility should be the end of the line , because once breeding stops , evolution can no longer select for genes that promote survival .
The most popular explanation , the " grandmother hypothesis , " argues that a generous post - reproductive life span makes sense if a grandmother improves the survival and reproduction of her grandchildren , thus ensuring continuation of her own genes — including genes that contribute to longevity .
But skeptics say the math is askew .
From an evolutionary perspective , it is hardly ever better for a woman to give up a chance to bear additional children of her own , and so pass on half her genes , for the sake of improving the survival of her grandchildren , who carry only a quarter of her genes .
" The problem is that these grandmother benefits are n't big enough to ever favor stopping breeding between the ages of 40 and 50 , " says Michael Cant , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Exeter in England and co-author of a new study on the genesis of menopause published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA .
" When you look at data from hunter - gatherers and other natural fertility populations , the sums just do n't add up . "
Grandmothers do benefit their descendants , he says , but the genetic payoff is small compared with those of producing another child .
Cant and co-author Rufus Johnstone , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge in England , used game theory to argue that menopause is early cessation of reproduction that originated through reproductive conflict between generations .
In most cooperatively breeding species , reproduction is suppressed in younger females , who act as helpers to older reproducing females .
By contrast , they say , younger women in human social groups win the reproductive sweepstakes , because the older ones stop having babies .
" We showed that , compared to other primates that exhibit a post - reproductive life span , humans really stand out , because there is absolutely no overlap in reproduction between generations , " Cant says .
" Women stop breeding on average when the next generation starts to breed . "
This makes evolutionary sense , Cant and Johnstone say , because , contrary to most mammals , young women tend to move to their mates ' communities , where they become immigrants whose only genetic kin are their own children .
There is no genetic profit in helping their mothers - in - law bear more children , because they will not share any genes with those children .
But an older woman who helps her son's wife reproduce will benefit by bequeathing 25 percent of her genes to her grandchildren .
" We show that the mother - in - law 's best strategy is to stop breeding , avoid competition , and allow the daughter - in - law to breed and help her , " Cant says .
" It 's the first time anyone has taken the idea that humans evolved with this sex bias in dispersal and looked at the implications for how these conflicts will be resolved within the family . "
The mother of the grandmother hypothesis , anthropologist Kirsten Hawkes of the University of Utah , says Cant and Johnstone are right to focus on intergenerational conflict .
Elephants have babies in their 60s , and some whales give birth in their 80s .
" It 's clearly something selection can adjust , " she says .
" So explaining why it has n't in us has to be part of the story . "
But she disputes their claim that female - bias dispersal is , in fact , the universal human / ape residence pattern , pointing out that half of the young female chimps at anthropologist Jane Goodall 's Gombe Stream Research Center remain with their mothers , and that recent studies show that hunter - gatherers often live with the wife 's family as well .
Another explanation for menopause is the " mother hypothesis , " which holds that it occurs because older mothers might profit more , genetically speaking , by investing resources in their existing children than in giving birth to new ones .
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock , Germany , make the case for this in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology ( AJPA ) , concluding that menopause is advantageous when a woman has aged enough to face an increased risk of stillbirth , birth defects and her own death in childbirth .
Researchers of a different AJPA study , based on 400 years ' worth of data on births in Costa Rica , believe that postmenopausal longevity is associated with an increased number of children but a decreased number of grandchildren — a finding that supports mothers over grandmothers .
" We 're not saying grandmothers do not provide benefits in some societies , " says study co-author Lorena Madrigal , an anthropologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa .
But , " we should not assume that one pattern fits all . "
Data on great ape fertility is spotty , but what there is shows that our closest relatives — chimps , bonobos , gorillas , even orangutans — stop having babies about the same age that we do : the late 30s .
The difference is , they generally die a short time later .
" The thing that makes us different from apes is not the age of fertility decline , it 's the lack of aging in other systems , " says Hawkes .
" I have been saying this for a long time and I do n't think it 's what anybody is hearing .
Probably what a lot of people are prepared to listen to is the way Cant and Johnstone have framed this , that the real question is : ' Why do we stop [ reproducing ] so early ? '
I think the bottom line is that , compared with our closest living relatives , we do n't . "

Is McCain facing a platform fight at the Republican convention ?
The official national Republican platform is 100 pages long , and 91 of those pages reference George W. Bush .
Not only will the party want to downplay the unpopular president ’s role in shaping the party ’s agenda for the future , but it will obviously be necessary to start promoting John McCain as the party ’s leader .
But the prospect of re-writing the Republican platform is ripe with opportunities for intra-party conflict .
Conservative activists are preparing to do battle with allies of Sen. John McCain in advance of September ’s Republican National Convention , hoping to prevent his views on global warming , immigration , stem cell research and campaign finance from becoming enshrined in the party ’s official declaration of principles .
McCain has not yet signaled the changes he plans to make in the GOP platform , but many conservatives say they fear wholesale revisions could emerge as candidate McCain seeks to put his stamp on a document that currently reflects the policies and principles of President Bush .
“ There is just no way that you can avoid anticipating what is going to come .
Everyone is aware that McCain is different on these issues , ” said Jessica Echard , executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum .
“ We ’re all kind of waiting with anticipation because we just do n’t know how he ’s going to thread this needle . ”
As a rule , fights over party platforms are rare and dull .
A party ’s presidential candidate generally reflects the policy agenda of the party ’s voters , and while competing factions might want specific provisions and / or language included in the platform in a certain way , the squabbles are behind the scenes and largely inconsequential in an otherwise choreographed event .
But this year , it appears Republicans are starting from scratch and there are ideological differences between the party ’s base and the party ’s nominee .
The result could be rather entertaining .
The battle may not be avoidable ….
McCain is “ really out of step with the strong majority of his party , ” said Myron Ebell , director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , which opposes McCain ’s positions on climate change .
“ He might get what he wants .
And he might get a change .
But I do n’t think it ’s going to sit well with a lot of Republicans . ”
Officials in the Republican National Committee and in McCain ’s campaign say they have much in common with conservatives .
They say their conversations as they approach the convention suggest there will not be a nasty platform fight . [ … ]
Ken Blackwell , a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a former Ohio secretary of state , said he does not expect a “ bloodletting ” in the platform committee .
He predicts that conservatives and McCain will be reasonable and stay focused on a November victory : “ I do n’t think you are going to see any radical departures or inflammatory demands for change in one direction or another . ”
Those assurances are not enough for activists such as Echard , who have been on the front lines of GOP platform fights for years .
She will be traveling to Minneapolis - St. Paul , site of the Sept. 1 - 4 convention , for two weeks in August , with the primary goal of making sure the 2008 platform reflects conservative principles .
So , what might they fight over ?
McCain apparently wants a less conservative approach on immigration , and Republican activists do n’t .
McCain wants some acknowledgement of the need for government action on global warming , and Republicans do n’t .
And McCain initially promised voters that he wanted to change the party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest .
He ’s since broken that promise , but party activists have vowed to raise hell if McCain tries to change so much as a syllable of the party ’s anti-abortion - rights language .
Stay tuned .

Snip from an item on Wikileaks :
Chip company NXP Semiconductors is to sue Radboud University in an
attempt to halt the publication of a paper detailing the cryptographic
cracking of the Oyster smartcard , used widely on the London transport
network .
The case is to be heard on Thursday in a court in Arnheim , NXP told
ZDNet.co.uk on Tuesday .
However , an NXP spokesperson declined to give
any reasons at present for the company seeking to halt the publication .
Researchers from the Radboud University in Nijmegen last month claimed
to have cracked the security on the Oyster card , which uses an NXP
chipset called Mifare Classic .
The research had led on from a
cryptographic crack of Mifare Classic by German researchers Karsten Nohl
and Henryk Pltz .
A spokesperson for Radboud University told ZDNet.co.uk that NXP wanted
to stop publication of the paper due to " safety reasons " .
However , the
spokesperson said that the university intended to proceed with the
publication of the research at the Esorics conference in Malaga in
October .
The court is expected to reach a decision next week .

Windows XP is dead ... long live Windows XP .
You may have heard that as of June 30 , you 're no longer able to buy the operating system or obtain support for it .
But that is n't quite the case .
In fact , you 'll be able to buy XP on certain mainstream PCs at least until January 31 , 2009 , and possibly beyond .
The cutoff date is even later for some ultra - low - cost notebooks , as well as low - cost desktop PCs commonly called nettops , such as those made by Asus , Dell , and other manufacturers :
They 'll sell with XP until June 2010 .
As for technical support , that has a lot of life left as well - - officially , Microsoft will provide at least some forms of support until 2014 .
In Video : XP Lives !
Until 2010 , at Least ...
Given the confusion about XP 's future , we decided to lay out your options for buying XP and getting support for it beyond the official sunset date for the OS .
Not Dead Yet
Microsoft 's public statement seems to leave no wiggle room .
It reads , " Windows XP will no longer be available for purchase from Microsoft for general retail and OEM partners as of June 30 , 2008 . "
But that simple statement hides plenty of loopholes .
First , retailers and PC makers can still sell the Windows XP software , and Windows XP PCs , after that date , as long as they purchased the products before June 30 .
If a retailer stocked up on copies of XP before June 30 , it can sell XP for as long as those supplies hold out .
The same holds true for PC manufacturers .
An even bigger loophole - - something called downgrade rights -- will allow people to get Windows XP on new PCs , even after computer makers ' stock of Windows XP licenses runs out .
An OEM such as Dell can sell you a PC that starts out with Vista Business or Vista Ultimate on it , and then downgrade the operating system to Windows XP Professional before shipping the machine out to you .
In the box , you will receive discs for Vista , XP , Vista drivers , and XP drivers .
That way , if you decide you 'd prefer Vista , you can use the installation disc and drivers to upgrade to that OS .
You can do this only with Vista PCs for which the OEM has decided to offer downgrade rights , however .
A Dell spokesperson says that Dell will provide the option for its XPS line of gaming PCs ( the XPS M1730 laptop , XPS 630 gaming desktop , and XPS 730 gaming desktop ) , for its line of Vostro small - business PCs , and for enterprise customers .
Dell wo n't offer the choice indefinitely , though - - only through January 31 , 2009 .
HP also offers a downgrade option on its business desktops , notebooks , and workstations , and will continue to do so until at least July 30 , 2009 , says a company spokesperson .
As with Dell PCs , when someone buys a system , it will have XP Pro installed , and will come with discs for both XP and Vista .
January 31 of next year is also the last date you 'll be able to buy XP on a machine from a " system builder " - - a company that builds no - brand custom PCs from components and purchases Microsoft software from a distributor rather than directly from Microsoft itself .
If you buy an ultra - low - cost PC - - which Microsoft describes as a notebook with " limited hardware capabilities " intended for entry - level buyers or people seeking an inexpensive second system -- you 're in luck .
Such laptops , including the popular Asus Eee PC , can be sold with Windows XP until June 2010 .
The notebooks must have small screens and low - powered CPUs to qualify .
In addition , very low - cost computers -- so - called nettops -- that do not have high - end processors , a great deal of RAM , or separate graphics processors can also be sold with Windows XP Home Edition until June 2010 .
Various vendors -- including Acer , Asus , and Dell - - are likely to sell nettops .

Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value -- zero . ~ Voltaire
" I want to stress just how fast this all happened .
By the time Serverus was crowned in 193 AD , the denarius was still the international currency , even though for the last few generations it had gradually been devalued .
But a mere 22 years later , in 215 AD , India first rejected the denarius and then the devalued gold coins .
And of course the world moved much slower in those days , with trade between Rome , India and China taking months .
Seen in this light , 22 years was very fast indeed .
After 215 AD and the final loss of Rome 's position as the owner of the world 's currency , Rome 's trade , economy and living standards went into tailspins .
The " silver " denarius lost so much more of its value that even Roman 's [ sic ] would n't take it .
Emperor Caracalla introduced a new silver coin , the antoninianus , but immediately started to remove silver from it .
Within 45 years , by 268 , this coin was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating .
I must stress again how quickly and completely Roman living standards fell from the time that the rest of the [ world ] rejected its money as the world 's currency . " ~ A Short History of International Currencies by Christopher Weber , April 4 , 2005

Introduction
As I will support in this essay , imbalances and systemic problems have become so severe that the economic downtrend in the United States will almost certainly accelerate dramatically at some point in the months and years ahead .
The natural question is " When , exactly ? " but exact timing and velocity of markets and other dynamic social phenomena are inherently unpredictable .
Trends , historical examples , and current data are knowable , however , and they all tell us a storm is coming .
The economy may drag on with the appearance of quasi - normality for a while longer yet – it has already done so for longer than many expected .
" Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent , " as Warren Buffett pointed out .
But if economic timing and velocity are not predictable , the direction and amplitude of future economic events seem clear : data strongly suggest that we are moving towards a Greater Depression , or perhaps something even worse .
This current and onrushing disaster is entirely the result of historically - typical and well - understood government dynamics and actions .
Ordinary Americans have allowed , encouraged , and participated in these dynamics and actions because their understanding of government has been systematically and purposefully subverted , beginning with the adoption ( via the Constitution ) of a powerful central government and then especially with the push for Prussian - inspired government schooling in the 1800s .
The political and corporate power elite have encouraged these same dynamics and actions because they personally benefit from them , directly and indirectly .
By now , the paradigm that Americans use to understand government has become so corrupted as to be massively out of sync with reality , to such an extent that Americans clamor for more of the same policies which caused the problems in the first place .
If we are somehow able to avoid an epic melt - down of America ’s economy ( and perhaps the world ’s ) , such a miracle would require a rapid and dramatic turnaround in the typical American ’s understanding of the dynamics and effects of government action – it would require , in other words , the widespread adoption of a new paradigm .
My scientific calculation on the odds of that happening in time : a billion to one against , with a margin for error of " not enough to matter . "
I will be surprised if more than a small minority understand the reason for the problem even after America ’s fall from economic grace .
You may disagree with my conclusions – most do – but the facts themselves are widely known and not in serious dispute .
Intelligent , well - connected and well - respected people have issued warnings in recent years on the problem ; these warnings have been reported in the media and then , for the most part , forgotten .
The situation continues to grow more precarious , which makes the " soft landing " many are hoping for less likely by the day .
As for when the crash will become too obvious to ignore or deny : once again , many unknowns can trigger or affect the speed and nature of a great unwinding such as the one we now face .
A few such possibilities : a U.S. attack on Iran ; a nuclear U.S. attack on Iran ; a domino of bank failures triggered by overwhelming numbers of mortgage defaults and other credit defaults ; an acceleration of the world trend away from using the US dollar ; China and other mega-creditors dumping their massive dollar holdings and using the cash to buy commodities and other real assets .
The tipping point could happen before this column is published , or not for several more years .
I lean towards " soon " however ; I will be surprised if we get through the next year ( or even this year ) without our current Rube Goldberg economy coming unraveled .
I urge you to do your own research and analysis and come to your own conclusions , but please give this issue the time and consideration it clearly deserves .

The Current Situation
My thesis here is serious and goes against both common wisdom and the view typically presented by government and the media .
Hence , I begin this section with a long list of news items and comments from respected sources to support my thesis that a major unraveling is likely and perhaps imminent ; many of these items also support my point that government action is the direct or indirect cause of this situation :
Stephen Roach , the chief economist at investment banking giant Morgan Stanley , has a public reputation for being bearish .
But you should hear what he 's saying in private .
Roach met select groups of fund managers downtown last week , including a group at Fidelity .
His prediction : America has no better than a 10 percent chance of avoiding economic " Armageddon . "
Press were not allowed into the meetings .
But the Herald has obtained a copy of Roach 's presentation .
A stunned source who was at one meeting said , " it struck me how extreme he was - much more , it seemed to me , than in public . "

The GAO found that the government ’s true debt — on - the - books and off — more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 , and now stands at a staggering $ 46.4 trillion .
GAO , it seems , actually low - balled the true debt by using the entitlement obligations for only the next 75 years .
To permanently fix these programs we ’d have to put up enough money to cover all of their obligations forever .
That ’s where the Trustees Report comes in .
Using the estimates from that report , the federal government ’s true debt is shown to be a stunning $ 94.7 trillion .
That ’s more than $ 315,000 owed by every man , woman , and child in the United States .
That ’s $ 1.25 million in debt for every family of four .

The Medicare “ trust fund ” is already badly in the red , and the only solution will be a dramatic increase in payroll taxes for younger workers .
The National Taxpayers Union reports that Medicare will consume nearly 40 % of the nation ’s GDP after several decades because of the new drug benefit .
That ’s not 40 % of federal revenues , or 40 % of federal spending , but rather 40 % of the nation ’s entire private sector output !

Concern for pricing oil only in dollars helps explain our willingness to drop everything and teach Saddam Hussein a lesson for his defiance in demanding Euros for oil .
And once again there ’s this urgent call for sanctions and threats of force against Iran at the precise time Iran is opening a new oil exchange with all transactions in Euros .
Using force to compel people to accept money without real value can only work in the short run .
It ultimately leads to economic dislocation , both domestic and international , and always ends with a price to be paid .

Retired government workers are twice as likely to get a pension as their counterparts in the private sector , and the typical benefit is far more generous .
The nation 's 6 million retired civil servants — teachers , police , administrators , laborers — received a median benefit of $ 17,640 in 2005 , according to the Congressional Research Service .
Eleven million private - sector retirees covered by traditional pensions got $ 7,692 .
Governments ' generosity could have serious consequences for taxpayers and pensioners .
Some states — including Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , New Jersey , Ohio and West Virginia — have troubled retirement systems that may require huge tax increases , spending cuts or even defaulting on promised benefits .
The U.S. government has a bigger unfunded liability for military and civil servant retirement benefits ( $ 4.7 trillion ) than it does for Social Security ( $ 4.6 trillion ) .
The pension gap will continue to widen because governments pump far more money into employee pensions than companies do .
Civil servants earn an average of $ 12.38 an hour in benefits , about $ 5 an hour more than private - sector workers , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The difference was just $ 2.70 an hour in 1995 .

Last month we saw the first tell tale signs of things to come .
The possibility of lower rates coupled with a declining dollar led to a fifty billion dollar shortfall in the flow of funds into the US .
You see the United States needs almost three billion dollars a day of other people 's money to survive and we did n't get it .
So where did the difference come from ?

The items above barely scratch the surface ; one could fill a bookshelf with such material .
Other points of economic stress and possible event triggers include :
* the approach ( or arrival ) of peak oil , including a recent , sudden drop in Saudi production , and the resulting upward pressure on prices
* rapid economic and infrastructure growth in China , India and elsewhere putting pressure on oil and other commodity prices
* the transfer of manufacturing and other jobs to low - cost producers in Asia
* the ever - worsening disaster of the American auto industry , a once - core element of this nation 's economic strength ( see also here and here )
* bursting of the housing bubble ( mentioned above ) , with millions of Americans on the verge of foreclosure , will also extinguish the economic stimulus of refinancing – the use of one 's home as an ATM – and much consumer spending along with it
* the massive growth in government size , expense , and repression here in America , including an exploding national debt ( in addition to the even larger entitlement debt )
* the bizarrely inflated pay [ PDF , see pages 40 – 43 , and remember that this document was prepared BY a government employee ] , benefits , and especially retirement arrangements for government workers at the city , county , state , and federal levels , which are severely under - funded in many cases
* the continuing and ever - growing US trade deficit
* the rapid , unprecedented , and highly dangerous growth in derivatives ( more than $ 370 trillion worth )
* The nosedive in America 's standing around the world ( see also here ) due to our aggressive wars , our reputation for torture and other mistreatment of prisoners ( including denial of the centuries - old right of habeas corpus ) , our third - world status as the planet 's largest debtor nation , and our unique combination of arrogance , coercive foreign policy , and rapidly growing financial , industrial , and moral decay
You will surely have no trouble adding to these lists .
Individually , such problems are serious enough .
Add them together and we have a situation that not merely could , but will at some point spin rapidly out of control .
Two more excerpts , in this case to further support the assertion in my subtitle that Americans have already become impoverished :
The American dream , at least on the economic side , is fading .
Most people see the United States as a special place where there is plenty of opportunity for someone to work hard , play by the rules , and get ahead - maybe even become wealthy .
Today , though , nearly 1 in 5 American households has zero net worth or actually owes more than it owns .
And the odds of a son or daughter rising above their parents in such a financial predicament have shrunk .
" Income mobility has declined in the last 20 years , " says Bhashkar Mazumder , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago .
. . .
That marks a change from the past .
From 1950 to 1980 , Americans were more and more likely to see their offspring move up - or down - the income ladder .
For example : poor parents in the US had good odds of seeing children make great strides in overcoming their parental heritage .
And if they lived long enough , they might well find that a grandchild had risen to a median income level .
Today , it could take five or six generations to close the gap between poverty and middle - class status , calculates Mr. Mazumder .

It 's a Thursday today .
2007 , by the way .
But the news of the day comes to us from the waaaaay back machine : 1933 .
The personal savings rate the year Franklin Roosevelt moved into the White House was - 1.5 percent of disposable income .
Makes sense that people were dipping into their savings when you remember the Great Depression was in full swing .
Seventy - three years , later [ sic ] the economy 's a whole lot better .
But we 've gone back to our spending ways .
The Commerce Department told us this morning that last year , the savings rate hit it's the lowest level since the early 1930s .
-- Americans are spending their savings , Public Radio's Marketplace for February 1 , 2007 ( Marketplace also ran a piece titled Almost everything 's more expensive on March 15 , 2007 about the newly released Producer Price Index report )
In addition to spending their savings , going deeper into debt , and living in a more difficult economic environment , the average American family is , remember , saddled with over a million dollars in federal debt ; living with decaying infrastructure ( roads , bridges , sewers , etc. ) caused mostly by government spending too many tax dollars on other things and not enough dollars on fundamentals ; and supporting wars of foreign aggression ( that is , against nations which have not attacked us and were realistically never a danger to us ) with not only their tax dollars but with the lives and bodies of their sons , daughters , mothers , fathers , aunts , uncles , cousins , and friends .
The negative savings rate in this supposedly wealthy nation is a warning flare , alright , but it is only one symptom in a very broad drama of destruction .

How it Happened
Two epigrams from Thomas Jefferson :
Experience hath shewn , that even under the best forms ( of government ) those entrusted with power have , in time , and by slow operations , perverted it into tyranny .
If Americans ever allow banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
All I can do in this short column is present an overview and point you to further resources .
I will include enough detail to , I hope , illuminate the path from relative freedom and sound economics to our current corrupt and massively imbalanced system , but I will of necessity leave much out .
I encourage you to further educate yourself on the topic to the extent you are interested .
Timeline to the Twilight of an Empire :
* Members of the Continental Congress write the Articles of Confederation in 1776 , as the war for independence gets underway .
The Articles are adopted by the Congress the following year and finally ratified by the states in 1781 .
The government created by the Articles is more a trade agreement and set of rules for loose alliance among thirteen sovereign nations than a blueprint for a central government as we know it today ; this " government " does not even have the power to tax .
There are ten* " Presidents of the United States under Congress assembled " ( as they were called ) ; Samuel Huntington was the first .
( What ?
You never heard of Samuel Huntington ?
Most Americans today could surely not identify him .
The victors always re-write history – or at least decide what gets taught in government schools – and big - government advocates won the day when the Articles were replaced by the Constitution . )
* Flaws in the Articles of Confederation plus the desire ( among the would - be power elite ) for a powerful central government make change inevitable .
The Constitution , written in 1787 , goes into effect in March of 1789 .
The United States now has a federal government whose restraints are in many ways vague and toothless .
For example , the " separation of powers " is no such thing , really : all three branches are part of the same government !
However , there are a few meaningful restraints on power that would later , to our great sorrow , be done away with in one fashion or other .
One example :
* The Constitution 's Section 10 ( which has , interestingly , never been repealed ) provides an absolute and unqualified prohibition against eliminating the gold standard ( bold added ) :
No State shall enter into any Treaty , Alliance , or Confederation ; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal ; coin Money ; emit Bills of Credit ; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts ; . . .
One might object that this is a restriction on the States , but of course the United States is just that : a collection of states .
If it is unlawful to " make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts " then – other than perhaps in the District of Columbia – gold and silver are the money , and anything else ( such as paper ) clearly would have to be convertible into gold or silver at a defined rate of exchange – as in fact was true for most of this nation 's history .
Why is that significant ?
Because gold and silver cannot be " printed up " like paper money , which puts a powerful restraint on government spending .
Governments have historically stolen from the people by means of counterfeiting ; that is , by printing more and more money , just as a counterfeiter prints $ 100 bills in his basement .
Governments , being vastly larger than a single private counterfeiter , do vastly more harm in this fashion .
The ocean of newly - created cash that can be generated by government erodes the value of every existing dollar ( or yen or other unit of currency ) .
This inflation of the money supply has historically financed wars and empires ; it has been used to bribe populations with social programs ( the modern version of " bread and circuses " in ancient Rome ) – which also has the effect of making citizens more dependent upon politicians and government – and to fill the coffers of favored corporations , special interests , and those in power by funding mandates and programs ( most often war ) that government would otherwise be unable to pay for .
Even before the printing press made paper money feasible , governments ( Rome , again , is a commonly - cited example ) called in their coinage to shave the edges or to melt the coins down and re-cast them with a higher proportion of base metal .
( A Short History of International Currencies by Christopher Weber , quoted at top of this file , is an article on this topic worth reading in its entirety . )
Such inflation of the money supply is what leads to price inflation : more dollars ( or pesos or whatever ) chasing the same amount of goods and services , resulting in higher prices generally and often creating investment bubbles , which inevitably crash , destroying the finances of those participants who did not sell near the top – and thus transferring massive wealth to those few participants who DID sell near the top .
Examples of bubbles include the John Law episode in France , the stock - market bubble of the Roaring Twenties in America , and of course the recent stock - market bubble of the late 1990s and our just - now - dying real estate bubble .
Extreme cases of monetary and price inflation are called hyperinflation , and such episodes are far more common than most people realize .
Could a hyperinflation happen in modern - day America ?
Yes ; print up enough money and hyperinflation becomes inevitable , more or less by definition .
Many believe we are already on the road to such an episode .
It is worth considering that a nation does not even need to run the physical printing presses overtime as in the past ; the number of dollars can now be increased to infinity electronically , essentially by pressing a few buttons at the Federal Reserve .
( The " few buttons " part is fanciful , perhaps , but the basic idea is not ) .
Gold and Silver Cannot be Hyperinflated
For most of this nation 's history , a dollar was defined as a specific weight of gold or silver .
For example , a $ 20 gold piece , such as the $ 20 Liberty coin ( also called the Double Eagle ) contained .9675 ounce of gold .
The difference between that amount and an ounce was the seigniorage , the mint 's cut for producing the coins .
In most discussions – and for most of this one – the seigniorage amount is ignored and a $ 20 gold coin is thus said to contain an ounce of gold .
The important thing is that the amount per coin was specific , legally - defined , and unchanging .
Anyone could slap a $ 20 bill on the counter at a bank ( or a hardware store , for that matter ) and exchange it for a $ 20 gold coin .
With such a monetary system , prices for particular items could fluctuate based on supply and demand , but overall price inflation is literally impossible , absent a huge influx of new gold or silver ( how ? ) or a dramatic tightening of supply through the market ( food , energy , manufactured goods , etc ) .
In fact , market efficiencies , technological advances , and the generation of wealth in this country meant that a dollar typically bought MORE in 1900 than it did in 1800 .
The calculator at measuringworth.com tells us that :
$ 66.89 in the year 1900 has the same " purchase power " as $ 100 in the year 1800 .
So a hundred years later ( starting in 1800 ) , the dollar had become worth significantly MORE than before .
That 's not because of bank interest or stock dividends or anything else : it is the return you ( or your heirs ) would get for just putting cash under the mattress and waiting a hundred years .
Your wealth grew substantially in that period .
Now plug in " 2006 " as the ending year , and the answer becomes :
$ 1656.53 in the year 2006 has the same " purchase power " as $ 100 in the year 1800 .
We will discuss how that disaster was arranged in a moment .
For those interested , here is the government 's own CPI calculator , at http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl.**
The " start " year begins at 1913 , oddly enough . . . and this calculator shows $ 100 from 1913 having the same value as $ 2,036.36 in 2006 ( or $ 2055.55 in 2007 ) .
So , if your grandfather had put $ 100 in U.S. gold coin under the mattress and you found it today , you 'd have something worth a lot more than a modern $ 100 bill .
And wait – the reality is that five $ 20 one - ounce gold coins are worth , as I write these words , $ 3261 at $ 652.20 each .
That buys a fairly decent used car , or over 1185 gallons of gasoline at $ 2.75 per gallon ( good for 23,700 miles of driving – about two year 's worth for most people – at 20 mpg ) .
Not bad for a hundred bucks .
Had your grandfather put $ 100 in paper money under the mattress – assuming it did n't get eaten by moths or otherwise destroyed – it would now be worth ( drum roll , please ) : $ 100 .
Somehow , your grandfather 's $ 100 bill lost $ 3161 in purchasing power .
Well , that old $ 100 bill might have collector value .
Or not .
But the face value would have lost nearly all of its purchasing power .
You 'd have roughly 3 % of the original value remaining .
Questions worth pondering about the issue :
Who does this hurt ?
Who does it benefit ?
How was it made to happen ?
Why was it made to happen ?
One final question before we continue : what IS the actual value of a modern dollar ?
What , other than " a unit of U.S. currency , " is the definition of a dollar ?
What is the dollar 's intrinsic worth ?
The answers are all , essentially , " nothing . "
Today 's fiat dollar is a cipher , a unit without meaning , an illusion .
Anything that can be produced in any amount for almost no cost or effort is worthless as a unit of exchange , for reasons that should be obvious .
How much longer will the world use an inherently worthless , undefined cipher as reserve currency ?
How much longer will the world send us oil or anything else of real value in return for dollars that America creates from thin air ?
I suspect the answer to both questions is : " not very long . "
* Back to the timeline : 1913 is a pivotal year in our journey , because it sees creation of both the Federal Reserve and the income tax .
How did America go from a currency system that by law consisted of gold and silver , to one based on nothing whatsoever ?
Answer : the Federal Reserve .
The Federal Reserve is not a federal agency , nor does it have any " reserves . "
It is a private bank chartered to issue money for the United States .
It does this by creating money out of nothing and then loaning that money to the U.S. Treasury and to banks , at interest .
The Fed is famously shrouded in mystery , and nearly everything one sees or hears about it seems designed to obfuscate rather than clarify the Fed 's actions and effects .
This alone should be a huge red flag , even were one not aware of the incredible loss of value the dollar has suffered under Fed management , or of the Constitutional prohibition against fiat currency , or of the vile history of central banking generally .
A page at HowStuffWorks says " In this article , we 'll visit the mystical world of the Fed. . . " – and backs up that characterization with nineteen sections that go into excruciating detail without really getting to the heart of the matter .
Their second section , " Why we need the Fed , " makes it sound as if the pre-Fed monetary situation was disaster , and the well - run , scientific institution of the Federal Reserve was created simply to , as the article puts it , " organize , standardize and stabilize the monetary system in the United States . "
I would argue that causing the dollar to lose 97 % of its previous and highly stable purchasing power is a poor example of " stabilizing the monetary system . "
What the Fed has been especially good at is providing money for wars and government expansion generally , and at making lots and lots of money for the banking cartel and all those corporate interests that have grown fat on federal mandates and contracts .
Since this is a short column ( or so I keep telling myself ) , I 'll encourage you to poke around in the InfoSphere for more detail .
A few places to start , with the URLs visible for those reading this in hard copy :

The Mystery of Central Banking by Robert Murphy
* Again , back to our timeline and the income tax : as mentioned , the income tax is created ( via the 16th amendment ) in the same cursed year as the Federal Reserve .
An amendment is necessary because the Constitution , as written by the Founders , prohibits an income tax as we have today .
Why , one might ask , was an amendment not deemed necessary to insert the Fed into our lives when the Constitution prohibits fiat money just as clearly as it does an income tax ?
The answer seems to be " because the Fed was a stealth attack . "
Until 1933 ( the next point on our timeline ) , the dollar remained freely exchangeable for gold at the original rate .
It was only in 1933 that the Fed 's inflation of the money supply could no longer be sufficiently hidden .
Foreigners were becoming reluctant to accept our money at face value ; they wanted gold in trade , not depreciating greenbacks .
Roosevelt called in all U.S. gold coins , made possessing more than a handful of gold coins a crime punishable by jail time and a large fine , and then massively devalued the dollar for U.S. transactions with foreign governments , from $ 20 / oz to $ 35 / oz .
( and so much for the protection of rights via the Constitution ) .
That took care of things for a few decades , but on August 15 , 1971 ( the arbitrarily final point on our timeline ) , Nixon " closed the gold window . "
That is , he declared national bankruptcy for the U.S. by completely ending any defined connection between the dollar and gold .
U.S. citizens – who had continued to think they were " free " this whole time – were finally allowed to own gold again ( starting in 1975 ) .
From 1971 on , the dollar has been a pure fiat currency ; not money itself but rather the illusion of money .
No government in history has ever resisted the chance to inflate a fiat currency into the ground , and the United States has proven itself no different in this regard .
Back to the income tax :
For the first 137 years of our history , the United States had no permanent income tax ( although Lincoln established one illegally during the Civil War ; it was overturned after the war ended ) .
During those 137 years ( with few and brief exceptions ) , our money was gold and silver , and price inflation ( as opposed to up / down fluctuations for individual items and services ) was zero .
Actually , price inflation was less than zero for more than a century , as shown earlier .
Once the Fed and the income tax came into being , things changed , at first slowly and then much faster .
The dollar became ever - more - worthless and the percentage of a typical family 's income taken by government at all levels has grown from one or two percent in the first half of the 1900s to over 55 % today ( this includes FICA , Medicare , and , in most states , a state income tax ) .
Then there are sales taxes , property taxes , and many other taxes , in ADDITION to the 55 % .
Let me say that again : tax rates on a typical family have gone from almost nothing – in the range of 1 % to 2 % – to well over 50 % , and they continue to grow .
This incredible increase in the rate of income confiscation has largely been concealed by the increasing bounty that technology and a free market have created for us , but – as we have already seen – those factors are being overwhelmed by the crushing burden that government has imposed and which it continues to increase .
Our markets are no longer so free , and neither they nor high technology can create enough wealth to counter today 's massive cost of government , in part because high - tech and the markets have been increasingly hobbled by government regulation , interference , and funding ( funding=control ) .
For a good visual presentation of the data , here 's a Federal Income Tax Inflation Chart that shows how dramatic this crunch has really been , in terms of both dollar inflation and inflation of the tax rate .
This tsunami of money – from taxing the wealth created by hard - working Americans and from the massive and illegal creation of fiat money ( section 10 of the Constitution , again ) – did more than impoverish American citizens ; it did more than merely take money directly from them and erode the value of every dollar they earned .
This largest inflow of wealth ever seen by any government in history was used in ways that most often harmed Americans instead of benefiting them .
In the months and years ahead , that truth will become ever - more apparent .

Healing by Paradigm
My title for this essay – " Destruction by Paradigm " – is meant to highlight that the overall mental framework most Americans now use to understand government ( and society generally ) has kept Americans from objecting to the destruction of their own liberties and prosperity .
The faulty paradigm so widely used actually leads Americans to call for more of the same policies and programs that have brought this country to the brink of disaster .
Paradigms are tools – frameworks – for understanding broad phenomena ( e.g. , the paradigm of science versus that of superstition ) – and a paradigm can be more accurate or less so .
A paradigm that excuses tyranny , that praises coercive centralized control and the people exercising that control , that makes the coercion of forcible government appear decent and normal and even positive , and which asserts that compassion can be expressed by coercively - funded government programs – such a paradigm is nothing less than a weapon against the great mass of people , wielded by the power elite .
Such a paradigm blinds people to the evil of coercion and to the harm it inevitably causes ; such a paradigm disconnects people from their own rights and responsibilities and strengths ; such a paradigm ensures that – since " more government = more compassion " – people will clamor for ever - more government , until inefficient and corrupt government programs , regulations , and mandates crowd out honest and efficient non-government efforts .
Eventually , such a paradigm , if severe enough and widely - enough held , must lead to a government so large and so controlled by corporate and other powerful interests , that the rights and welfare of the people themselves become crushed under the weight of so much tyranny , well - meant though much of it may be .
Nearly every problem discussed in this essay is the end result of the slow corruption of a paradigm that held genuine freedom in highest regard , into a paradigm in which " patriotism " has morphed into " obedience to authority " and in which freedom itself has become increasingly suspect ; a paradigm in which almost nothing is beyond the control of congress , and thus in which almost nothing is left to the people themselves ; a paradigm in which even if government could grow to 500 % of GDP it would not be enough to do all the things ordinary people are hoping and clamoring for government to do , not to mention all those things that defense contractors and other corporate interests are hoping and scheming for .
The founders of this nation ( in which I include the average person ) held a paradigm in which " freedom " meant something more than doing what you were allowed to do , or forced to do , by your masters .
They held a paradigm in which civil society was nearly everything in life , and coercive government was a very small " necessary evil " – a mistake , we now know , because as I have said before , coercive government is not a " necessary " evil but merely an ancient one .
Nonetheless , freedom in early America was astonishing compared to most times and places .
There were , for example , no passports or travel restrictions of any kind for most of our history – how many today can even imagine such a thing ?
For another example , your mind and body were your own – anyone could walk into a drug store and buy any drug whatsoever ; it was not government 's business what someone put into his or her own body .
Mutual aid societies , churches , and charities provided help to those in need ; using government for such things made no sense .
Consumer and industry organizations provided consumer protection , as Underwriters Laboratories ( founded in 1894 ) still does ; you probably have a dozen or more items in your home that are " UL Listed . "
Other such groups exist as well today , as well .
Government was so small during much of our history as to rarely encroach on one 's life , and the specific and often lived up - to recognitions of human rights – in the body of the Constitution ( habeas corpus , for one ; our current President and his Attorney General may wish to read Section 9 to confirm that ) , in the Bill of Rights , and in the background understanding of life that defines a culture – were enough to make America a truly special place and in many ways a deserving beacon to the world .
Why and how did that change in such dire fashion ?
In large part , because of flaws in the original paradigm , and in the too - low levels of both love and freedom within the United States at the time .
Love and freedom literally require each other , and high levels of both are required for a health society .
Love provides the anti-corrosive and lubricant for the market and for a free society generally ; freedom protects human rights , emotional health , and life itself – a police state is never conducive to love and compassion , nor safe for the lives of its subjects .
For more on the topic of love and freedom , see my archive ( linked at the end of this column ) or my website at http://www.paradise-paradigm.net.
Early America was an amazing , unprecedented attempt at a free society – at a New World worthy of the name – but it nonetheless fell short .
A nation which allows human slavery and which is slowly committing genocide against the original native inhabitants is neither free nor compassionate .
The flaws and shortcomings of early American society and government ( specifically , too much emotional damage and too much coercive power ) have grown into the destructive Frankenstein we have today .
That Frankenstein is about to fall .
This will be a disaster , yet it is also a great opportunity .
How are we to respond ?
There can be no quick fix ; no magic cure for the political and economic dilemma Americans have gotten themselves into , but there IS a solution .
It is imperative that more people hear and begin to understand that solution , else they will encourage the further destruction of their nation by the Two Great Evils ( as I have called them previously ) of government coercion and widespread emotional damage .
For an extreme and horrifying example , study the rise to power of the National Socialists in Germany during the 1930s .
The solution – the only real and permanent solution – is to widely spread the understanding that love and freedom are the two most important fundamentals in life ; that these fundamentals are connected to and dependent upon each other ; and that any system which denies either love or freedom is simply evil .
Belief systems guide behavior , and only a paradigm that clearly and whole - heartedly embraces the duality of love and freedom will guide people to the healthier , saner , more free and compassionate world that every new human life is born expecting and needing .
Such a world may also be the only world compatible with a human future .
Twenty - first century technology is advancing at a dramatic , non-linear rate , and will hugely empower either health or sickness ; either freedom or tyranny .
This may be our last chance to get things right .
The United States today denies love and freedom so deeply that its leaders justify torture and order its use .
Our government violates the principles of love and freedom in nearly everything it does , from aggressive wars that have left hundreds of thousands dead , to a " war on poverty " that has caused millions of children to grow up without their fathers ( else momma would lose benefits ) .
The U.S. expresses its coercive , corrupt , and phony " compassion " by means of a " war on drugs " that has put millions in prison over the years ( mostly for using a safe herb ) and created vast and violent criminal empires ; the reach of this particular policy has stretched across the globe , wreaking violence and corruption in Columbia , Afghanistan , and many other nations .
America has overthrown elected foreign governments ( mostly for corporate gain ) , installed and supported vile dictators , and taught the secret police agencies of those dictators how to torture dissidents and otherwise repress dissent .
The list of such crimes by the United States against love and freedom are endless , as could only be the case for the largest , most expensive , and most powerful government the planet has ever known .
" Power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely , " observed Lord Acton .
Americans of his day understood that truth and took it seriously .
It is time for Americans to relearn that lesson , and to apply it .
It is time for us to learn also , and clearly , that coercive power is not the only enemy , because widespread emotional damage is the handmaiden of tyranny as well as a horror in its own right .
As the coming storm gathers , and as it breaks upon us in the months and years ahead , remember that any approach which denies or subverts love and freedom can only lead us astray .
Love and freedom : we 'll have both , or we 'll have neither .

July 1 , 2008
THE BRITISH lawyer Gareth Peirce , celebrated for her defense of miscarriage of justice victims , wrote recently : " Over the years of the conflict , every lawless action on the part of the British state provoked a similar reaction : internment , ' shoot to kill , ' the use of torture ... brutally obtained false confessions and fabricated evidence .
This was registered by the community most affected , but the British public , in whose name these actions were taken , remained ignorant . "
Referring to the conflict in Northern Ireland , she was drawing a comparison with " our new suspect community , " people of Muslim faith , against whom a vicious , sectarian and mostly unreported war is well under way .
As Peirce points out , " internment , discredited and abandoned in Northern Ireland , " now allows , not 42 days , but the " indefinite detention without trial of foreign nationals , the ' evidence ' to be heard in secret with the detainee 's lawyer not permitted to see the evidence against him . "
Those snatched from their homes in Britain following September 11 , 2001 , have all but vanished into an Anglo - American gulag , which in this country joins Belmarsh Prison , where people are consigned to oblivion , with Broadmoor psychiatric prison , where they are sent as they go mad , and with Kafkaesque versions of " home " where others are interred under " control orders . "
Columnist : John Pilger John Pilger is a renowned investigative reporter and documentary filmmaker who was called " the most outstanding journalist in the world today " by the Guardian .
He is the author of numerous books , including most recently Freedom Next Time : Resisting the Empire , a collection of investigations into the effects of war crimes and globalization .
His books and films are featured at JohnPilger.com .
One such home prisoner , wrote Peirce , " a man without arms , was left alone and terrified , unable to leave the flat or to contact anyone without committing a criminal offense , subject to a curfew and allowed no visits unless approved in advance by the Home Office . "
Going into the garden , arranging a plumber , speaking to a child 's teacher , all require permission .
The families go mad , too .
Preferring " a quick death ... to a slow death here , " one man who took a risk and returned to Algeria has been lost in the subcontracted gulag , where his new torturers have given the British government " assurances " and are themselves reassured by the fact that BP , the ethical oil company , has sunk $ 12 billion into getting oil out of Algeria 's Southern Sahara .
Jordan , another subcontractor , is held economically afloat by the U.S. so George W. Bush 's " renditions " and torture can proceed there .
No British court has found any of these people guilty of any crime , but as Tony Blair , a genuine prima facie criminal , put it so well , " the rules of the game have changed . "
AS IN the Irish conflict , it is again the ignorance of us , the public , upon which the state relies .
All propaganda is directed at honing this ignorance and fabricating a fear .
This is primarily the task of journalists .
True fear is in Muslim communities .
Visit them , and you will find people terrified by your knock on the door , and women who now never go out .
In effect , control orders have been served on thousands of British citizens .
As Peirce reminds us , the Irish had allies in the Catholic Church and the 40 million Americans of Irish descent ; Muslims are alone as they watch the British state , with its " obstinate incomprehension " of their faith , do to them as it would never do to those of other faiths .
You can't imagine Jews treated this way ; the profanity is too great .
The silence of British Jews , who have the history , is also great .
As the suppressed facts of " terrorism " show , Muslims are by far the most numerous victims -- up to a million Iraqis dead , including 500,000 infants , during " sanctions " against Iraq in the 1990s ; perhaps another million dead when Blair and his mentor ignited the current inferno ; countless killed and maimed in Afghanistan by weapons that include the British thermobaric bomb , designed to suck the air out of human beings .
And there is Palestine , an entire nation under a permanent control order .
Reviewing this monstrous record , it is no less than amazing that the world 's most violent governments -- Britain is now the world 's leading arms merchant -- have sustained only two retaliations on their home soil .
With every hypocritical act , they beckon another .
Moreover , wrote Gareth Peirce , " If our government continues on [ this destructive ] path , we will ultimately have destroyed much of the moral and legal fabric of the society that we claim to be protecting .
The choice and the responsibility are entirely ours . "

It 's not just the American dollar that 's losing value .
A government agency has decided that an American life is n't worth what it used to be .
The " value of a statistical life " is $ 6.9 million in today 's dollars , the Environmental Protection Agency reckoned in May — a drop of nearly $ 1 million from just five years ago .
The Associated Press discovered the change after a review of cost - benefit analyses over more than a dozen years .
Though it may seem like a harmless bureaucratic recalculation , the devaluation has real consequences .
When drawing up regulations , government agencies put a value on human life and then weigh the costs versus the lifesaving benefits of a proposed rule .
The less a life is worth to the government , the less the need for a regulation , such as tighter restrictions on pollution .
Consider , for example , a hypothetical regulation that costs $ 18 billion to enforce but will prevent 2,500 deaths .
At $ 7.8 million per person ( the old figure ) , the lifesaving benefits outweigh the costs .
But at $ 6.9 million per person , the rule costs more than the lives it saves , so it may not be adopted .
Some environmentalists accuse the Bush administration of changing the value to avoid tougher rules — a charge the EPA denies .
" It appears that they 're cooking the books in regards to the value of life , " said S. William Becker , executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies , which represents state and local air pollution regulators .
" Those decisions are literally a matter of life and death . "
Dan Esty , a senior EPA policy official in the administration of the first President Bush and now director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy , said : " It 's hard to imagine that it has other than a political motivation . "
Agency officials say they were just following what the science told them .
The EPA figure is not based on people 's earning capacity , or their potential contributions to society , or how much they are loved and needed by their friends and family — some of the factors used in insurance claims and wrongful - death lawsuits .
Instead , economists calculate the value based on what people are willing to pay to avoid certain risks , and on how much extra employers pay their workers to take on additional risks .
Most of the data is drawn from payroll statistics ; some comes from opinion surveys .
According to the EPA , people should n't think of the number as a price tag on a life .
The EPA made the changes in two steps .
First , in 2004 , the agency cut the estimated value of a life by 8 percent .
Then , in a rule governing train and boat air pollution this May , the agency took away the normal adjustment for one year 's inflation .
Between the two changes , the value of a life fell 11 percent , based on today 's dollar .
EPA officials say the adjustment was not significant and was based on better economic studies .
The reduction reflects consumer preferences , said Al McGartland , director of EPA 's office of policy , economics and innovation .
" It 's our best estimate of what consumers are willing to pay to reduce similar risks to their own lives , " McGartland said .
But EPA 's cut " does n't make sense , " said Vanderbilt University economist Kip Viscusi .
EPA partly based its reduction on his work .
" As people become more affluent , the value of statistical lives go up as well .
It has to . "
Viscusi also said no study has shown that Americans are less willing to pay to reduce risks .
At the same time that EPA was trimming the value of life , the Department of Transportation twice raised its life value figure .
But its number is still lower than the EPA's .
EPA traditionally has put the highest value on life of any government agency and still does , despite efforts by administrations to bring uniformity to that figure among all departments .
Not all of EPA uses the reduced value .
The agency 's water division never adopted the change and in 2006 used $ 8.7 million in current dollars .
From 1996 to 2003 , EPA kept the value of a statistical life generally around $ 7.8 million to $ 7.96 million in current dollars , according to reports analyzed by The AP .
In 2004 , for a major air pollution rule , the agency lowered the value to $ 7.15 million in current dollars .
Just how the EPA came up with that figure is complicated and involves two dueling analyses .
Viscusi wrote one of those big studies , coming up with a value of $ 8.8 million in current dollars .
The other study put the number between $ 2 million and $ 3.3 million .
The co-author of that study , Laura Taylor of North Carolina State University , said her figure was lower because it emphasized differences in pay for various risky jobs , not just risky industries as a whole .
EPA took portions of each study and essentially split the difference — a decision two of the agency 's advisory boards faulted or questioned .
" This sort of number - crunching is basically numerology , " said Granger Morgan , chairman of EPA 's Science Advisory Board and an engineering and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University .
" This is not a scientific issue . "
Other , similar calculations by the Bush administration have proved politically explosive .
In 2002 , the EPA decided the value of elderly people was 38 percent less than that of people under 70 .
After the move became public , the agency reversed itself .

Mr Paulson held talks with Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday
The impact of the global credit crunch could have been minimised by better regulation of US banks , US Treasury Secretary has admitted .
Henry Paulson denied the regulatory system had " failed " but acknowledged that it could have " performed better " .
He told the BBC his main focus was limiting the " spillover " from the banking crisis to the US economy .
In the same interview , Chancellor Alistair Darling said that rising oil prices were a " real problem " .

With oil prices now above $ 145 a barrel , Mr Darling said G8 leaders meeting next week urgently needed to address the requirement for increased crude supplies .
Oil woes Mr Paulson held talks with Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday , and staged a joint news conference with Mr Darling after meeting top UK bankers .
In his remarks , Mr Paulson warned that there was no easy , short - term solution to high oil prices , and said that the cost of oil was likely to prolong the US slowdown , possibly into 2009 .
He said the current level of oil prices was " unacceptable to the American people " and that all his efforts were focused on dealing with the matter .
But he admitted that the basic problem was that there was not enough oil to meet the growing demand - and it was not clear whether producers such as Saudi Arabia actually had the capacity to increase output further .
In the longer term , he argued that a wide range of measures , including energy conservation , the development of more oil fields , and switching to cleaner technology , could bring about a reduction in the oil price .
And he announced that the UK and the US would be bringing forward plans for a large clean energy loan facility at the G8 meeting next week .
Tighter control Mr Paulson praised his counterpart 's handling of the Northern Rock crisis and the current economic turbulence , saying he was " on his toes " .
No -one wants to see high compensation for failure
Henry Paulson , US Treasury Secretary " There is a lot of co-operation going on right now between the UK and US in developing the right policy responses , " Mr Paulson said .
Both admitted there should have been earlier warning of the turmoil that hit global credit markets last year and that policymakers needed to raise their game .
" There is no doubt that that there were mistakes made by banks , regulators and investors , " Mr Paulson said , adding that he was " encouraged " by banks ' efforts to acknowledge the size of their losses and repair their balance sheets .
Mr Darling said the US and UK had " led the way " in addressing shortcomings in how the global banking system was policed .
" Whether it is the government , the Bank of England or the Financial Services Authority , we need to tighten up what we are doing , " he said .
' Market discipline '
Mr Paulson has said the US must devise a tougher regulatory system that can allow financial institutions to fail without causing wider economic turbulence .
The Federal Reserve stepped in to support investment bank Bear Stearns in March after confidence in the firm 's financial position evaporated .
Minutes of meetings held by the Fed at the time of the crisis showed that officials were worried about the prospect of " contagion " from the possible collapse of Bear Stearns with broader disruption to financial markets .
However , he said it was not the government 's job to dictate how much bank bosses who have lost their jobs as a result of the credit crunch should be paid in compensation .
" No - one wants to see high compensation for failure , " he said .
But he added : " I believe in market discipline .
I think we are going to see markets react . "
' Tough period '
In an interview with BBC Newsnight to be broadcast later on Thursday , Mr Paulson will say the current economic downturn " has further to go " .
He admits the US economy is going through a " tough period " because of the combination of the spike in oil prices , the credit crunch and housing slump .
But he is more upbeat about prospects for the rest of the year , saying he believes growth will improve at the end of 2008 .
He adds that on his travels around the world he had found that inflation had been the issue that was the top focus for governments , rather than the credit crunch .
But he declines to be drawn on whether that meant that the Federal Reserve 's aggressive cutting of interest rates had been a mistake .
The full interview with Mr Paulson will be broadcast on Newsnight on BBC2 at 2230 BST on Thursday .

What are these ?
The 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru had a global impact on human society , according to a new study of contemporary records by geologists at UC Davis .
The eruption is known to have put a large amount of sulfur into the atmosphere , and tree ring studies show that 1601 was a cold year , but no one had looked at the agricultural and social impacts , said Ken Verosub , professor of geology at UC Davis .
" We knew it was a big eruption , we knew it was a cold year , and that 's all we knew , " Verosub said .
Sulfur reacts with water in the air to form droplets of sulfuric acid , which cool the planet by reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth 's surface .
But the droplets soon fall back to Earth , so the cooling effects last only a year or so .
Verosub and undergraduate student Jake Lippmann combed through records from the turn of the 17th century from Europe , China and Japan , as well as the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South America and the Philippines , for information about changes in climate , agriculture and society .
In Russia , 1601 - 1603 brought the worst famine in the country 's history , leading to the overthrow of the reigning tsar .
Records from Switzerland , Latvia and Estonia record exceptionally cold winters in 1600 - 1602 ; in France , the 1601 wine harvest was late , and wine production collapsed in Germany and colonial Peru .
In China , peach trees bloomed late , and Lake Suwa in Japan had one of its earliest freezing dates in 500 years .
" In one sense , we can't prove that the volcano was responsible for all this , " Verosub said .
" But we hope to show that 1601 was a consistently bad year , connected by this event . "
The previous major eruption that might have affected global climate was in 1452 - 53 , when records were much less complete : in Europe , people began to take more careful note of the natural world after the Renaissance .
The 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia had a well - documented impact on global agriculture , so such eruptions may occur as often as every 200 years , Verosub noted .
Verosub hopes to expand the study by examining records kept by the Jesuit order in Seville , Spain , and from the Ming Dynasty in China .
The initial results are presented in an article in Eos , the transactions of the American Geophysical Union .

TRADITION has it that boys are good at counting and girls are good at reading .
So much so that Mattel once produced a talking Barbie doll whose stock of phrases included “ Math class is tough ! ”
Although much is made of differences between the brains of adult males and females , the sources of these differences are a matter of controversy .
Some people put forward cultural explanations and note , for example , that when girls are taught separately from boys they often do better in subjects such as maths than if classes are mixed .
Others claim that the differences are rooted in biology , are there from birth , and exist because girls ' and boys ' brains have evolved to handle information in different ways .
Luigi Guiso of the European University Institute in Florence and his colleagues have just published the results of a study which suggests that culture explains most of the difference in maths , at least .
In this week 's Science , they show that the gap in mathematics scores between boys and girls virtually disappears in countries with high levels of sexual equality , though the reading gap remains .
Dr Guiso took data from the 2003 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment .
Some 276,000 15 - year - olds from 40 countries sat the same maths and reading tests .
The researchers compared the results , by country , with each other and with a number of different measures of social sexual equality .
One measure was the World Economic Forum 's gender - gap index , which reflects economic and political opportunities , education and well - being for women .
Another was based on an index of cultural attitudes towards women .
A third was the rate of female economic activity in a country , and the fourth measure looked at women 's political participation .
On average , girls ' maths scores were , as expected , lower than those of boys .
However , the gap was largest in countries with the least equality between the sexes ( by any score ) , such as Turkey .
It vanished in countries such as Norway and Sweden , where the sexes are more or less on a par with one another .
The researchers also did some additional statistical checks to ensure the correlation was material , and not generated by another , third variable that is correlated with sexual equality , such as GDP per person .
They say their data therefore show that improvements in maths scores are related not to economic development , but directly to improvements in the social position of women .
The one mathematical gap that did not disappear was the differences between girls and boys in geometry .
This seems to have no relation to sexual equality , and may allow men to cling on to their famed claim to be better at navigating than women are .
However , the gap in reading scores not only remained , but got bigger as the sexes became more equal .
Average reading scores were higher for girls than for boys in all countries .
But in more equal societies , not only were the girls as good at maths as the boys , their advantage in reading had increased .
This suggests an interesting paradox .
At first sight , girls ' rise to mathematical equality suggests they should be invading maths - heavy professions such as engineering — and that if they are not , the implication might be that prejudice is keeping them out .
However , as David Ricardo observed almost 200 years ago , economic optimisation is about comparative advantage .
The rise in female reading scores alongside their maths scores suggests that female comparative advantage in this area has not changed .
According to Paola Sapienza , a professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management in Illinois who is one of the paper 's authors , that is just what has happened .
Other studies of gifted girls , she says , show that even though the girls had the ability , fewer than expected ended up reading maths and sciences at university .
Instead , they went on to be become successful in areas such as law .
In other words , girls may acquire an absolute advantage over boys as a result of equal treatment .
This is something that society , more broadly , has not yet taken on board .
Mattel may wish to take note that among Teen Talk Barbie 's 270 phrases concerning shopping , parties and clothes , at least one might usefully have been , “ Dostoevsky rocks ! ”
Music streaming and social community Last.fm has redesigned for a more mature experience , adding more integration and ubiquity across a variety of devices .
Ars Technica put on some headphones and rocked out with some of the new features .
Now sporting a much more refined and organized layout , Last.fm is finally filling its shoes as part of CBS ' transition to becoming an " audience company " and further extending its reach onto the web .
The network purchased Last.fm in May 2007 for $ 280 million .
Since then , Last.fm has introduced significant new features like music streaming from the four major labels — never mind that little squabble with Warner — and a music video initiative .
Last.fm became a bit more interesting some time ago with the introduction of a plug - in for various software like iTunes and Windows Media Player which " scrobbles " a list of the artists and songs you play up to your Last . fm account ( not the files themselves ) .
Combined with adding friends and the ability to purchase songs found on the sites at popular digital outlets like Amazon and iTunes Store , Last.fm has morphed into a convenient , free , one - stop social networking shop for exchanging music tastes , discovering new tracks , and keeping up with one 's favorite artists .
No fair making fun of our taste in music
Although some long - time fans are upset ( scroll down to the comments ) with the redesign , we think Last.fm has gained a much more pleasant layout and new features that make it far easiest and faster to begin discovering new music you might like .
While you can still install its plug - in to " scrobble " music and harness Last . fm 's auto - recommendation system , you can now simply search for artists and click " add to library " to begin building a music profile and find new music .
While listening to any song with Last . fm 's streaming player , the song can easily be added to your library to once again keep building a profile and give the site 's recommendation engine more preferred tunes to crunch on .
The new features are pleasantly convenient : ee found tracks from both pop and indie artists that we 've already added to our shopping carts , and being able to stream the entirety of ( most ) recommended tracks while we 're a thousand miles away from our main iTunes library is an appreciated bonus .
Last.fm has also improved the sheer speed of its recommendation system so recommended artists appear " in seconds instead of weeks , " so the site takes on the responsiveness of talking to an encyclopedic music store employee instead of trading CDs in the mail .
During our testing today , Last .fm frequently took a while to deliver new pages , and streams occasionally broke .
It 's understandable in a way since the site is probably experiencing higher - than - average traffic because of the buzz .
Considering that sites with heavier media to move like YouTube have yet to experience a memorable hiccup , though , we expect a little more out of CBS since Last . fm is such a big push for the company .
In addition to refreshing its site today , Last.fm is branching out into mobiles phones and the living room .
Now that the iPhone and iPod touch can officially run third - party applications , Last .fm launched a free native app that can stream any of the 5 + million songs from its library , recommend new songs , and give users access to their favorite artists and tracks .
The app's UI is obviously inspired by Apple 's iPod application , and it provides straightforward access to Last .
fm 's key areas and controls , such as banning a recommended track and a list of events from one 's favorite artists .
Unfortunately , due to Apple 's restriction of not allowing applications to run in the background , you can't start Last . fm 's iPhone app and do something else like you can with the built - in iPod app .
Considering how quickly streaming music like this could gobble up an iPhone 's battery while on - the - go , though , we are n't too broken up about it .
In the living room , Last.fm has partnered with Logitech to bring its services to the gadget company 's line of Squeezebox wireless music streaming players .
Viewers of the CBS show Swingtown can also now visit last .
fm / swingtown during and after each episode to listen to a free , on - demand playlist of songs featured from the show .

There are concerns about abortion on the web Some women in countries where abortion is restricted are using the internet to buy medication enabling them to abort a pregnancy at home , the BBC has learned .
Women in Northern Ireland and over 70 countries with restrictions have used one of the main websites , Women on Web .
A British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology review of 400 customers found nearly 11 % had needed a surgical procedure after taking the medication .
The website says it can help reduce the problems linked with unsafe abortions .
' Stressful experience '
But anti-abortion campaigners called the development of such sites " very worrying indeed " .
The research into those who had used Women on Web found that about 8 % did not end up using the medication they had ordered .
Almost 11 % went on to need a surgical procedure - either because the drugs had not completed the abortion or because of excessive bleeding .
I think it 's very important women have this resource to turn to in that situation
Women on Web customer Almost 200 women answered questions about their experiences - 58 % said they were just grateful to have been able to have had an abortion in this way , while 31 % had felt stressed but found the experience acceptable .
Women on Web posts the drugs only to countries where abortion is heavily restricted , and to women who declare they are less than nine weeks ' pregnant .
A US woman , who has a rare medical complication meaning pregnancy is life - threatening to her , described her experience when she used the website while in Thailand .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .

More from Today programme " Women on Web kept in contact with me via e-mail .
The medication arrived through Customs , properly blister - packed , with complete paperwork and a doctor 's signature .
" Medication from other websites came in unmarked bottles with no instructions or paperwork - it was quite frightening .
" I was not very far along - only three or four weeks .
It went smoothly for me .
" I think it 's very important women have this resource to turn to in that situation - and they can need it for a number of reasons . "
' Reputable site '
The Family Planning Association in Northern Ireland has had several calls from women considering buying abortion pills online .
ABORTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND Northern Ireland was not included in the 1967 Abortion Act , which liberalised access to termination on the mainland .
At present a woman is generally given an abortion if she has a serious medical or psychological problem that endangers her life if she continues with her pregnancy , has severe learning difficulties , or if doctors detect foetal abnormalities .
Social abortions are less easily accessible , although critics say the law lacks clarity .
The FPA said that on two occasions , women bought drugs without appropriate medical information .
They experienced complications and needed aftercare .
Northern Ireland FPA director Audrey Simpson said : " The Women On Web site is very helpful and reputable .
" But for Northern Ireland women , it is encouraging them to break the law - and as an organisation , we have to work within the law .
" We 're really concerned about women accessing the rogue sites - we 're hearing about it and we know it 's happening .
" There are potentially serious medical complications for women from sites which are n't well managed and this could be the new era of backstreet abortions . "
Anti-abortion campaigners said they were appalled by such websites .
Josephine Quintavalle , from the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said : " This is very worrying indeed .
It represents further trivialisation of the value of the unborn child .
" It 's like taking abortion into the shadows .
These drugs have side - effects and tragedies will increase . "

What are these ?
It ’s all falling into place !
After all of your hard work and preparation , your business is gaining ground and ready to be taken as a serious competitor in your industry .
Now it ’s time to take that marketing strategy and put it to action in order to generate more leads and build up your brand .
One of the best ways you can start that process is by getting your name out there via meeting face to face with new clients .
What better way to do that than by participating in a trade show ?!
If you have no previous experience with setting up at an event , do n’t sweat it !
Here are 6 trade show booth ideas to get you rolling in the right direction .
Trade Show Booth Ideas for Your First Time !
Grab that sales table and gather up some ideas before hitting the road for your first - ever trade show !
1. Have Hand Outs That Help Refuel
Trade
Shows are an all - day affair , and when they ’re done right , they can make people lose all sense of time .
Because of that , they ’ll be too busy walking around to different tables and checking out other events to notice they either skipped lunch or have n’t eaten all day .
That ’s when it ’s beneficial for you to have small snacks ( such as small chip bags you can buy in bulk ) or bottled water available for those that visit your table .
You ’d be surprised how quickly word gets out that you ’re handing food out in exchange for a few moments of their time .
This will help you get face to face with certain people that may have otherwise overlooked you AND give people a reason to come back a second time , which always works in your favor !
2. Make That Booth Stand Out !
Here ’s a tip :
If you notice there ’s a certain pop -up backdrop or sign template your competition is using for their sales tables …
DON ’T use it .
In a room or outdoor space filled with over 50 sales tables , it ’s already easy enough for your table to mesh in with the rest .
That ’s why it ’s up to you to incorporate certain features to make your space pop out to anyone walking by .
For example , if you ’re a brewery known as “ Blackbeard ’s Favorite Brewery ” and are set up at a trade show , find somewhere to rent a ship display and hand out beer samples from on top of it .
While that may be a bit unrealistic , you get the idea .
Make your brand stand out with a setup that will have visitors saying “ I need to visit that right now ” as soon as they walk into the trade show .
3. Interact with Your Guests
Even if your business is n’t a restaurant or brewery that can hand out samples , you can still make your trade show booth interactive for those that walk through .
Think of ways that you can incorporate a sample of the product you sell into your sales table .
This will help potential clients get a sense of what it ’s like to work with you and get a better understanding of your product / service .
If you ’re starting a photography business and are at a career building trade show , offer free Linked In professional photos to all that visit your booth .
That ’s a good way to start building up your email address listings for future email marketing endeavors !
4. Create a Trade Show Exclusive Deal
Visitors of any trade show you attend will get a list full of all the vendors and companies at the event as they walk in .
So what ’s drawing them to come by your booth when they can just visit the other tables and lookup yours on the internet after they leave ?
A great way to combat this is by setting up a deal that ’s exclusive to the event : a “ one time offer ” if you will .
This can be anything from a special bundle or a discounted rate on certain products .
It does n’t have to be anything too extravagant , but letting all visitors know there ’s a special benefit to visiting your booth during the trade show will create more traffic .
5. Giveaway Prizes
Trade shows can be an absolute success without selling a single product if you ’re able to build your email list or followers on social media .
One easy way to do that is by having giveaway prizes for anyone that places their email on your list at the event .
The giveaways themselves should be as individualistic as possible , yet no one would dare turn down a good - looking writing pen as well !
Worried about the logistics ?
Buying shipping containers can help make it easier to ensure the giveaways are safe leading up to the trade show date .
Figure out a giveaway that gels with your brand and have them ready to throw to the masses at trade show events !
6. Spread the Word on Social Media
Before you even pack up your trade show booth equipment the night before , you should be pushing the event on social media !
Everyone love ’s a good marketing tease , and you ’d be wise to dish out small hints on Instagram and other outlets leading up to the big day .
Is there a hashtag for the trade show ?
If so , plant that sucker on each post the week of .
Also , make sure to take several pictures at the event to stockpile quality pictures you can use for social media posts for months to come .
You ’ve Got This !
Hopefully , these trade show booth ideas have gotten the brainstorming started for your first one !
This is a big first step that all companies make at some point in time ; you ’ll have this down to a science in no time !
Happy Trade - showing , and remember , no one knows your brand better than you , let that shine through at all events from here on out !
As I was poking around iTunes I came across a familiar voice .
Billy Joe Armstrong from Green Day , with a unique sound , blared through the speakers as the lyrics bounced along to a familiar beat .
I ended up digging through Google and found out that Green Day renamed themselves to Foxboro Hot Tubs .
I could n’t believe what I was hearing , the sound was powerful and crunchy with melodic choruses .
A fresh sound I must say even after the band has created hundreds of songs and done tons of covers .
The band currently has a couple of albums on iTunes and if you like punk or Green Day I would suggest you give it a listen .
Apparently the reason for the name change is so that they could play small venues , aka local bars .

Dunkin ' Donuts said there was a " possibility of misperception "
The US chain Dunkin ' Donuts has pulled an advert following complaints that the scarf worn by a celebrity chef offered symbolic support for Islamic extremism .
The online advert for iced coffee featured the well - known US television chef Rachael Ray .
She was wearing a black - and - white checked scarf around her neck that resembled a traditional Arab keffiyeh .
This fashion choice incensed at least one prominent conservative blogger , who said it evoked extremist videos .
The blogger , Michelle Malkin , called the garment " a regular adornment of Muslim terrorists appearing in beheading and hostage - taking videos " .
Stylist 's choice
Other criticism followed and the coffee and doughnuts chain has now decided to drop the advert .
Fashion statements may seem insignificant , but when they lead to the mainstreaming of violence - unintentionally or not - they matter
Michelle Malkin
In a statement , Dunkin ' Donuts said the silk scarf had been " selected by Rachael Ray 's stylist and that no symbolism was intended .
" But given the possibility of misperception the commercial was no longer being used . "
This has caused a fair amount of consternation in some quarters but the conservative blogger at the centre of the row has praised the decision .
" Fashion statements may seem insignificant , but when they lead to the mainstreaming of violence - unintentionally or not - they matter , " Ms Malkin has written .

Tony Markel drives a plug - in hybrid that runs 50 miles per charge , goes 100 miles per gallon and gets power from the sun .
If he has his way , you 'll drive one too before long .
His 2006
Prius has a lithium - ion battery six times more powerful than the nickel - metal hydride pack Toyota put in it .
But what makes the car really cool is the solar panel on the roof .
It generates enough juice to go 5 miles .
Markel is a senior engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
He and his colleagues have been experimenting with the car for about a year in a quest to make lithium - ion batteries cheaper and more durable .
" Those are the barriers – battery cost and battery life , " he says .
" That 's the main thing holding the technology back . "
The way he sees it , though , the barriers wo n't stand much longer .
Automakers are chipping away at those barriers as well , and the lab hopes its research hastens the day when electricity supplants petroleum in our cars .
" The landscape is changing quickly , " he says , with plug - in hybrids and electric cars from General Motors , Toyota and Nissan looming on the horizon as early as 2010 .
They 're all working with the leading battery makers to perfect the technology , and lab is working with battery maker A123 Systems to bring improved thermal management to lithium - ion batteries .
The lab , known formally as the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , started working with Detroit on hybrids in 1994 .
Honda and Toyota beat them to the showroom , but DOE says even those vehicles benefited from its research .
The lab started experimenting with lithium - ion batteries four years ago ; last year it had Energy CS convert a Prius to a plug - in drivetrain at a cost of $ 40,000 .
( Another from HyMotion is on the way . )
The car 's got a 9 kilowatt hour li-ion battery and a rooftop solar panel that generates 165 watts .
" The vehicle is a research platform , " Markel says .
Much of the work has focused on improving thermal management of the battery and minimizing the losses in efficiency and energy capacity that occur as li-ion batteries age .
The challenge , Markel says , is developing a battery that 'll last as long as the car it 's energizing .
That 's a tall order , given the lifespan of a car is about 15 years .
The lab also is exploring vehicle - to - grid charging – the idea that plug - in hybrids charged at night , when electricity demand is low , can return some of that power to the grid during the day .
Although utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric are interested in V2G , " that 's research that 's outside the scope of what the auto industry is doing , " Markel says .
Markel says the car will go 50 miles on a charge , which is more than adequate because 78 percent of Americans drive 40 miles or less each day .
Befitting the lab 's name , the car is charged at a solar charging station .
Ask Markel when he last filled the tank and he needs a second to remember .
" A couple of weeks ago , " he says .
" It 's a pretty rare event . "

McCain expresses concern over Iraq - Pakistan border — which does n’t exist
Remember , the entire premise of John McCain ’s campaign pitch is that he has an unrivaled expertise in foreign policy .
For those of you who ca n’t watch clips online , McCain appeared on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” a few hours ago , and Diane Sawyer asked if he believed “ the situation in Afghanistan is precarious and urgent . ”
McCain , carefully avoiding Sawyer ’s adjectives , responded , “ It ’s a serious situation , but there ’s a lot of things we need to do .
We have a lot of work to do and I ’m afraid that it ’s a very hard struggle , particularly given the situation on the Iraq - Pakistan border . ”
And in apparent attempt to win the electoral votes of Schmuck Town , McCain added , “ And I would not announce that I ’m going to attack Pakistan , as Sen .
Obama did when he was during [ sic ] his campaign . ”
Watching McCain humiliate himself like this is just painful .
For one thing , Iraq and Pakistan do n’t share a border .
They ’re not even especially close — Iraq and Pakistan are separated by 1,500 miles and the country of Iran .
For another , Obama did not “ announce ” that he ’s going to “ attack ” Pakistan .
Obama said he would authorize pursuit against high - value terrorist targets if targets slipped into areas of Pakistan where Musharraf has limited control .
If John McCain seriously wants to tell voters that he would not pursue terrorists in this area , perhaps he should stop lying and start acknowledging the weakness of his counter - terrorism policy .
Regardless , the comments reflect a larger problem for McCain and his surprisingly incoherent perspective on the basics of foreign policy .
Look , I know it ’s easy to make a mistake on live , national television .
But Diane Sawyer had just asked about Afghanistan when McCain started talking about the Iraq - Pakistan border .
Indeed , in context , it seemed as if McCain was so anxious to falsely attack Obama on U.S. policy towards Pakistan that he changed subjects in mid-sentence , leading to a gaffe that did n’t make any sense at all .
And if McCain were generally coherent on matters of foreign policy , it ’d be easier to overlook minor errors like talking about borders that do n’t exist .
But the real problem here is that McCain ’s constant confusion seems to be part of a pattern .
* McCain continues to believe Czechoslovakia is still a country .
* McCain has been confused about the difference between Sudan and Somalia .
* McCain has been confused about whether he wants more U.S. troops in Afghanistan , more NATO troops in Afghanistan , or both .
* McCain has been confused about how many U.S. troops are in Iraq .
* McCain has been confused about whether the U.S. can maintain a long - term presence in Iraq .
* McCain has been confused about the source of violence in Iraq .
* McCain has been confused about Iran ’s relationship with al Qaeda .
* McCain has been confused about the difference between Sunni and Shi’ia .
* McCain has been confused about Gen. Petraeus ’ responsibilities in Iraq .
* McCain has been confused about what transpired during the Maliki government ’s recent offensive in Basra .
* McCain has been confused about Gen. Petraeus ’ ability to travel around Baghdad “ in a non-armed Humvee . ”
* McCain has been so confused about Iraq , in November 2006 , he could n’t even do a live interview about the war without reading prepared notes on national television .
* McCain has been confused about his vote on the Kyl - Lieberman amendment on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
* McCain , following a trip to Germany , referred to “ President Putin of Germany . ” ( Updated )
And this only covers McCain ’s obvious incoherence on his signature issue .
I honestly do n’t know what happened to this guy .
John McCain used to be a sharp , reasonably honest politician .
And then he decided he desperately wanted to be the Republican presidential nominee — and he threw it all away .
Maybe it ’ll work out .
Maybe just enough voters will be fooled by McCain ’s bizarre con job .
But it ’s hard to imagine how .
Iglesias : Ashcroft pushed out for wiretap opposition Stephen C. Webster

In an interview with the Dallas Morning News , former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias , who was at the epicenter of the recent U.S. attorneys scandal , claims that former Attorney General John Ashcroft was " pushed out " for his refusal to sign off on an administration wiretapping order .
In the interview , penned by Morning News contributor Todd Robberson , Iglesias states :
The one really intriguing question I 've had was from a book buyer a few months ago who asked whether I thought John Ashcroft had been pushed out or not after he refused to sign off on the warrantless wiretaps .
That 's something that a journalist has never asked me .
The honest answer is , yes , that had Ashcroft done the wrong thing , the unconstitutional thing , and signed off on it , he 'd probably still be the AG .
But Ashcroft served honorably .
He did the right thing , and he paid the price .
He was asked to move on .
In the aftermath of the U.S. attorneys scandal , and the proceeding investigations into the Bush Administration 's misuse of the Justice Department , the President 's closest political adviser , Karl Rove , was subpoenaed to testify before the judiciary committee .
Rove is widely suspected to have played a role in the Justice Department 's prosecution and subsequent jailing of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on charges of bribery , as detailed in a series of RAW STORY exclusive reports .
On July 10 , the committee voted 7 - 1 to reject Rove 's claim that his refusal of the subpoena was grounded in ' executive privilege ' and Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) issued Rove an ultimatum allowing five more days before pursuing ' all available options . '
At the hearing , the Judiciary committee was then informed that Rove had left the country .
Iglesias added :
Had we been fired a year earlier , it 's possible this would never have come to light because there would not have been interest by the majority [ Republicans ] on Capitol Hill to investigate why is it that seven U.S. attorneys got pushed out on the same day in an unprecedented action .
It would 've never risen to that level .
The media would 've picked up on it a little bit maybe .
But the Democrats ran with it when , last year , they were fresh in power .
I 'm sure they were looking for areas in which to exercise oversight , and this was handed to them on a golden platter by the Republicans .
But I want to make clear , they [ the administration ] got away with it .
...
There was no hue and cry .
There was no press coverage that I 'm aware of [ after the initial firings of two U.S. attorneys ] .
I think the hubris kicked in and they figured , heck , if we can get rid of two over a six - month period , why not get rid of seven more on the same day ?
David Iglesias ' book , " In Justice , " covering the U.S. attorneys scandal , is in bookstores now .
READ THE REST .
This is a forward to the book Flirting with Disaster : Why Accidents Are Rarely Accidental by Marc S. Gerstein .
I have participated in several major organizational catastrophes .
The most well known of them is the Vietnam War .
I was aware on my first visit to Vietnam in 1961 that the situation there  a failing neocolonial regime we had installed as a successor to French rule  was a sure loser in which we should not become further involved .
Yet a few years later , I found myself participating as a high - level staffer in a policy process that lied both the public and Congress into a war that , unbeknownst to me at the time , experts inside the government accurately predicted would lead to catastrophe .
The very word catastrophe , almost unknown in the dry language of bureaucracy , was uttered directly to the president .
Clark Clifford , longtime and highly trusted adviser to U.S. presidents , told President Lyndon Johnson in July 1965 : “ If we lose fifty thousand men there , it will be catastrophic in this country .
Five years , billions of dollars , hundreds of thousands of men  this is not for us .
. . . ”
But it was for us , casualties included , after Johnson launched an open - ended escalation just three days later .
In time , Clifford ’s estimates were all exceeded : Before our ground war was ended in eight years ( not five ) , the cost in dollars was in hundreds of billions , over five hundred thousand men served in Vietnam in a single year ( 1968 ) out of three million altogether , and  uncannily close to his predicted figure  more than fifty - eight thousand soldiers had died .
Clifford ’s prophecy in his face - to - face session with the president at Camp David  “ I ca n’t see anything but catastrophe for our nation in this area ”  could not have been more urgent in tone or , tragically , more prescient .
And Clifford ’s was not a lone voice .
Johnson ’s vice president , Hubert H. Humphrey , had used almost the same words with him five months earlier ; others , including Johnson ’s career - long mentor Senator Richard Russell , had also made the same argument .
Yet Johnson went ahead regardless .
Why ?
I have pondered and researched that question for forty years .
( The documentation in the Pentagon Papers provides no adequate answer . )
But one seemingly plausible and still widely believed answer can be ruled out .
The escalation in Vietnam was not the result of a universal failure of foresight among the president ’s advisers , or to a lack of authoritative , precise , and urgently expressed warnings against his choice of policy .
The nuclear arms race , in which I was intimately involved between 1958 and 1964 as a RAND Corporation analyst serving the executive branch , is a moral catastrophe on a scale without precedent in human history , even though its full tragic potential has not yet occurred .
The arms race involved  under both Democratic and Republican administrations , soon joined by the USSR  the mutual construction of a physical and organizational capability for destruction of most of the world ’s population within a matter of hours .
That project  building two matched and opposed “ doomsday machines ” and keeping them on hair - trigger alert  is the most irresponsible policy in human experience , involving as it does a genuine possibility of creating an irreversible catastrophe for humanity and most other living species on a scale that the world has not seen since the dinosaurs perished sixty million years ago .
Even if the system were decommissioned totally  and it is not yet remotely close to being dismantled  such a course of action would not cancel out the fact that over the past sixty years , a moral cataclysm has already occurred , with ominous implications for the future of life on earth .
I have been trying since 1967  when I realized that the Vietnam War must end  to understand how we got into that war , and why it was so hard to end it .
Since 1961 , even earlier , I have viewed the nuclear arms race as an ongoing catastrophe that has to be reversed , and a situation that has to be understood .
I assumed then , and still believe , that understanding the past and present of these realities is essential to changing them .
In my life and work , I have tried to do what Dr. Gerstein ’s book is trying to help us do : to understand these processes in a way that will help us avert them in the future .
A major theme to be gained from this important book is that organizations do not routinely and systematically learn from past errors and disasters  in fact , they rarely ever do .
This intentional lack of oversight can partly explain why our predicament in Iraq is so precisely close to the Vietnam experience , both in the way that we got into the war , deceptively and unconstitutionally , and in the way the war is being conducted and prolonged .
It might not seem surprising that after thirty years , a generation of decision - makers and voters would have come along that knew little about the past experience in Vietnam .
What is more dismaying is to realize that much the same processes  the same foolish and disastrous decision - making , the same misleading rationales for aggression  are going on right now with respect to Iran , with little political opposition , just three years after the invasion of Iraq , and while the brutal and tragic consequences of that occupation are still in front of our eyes every day .
One reason for this folly is that many aspects of disasters in decision - making are known only within the organization , and not even by many insiders at that .
The organizations involved tend not to make relevant and detailed studies of past errors , let alone reveal them outside the organization .
In fact , the risk that such a study or investigation might leak to the outside is a factor sufficient to keep inquiries from being made in the first place .
Making or keeping possibly incriminating documentation earlier , at the time of the decision , or later is similarly sidestepped .
This deliberate decision within organizations not to try to learn internally what has gone wrong constitutes what I have called , with respect to Vietnam , an anti-learning mechanism .
Avoiding improved performance is not the point of the mechanism .
But because studying present and past faulty decision - making risks may invite blame and organizational , political , perhaps even legal penalties , those outcomes “ outweigh ” the benefits of clearly understanding what needs to be changed within the organization .
The valuable cases studies , analyses , and information in the pages of this book were not provided by the organizations involved .
This compendium arose from the accounts of individual whistle - blowers , journalistic investigations , and in some cases congressional action  and from Dr. Gerstein ’s own initiative in collecting and analyzing the data .
Did any one of the organizations detailed herein conduct a comparable study ?
Quite possibly not a single one .
And even if they did , they certainly did n’t publish the results in a way that would allow other organizations and individuals to learn from their mistakes .
Societally , then , we do n’t have an easy way to learn from organizational mistakes of the past .
That ’s one reason that disasters are so likely , and why comparable disasters occur again and again , across organizations and even within the same organizations .
In the case of Vietnam , Americans did not learn from the French or Japanese occupations before ours .
Nor did Republicans under Nixon manage to learn from Democratic missteps before theirs .
Specifically , there was no systematic study of the Pentagon Papers , which were available within the Defense Department to the Nixon administration , but no one ever admitted to having read them or even to directing their staff to analyze possible lessons from them .
( I personally urged Henry Kissinger , in a discussion at the Western White House in 1970 , to do both of these , or at least the latter , but he later claimed he had never read anything of them or about them , though he had a copy available to him . )
As far as we know , Secretary of Defense Laird , Henry Kissinger , and others had no interest in the documentary record and analysis of twenty - three years of decision - making in the same geographic area , against precisely the same adversaries .
And so they ended up committing many of the mistakes made by those who ’d gone before , with the same results .
This “ anti- learning ” phenomenon also explains why it is possible to reproduce our experience in Vietnam years later in Iraq , and now , from Iraq to Iran .
In sum , there is strong and successful resistance within many organizations to studying or recording past actions leading to catastrophe  because doing so would reveal errors , lies , or even crimes .
There is no substitute for the kind of comparative study analysis Dr. Gerstein shares on these pages .
I hope this book is read widely ; if we are to avoid the kinds of disasters and catastrophes described , we first need to understand them .
Flirting with Disaster is a pathbreaking , indispensable step toward such a goal .

It 's an interesting week in the world of LEDs : on the weekend we heard about ultra-cheap ones , and today Osram ( yes , the lightbulb people ) has news that they 've pushed white LEDs to world - record brightness .
By optimizing the diode , light converter and the package , their lab test squeezed 500 lumens out of a single LED at 1.4A .
That 's bright enough for projector tech , and certainly makes the single unit good for car lighting and even interior lights .
At a lower , more optimal , current the 1 mm - square white LED had an efficiency of 136 lumens / W which makes it about twice as efficient as standard fluorescent lamps and 10 times a normal bulb .
Press release below .
The researchers at Purdue University are just full of bright ideas these days , and this weekend was
OSRAM Achieves Quantum Leap in Brightness and Efficiency of White LEDs
SANTA CLARA , Calif. —( Business Wire ) — Jul. 21 , 2008
By improving all the technologies involved in the manufacture of LEDs , OSRAM development engineers have achieved new records for the brightness and efficiency of white LEDs in the laboratory .
Under standard conditions with an operating current of 350 mA , brightness peaked at a value of 155 lm , and efficiency at 136 lm / W .
In generating these results , researchers used white prototype LEDs with 1 mm - square chips .
The light produced had a color temperature of 5000 K , with color coordinates at 0.349/0.393 ( cx / cy ) .
The key to OSRAM 's success was the efficient interplay among all the advances made in materials and technologies .
A perfectly matched system of optimized chip technology , a highly advanced and extremely efficient light converter , and a special high - performance package all combined to produce the world record performance results .
Potential applications for this high - performance LED technology include general illumination , the automotive sector , and any application that calls for large , high - power LEDs .
These semiconductor light sources are also suitable for high operating currents .
At 1.4 A , they can produce up to 500 lm of white light .
This means that in the future the LEDs can also be used for projection applications as blue and green chip versions .
Dr. Rudiger Muller , CEO at OSRAM Opto Semiconductors , commented : " It was the successful convergence of OSRAM know - how in different fields that led to these new records in efficiency and brightness .
Starting with the light converter , we will be gradually moving these new developments into production . "
OSRAM has already applied for patents for the technologies that lie behind these world record performance levels

Today in Missouri , John McCain said that all of Obama ’s solutions to energy problems involve raising taxes .
“ For his part , Senator Obama has a different outlook on all of this .
Instead of new energy production , he wants new energy taxes , ” McCain said .
He also criticized Obama for not supporting his gas tax holiday , “ And he ’s against any tax relief to give folks a break at the pump .
I ’ve noticed a pattern here .
When the speechmaking is over and you stop to figure out what all the rhetoric really amounts to , the answer is usually some new tax .
For Senator Obama , the solution to every problem and the answer to every challenge is a new tax .
And he is convinced that a 1970 ’s - style windfall profits tax is just what America needs in the 21st Century . ”
McCain ’s alternative energy solution is to build 100 new nuclear reactors in the United States .
Of course , this easier said than done as nobody wants a nuclear reactor in their community or back yard .
What I find funny is the contradiction that McCain is supposed to be an environmentally conscious Republican , yet he is willing to ruin the environment by burying nuclear waste in our ground .
If the nation would switch to nuclear power , the prime beneficiary would be the energy companies , who are largely supporting McCain in this election .

I honestly do n’t believe that McCain ’s portrait of Obama as a tax and spend liberal will have any impact on voters whose primary concerns seem to be the economy , the war , and healthcare .
When the economy is good , the Republican tax issue works , but when the economy is bad , it tends to fall flat on its face .
Voters do n’t care about taxes right now , they want the price of food and gas to come down , they want to go back to building equity in their homes , and they want to be able to go see a doctor .
It seems that John McCain ’s answer to every policy question is to propose a tax cut , and criticize his opponent .
Obama has firmly branded himself as a new kind of politics , so this old school mudslinging from McCain is certain to fail .
McCain does n’t have any solutions for the problems that matter .
In fact , he does n’t seem to be very interested in the issues that voters consider most important .
McCain can keep quoting from the old Republican playbook , but it wo n’t work against Barack Obama .

Scientists at the California Institute of Technology have developed a new strategy for creating " liquid metal " that makes it able to bend significantly without breaking , while retaining a strength twice that of titanium .
It is among the toughest , or least brittle , known materials , and could be used anywhere that strong metal alloys are traditionally found , but may prove most useful in the aerospace industry , where lower density means fuel savings .
When commercialized metallic glass known as Liquidmetal and Vitreloy hit the market several years ago in the forms of golf clubs and baseball bats , it was too brittle to withstand much duress .
Now , says Douglas Hofmann , a Caltech materials science graduate student and lead author of a paper presenting the method for making the new material , it can be made to flex and can be produced at relatively low cost .
" Metallic glasses now have among the highest toughness of any materials , " he says .
Like window glass , metallic glass has no crystalline structure , but it is made with combinations of zirconium , titanium , copper , nickel , platinum , or other metals .
Although the random arrangement of elements makes the material as strong as some of the strongest known metals , it also makes it very brittle .
Most other metals deform plastically , meaning that under a heavy load , the deformation before ultimate fracture is permanent .
Metallic glass behaves like an elastic band , which regains its original shape when released , but snaps when stretched past a certain point .
A piece of metallic glass with any substantial thickness shattered easily when it was bent , and , Hofmann points out , " you could n't build a bridge out of it .
It breaks with no visual precursor .
" Many researchers in metallic glasses are trying to make them useful in structural applications , " Hofmann says .
He and his colleagues at Caltech have finally accomplished exactly that .
They experimented with different combinations of metals to create a new version by manipulating the ratios of starting materials .
They were guided by previous work by coauthor William Johnson , Caltech 's Mettler Professor of Engineering and Applied Science , and his collaborators .
Over the past two decades , these scientists had found that ductility -- the ability of a material to deform in tension before breaking -- was linked to the formation of branching , crystalline structures called dendrites within the metallic glass .
The team experimented first with the size of the dendrites .
Hofmann and Johnson started by noting that when metallic glasses are bent , 10 - nanometer - wide features called shear bands rip right through glass that is thicker than one millimeter , but are stabilized in thin glass .
" The bending experiments told us that the size of the particles we need to add is proportional to the length scale of the shear bands before they become catastrophic , " Hofmann describes .
In this time of exploding interest in nanotechnology , Hofmann was surprised to find that the dendrites had to be on the order of hundreds of microns in size , many thousands of times the size of the shear bands .
The second major insight was that they also had to be softer than the surrounding metallic glass .
Because they are crystalline , the dendrites deform plastically , and their size blocks a single shear band from growing into a catastrophic crack .
" It takes more energy to move a shear band forward than it takes to form a new shear band , " notes Hofmann .
" We took an alloy that broke with one shear band and made it make countless shear bands .
" We took a metallic glass , which is considered a brittle material , and showed that by making a designed composite out of it , we can span the entire space of toughness , " Hofmann remarks .
" The tougher it is , the harder it is to drive a crack through it .
Now we have ductility and toughness , " he claims .
Because the new metallic glass is tough and strong and has relatively low density , its obvious applications would be in any structure that incorporates titanium .
In aerospace technology , these properties are crucial to minimizing weight and saving fuel costs .
Rumours have emerged that a sex tape starring Jessica Simpson will appear online .
According to the Daily Sport , the home movie , which features popstar and actress Simpson engaging in a number of sex acts with her ex-husband Nick Lachey , has been acquired by the same people who released Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee 's holiday sex video .
A source said : " Jessica is horrified her name and ' sex tape ' are being mentioned in the same sentence .
She 's always been a girl of high morals and principles . "
The tape will reportedly be distributed online unless Simpson pays an undisclosed fee to keep it out of the public domain .
Simpson and Lachey , who starred in the MTV reality show Newlyweds , divorced in 2006 .
Last month , a sex tape starring Mini - Me actor Verne Troyer and a former girlfriend leaked on the internet .

Even with gas prices cresting above $ 4 a gallon , large SUVs , pickup trucks and even Toyota Priuses barrel down freeways here in suburban Detroit at more than 75 miles per hour -- well beyond the 55 mph that was the national speed limit during the ' 70s and ' 80s .
If the U.S. Energy Department 's calculations are right , all these lead foots could save the equivalent of 29 cents to 94 cents a gallon if they slowed down just to 60 mph -- and reduce the fuel they burn by about 7 % to 23 % .
But most of my neighbors and I still choose to hit the gas rather than add 10 or 15 minutes to our commute times .
While energy policy debates are abstract , the speed you drive on the freeway is real .
Most Americans are in favor of burning less " foreign oil . "
Not as many want to slow down to achieve that goal .
This is cognitive dissonance on a mass scale .
It would be good to talk this out , and Americans will likely get that chance .
The idea of adopting a nationwide , slower speed limit is coming around again .
The federally mandated 55 mile per hour speed limit put into force in 1974 by the Nixon administration did curb fuel consumption .
But it was one of the most unpopular moves the government made during the energy crisis of that decade .
One of the few Americans who might have a good word to say about the old " double nickel " is Sammy Hagar , the rocker who scored a hit with a song titled , " I Can't Drive 55 . "

WASHINGTON – The Associated Press has learned that now - defunct IndyMac Bancorp is under investigation for possible fraud in connection with home loans made to risky borrowers .
It was not immediately clear how long the FBI ’s probe of the bank has been ongoing .
The investigation is focused on the company – which was taken over last Friday by the FDIC – and not individuals who ran it , according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation .

As you know if you ’ve looked over the key findings of our Follow the Oil Money database , Senators who vote against clean energy take on average 3 times more oil money than those who vote for clean energy .
Last week ’s vote on the Lieberman – Warner bill was true to form .
We ran the vote count through our database and found that Senators who voted against the bill took on average nearly three times as much money from the oil industry since 2000 as those who voted for our climate .
Avg Oil / Gas Money Per Vote
Yea ( 48 ) $ 54,948
Nay ( 36 ) $ 159,288
There were also 16 Senators who did n’t vote and their average was even higher – $ 160,535 .
Thats mostly because McCain , Clinton , and Obama are in this category .

The defendant confessed to spying and has asked for clemency
An Iranian man has been sentenced to death for spying for Israel , according to reports from Tehran .
Ali Ashtari was found guilty of sending " sensitive information on military , defence and research centres " to Iran 's arch foe in the region , reports say .
Israeli officials have been quoted as saying that Israel was not familiar with the case .
Iranian media say he was put on trial on Saturday .
He confessed to charges against him and asked for clemency .
Mr Ashtari has 20 days to appeal against the verdict handed down by a revolutionary court .
Iranian state TV said Mr Ashtari was a 45 - year - old tradesman in electronic merchandise who supplied electronic devices to military bases and research centres .
The material he reported to have sent to Israel included information about his country 's Atomic Energy Organisation .
An official is quoted saying that Mr Ashtari was trying to set up links between Iranian experts and members of the Israeli foreign intelligence service Mossad .
The text of his alleged confession is reported by Fars news agency , which says Mossad gave him $ 50,000 to supply internet cables and satellite phones to " special customers " in the hope of enabling Israel to spy on their communications .
" I am not sure what they intended to do as before I sold these to my customers I was arrested , " he added .
Correspondents say the verdict comes amid an intensifying war of words between Iran and Israel , which has threatened military action to halt Iran 's controversial nuclear programme .

About one in three people shot with a Taser by the RCMP receive injuries that require medical attention , according to a joint investigation by CBC News / Radio - Canada and the Canadian Press .
The media outlets , which analyzed the Taser - use forms RCMP officers are required to fill out if they draw a stun gun , examined reports from 2002 to 2007 .
According to the data , 28 per cent , or 910 of the 3,226 people who were shot , had to go to a medical facility .
But a detailed examination of the forms revealed that many more people are injured , yet never see a doctor .
In three years worth of reports obtained under Access to Information legislation , people suffered injuries including burns , puncture wounds from the probes , and head wounds from falling .
In many cases , however , the person was not taken for medical treatment .
More recent forms had the sections on injuries blacked out .
The investigation suggests some of those incidents resulted in injuries that are not included in the 28 per cent figure .

Editor 's note : CNN does not usually identify children of alleged abuse , but in this case the girl and her family gave CNN permission to tell her story and use her name .
Nujood Ali , 10 , has been chastised by some in Yemen for speaking out about her arranged marriage .
SANAA , Yemen ( CNN ) -- Nujood Ali is 10 years old , but she already has been married and divorced .
It was an arranged marriage in which she said a husband three times her age routinely beat and raped her .
" When I got married , I was afraid .
I did n't want to leave home .
I wanted to stay with my brothers and sisters and my mom and dad , " she said , speaking to CNN with the permission of her parents .
" I did n't want to sleep with him , but he forced me to .
He hit me , insulted me . "
As she plays marbles with her brothers and sister , Nujood is a portrait of innocence , with a shy smile and a playful nature .
But what happened evokes anger and shame .
Asked if what she went through was torture , she nods quietly .
Watch Nujod describe what happened »
Nujood 's parents married her off in February to a man in his 30s whom she describes as old and ugly .
Her parents said they thought they were putting her in the care of her husband 's family , but Nujood said he would often beat her into submission .
Nujood then turned to her family for mercy .
" When I heard , my heart burned for her ; he was n't supposed to sleep with her , " said Nujood 's mother , who asked not to be identified .
But , initially , she also told her daughter she could not help her -- that she belonged to her husband now .
Nujood 's father , Ali Mohammed Ahdal , said he is angry about what happened to his daughter .
" He was a criminal , a criminal .
He did hateful things to her , " he said .
" He did n't keep his promise to me that he would n't go near her until she was 20 . "
When contacted by CNN , the girl 's former husband declined to comment .
Nujood 's parents , like so many others in Yemen , struck a social bargain when they decided to have their daughter wed .
More than half of all Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 , according to Oxfam International , a nonprofit group that fights global poverty and injustice .
Many times girls are forced to marry older men , including some who already have at least one wife , Oxfam said .
According to tribal customs , the girls are no longer viewed as a financial or moral burden to their parents .
" There is always a fear that the girl will do something to dishonor the family :
She will run away with a guy , she will have relations with a boy .
So this is always the phobia that the families have , " said Suha Bashren of Oxfam International .
Bashren calls the tradition of child brides in Yemen a national crisis .
She works with young girls to protect them from early marriage , abuse and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world .
The Yemeni government is holding legal and religious workshops to try to deal with the issue of early marriage .
But experts say marrying off a young daughter is generally still seen as the right thing to do .
" A lot of people in the public do n't think that this is wrong or that what happened to her was abuse , " Bashren said .
In Yemen , there is nothing new or extraordinary about Nujood 's story because children have been married off for generations .
The country 's legal minimum age for marriage was 15 till a decade ago , when the law was changed to allow for children even younger to be wed .
But what is most unusual is that this young girl took such an intensely private dispute and went public with it .
Nujood said she made up her mind to escape from her husband , describing how on a visit to her parents ' home she broke free and traveled to the central courthouse across town and demanded to speak to a judge .
" He asked me , ' What do you want ? '
And I said , ' I want a divorce . '
And he said , ' You 're married ? '
And I said , ' Yes , ' " she recalled .
What unfolded in those few days in April gripped the country on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula .
Nujood got her divorce , but based on the principles of Islamic Sharia law , her husband was compensated , not prosecuted .
Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $ 200 .
The human rights lawyer who represented her donated the money .
But for this determined spirit , it was still a sweet victory .
" I did this so that people would listen and think about not marrying their daughters off as young as I was , " she said with a shy smile .
Now back at the family home , she said she wo n't go outside to play -- that all the attention bothers her .
Some still condemn the young girl for speaking out , believing that she should n't have challenged convention .
Human rights advocates said it will take more than a generation if this practice is to change in Yemen for other children .
" These girls are living in a misery that no one is talking about , " Oxfam 's Bashren said .

Three demonstrators scaled cables near the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge today and unfurled banners intended to draw attention to Chinese human rights violations in Tibet .
The protest by Students for a Free Tibet came the day before the Olympic Torch is to arrive in San Francisco for its only North American stop before this summer 's games in Beijing .
The protesters , two men and a woman , scaled the cables around 10:30 a.m. , and unfurled two banners around 11:20 a.m .
One banner read , " One World , One Dream , Free Tibet 08 , " a play on the official slogan of this year 's Olympic Games , " One World , One Dream . "
The other read simply , " Free Tibet . "
The protesters also hung two Tibetan flags .
The activists used climbing gear to reach a spot 150 feet over the roadway and 370 feet above the water .
They rappelled down about 1 p.m. and were arrested by California Highway Patrol officers .
Iron workers will remove the banners and flags , authorities said .
California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Mary Ziegenbein said police arrested another four activists who did not scale the cables .
Bridge manager Kary Witt said cameras are trained on the span , but that authorities at first had n't realized that protesters were about to climb the cables because they wore " ordinary " clothing and pushed a baby stroller .
Their " Team Tibet " T - shirts were covered , and their banners and climbing gear were disguised by the stroller , he said .
Witt said the group came down after he went out with a bullhorn and pleaded with them .
He told the activists that they were posing a danger to themselves and bridge employees .
It took the group an hour to get down , Witt said , partly because the female protester got caught in one of the banners and needed help getting untangled .
Arrested were Mac Sutherlin , 30 , of Sausalito ; Hannah Strange , 29 , of Oakland ; Duane Martinez , 27 , of Sausalito ; Alexandra Taub , 22 , of Vancouver ; Thomas Parkin , 38 , of San Francisco ; Tashi Sharzur , 47 , of San Mateo ; and Leslie Kaup , 31 , of St. Paul , Minn .
All were booked on suspicion of felony conspiracy and misdemeanor causing a public nuisance , the CHP said .
Sutherlin , Strange and Martinez , the three who climbed the cables , were also booked on suspicion of misdemeanor trespassing , the CHP said .
Yangchen Lhamo , a Tibetan American who lives in San Francisco , said Students for a Free Tibet hopes to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep the torch out of Tibet this summer .
It is scheduled to pass through Tibet on June 19 - 21 .
Lhamo said the group planned other protests Tuesday and Wednesday that she said would be peaceful .
On Tuesday , there will be an alternative torch event , the celebration of the Tibetan Freedom Torch , beginning at 11 a.m. at United Nations Plaza in San Francisco .
A number of visitors who were prevented from crossing the bridge for several hours appeared to take the protest in stride .
Cincinnati resident Jim Hayden , 62 , who is visiting San Francisco for the first time , said he was well aware of the city 's reputation for political activity .
" If they 're going to do it , do it here , " Hayden said .
" These people have their point of view , and find very strange ways to express them . "
How To Find The Best Gaming Deals on eBay
A decade ago , it was quite easy to find real bargains on eBay .
Now that the site is a mainstream marketplace , most items actually sell for what you might expect they are worth — and sometimes much more .
As the community of eBay buyers grows , it can be increasingly frustrating if you are looking for a really good deal .
Since one of the real appeals of classic gaming is being able to experience a lot of gaming on a budget , I wanted to help everyone make the most of eBay and find the best deals possible .
While some of these tips may be common knowledge to experienced eBayers , I hope that you can at least pull away a nugget of valuable info from this guide .
If you have any additional tips to add , be sure to add them in the comments section below .
Make A Wishlist
If you plan on just searching and browsing around on eBay for good deal without a real purpose , you probably wo n’t accomplish much .
Instead of flying blind , think of what exactly what items you want to build your collection .
If it helps , make a wish list for yourself that lists all the exact items you want and put them in order of what you want most .
Once you have defined goals for your shopping , think of all the search terms that could apply to your wish list .
Some items may be listed under more that one term .
Know A Good Deal When You See One
Once you know what items you are looking for , you should establish what the going rate for those items may be .
Luckily , eBay has a way to see exactly what items have been selling for over the last 30 days .
To find out the recent value for an item on eBay , just do a search for the item just like you normally would .
Once the search is finished , scroll down and look in the left sidebar for the “ Completed Auctions ” checkbox in the “ Search Options ” section .
( see image item 1 ) Check the box and hit the “ Show Auctions ” button below .
The search results will then refresh with all the auctions for that search that closed in the last 30 days .
[ check out this sample Gunstar Heroes completed auction search ]
If the price is in the completed auctions listing is in red , that means that the item did not receive any bids and did not sell ( it was probably was priced too high ) .
Of course , that also means that the items with prices in green actually did sell .
( see image item 2 )
Once you have the completed auction results in front of you , you can sort the results by price ( by selecting “ Price + Shipping : Highest First ” from the sort drop - down box ) .
( see image item 3 ) Once the items are sorted , you can more easily see the average selling prices group together in the middle .
You can also see what the rock - bottom prices have been .
( This is the method I use for I use for both the Cheapest Games and Rare & Valuable Series )
Does The Condition of the Game Matter ?
If you are a meticulous collector , you probably want to have all your games in good condition and complete with boxes and manuals .
If that is the case , this tip does n’t really apply to you .
However , if you only really care about the game itself ( or maybe you just do n’t care about the manual ) be on the lookout for listing that feature cart - only , disc- only , missing manual , or broken case games .
These little things matter a great deal to collectors , so if you could care less , you can get the game dirt cheap in most cases .
If you would like to see how much of a difference the condition of game makes in value for the most popular consoles history has to offer , take a look at this analysis I did on my article entitled , Comparing Massive Markups For Pristine Retro Games .
As you can see from that article , some newer games like those for the Dreamcast or Playstation will almost always come with cases , but every now and then somebody lists some disc - only games at a discount .
Some systems like the Saturn and Sega CD came in fragile cases that are now becoming a rarity , so those disc - only games should be relatively easy to find .
Take A Chance on Untested / “ As - Is ” Equipment
A lot of times sellers that run a resale business on eBay or people that are missing cables for systems do n’t have time or the ability to test everything out well .
You can usually score these systems at a nice discount as you are taking a bit of a gamble on them .
Older consoles do n’t usually break too easily , so the odds are in your favor that the machine is fine .
( You might want to check the seller ’s feedback just to get some reassurance )
On some occasions you might even see auctions for consoles where the seller specifically says that the machine is n’t working properly and they do n’t have time to fix it .
While console repairs are far from my specialty , I know of many people that can perform relatively quick and easy fixes on the machines to get them back to full health .
( You can always ask questions in our Technical Help forum if you need help )
Also , if for some reason you ca n’t get the machine working , you can always use the remaining parts for future repairs or use the cases for mod / repainting work .
I think the best example I have seen recently using this technique is our very own Raztat who scored 30 Sega Dreamcasts for $ 50 including shipping .
They were claimed to be duds , but he has already found that seven of them work fine .
Many of the rest have controller port issues that could be fixed if somebody wanted to go through the effort .
( see his blog post here )
Look For Spelling / Wording Variations
This is an old - school eBay trick and many other experienced eBay shoppers will be looking for these as well .
However , it is still worth mentioning as it may just give you an edge over a few other people .
Sometimes sellers may misspell the title of a game or system .
( I ’ve even seen people call a Sega Saturn a “ Sega CD ” machine ) .
Obviously , it will be very challenging to think of every way a person could mistake the name of an item , but if you are serious about shopping for a certain game or system , think of the different ways it may be spelled or worded .
Services like Missing - Auctions.com and MisspelledAuctions.com let you check eBay for item misspellings .
There are also different variations on how people label different games and systems .
Two popular examples are “ SNES ” vs “ Super Nintendo ” and “ Playstation ” vs “ PS1 ” vs “ PSOne ” vs “ PSX ” .
Be sure to think of the different ways people might list their items and search for them with the different variations .
Buy Games out of Season
While video games may not have as much of a defined season as some products , there is a relatively surprising trend in overall game sales .
As you can see from this article on Videogame Price Charts , there is a pretty large dip in game values starting in June and ending right before the Christmas rush .
This came to a bit of a surprise to me as I always did more game buying in the summer when I was when I was out of school , but this just goes to show how much retail power the Christmas season really has .
Not only do you have people buying hardware , games , and accessories in November and December , but you also have the recipients of those gifts buying additional items to complement their gift in January and the following months .
This trend may have the strongest effect on newer games , but it should effect on older games as well .
Just from my personally experiences in selling video cables for consoles likes the Genesis and Dreamcast , I ’ve always been amazed on how many people mention that they are giving classic gaming goodies to their friends and family for Christmas .
Combine Shipping to Cut Costs
And as anybody that spends much time on eBay knows , shipping costs can add a lot to the final purchase price for the buyer .
However , many times when somebody is cleaning out a lot of their old gaming stuff or the seller is has a dedicated eBay business , they may have many gaming auctions up at a given time and may be willing to combine shipping costs for multiple items in order to save you a lot of money .
Once you have found an item that you would like to purchase , check out the seller ’s other auction listings to see if they have anything else to offer .
If they do , check in the item descriptions to see if they offer Combined Shipping discounts .
Even if they do n’t mention it but you are very interested in more than one of their auctions , it may very well be worth your time to send the seller an email to see if they combine shipping costs .
Look for Groups of Systems & Games
Not only does it help when combining more than one auction , but you can also save on shipping costs and on the price of the items themselves when you purchase large groups of games and / or consoles .
e Bay is filled with people that are selling entire collections of games or just their whole set of console , accessories , and games for a given platform .
While you might not want every single item in the lot , you should get a nice discount because every other bidder will probably be in the same boat .
This is not only a great way to start a collection of your own , but you can also trade or sell off the items you do n’t want as much .
Use “ Search Title & Description ” for Multiple Items
Again , this tip builds upon the ideas of the ones before it .
If you are willing to bid on a large lot of games / systems / accessories , try to think of a few different games or items that would be for the same platform .
Chances are that if they are relatively common , there are at least one or two auctions that have two or more of the items you desire .
If you get a few items you would like in one auction , you might essentially get a few extra items for free .
So how do you find auctions that have more than one item of interest in one auction ?
This might initially seem like a challenge as in most cases , the seller wo n’t be able to list every item in the auction title ( which is what the standard eBay search is based off of ) .
However , most sellers will list the name of every game and accessory that is included in their auction within the listing ’s description .
If this is the case , you can check a box below the search area labeled “ Search Title & Description ” ( see image item 1 ) and resubmit your search query help you discover lots of auctions that should interest you .
( see image item 2 )
Let ’s say you are in the market for a Super Nintendo system in addition to a few of its most popular games : Super Mario World , Super Metroid , and Pilotwings .
If you want to test your luck , you could do a search ( with title and description ) for “ Super Mario World Metroid Pilotwings ” .
This search will see if there are any auctions that include all three of those games .
Unless this is your lucky day , you might not find any results .
That ’s ok , let ’s try for two out of three .
This time , take off Pilotwings – you may find two auctions that include those games .
Not bad !
Subscribe to RSS Feeds / Email Alerts
If you want to be able to keep track of all the items you are interested in without having to keep going to the site and performing searches , you have two great options .
First of all , you can sign up for eBay Favorite Searches email alerts .
If you are n’t familiar with Favorite searches , check out this link .
Once you have a search marked as a favorite , you can subscribe to some or all of your favorites via email alerts .
With these alerts , eBay will send you an email summary of all the new auctions that were listed that day that meet your search criteria .
The main downside of this method is that listings may be up to 24 hours old by the time you even have the email in your inbox .
By the time you actually read it , somebody else may have snatched a cheap Buy It Now auction .
If you need something quicker , you may want to look into RSS feeds .
If you frequently use a feed reader or have a homepage that supports RSS feeds , you can also subscribe to a number of eBay product - specific feeds .
( Read more about eBay RSS feeds and how RSS works )
Once you get these RSS feeds set up in your reader or home page , you will get new notifications every 30 minutes or so .
This can really give you the edge on other eager bidders .
Below you can see one of my personal eBay alerts for Official Dreamcast Magazines ( using Bloglines as my reader )
What is also nice about both the email and RSS notifications is that you never have to worry about missing an auction you were interested in as long as you check these alerts and they will save you a ton of time and effort .
These are especially useful for searches that do n’t turn up results very often .
So if you ’re still holding out for an auction that includes Super Mario World , Super Metroid , and Pilotwings , you can be alerted if it ever shows up .
Or maybe you ’re looking for an original steering wheel for an Outrun arcade machine or a Capcom Art Works book .
With any of these instances , you subscribe to the alerts for these searches and be notified when these relatively rare auctions ever surface .
Also , keep in mind that anything you can normally do on eBay to narrow your search ( product categories , price ranges , Buy It Now etc ) can be applied to your eBay email or RSS alerts .
So if you only want to be notified if a certain item is listed under a certain price , you can trim down you notifications to those that really interest you .
Jump on “ Buy - It - Now ”s
If you ’re like me , “ Buy It Now ” purchases can seem a little too spontaneous .
I ’m the type that likes to add items to my Watch List and think about them for a little while before bidding .
However , many times if you look back at the lowest sale prices on the Completed Auctions search ( see above ) , you ’ll notice that many of them we Buy It Now listings that got scooped up right away .
I ’ve been trying to get better about jumping on deals quickly , but it takes some dedication to beat your competition .
If you combine a few of the tips above such with the RSS feeds and Email Alerts , you are bound to find some cheap Buy It Now before everyone else does .
When you do , make sure you read over the description and terms fairly quickly to make sure you ’re getting what you think and double - check the seller ’s feedback .
Once everything looks good , make sure to buy it before others have the chance .
Auction Snipping
This controversial method is essentially waiting to the last possible moment to place your bid .
This tactic is losing its effectiveness as your most dedicated of competition will probably do the same thing and will still bid the most they are willing to pay , but if you are interested in an item that would n’t appeal to most people , you may be able to grab the winning bid from an unsuspecting newbie .
If you do n’t want to hover over all your auctions yourself , there are a few websites that will help you in your strategy .
Some services that have been recommended are AuctionStealer and GavelSnipe .
These services and most others like them only let you do a few free snipes per month with paid upgrades available .

The cunning masterminds behind the Storm worm are apparently rolling in great wealth .
The boffins at IBM estimate the worm is netting just under $ 2 million per day for its creators .
The Storm worm 's financial success comes from the fact that it has successfully created a massive collection of autonomously running computers , a.k.a. a botnet , which can be used to launch profitable spam attacks .

The sheer volume of spam that can be sent by harnessing the full power of the Storm worm is much greater than anything before .
Due to this fact , the money that is generated from spamming , as well as from business deals that are a result of said spam , is thought to be in the area of millions of dollars per day .
Clearly , we 're in the wrong business .

Rebooting the Indian green revolution
Amy Yee in New Delhi | May 03 , 2008
Ajit Singh , a farmer in the poor northern state of Uttar Pradesh , had never seen a computer until four years ago when ITC , the Indian agribusiness - to - hotels conglomerate , installed a PC in his village , Kurthia .
Now the thin 47 - year - old farmer visits the ITC station , known as an " e- choupal " after the Hindi term for " gathering place " , every day for online access to news­papers , crop prices , weather forecasts and farming techniques .
As ITC 's village manager , he passes on what he gleans to fellow farmers .
Knowing the fair market value of crops allows farmers to fetch better prices and circumvent local traders who used to dictate terms .
Farmers can also sell wheat and other crops to ITC .
The result has been a big jump in crop productivity .
Annual incomes in Kurthia have risen from Rs40,000 - Rs50,000 ( $ 1,000 - $ 1,230 ) before e-choupal to Rs100,000 - Rs120,000 now , says Mr Singh .
ITC has rolled out 6,400 e-choupals across India since 2000 .
The initiative has gained new relevance as New Delhi urgently tries to tackle threats to food security , the growing gap between rich and poor and stagnant agricultural growth that has added to soaring food prices .
India " needs another green revolution " , the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( Unescap ) recently urged .
" Growth and productivity in agriculture are slowing , and the green revolution has bypassed millions . "
India has the most to gain from improvements in agriculture because it is home to nearly two - thirds of Asia 's poor , most of whom rely on farming , Unescap said .
Middle - class Indians are eating more and better food .
Yet its population of 1.1bn is growing at about 1.4 per cent and food grain production increased just 0.9 per cent last year , according to ministry of agriculture statistics .
Agricultural growth has steadily decelerated because of years of under - investment as attention has focused on high - growth manufacturing and service industries .
But big strides can be made with relatively simple measures .
In Kurthia , which is 40 km from the bustling holy city of Varanasi , the e-choupal consists of a computer in a modest house rigged with a small satellite dish .
Farmers pose questions that are e-mailed to ITC ­agricultural scientists and experts at agricultural ­institutes .
Yogesh Bhrigulanshi , a farmer and the ITC local manager in nearby Bisuari village , says rice yields have risen 70 per cent , to 3,900 kg per acre , since the arrival of the e-choupal .
" We used to use fertiliser without any knowledge , " says Mr Bhrigulanshi .
" We used to use pesticides for any disease on plants .
Now we know which pesticide to use and if it needs to be used . "
ITC plans to invest $ 1bn on e-choupals in the period to 2015 to connect farmers to information , products and services .
The hope is that as rural incomes rise , farmers will buy more products and services , ranging from seeds and fertilisers to insurance and healthcare .
Rural standards of living have improved .
Mr Bhrigulanshi bought his second mobile phone last month and two years ago purchased a television .
His 11 - year - old son , wearing a white uniform and striped blue tie , goes to an English school that costs Rs25,000 ( $ 625 ) per year .
That compares to the $ 7 annual cost of his previous government school .
There is still a long way to go .
Farmers say there has been little improvement in roads , electricity and water over the years .
Government agricultural subsidies for fertiliser , pesticide and equipment do not reach them .
Subsidies should be provided through private parties , Mr Singh suggests .
They remain sceptical of the Indian government 's recent promises to invest heavily in agriculture and waive $ 15 bn ( Euro 9.7bn , 7.6bn pounds ) worth of loans to farmers .
Writing off bad loans means " defaulters benefit .
Those who have paid do not have any benefit , " opines Mr Bhrigulanshi .
" Government always talks about farmers when elections come , " adds Mr Singh .
" But practically , we are not seeing anything . "

The latest poll in Ireland has revealed a shock swing to the " no " side ahead of next week 's vote on the EU 's Lisbon treaty .
Carried out for the Irish Times , the TNS / mrbi poll shows that those saying they intend to vote " no " has almost doubled to 35 percent ( up 17 points ) since their last survey three weeks ago .
The " yes " side has seen a drop of five points to 30 percent , while those undecided clock in at 28 percent ( down 12 points ) and seven percent do not intend to vote .
According to a detailed break down by the Irish Times of the 1,000 - strong survey , the reason most often cited for voting " no " - 30 percent - is that voters say they do not know what is in the treaty or they do not understand the treaty .
Only five percent cited domestic reasons for voting " no . "
Those planning to vote " yes " said they would do so to keep Ireland closely involved in the EU .
" Yes " supporters also said they wanted to enable the bloc to work more effectively .
The poll revealed a clear socio- economic divide , with a majority of better - off voters intending to vote " yes , " and a majority among the working class planning a " no " vote .
Meanwhile , older voters tended to be more positive towards the treaty , but there was only a majority of " yes " supporters among the over - 50s .
The survey 's result comes despite the fact that Ireland 's main political parties all support the treaty , and shows there will have to be a large swing before the 12 June vote if it is to result in a " yes . "
Ireland is the only one of the 27 member states to hold a referendum on the EU treaty and is facing enormous pressure to secure a " yes " vote , with a rejection likely to scupper the ratification process in the rest of the bloc .
But Dublin has had a hard time trying to sell the treaty , as it has struggled to find a headline reason for voting for the charter that the ordinary voter perceives as directly affecting them .
Reading the treaty
In addition , senior politicians , including prime minister Brian Cowen , have admitted to not reading the entire document , while deputy prime minister Mary Coughlan when questioned gave an inaccurate answer on the future number of EU commissioners foreseen under the treaty .
On top of this , a government book explaining the treaty differs in important ways to a summary of the pact produced by the referendum commission , an independent body that manages referendums in Ireland .
Instead of focussing on the detail , the government has relied on appealing to Irish citizens ' generally pro-European stance , with warnings about " disasters " if the country votes " no . "
The " no " side has concentrated on single issues , saying the treaty will mean Ireland loses it powers over taxes and abortion while its traditional neutrality will be undermined – all of which the government has categorically denied .
Most of Europe will be focussed on Ireland when voters go to the polls next Thursday .
Some , however , are already planning for a possible " no " vote .
According to reports , the Czech Republic , which takes over the EU presidency on 1 January as the EU treaty is supposed to come into force , has prepared two papers how the EU should work in the first half of 2009 - one with the EU treaty in place and one without .
