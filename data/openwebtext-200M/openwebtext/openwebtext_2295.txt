You do n't have to lie awake for hours past your bedtime to have insomnia .
The condition can manifest itself in several ways .
Yes , you may have trouble falling asleep ( known as sleep - onset insomnia ) , but some people have problems staying asleep ( sleep - maintaining insomnia ) or waking up too early ( early morning awakening ) .
Sleep specialists may look for an underlying cause , such as a medical condition or psychological issue .
Here are 11 classifications of insomnia , developed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine .

Everyone loves a good tale of battles and blood – which is clearly evidenced by the plethora of movies and movie scenes based on them .
In this list , instead of just looking at great battles based on numbers or deaths , we are looking at battles that were strategically important or changed the methods of warfare .
This list only includes battles from before the time of Christ .
Later battles will be the subject of a future list .
I have generally avoided describing the actual events of the battles in order to present the overall historical impact .
You can use the “ source ” links to read more on each battle .
This list contains a competition – read more at the bottom of the list .
10 Carrhae 53 BC
The Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC was a decisive victory for the Parthian Spahbod Surena ( try saying that 10 times fast ! ) over the Roman general Crassus near the town of Carrhae ( now the present - day ruins of Harran , Turkey ) .
A Parthian force of 1,000 cataphracts and 9,000 horse archers under general Surena met the Romans at Carrhae .
Crassus ’ cavalry was screening ahead of the main force when they were engaged by the cataphracts , and the weapons his cavalry employed were not capable of piercing the cataphracts armor .
His cavalry was soon surrounded and routed , and his son Publius killed .
Rome was humiliated by this defeat , and this was made even worse by the fact that the Parthians had captured several Legionary Eagles .
It is also mentioned by Plutarch that the Parthians found the Roman prisoner of war that resembled Crassus the most , dressed him as a woman and paraded him through Parthia for all to see .
The capture of the golden Aquilae ( legionary battle standards ) by the Parthians was considered a grave moral defeat and evil omen for the Romans .
It required a generation of diplomacy before the Parthians returned them .
An important and unexpected implication of this battle was that it opened up the European continent to a new and beautiful material : silk .
However , the most immediate effect of the battle was that Carrhae was an indirect cause for the fall of the Republic , and the rise of the Empire .

9 Pydna 168 BC
The Battle of Pydna in 168 BC between Rome and the Macedonian Antigonid dynasty represents the ascendancy of Rome in the Hellenic / Hellenistic world and the end of the Antigonid line of kings , whose power traced back to Alexander III of Macedon .
It is often considered to be the classic example of the Macedonian phalanx against the Roman legion , and generally accepted as proving the superiority of the latter over the former .
This was not the final conflict between the two rivals , but it broke the back of Macedonian power .
The political consequences of the lost battle were severe .
The Senate ’s settlement included the deportation of all the royal officials and the permanent house arrest of Perseus .
The kingdom was divided into four republics that were heavily restricted from intercourse or trade with one another and with Greece .
There was a ruthless purge , with allegedly anti-Roman citizens being denounced by their compatriots and deported in large numbers ( 300 000 ) .

8 Ipsus 301 BC
The Battle of Ipsus was fought between some of the Diadochi ( the successors of Alexander the Great ) in 301 BC near the village of that name in Phrygia .
Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his son Demetrius I of Macedon were pitted against the coalition of three other companions of Alexander : Cassander , ruler of Macedon ; Lysimachus , ruler of Thrace ; and Seleucus I Nicator , ruler of Babylonia and Persia .
The battle opened with the usual slowly intensifying skirmishing between the two armies ’ light troops , with elephants eventually thrown into the fray by both sides .
Efforts were made by both sides to hamstring the enemy ’s elephants , but also had to hang back to protect their own .
Demetrius ’ superior right - flank cavalry drove Antiochus ’ wing back , but was halted in his attempted rear blow by Seleucus , who moved the elephant reserve to block him .
More missile troops moved to the unprotected Antigonid right flank , as Demetrius was unable to disengage from the elephants and enemy horse to his front .
At the beginning of the day , Antigonus had not been able to wear plate armor ; this disadvantage was unexpectedly used by an anonymous allied peltast , who killed him with a well - thrown javelin .
Without leadership and already beginning to flee , the Antigonid army completely disintegrated .
The last chance to reunite the Alexandrine Empire had now passed .
Antigonus had been the only general able to consistently defeat the other Successors ; without him , the last bonds the Empire had had began to dissolve .
Ipsus finalized the breakup of an empire , which may account for its obscurity ; despite that , it was still a critical battle in classical history and decided the character of the Hellenistic age .

7 Gaugamela 331 BC
The Battle of Gaugamela took place in 331 BC between Alexander the Great of Macedonia and Darius III of Achaemenid Persia .
The battle , which is also inaccurately called the Battle of Arbela , resulted in a massive victory for the Macedonians .
While Darius had a significant advantage in numbers , most of his troops were of a lower quality than Alexander ’s .
Alexander ’s pezhetairoi were armed with a six - meter spear , the sarissa .
The main Persian infantry was poorly trained and equipped in comparison to Alexander ’s pezhetairoi and hoplites .
After the battle , Parmenion rounded up the Persian baggage train while Alexander and his own bodyguard chased after Darius in hopes of catching up .
As at Issus , substantial amounts of loot were gained following the battle , with 4,000 talents captured , as well as the King ’s personal chariot and bow .
The war elephants were also captured .
In all , it was a disastrous defeat for the Persians , and possibly one of Alexander ’s finest victories .
At this point , the Persian Empire was divided into two halves – East and West .
Bessus murdered Darius , before fleeing eastwards .
Alexander would pursue Bessus , eventually capturing and executing him the following year .
The majority of the existing satraps were to give their loyalty to Alexander , and be allowed to keep their positions , however , the Persian Empire is traditionally considered to have fallen with the death of Darius .

6 Marathon 490 BC
The Battle of Marathon during the Greco - Persian Wars took place in 490 BC and was the culmination of King Darius I of Persia ’s first full scale attempt to conquer the remainder of Greece and incorporate it into the Persian Empire , which would secure the weakest portion of his western border .
The longest - lasting legacy of Marathon was the double envelopment .
Some historians have claimed it was random rather than a conscious decision by Miltiades – the Tyrant of the Greek Colonies .
In hoplitic battles , the two sides were usually stronger than the center because either they were the weakest point ( right side ) or the strongest point ( left side ) .
However , before Miltiades ( and after him until Epaminondas ) , this was only a matter of quality , not quantity .
Miltiades had personal experience from the Persian army and knew its weaknesses .
As his course of action after the battle shows ( invasions of the Cyclades islands ) , he had an integrated strategy upon defeating the Persians , hence there is no reason he could have not thought of a good tactic .
The double envelopment has been used ever since , such as when the German Army used a tactic at the battle of Tannenberg during World War I similar to that used by the Greeks at Marathon .

5 Cynoscephalae 197 BC
The Battle of Cynoscephalae was fought in Thessaly in 197 BC between the Roman army , led by Titus Quinctius Flamininus , and the Antigonid dynasty of Macedon , led by Philip V . This Macedonian defeat marks the passing of imperial power from the successors of Alexander the Great to Rome .
Along with the later Battle of Pydna , this defeat is often held to have demonstrated that the Macedonian phalanx , formerly the most effective fighting unit in the ancient world , was now obsolete , although in fact the phalanx was able to force the legions back and held their own with swords until twenty maniples fell upon their rear ( due to the weak Macedonian flanks and the Roman elephants routing the disordered Macedonian left flank ) .
As a consequence of his loss , Philip had to pay 1,000 talents to Rome , as well as disband his navy and most of his army .
He also had to send his son to Rome as a hostage .
The battle in many ways determined the subsequent history of the Mediterranean .
It also was a major turning point in how wars were fought .

4 Actium 31 BC
The Battle of Actium was the decisive engagement in the Final War of the Roman Republic between the forces of Octavian and those of the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra .
It was fought on September 2 , 31 BC , on the Ionian Sea near the Roman colony of Actium in Greece .
Octavian ’s fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa , while Antony ’s fleet was supported by the fleet of his lover , Cleopatra VII , queen of Ptolemaic Egypt .
The victory of Octavian ’s fleet enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its domains , leading to his adoption of the title of Princeps ( “ first citizen ” ) and his accepting the title of Augustus from the Senate .
As Augustus Caesar , he would preserve the trappings of a restored Republic , but many historians view his consolidation of power and the adoption of his honorifics flowing from his victory at Actium as the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire .
The political consequences of this sea battle were far - reaching .
As a result of the loss of his fleet , Mark Antony ’s army , which had begun as equal to that of Octavian ’s , deserted in large numbers .
In a communication breakdown , Antony came to believe that Cleopatra had been captured , and so he committed suicide .
Cleopatra heard the news about Mark Antony and , rather than risk being captured by Octavian , committed suicide herself , on August 12 , 30 BC .
She allowed herself to be bitten by a poisonous asp that was reportedly hidden for her in a basket of figs .

3 Siler River 73 BC
The Third Servile War , also called the Gladiator War , The Battle of Siler River , and The War of Spartacus by Plutarch , was the last of a series of unrelated and unsuccessful slave rebellions against the Roman Republic , known collectively as the Servile Wars .
The Third Servile War was the only one to directly threaten the Roman heartland of Italia and was doubly alarming to the Roman people due to the repeated successes of the rapidly growing band of rebel slaves against the Roman army between 73 and 71 BC .
The rebellion was finally crushed through the concentrated military effort of a single commander , Marcus Licinius Crassus , although the rebellion continued to have indirect effects on Roman politics for years to come .
The Third Servile War was significant to the broader history of ancient Rome mostly in its effect on the careers of Pompey and Crassus .
The two generals used their success in putting down the rebellion to further their political careers , using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor .
Their actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions and contributed to the eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire .

2 Pharsalus 48 BC
The Battle of Pharsalus was a decisive battle of Caesar ’s Civil War .
On August 9 , 48 BC , the battle was fought at Pharsalus in central Greece between forces of the Populares faction and forces of the Optimates faction .
Both factions field armies from the Roman Republic .
The Populares were led by Gaius Julius Caesar ( Caesar ) and the Optimates were led by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ( Pompey ) .
In addition to Pompey , the Optimates faction included most of the Roman Senate .
The victory of Caesar weakened the Senatorial forces and solidified his control over the Republic .
Pompey fled from Pharsalus to Egypt , where he was assassinated on the order of Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII .
The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the First Triumvirate .
The Roman Civil War , however , was not ended .
Pompey ’s two sons , the most important of whom was Sextus Pompeius , and the Pompeian faction led now by Labienus , survived and fought their cause in the name of Pompey the Great .
Caesar spent the next few years ‘ mopping up ’ remnants of the senatorial faction .
After finally completing this task , he was assassinated in a conspiracy arranged by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus .

1 Salamis 480 BC
The Battle of Salamis , was a decisive naval battle between the Greek city - states and Persia in September , 480 BC in the strait between Piraeus and Salamis Island , an island in the Saronic Gulf near Athens .
The Greeks were not in accord as to how to defend against the Persian army , but Athens under Themistocles used their navy to defeat the much larger Persian navy and force King Xerxes I of Persia to retreat .
The Greek victory marked the turning point of the campaign , leading to the eventual Persian defeat .
The Battle of Salamis has been described by many historians as the single most significant battle in human history .
The defeat of the Persian navy was instrumental in the eventual Persian defeat , as it dramatically shifted the war in Greece ’s favor .
Many historians argue that Greece ’s ensuing independence laid the foundations for Western civilization , most notably from the preservation of Athenian democracy , the concept of individual rights , relative freedom of the person , true philosophy , art and architecture .
Had the Persians won at Salamis , it is very likely that Xerxes would have succeeded in conquering all the Greek nations and passing to the European continent , thus preventing Western civilization ’s growth ( and even existence ) .
Given the influence of Western civilization on world history , as well as the achievements of Western culture itself , a failure of the Greeks to win at Salamis would almost certainly have had seriously important effects on the course of human history .

SAKURA , Japan ( Reuters ) - With animal feed and fertilizer prices at record highs , Japan ’s food recycling industry is seeing greater demand than ever before for pellets for pigs and poultry made from recycled leftovers .

Japan disposes of some 20 millions tonnes of food waste a year , five times as much as world food aid to the poor in 2007 .
The leftovers used to be dumped in land fills where they decomposed and produced the greenhouse gas methane .
But government legislation since 2001 has spurred a recycling industry that turns food scraps into animal feed and fertilizer , or ships leftovers off to facilities where the methane gas produced by rotting food is harnessed to power industrial plants .
“ Given higher fuel and feed prices , the ( food recycling ) business is on the rise now , ” said Yasufumi Miwa , researcher at Japan Research Institute Ltd .
Farmers had been loathe to use recycled animal feed , but rising feed prices have made them more receptive to recycled feed , which is about 50 percent cheaper than regular feed .
A pig farm in Akita Prefecture , northern Japan , has offset a 20 percent jump in compound feed prices in the past year by making its own recycled feed from scraps disposed by local food manufacturers .
“ We could have faced a critical situation this year if we did n’t produce feed by ourselves , ” said Hideki Sato , a spokesman at Sugayo Co , which currently raises 20,000 pigs .
FED UP
Former garbage truck driver Hiroyuki Yakou became so fed up with dumping loads of discarded food every day that he started a food recycling company , Agri Gaia System Co , Japan ’s largest recycled animal feed maker .
“ It really was a waste , ” said Yakou .
Nowadays , his drivers cart truckloads of rice balls , sandwiches and milk discarded by 1,200 Seven - Eleven stores to his factory on the outskirts of Tokyo where the food scraps are turned into dry and liquid animal feed for pigs and chickens .

The feed is not used for cattle or sheep due to strict health regulations to prevent Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) , more commonly known as Mad Cow ’s disease .
Food recyclers often use leftovers from convenience stores and restaurants where strict health laws mean unsold items must be thrown out at the end of the day .
“ They do n’t take disposed food from households as they are not in good conditions , ” said Miwa .
Japan imports about 75 percent of its feedstocks from abroad .
It is the world ’s biggest corn importer to feed animals .
But recent price hikes due to high corn and soy meal prices , the main ingredients in animal feed , has made recycled feed more popular .
Although it still accounts for only 1 percent of feedstocks in Japan , or about 150,000 tonnes in 2006 , double the volume of 2003 .
In Japan , companies such as food manufacturers , retailers and restaurants produce some 11 million tonnes of food waste a year .
They are responsible for disposing the waste , often paying hefty fees to have it carted away and dumped .
A revised recycling law introduced in Japan in December sets gradually increasing recycling targets for companies that dispose of more than 100 tonnes of food waste a year , adding to their incentive to work with feed recycling companies .
Japan ’s food industry , the biggest producer of food waste , recycles more than 70 percent of leftovers .
About half is turned into feed , less than 5 percent into methane and the rest into fertilizer .
“ At first , corporate waste was converted into manure , and more of the waste is now turned into feed , which is more lucrative , ” Miwa added .
Some have begun to use the waste to produce methane to save energy and at the same time reduce dumping costs .
Regional governments , which incinerate waste to reduce volume before dumping in landfills , are now trying to produce alternative energy from the waste .
Methane from food waste is used to generate electricity in some parts of Japan .
The Tokyo metropolitan government ’s cleaning service agency and Tokyo Gas Co began a test plant in February to produce methane and ethanol from waste from school meals .
It is the first plant in Japan to produce two types of fuel at the same time .
ANIMAL RIGHTS ?
At Yakou ’s plant , workers carefully sift through food carted in by cool trucks to remove non-edible objects , such as skewers and plastic , before sending the leftovers to a cooking facility .
The food waste is turned into two types of dry feed after a final heating process -- rich in fat and protein and less fat and protein but more carbohydrate -- and a liquid type from pasteurized drinks such as milk and chopped vegetables .
“ A blind test of pork shows respondents tell the difference immediately .
That ’s because the fat of our pork is sweeter than usual , ” Yakou said .
“ Another effect of tasty feed is that hens produce more eggs than usual ” .
Despite the ‘ waste not , want not ’ attitude , some animal rights activists and nutritionists are critical of feeding animals leftovers that have often passed their use - by - dates .
Junichi Kowaka , head of Japan Offspring Fund , a consumer interest NGO , said feed made from fast food may lack minerals necessary for both humans and animals .
“ I think the chances are high that the animals will get sick if they eat only that kind of feed while being kept in artificial environments , ” he said .

VIEWPOINT
Chris Rapley
The global population is higher than the Earth can sustain , argues the Director of the British Antarctic Survey in the first of a series of environmental opinion pieces on the BBC News website entitled The Green Room .
Solving environmental problems such as climate change is going to be impossible without tackling the issue , he says .
The welfare and quality of life of future generations will be the ineluctable casualty
Ten thousand delegates attended the recent Montreal Summit on the control of carbon emissions " beyond Kyoto " .
That 's a lot of people !
The conference organisation must have been daunting ; and just imagine arranging the hotel accommodation and restaurant facilities and dealing with the additional human - generated waste .
Imagine the carbon and nitrogen emissions from the associated air travel !
The 40 or more decisions made were announced as an historic success .
Supposing this proves to be so , will it be sufficient to secure an acceptable quality of life for the generations to come ?
What about the myriad other planetary - scale human impacts - for example on land cover , the water cycle , the health of ecosystems , and biodiversity ?
What about our release of other chemicals into the environment ?
What about our massive transport and mixing of biological material worldwide , and our unsustainable consumption of resources ?
Big foot
All of these effects interconnect and add up to the collective " footprint " of humankind on our planet 's life support systems .
The consequences of the human footprint extend to the ends of the Earth
The consequences extend to the ends of the Earth ( recall the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic ) and each is as difficult to predict and as challenging to deal with as the link between carbon emissions and climate .
It would surely be impractical and almost certainly ineffective to assemble 10,000 delegates to address each one of these issues , and especially to do so in the necessary " joined up " way ?
And in particular , what about the net 76 million annual rise in the world 's population , which currently stands at about 6.5 billion - more than twice what it was in 1960 - and which is heading towards eight billion or so by mid-century ) ?
That 's an annual increase 7,500 times the number of delegates in Montreal .
Imagine organising the accommodation , feeding arrangements , schooling , employment , medical care , cultural activities and general infrastructure - transport , power , water , communications , waste disposal - for a number of people slightly larger than the population of the UK , and doing it each year , year on year for the foreseeable future .
Combined with ongoing economic growth , what will be the effect on our collective human " footprint " ?
Will the planet cope ?
Steps to Utopia
Although reducing human emissions to the atmosphere is undoubtedly of critical importance , as are any and all measures to reduce the human environmental " footprint " , the truth is that the contribution of each individual cannot be reduced to zero .
Only the lack of the individual can bring it down to nothing .
The Montreal climate talks :
Did they have the issue right ?
So if we believe that the size of the human " footprint " is a serious problem ( and there is much evidence for this ) then a rational view would be that along with a raft of measures to reduce the footprint per person , the issue of population management must be addressed .
Let us assume ( reasonably ) that an optimum human population level exists , which would provide the physical and intellectual capacity to ensure a rich and fulfilling life for all , but would represent a call upon the services of the planet which would be benign and hence sustainable over the long term .
A scientific analysis can tell us what that optimum number is ( perhaps 2 - 3 billion ? ) .
With that number and a timescale as targets , a path to reach " Utopia " from where we are now is , in principle , a straightforward matter of identifying options , choosing the approach and then planning and navigating the route from source to destination .
Cinderella subject
In practice , of course , it is a bombshell of a topic , with profound and emotive issues of ethics , morality , equity and practicability .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Only the lack of the individual can bring the footprint down to nothing
Send us your comments
As found in China , practicability and acceptability can be particularly elusive .
So controversial is the subject that it has become the " Cinderella " of the great sustainability debate - rarely visible in public , or even in private .
In interdisciplinary meetings addressing how the planet functions as an integrated whole , demographers and population specialists are usually notable by their absence .
Rare indeed are the opportunities for religious leaders , philosophers , moralists , policymakers , politicians and indeed the " global public " to debate the trajectory of the world 's human population in the context of its stress on the Earth system , and to decide what might be done .
Unless and until this changes , summits such as that in Montreal which address only part of the problem will be limited to at best very modest success , with the welfare and quality of life of future generations the ineluctable casualty .

What are these ?
And what about Vancouver ?
Is it an even more hip version of Seattle ?
By Sara Robinson
British Columbia is a very small province — well under five million people — and a very big one , nearly twice the size of California .
The economy was entirely resource - based for most of its history , and still is ; but they ’ve worked very hard to get the movie and tech businesses up here , and succeeded wildly .
Because of this history , even though Vancouver is the original home of both Greenpeace and the Suzuki Foundation , environmental oversight is still not what it should be — certainly , not what I came to expect living in California , which I now realize was exceptional in many ways on that front .
Where you have a resource - based economy , you always have a network of Old Boys .
So , yes , there ’s that .
But the drive for “ peace , order , and good government ” runs deep , too ; and we ’re blessed with voters and newspapers who are very quick to say — loudly , but politely — “ Hey : that ai n’t right ! ”
Vancouver is a city of immigrants .
There are an estimated 250,000 American expats here , not to mention an equal number of east Indians ( mostly Punjabi ) and three quarters of a million Chinese who came fleeing the Hong Kong takeover a decade ago .
I live in an Iranian neighborhood .
Lots of Brits , Irish , and Africans , too .
The schools are exceptional .
Canada has the fourth - best school system in the world , according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development .
And within that , Alberta and British Columbia are neck - and - neck for having the best provincial systems .
Their responsiveness to special needs kids is n’t what it should be ; but private schooling is a ) cheaper to start with and b ) partially subsidized by vouchers .
My son has benefited from two amazing schools , at an average cost to us of under $ 10 K a year .
On that front , coming here was absolutely the right move .
The country gives amazing tax breaks to small , family - owned businesses ; and does much to discourage big - box stores that will eat them whole .
Also , the unions have real muscle , and there ’s not a huge problem with undocumented workers eroding the wage base .
Yes , there ’s a Wal - Mart and a Home Depot within an easy bus ride ; but the same malls they ’re in contain mostly mom-and - pop shops and successful local chains .
So you see less of that corporate - serf thing here .
People start businesses , and make them go .
If you think you might want to move , it ’s best if you get your application in before the head of household turns 45 .
The point system does n’t favor immigrants who are older than that .
If you decide to come , do n’t skip the step of getting an immigration attorney to bounce things off of .
The system is full of sweet loopholes that appear nowhere on the Immigration Canada website , but a good attorney will steer you through — take no “ no ” for granted , because there ’s almost always a way around it .
You will get in faster and easier , and with far less runaround .
If there are hitches — well , they know people .
Ours was a real fixer .
Best $ 2,500 we ever spent .
We are glad we made the move — especially this week .
We got every asset we could out of the United States several years ago .
The Canadian dollar far more solid , since it ’s backed by the country ’s vast resources , and the country carries very little debt .
( It ’s a nation of Scots , and they are tight - fisted and cautious with their money . )
Real estate in our neighborhood is holding steady , though it ’s falling a bit elsewhere in Vancouver .
We have health care , no matter what .
Once our citizenship comes through ( hopefully , this year ) , we will have Commonwealth passports , and can move to one of 52 other countries should that ever be necessary .
And the quality of life is very high .
People are n’t as far along on the consumption curve , so houses are smaller , neighborhoods more intimate , stuff just not as important .
Good transit makes one - car families typical .
Pay is lower , and stuff is a bit more expensive , but the expectations are also lower — life is not about stuff here , anyway .
The social contract is strongly intact .
The cops are incredibly decent .
People who play “ us-versus - them ” games are censured immediately — it ’s not the Canadian way .
Sometimes I get incredibly homesick for America .
I miss my culture , and feel sidelined in an important fight .
And other times , like today , I ’m grateful for the security the distance gives me , and for the kind civility of my Canadian neighbors .

The USG Open Source Center translates a recent interview with Baghdad mayor Sabir al - Isawi in a Czech newspaper .
The mayor 1 ) denies that the US troop ‘ surge ’ is the major reason for the reduced violence in Iraq ; 2 ) complains bitterly that US armored corps drivers continually run their tanks over lampposts , gardens and other things in Baghdad streets instead of going around them ; and 3 ) says that that the US military too often goes in with guns blazing unnecessarily and arbitrarily detains too many Iraqis , treating them in ways that contravene human rights standards .
He also says plainly that there will never be a street in Baghdad named after George W. Bush !
Mayor al - Isawi seems to be more cordial toward Iran than toward the US .
The Shiite Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq headed by Abdul Aziz al - Hakim won the January 2005 provincial elections in Baghdad , so I presume al - Isawi is a member of ISCI , which was formed in exile in Iran in 1982 under the guidance of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Baghdad Mayor Criticizes US Troops ’ Insensitiveness , Human Rights AbusesInterview with Baghdad Mayor Sabir al - Isawi by Teodor Marjanovic in Prague ; date not given : “ ‘ I Have Survived Four Assassination Attempts : ’ Baghdad Mayor Says Americans Are Often Hard To Deal With and Explains What Has Calmed Down Sectarian Killing in His Country ” iDnes.czSaturday , September 20 , 2008OSC Translated Excerpt
. . . ( Marjanovic )
What has caused the improvement of the situation in Iraq ?
( Al - Isawi ) There are two reasons .
The uprising of the Sunnite tribes against Al - Qa’ida as a result of its unending bomb attacks .
Initially , Al - Qa’ida had enjoyed those tribes ’ support .
The other cause is Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s resolve with which he crushed the Shiite militias in Basra and Baghdad ’s Sadr City .
Even without the help and , at the beginning , knowledge of the United States .
( Marjanovic )
They used to say that Al - Maliki was in cahoots with these militias .
( Al - Isawi ) Yes , and he proved that it was not true .
The political parties , then , finally began to approach the government .
It became evident that the prime minister did not want to have anything in common with these Iran - supported armed groups .
( Marjanovic )
Here in the West , the reports go that the crucial role was played by the increase of American soldiers last spring .
( Al - Isawi ) This was a partial reason for the calming down .
Another such partial reason was that the Iraqi armed forces are now working much better .
But the two things I mentioned are certainly the most important .
( Marjanovic )
When you look back , do you think that the Iraqis should be grateful to the Americans for something ?
( Al - Isawi ) Yes and no .
As Iraqis , we should feel gratitude that the Americans brought down the hated Saddam regime for us .
But — and I wish to say it very strongly — so long as the Americans continue to be stuck in their ruts , the last remainder of gratitude will evaporate .
They ought to be able to be liberators and not act as occupiers .
( Marjanovic ) Be concrete .
( Al - Isawi ) During detentions , they do not heed human rights .
They carry out raids without reason .
They shoot more than necessary .
They shrink from quickly determining the exact relations between the two states so that the situation no longer is that one occupies while the other obeys .
( Marjanovic )
And how do they complicate the life for you , as the City Hall ?
( Al - Isawi )
They are driving their heavy vehicles and tanks insensitively , through people ’s gardens .
They crush sidewalks .
They demolish lampposts .
They are driving , there is a post , but they will not go around it .
( Marjanovic )
Can you complain ?
( Al - Isawi ) Yes , we call them and sometimes they pay for repairs .
But this is not just the question of money .
One example : it took us six months to build an orchard .
Then arrived a tank , and the six months ’ efforts were destroyed within a moment .
( Marjanovic )
But you are aware of the thousands of Americans who perished in Iraq .
( Al - Isawi ) Of course , they must not be forgotten .
( Marjanovic )
Can you imagine a street or a square in Baghdad being named after George W Bush one day ?
( Al - Isawi ) No. ( passage omitted on Baghdad citizens ’ daily troubles )

The end of the road is in sight for the venerable iPod classic .
Meriting barely a passing mention during Apple ’s “ Let ’s Rock ” press event on Tuesday , the device is now available in only a single 120 GB model for $ 249 .
Oh , how the mighty have fallen .
The 120 GB iPod classic is now Apple ’s only hard drive - based iPod model .
All of the other offerings in Apple ’s catalog use flash memory to store songs .
And as flash memory density has increased steadily year after year ( and as Apple has gobbled as much of the market ’s NAND inventory as it can get ) , using a hard drive to store songs on a portable device has seemed increasingly anachronistic — it ’s like putting a record player in a car .
( They did try that once , with less success than the iPod . )
Most consumers seem content with the iPod nano as the “ sweet spot ” of the iPod product line — a color screen and all of the capabilities of the iPod classic in a smaller , thinner package .
Better for working out .
Better to carry with you unobtrusively .
As evidenced by the announcements Tuesday , Apple seems to be putting more and more innovation into the iPod nano , combining the best features of the iPod classic ( a robust color screen , the click wheel ) with the best features of the iPod touch ( tilt sensitivity ) .
If the iPod touch is the wave of the future , the iPod classic offers a more rearward - facing view .
It ’s the Model T to the iPod touch ’s Lamborghini Reventón .
But the classic retains appeal to some users , like me , who value its capacious storage capabilities .
But lost in nostalgia I am not .
For my part , I had hoped in vain the press event would yield the final death - blow to the classic line .
I pined for an iPod touch interface mated to a 160 GB hard drive .
I brashly told friends and colleagues that I would happily drop $ 500 on such a product in a heartbeat .
So I guess I ’m off the hook for making such a purchase for the moment .
But at $ 250 for a 120 GB classic , I think the time may finally right for me to retire my loyal 30 GB fifth - generation iPod , which has served me very well for the past few years .
My iTunes library long ago outgrew that system ’s paltry capacity , but the flash - based iPod models currently on the market still do n’t offer the storage space I need for my jumbo - sized music library , which I do n’t want to be without when I go out for a road trip or even to the grocery store .
Perhaps if I were more well - organized or less obsessive about my music collection , I ’d feel the same way as all those nano users .
But the nano does n’t appeal to me .
I want the massive storage capability that only the iPod classic is able to provide , even at the risk of having a bulkier , more bloated product .
To continue the car metaphor , I like a big , roomy sedan , even if everyone else is content with a subcompact .
Several state legislators have recently proposed cyberbullying measures .
At the federal level , Representative Linda Sánchez , a Democrat from California , has introduced the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act , which would make it a federal crime to send any communications with intent to cause “ substantial emotional distress . ”
In June , Lori Drew pleaded not guilty to charges that she violated federal fraud laws by creating a false identity “ to torment , harass , humiliate and embarrass ” another user , and by violating MySpace ’s terms of service .
But hardly anyone bothers to read terms of service , and millions create false identities .
“ While Drew ’s conduct is immoral , it is a very big stretch to call it illegal , ” wrote the online - privacy expert Prof. Daniel J. Solove on the blog Concurring Opinions .
Many trolling practices , like prank - calling the Hendersons and intimidating Kathy Sierra , violate existing laws against harassment and threats .
The difficulty is tracking down the perpetrators .
In order to prosecute , investigators must subpoena sites and Internet service providers to learn the original author ’s IP address , and from there , his legal identity .
Local police departments generally do n’t have the means to follow this digital trail , and federal investigators have their hands full with spam , terrorism , fraud and child pornography .
But even if we had the resources to aggressively prosecute trolls , would we want to ?
Are we ready for an Internet where law enforcement keeps watch over every vituperative blog and backbiting comments section , ready to spring at the first hint of violence ?
Probably not .
All vigorous debates shade into trolling at the perimeter ; it is next to impossible to excise the trolling without snuffing out the debate .
If we ca n’t prosecute the trolling out of online anonymity , might there be some way to mitigate it with technology ?
One solution that has proved effective is “ disemvoweling ”  having message - board administrators remove the vowels from trollish comments , which gives trolls the visibility they crave while muddying their message .
A broader answer is persistent pseudonymity , a system of nicknames that stay the same across multiple sites .
This could reduce anonymity ’s excesses while preserving its benefits for whistle - blowers and overseas dissenters .
Ultimately , as Fortuny suggests , trolling will stop only when its audience stops taking trolls seriously .
“ People know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a supermarket tabloid , ” says Dan Gillmor , who directs the Center for Citizen Media .
“ It should be even more so with anonymous comments .
They should n’t start off with a credibility rating of , say , 0 .
It should be more like negative - 30 . ”
Of course , none of these methods will be fail - safe as long as individuals like Fortuny construe human welfare the way they do .
As we discussed the epilepsy hack , I asked Fortuny whether a person is obliged to give food to a starving stranger .
No , Fortuny argued ; no one is entitled to our sympathy or empathy .
We can choose to give or withhold them as we see fit .
“ I ca n’t push you into the fire , ” he explained , “ but I can look at you while you ’re burning in the fire and not be required to help . ”
Weeks later , after talking to his friend Zach , Fortuny began considering the deeper emotional forces that drove him to troll .
The theory of the green hair , he said , “ allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around .
Zach asked if I thought I could turn my parents around .
I almost broke down .
The idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that I could actually be proud of . . . it was overwhelming . ”
He continued : “ It ’s not that I do this because I hate them .
I do this because I ’m trying to save them . ”
Weeks before my visit with Fortuny , I had lunch with “ moot , ” the young man who founded 4 chan .
After running the site under his pseudonym for five years , he recently revealed his legal name to be Christopher Poole .
At lunch , Poole was quick to distance himself from the excesses of / b/.
“ Ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards , ” he said .
“ All we do is provide a general framework . ”
He was optimistic about Robot9000 , a new 4 chan board with a combination of human and machine moderation .
Users who make “ unoriginal ” or “ low content ” posts are banned from Robot9000 for periods that lengthen with each offense .
The posts on Robot9000 one morning were indeed far more substantive than / b/.
With the cyborg moderation system silencing the trolls , 4 chan had begun to display signs of linearity , coherence , a sense of collective enterprise .

NASA recently took some of its most promising new concepts for living and working on the moon and tried them out in a moon - like location near Lake Moses , Washington .
Scout robots , rovers , cargo carriers , cranes and spacesuits endured sand storms and temperature swings to help test out the prototypes and prepare for future lunar expeditions .
Although conditions on the moon will be much harsher , one investigator said , “ It ’s as close as we can get in a terrestrial environment to the lunar environment . ”
Above is the Mobile Lunar Transporter , which includes unique features that allow each of its six wheels to move independently , giving the vehicle the ability to drive in any direction .
The human drivers stood in turrets on the “ trucks . ”
JPL tested two ATHLETE cargo - moving rovers they are developing .
These rather odd - looking transport vehicles have legs capable of rolling or walking over extremely rough or steep terrain .
They can carry , manipulate , deposit and transport payloads to desired sites .
Maybe they ’ll become the lunar version of a Winnebago , and future lunar astronauts can also take them out on weekend camping trips .
This Autonomous Drilling Rover could be used to search for valuable resources under the lunar surface in the moon ’s polar regions .
Its made to operate in extreme cold and dark conditions .
This lunar bulldozer , called LANCE ( Lunar Attachment Node for Construction Excavation ) , is designed to be used with the lunar truck .
The bulldozer can be used to help prepare a site for building an outpost on the moon .
These K10 scout robots can perform highly repetitive and long - duration tasks .
During the tests , the rovers surveyed simulated lunar landing sites and built topographic and panoramic 3 - D terrain models .
One rover used a ground - penetrating radar to assess subsurface structures .
The other used a 3 - D scanning laser system known as LIDAR to create topographic maps .
They can also perform science reconnaissance .
And of course , we ca n’t have humans on the moon without having spacesuits , so some of the new design of spacesuits were tested as well .
More info about these tests , which took place on June 2 - 13 , 2008 .
You 've probably heard the buzz - word " Cloud Computing " tossed around recently .
Cloud Computing is the next big thing in remote and distributed computing and is very much in fashion now for many industry bellwethers like IBM , Sun , Amazon , Google and storage giants like EMC .
You do n't have to have a degree in IT to see it coming together .
If you 've played around with Gmail or Google Docs , even as an end user , you 've already seen the beginnings of something big , really big .
As with any budding new market however , there are a lot more questions than answers these days , perhaps because the possibilities are seemingly infinite .
Let 's take a quick gander at a basic high level understanding of how the cloud works and what the building blocks are .
Cloud Computing High - Level Diagram , Courtesy : Wikipedia
The term " cloud " was originally coined by networking technologist to explain a group of resources connected together as one .
These days , coupled with the word " computing " , the cloud takes on a whole new meaning .
The concept is quite simple actually but it's the forces at play that leave us all speculating how the landscape will take shape .
As the internet 's capacity has scaled and enabled powerful new functionalities , real - time virtual resource access and billing / metering of those resources , the Cloud Computing model gained serious traction .
The market has evolved from offering not only enterprise and educational institutions , services like Amazon 's EC2 , but also services like Google Apps are being offered all the way down to the average end user .
Liquid Computing's
Fabric Computing Architecture
At a high level , there are a few usage models of Cloud Computing that have begun to take shape .
SaaS or Software as a Service , is what is generally thought of when you consider services like Google Apps or Salesforce.com .
Let 's face it , from the end user and SOHO crowd , to big businesses that are making use of services like Salesforce , you can see the huge value in outsourcing certain applications , not only from a cost standpoint but for ease of use and collaborative efforts .
Then there 's Utility Computing , another variation on the Cloud concept , that offers raw virtual server resources to corporate entities , IT departments , and even educational institutions .
Need more capacity or throughput from your Data Center ?
Just provision more resources with a place like Liquid Computing and kick back for a coffee break .
Not to mention , you 'll probably sleep better at night because someone else has built the infrastructure for you already that will cover your assets , so to speak , should some sort of catastrophic hardware or other failure take place .
In the final analysis , there 's no question that Cloud Computing , Grid Computing , Utility Computing or whatever else you 'd like to call it , is definitely the wave of the future for many applications and usage models .
Granted , the average power user or enthusiast will likely still have a powerful desktop or notebook system for many years to come .
However there 's something taking shape on the horizon that looks a little like Web 2.0 for computing hardware and compute resources -- a shared , collaborative and leased commodity , always accessible and shaped by the customer .
It 's a compelling business case to be sure with lots of competition filing into the market place .
The questions that remain are many and various .
What will the dominant player be for the various service types ?
What will the killer apps look like ?
And probably more importantly , will the transport providers supporting the internet backbone -- the Ciscos of the world -- be able to scale quickly enough with it ?
Some rather smart folks better have a few precision crystal balls at work for these questions because it 's coming fast and furious but there are many of us that can't quite make out what it looks like just yet .

A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by conservative radio talk show host Michael Savage against a Muslim rights group that reprinted his attacks against Islam and called for an advertising boycott .
Savage , who has about 8 million listeners a week on 400 stations for his syndicated " Savage Nation " program , sued the Council on American - Islamic Relations in December for copyright infringement .
The organization had posted four minutes of excerpts from an Oct. 29 broadcast in which he called the Quran a " hateful little book " and a " document of slavery . "
He said Muslims were " screaming for the blood of Christians or Jews or anyone they hate . "
The council cited Savage 's remarks in urging advertisers to boycott the program .
Its members say Savage has since lost $ 1 million in advertising .
The broadcaster claimed in his lawsuit that the Muslim rights group had misappropriated his words and used them for its own fund - raising purposes , damaging the value of his copyrighted material .
He also claimed in his suit that the group was engaged in racketeering , describing it as a " mouthpiece of international terror " that helped to fund the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The council called those allegations preposterous , denied any connection to terrorism and said Savage was trying to intimidate and silence a critical voice .
In her ruling , U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco said anyone who listens to a public broadcast is entitled to take excerpts and use them for purposes of comment and criticism .
Reprinting small portions of a copyrighted work for those purposes helps to put it in context and benefits both the public and the target of the criticism , Illston said .
She also said Savage offered no evidence that copying and posting the excepts affected his commercial market for the Oct. 29 broadcast .
In dismissing the racketeering claim , Illston said that even if Savage could prove his " alarming allegations " that the council was part of a worldwide terrorist conspiracy , he has n't shown how those activities affected him or his broadcast .
Savage 's complaint - which cites the council 's lawsuits , boycotts , letter - writing , and criticism of him - is principally focused on " the ideas that ( the council ) may or may not espouse , " the judge said .
Those ideas are constitutionally protected , she added .
Illston said Savage could try to rewrite the racketeering portion of his suit to cure its legal defects , and the broadcaster 's lawyer said he would do so .
" We are prepared to file a very detailed and well - documented new complaint " for racketeering , said attorney Daniel Horowitz , without going into detail .
He said Illston 's ruling was " very carefully thought - out " even if its conclusion was unwelcome .
Ahmed Rehab , a spokesman for the council , said it " will continue to stand up to Savage 's bigotry and will not be bogged down by his knack for retaliatory fluff lawsuits . "
When you 're living with less sleep than your body needs to operate , it 's tempting to go the easy route and keep yourself alert with caffeine and sugar .
But these quick fixes can make things worse in the long run .
Sugar brings a quick crash
Sugar can give you a temporary energy boost , but when that " high " wears off , you may become even sleepier and slower to react , according to a 2006 study from England 's Loughborough University .
" Sugar is not the best way to stimulate the brain , " says Ralph Downey III , PhD , director of the Loma Linda University Sleep Disorders Center in California .
" It does n't have the value that caffeine does for the short boost . "
For a boost to get you through the day , you 're better off with a small snack ; aim for a combination of protein and carbohydrates , like an apple with peanut butter .
But do n't eat too much : A full stomach can make you even more tired .
Caffeine is a sleep stealer
Caffeine — and coffee in particular — poses the opposite problem .
Within 15 minutes of drinking a cup , you 'll have the jolt of energy you were looking for .
But since caffeine can stay in your system for 12 hours , its effects continue long after your latte is gone .
That 's why experts recommend quitting coffee altogether if you have difficulty sleeping at night , or at least stopping after your morning cup .
Soda and chocolate generally contain less caffeine than coffee , but if you are sensitive to even small amounts , they can cause problems — especially in excess or too close to bedtime .
Next Page : Decaf drinkers beware [ pagebreak ]
Even decaf drinkers should beware : A 2007 Consumer Reports study found that " decaffeinated " coffees sold at several chain restaurants varied widely , containing up to 32 mg of caffeine per cup — about the same amount in 12 ounces of cola .
This amount of caffeine wo n't keep most people up , but if you are particularly sensitive , two or three cups might .
Still , for some insomniacs , the need for caffeine is so great that they will sacrifice their sleep in order to stay alert during the day — creating a vicious cycle of sleeplessness .
Jacqueline Cutler , 49 , is one of them :
While most coffee drinkers average three cups a day , she drinks six .
Caffeine props her up during the day .
Once the coffee starts flowing , " I just go into automatic , " says Cutler , a journalist in suburban New Jersey .
" If a story is due or I have to go somewhere , I just do it . "
Cutler did make an effort to eliminate coffee from her diet , but she ended up getting headaches .

Well , as Digby says --- look what 's been scrubbed from McCain 's campaign website :
There had been no doubt that McCain would eventually become a full - fledged White House candidate , and he had been expected to make his candidacy official in the spring .
The 2006 midterm campaign had just ended when McCain took the first formal step toward a presidential run in November .
He formed an exploratory committee and gave a speech casting himself as a " common - sense conservative " in the vein of Ronald Reagan who could lead the party back to dominance after a dreadful election season by returning to the GOP 's core principles .
A political celebrity , McCain is considered a top contender for the nomination .
Obama would consider Gore for cabinet position

Chances for an Al Gore presidency may be all - but - nonexistent at this point in the campaign , but Barack Obama said Wednesday the former vice president might just have a spot in his administration , perhaps even cabinet - level .
A woman at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania asked whether Obama , if elected , would tap Gore for such a position to address global warming issues .
" I would , " Obama said .
" Not only will I , but I will make a commitment that Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem . "
Obama said Gore is " somebody I talk to on a regular basis .
I 'm already consulting with him in terms of these issues , but climate change is real . "
Gore won a Nobel Prize last year for his work on climate change , which was documented in the 2006 Oscar - winning film An Inconvenient Truth .
He remains popular among Democrats , and some have even speculated that Gore could enter the Democratic nomination contest at the 11th hour to put an end to the sniping between Obama and opponent Hillary Clinton .
In a recent interview on CBS 's 60 Minutes , Gore dismissed suggestions he would enter the race and said he had no interest in serving as a " broker " to find a conclusion to the Obama - Hillary contest .

One person worries about governmental abuse of power ; another blushes about his drug use and sexual history ; a third vents outrage about how corporations collect private data to target their ads or how insurance companies dig through personal medical records to deny coverage to certain people .

As reports swirl about Members of Congress in transition , it ’s the perfect time to delve further into the mechanisms of congressional authority .
How are Members assigned to committees , to chairmanships , to status as ranking members ?
How are leadership positions determined ?

Over the past three years , MIT has begun to adopt a new way of making decisions–one that fosters experiential learning of leadership skills and promotes a sense of community among graduate students .
While graduate students at many of our peer institutions have moved toward unionization , MIT has embraced the ideals of shared governance and collaborative decision - making .
The Institute has not fully realized these ideals , but it has made progress on the graduate level–and the results have been overwhelmingly positive .
I became involved in student - life issues during my first year at MIT , amidst a string of student - life “ crises . ”
In January 2002 , a proposal was put forward to convert half of Ashdown House , the cultural hub of MIT ’s graduate community , into undergraduate housing .
Neither students nor faculty housemasters had been involved in shaping the proposal , and the graduate community , feeling the injustice of its exclusion , quickly mobilized against it .
By fall 2002 , the situation at MIT had reached a turning point .
Frustrated by a number of Institute decisions , graduate students pushed for increased transparency , accountability , and student involvement in decision - making .
When the next major student - life issue arose –the restructuring of graduate residence hall rents to more equitably reflect differences among rooms –the Graduate Student Council ( GSC ) was invited to help address it .
The GSC worked with student leaders from all graduate residences to develop and conduct a survey of the grad student population and , based on the data obtained , determined an optimal rent structure .
In the spring , graduate students faced another challenge .
The Institute announced that health insurance premiums for graduate students would increase by 60 percent the next year .
Students were outraged , and some even began to feel that unionization might be the only way to fight back .
The Graduate Student Council immediately voiced the students ’ concerns to administrators and began working with them to find a solution to the problem .
In the end , MIT agreed to fully subsidize health insurance for all graduate students supported by the Institute .
About the same time , MIT began to search for its 16th president .
As another sign of the changing MIT culture , students were given a historic opportunity to provide input into the selection process .
The students described what they saw as MIT ’s opportunities and challenges for the future and the characteristics MIT ’s next president would need to best lead the institution , and they nominated candidates for the position .
The report presented by the student advisory group is regarded by faculty and MIT Corporation members as having made a significant contribution to the process that led to the selection of President Susan Hockfield .
Through these projects , graduate students have proven that , if given an opportunity , they can bring a level of professionalism , dedication , and creative thought to the table that can result in better solutions to campus problems .
They have also proven the value of collaborative decision - making , which involves students in its early stages , rather than leaving them to react after decisions are made .
Students have noticed the success of the process over the past few years and , as a result , have become more active in the Graduate Student Council and in Institute affairs more generally .
This year , the council has been proactive in its initiatives and further increased its collaborations .
Its initiatives include the formation of a student advisory board ( in collaboration with the Undergraduate Association ) to orient President Hockfield toward student culture and concerns , an examination of the state of graduate advising and how it can be improved , and an in - depth look at the needs of graduate student families .
Every year , through mechanisms such as national conferences , the Graduate Student Council is able to get an idea of how our peer organizations fare in their efforts to make their voices heard .
We see many of them still struggling and feeling forced to turn to the aggressive and polarizing model of graduate student unions .
The MIT model of shared governance puts us far ahead of the curve .
We must continue to place value on the principles essential to effective collaboration –inclusiveness , communication , transparency , and accountability .

A lawsuit filed in federal court a year ago by a Dominican detainee makes complaints about health care at a detention center in Rhode Island that are similar to accounts of how the center treated a Chinese New Yorker who died Aug. 6 in immigration custody .
That inmate was suffering from a fractured spine and extensive cancer that had gone undiagnosed until five days before his death .
The lawsuit , filed in Providence , asserts that employees at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Center , in Central Falls , R.I. , denied a wheelchair to Marino De Los Santos , who said that he suffered serious injuries to his neck , back , chest and spine in two falls at the center in 2006 .
According to the suit , employees accused Mr. De Los Santos of faking his injuries and refused to take him to scheduled examinations by a spine specialist .
Cornell Corrections of Rhode Island , one of the defendants , which ran the center at the time covered by the suit , denied any wrongdoing in its answer .
In the case of Hiu Lui Ng , who was the subject of an article last week in The New York Times , lawyers and relatives said that when he was racked with pain and too weak to walk , detention officials refused him a wheelchair , failed to take him to scheduled appointments for an M.R.I. exam or a CT scan , and instead took him in shackles to Hartford  where he was pressured to withdraw his appeals and accept deportation .

The times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
So let us agree that patriotism has no party .
I love this country , and so do you , and so does John McCain .
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America .
Full transcript below :
These are the policies I will pursue .
And in the weeks ahead , I look forward to debating them with John McCain .
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes .
Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other ’s character and patriotism .
The times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
So let us agree that patriotism has no party .
I love this country , and so do you , and so does John McCain .
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America .
So I ’ve got news for you , John McCain .
We all put our country first .
America , our work will not be easy .
The challenges we face require tough choices , and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn - out ideas and politics of the past .
For part of what has been lost these past eight years ca n’t just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose .
And that ’s what we have to restore .
We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang - violence in Cleveland , but do n’t tell me we ca n’t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK - 47s out of the hands of criminals .
I know there are differences on same - sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
Passions fly on immigration , but I do n’t know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers .
This too is part of America ’s promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
They claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
And that ’s to be expected .
Because if you do n’t have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
If you do n’t have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
You make a big election about small things .
Veteran blogger Brad Friedman of The BRAD BLOG is perhaps the most well - known and respected advocate on the Internet for free , fair and accountable elections .
He ’s in Denver attending Democratic National Convention events and was kind enough to stop by Lime , S&R ’s Convention headquarters , to chat with Mike Sheehan .

MS : You ’re the guy to ask : have you seen any progress in election certification on a national scale , or is it strictly regional improvements , or are you not seeing any improvements at all ?
BF : I would pretty much say no improvements at all .
And I hate to say it .
On a federal level , there is sort of an incremental improvement , in that the United States Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) has put in place a new certification process which is much more stringent than the previous one .
That said , apparently it ’s so stringent that none of the machines have passed testing .
And yet , one of the two Democratic appointees to the EAC , Gracia Hillman , wants to do away with that testing , wants to say “ forget about this new procedure and let ’s just let the machines work anyway . ”
And this is a Democrat , a Democratic appointee .
So no , it ’s not good .
There have been incremental changes : states like California , you got a better secretary of state ; Ohio , better secretary of state .
But then you get Colorado here , and you got this yutz Mike Coffman who ’s forced by a judge to test all of the machines , finds that none of them works , so he decertifies them and then he recertifies them .
So you guys are in the same mess you were in four years ago here .
MS : He just won his primary and he ’s potentially on his way to Congress .
BF : Yeah , he ’s running for a different office .
So you guys are held hijacked to these crappy machines that do n’t work and Colorado ’s gonna be a very serious … could be a very , very close state this year .
Good luck !
I mean , really … there ’s gonna be no way to verify what happens here in Colorado . …
And the media seems to have gotten no better .
I mean , suddenly they ’ve started reporting on these stories that they could ’ve reported on two , three years ago — we could ’ve made a difference between then and now — they did n’t .
They always do this , just before the election , when there ’s no time to make any actual changes .
And what do we have last week ?
Diebold is forced to admit that all of their machines — all of them , not just ones in Ohio — all of them lose votes .
Seems like a problem to me ; apparently not a lot of other people give a damn for some reason .
MS : I notice that too .
Let ’s talk about the Internet itself , the “ state of the Web ” I suppose .
Speaking in a broad sense , have you seen your readership or your influence grow , or has it waned , or has it stayed the same ?
How ’s the Web treating you these days ?
BF : Well I suppose influence is different than traffic , and you ca n’t necessarily measure one by the other .
For example , we had huge traffic back in January when we had the New Hampshire primary and we had this result that made no sense , and I came out and said , “ Well , do n’t you think we should count those ballots , since we ’re lucky enough to have paper ballots ?
Do n’t you think we should actually count them ? ” since they were all counted on voting systems that are known to be hackable as we saw in HBO ’s Hacking Democracy .
MS : Kucinich made an effort …
BF : Kucinich tried , but he had to go in and pay for it .
He could only afford …
I think he counted 40 percent of the votes .
We found all kinds of miscounting errors .
So my traffic goes through the roof .
At the same time , I got these guys over at Daily Kos saying “ Brad Friedman is crazy and he ’s saying that Hillary Clinton stole the election . ”
And we never said any such thing , never said it was stolen , certainly never said it was Hillary Clinton if it was stolen .
And it turns out one of the front - pagers he has over there who blogs under a pseudonym , turns out his name is Dana Houle , and he was chief of staff for the congressman from New Hampshire .
So he ’s sitting behind his little mask of anonymity .
You ask , does your influence go up ?
Does your traffic go up ?
I ’m not sure if you call that influence , I do n’t know if you call it traffic , I do n’t know .
But obviously people are paying attention to guys like you and me .
You know , important people , I guess .
Elected people are paying attention .
Media are certainly paying attention to what you and I do , we ’re driving them crazy , the corporate media .
MS : I ’d like to think so , yeah .
BF : We are .
They ’re jumping out of buildings .
They really are … they ’re like so depressed that the readership is going down and that guys like Scholars and Rogues , and BRAD BLOG , and Raw Story , consistently scoop them .
I ’ve talked to a lot of them … they ’ve gotta rewrite stories suddenly , because we beat them to it , so they gotta figure out new angles to cover it .
MS : I hope that continues .
BF : I hope they do something .
MS : You mentioned elected officials , I wanted to ask you your thoughts on this .
Do you have any theories …
BF : Can I add that Barack Obama could ’ve recounted the entire state of New Hampshire for $ 2,000 because the race was so close ?
MS : I heard his campaign ’s really low on funds .
BF : [ chuckle ]
Yeah , right .
MS : Has he been asked why he has n’t …?
BF : I have n’t been able to ask him .
Have you ?
MS : No .
BF : I wish somebody would .
MS : Ca n’t get close to the guy .
BF : Yeah , I know .
MS : You mentioned elected officials , I wanted to ask you : any theories or ideas or guesses as to why John Conyers , of all people , is pushing back so vigorously on impeachment ?
BF : You know , I have n’t asked him directly .
I just saw him about an hour ago …
MS : That ’s right , he was here .
BF : We chatted quickly about election issues .
MS : Because I ’ve seen reports in the media where he ’s been confronted by voters and he always commiserates , but nothing happens .
BF : All I can give you is the same speculation that everybody has , which is that I think that as tough as he is , he ’s also a good , loyal Democrat .
And if Nancy Pelosi — actually I think it ’s more Steny Hoyer , frankly , and Rahm Emanuel than anybody else — but if those guys say to him , “ No , we ’re not doing impeachment , ” I think that ’s what he does .
MS : I wanted to get your thoughts on the Convention itself .
You ’re here from L.A .
BF : Yup .
MS : Your general impressions about how Denver ’s handling things ?
Have you noticed the rampant security ?
Any surprises ?
What are your general impressions ?
BF : I ’m surprised it ’s 90 degrees in Denver .
What the hell is up with that ?
MS : And then tomorrow it could drop to 70 all of a sudden .
BF : Why do n’t we have the conventions in the winter and the elections in the summer ?
Why do we have the elections when it ’s freezing cold and then we have to have these conventions , and now you ca n’t move anywhere and it ’s 90 degrees ?
MS : Maybe the parties just like the crazy , when everybody gets rabid with heat …
BF : There seems to be Obama fever in town , people seem to be having a good time …
MS : Well , he ’s the Messiah , have n’t you heard ?
BF : That ’s right .
Walk - on - water Obama .
The SWAT teams are out , but so far everybody seems to be in a good mood .
As long as FOX News does n’t keep taunting demonstrators , perhaps they ’ll be no riots .
My hope here is to find this Griff Jenkins , this jerk who was asking all of these demonstrators , “ Why are you demonstrating ? ” and they did n’t want to talk to him because he ’s FOX News , and he would say , “ Do n’t you believe in free speech ? ”
Does he not understand the concept ?
Just because you believe in freedom of speech , it does n’t mean you have to talk to FOX News , it means you get to not talk to them .
So anyway , if I can track him down , we ’ll take a videocamera out there , we ’ll do some ambush interviews with Griff Jenkins and we ’ll find out if he believes in freedom of speech .
MS : I think he ’s probably trying to ask Barack Obama why they wo n’t put Hillary on the ticket .
BF : Idiots .
God , are they idiots … and it ’s gonna be a real tough time for Democrats , now and forever , until they do something about the media .
And it ’s not just FOX , they ’re emblematic .
We drove here , we drive all around the country … you turn on the radio , it ’s four levels deep of right - wing talk radio .
Good luck finding any progressive radio .
And if you can have that kind of coverage , that kind of ownership of the media by the so - called “ right wing , ” you know , you ’re gonna have this every single time .
Turn a war hero like Kerry into a raving pansy .
MS : Max Cleland .
BF : … Max Cleland .
They ’re doing the same job on Obama .
And the Democrats need to really start paying attention and do something when it comes to media reform and election reform .
MS : Well there ’s a little glimmer of hope with Rachel [ Maddow ] over at MSNBC .
BF : A glimmer .
But she ’s not [ big ] on the radio , and that ’s what people are listening to driving home from work .
And every single station reporting the same bullshit , repeating the stuff that comes up from wingnut Associated Press …
MS : Rupert Murdoch sitting on the board and all that .
BF : Yeah , yup .
MS : I just want to get your thoughts on this :
Do you have any remarks or any opinion on the apparent “ Hillary subterfuge ” that ’s underway ?
I ’m really not hearing it from citizens and seeing it myself , but if you watch the media , apparently Hillary is …
BF : Ron Fournier at AP ?
MS : That ’s one part of it …
BF : Fox News ?
Are they telling you …?
MS : But all day today at CNN and FOX …
BF : The Recreate 68 ?
They ’re “ taking over … ? ”
MS : Is that real , is it a media construct … ?
BF : Of course it is .
Of course it is .
They want a story , I ’m sure Hillary and Bill are not thrilled to not be the nominee this year , but as far as undermining the entire thing , as far as supporting some effort to … it ’s these idiots who just refuse to cover the issues , refuse to cover the things that are important to America , want to cover themselves .
You ’re gonna see , coming out of this , the coverage of the coverage .
MS : Afterwards .
“ Where did we go wrong ? ”
BF : So , we ’re going to try to cover the coverage of the coverage .
We ’re covering the coverage coverage .
Because that ’s what they do : they talk about themselves , they look for stories instead of serving America .
They ’re disserving America , they ’re undermining our country , and we ’re screwed .
When you ask a question about a guy like John Conyers — a hero , frankly , a war hero , longest - serving member of the Congress , I think , at this point — when he ca n’t even proceed with doing the right thing because the entire party is so frightened about what the media will say about them , even though it ’s the right thing …
I ’m quite concerned for this country .
It is not business as usual , despite looking around and it appearing to be .
But I do n’t think it is , and I think this place is a tinderbox .
I ’m quite worried about where we go from here .
MS : Allright , let ’s move onto something more mundane .
Joe Biden : what strengths or liabilities does he bring to the ticket , if any , or is he just a safe pick …
BF : Well , he ’s got great one - liners .
MS : ( chuckles )
BF : No , seriously , and they could use that .
America elects presidents based on one - liners …
MS : Yeah , he came out swinging on McCain ’s “ Parade of Homes . ”
BF : He could use someone like that , a pit bull , like Biden .
That said , I wish Biden was n’t as much of a liar .
And I should say , I used to love Biden .
I was a big fan of Biden .
And then he came on Bill Maher ’s show once .
You may remember this .
He came on Bill Maher ’s right before the ’06 election , might have been in ’05 , during the whole Jeff Gannon thing , and he said , “ Well , this is why we need to elect Democrats , ’ cause if we were in charge of Congress , we ’d hold hearings , we ’d get to the bottom of this Jeff Gannon thing , and find out what the hell is going on , and believe me , heads would roll , and there ’d be arrests , and jail time … ”
So he gets the chairmanship , they get the majority , and what have they done ?
They ’ve held a few hearings , but virtually no accountability .
Nothing from Joe Biden on Jeff Gannon .
At that point , it seems to be that he was a liar .
MS : Maybe in retrospect now , Jeff Gannon , compared to how the media are going now , is probably more qualified than a lot of the people on the air …
BF : Yeah .
He ’s exactly the same as the rest of the media , except that he ’s a gay prostitute as opposed to just a regular prostitute .
MS : Here ’s a question I like to ask people in interviews who have political ties .
Are there any circumstances under which you yourself would run for office ?
BF : ( laughs ) Yeah !
There are , in that I do think that people need to step up , citizens need to step up .
And there ’s a lot of folks — let me put in a plug for some of the citizens , citizen election integrity advocates who have stepped up .
Ellen Brodsky and Susan Pynchon , down in Florida , they ’re both running for county election supervisors .
Clint Curtis , the software programmer , he ’s running for Congress against Tom Feeney …
MS : Oh yeah , you ’ve covered that extensively .
BF : … the guy who asked him to create vote - rigging software .
Jason Osgood up in Washington , running for secretary of state .
So I do think that citizens need to step up and throw these bums out and do the right thing .
At this point , I think I can be more effective doing what I ’m doing , which is blogging and speaking and so forth , but I think at some point we might have to look at this situation and say , “ Well , how best can we serve the country ? ”
And if the bloggers ran Congress , I think we ’d in a hell of a lot better shape .
So if you think you ’re off the hook , Sheehan , you ’re not …
MS : ( chuckles )
BF : You ’re gonna have to run .
You ’re gonna be in the same freshman class .
MS : Oh , God .
I do n’t know if that would help America or hurt America .
BF : Could n’t hurt it any worse than the shape it ’s in right now . ∞
The size of the bailout is growing by leaps and bounds .
Inquiring minds are asking A $ 1.8 Trillion Bailout :
Where the Money 's Going ?
— Up to $ 700 billion to buy assets from struggling institutions .
The plan is aimed at sopping up residential and commercial mortgages from financial institutions but gives Treasury broad latitude .
— Up to $ 50 billion from the Great Depression - era Exchange Stabilization Fund to guarantee principal in money market mutual funds to provide the same confidence that consumers have in federally insured bank deposits .
— The Fed committed to make unspecified discount window loans to financial institutions to finance the purchase of assets from money market funds to aid redemptions .
— At least $ 10 billion in Treasury direct purchases of mortgage - backed securities in September .
In doubling the program on Friday , the Treasury said it may purchase even more in the months ahead .
— Up to $ 144 billion in additional MBS purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The Treasury announced they would increase purchases up to the newly expanded investment portfolio limits of $ 850 billion each .
On July 30 , the Fannie portfolio stood at $ 758.1 billion with Freddie 's at $ 798.2 billion .
— $ 85 billion loan for AIG , which would give the Federal government a 79.9 percent stake and avoid a bankruptcy filing for the embattled insurer .
AIG management will be dismissed .
— At least $ 87 billion in repayments to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) for providing financing to underpin trades with units of bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) .
— $ 200 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The Treasury will inject up to $ 100 billion into each institution by purchasing preferred stock to shore up their capital as needed .
The deal puts the two housing finance firms under government control .
— $ 300 billion for the Federal Housing Administration to refinance failing mortgage into new , reduced - principal loans with a federal guarantee , passed as part of a broad housing rescue bill .
— $ 4 billion in grants to local communities to help them buy and repair homes abandoned due to mortgage foreclosures .
— $ 29 billion in financing for JPMorgan Chase 's government - brokered buyout of Bear Stearns in March .
The Fed agreed to take $ 30 billion in questionable Bear assets as collateral , making JPMorgan liable for the first $ 1 billion in losses , while agreeing to shoulder any further losses .
— At least $ 200 billion of currently outstanding loans to banks issued through the Fed 's Term Auction Facility , which was recently expanded to allow for longer loans of 84 days alongside the previous 28 - day credits .
HARARE : It has come to this - Zimbabwe is about to run out of the paper to print money on .
Fidelity Printers & Refiners , the state - owned company that tirelessly churns out bank notes for the Mugabe regime , was thrown into a crisis early this month after a German company stopped supplying bank note paper because of concerns over Zimbabwe 's recent violent presidential election , widely seen as fraudulent by international observers .
The printing operation slowed drastically .
Two - thirds of the 1000 - strong workforce was ordered to take leave , and two of the three money - printing shifts were cancelled .
Next time you attend a techie - rich conference and go to the Internet café , take a look at the laptops on display .
Chances are , about half of them will be ThinkPads .
However , while they still bear the IBM logo , a Chinese firm known as Lenovo has actually been manufacturing them for several years now .
Lenovo takes aim at SMBs with its ThinkServer line .
Does it have what it takes to make the major OEMs quake ?
Now Lenovo is entering the global server market with its ThinkServer line .
And it looks like it is after a very specific vertical  the SMB market  at least initially .
Presently , the company offers five servers  three towers and two racks .
These 1 - and 2 - processor models will be featured in a full server snapshot when complete pricing data is available from the manufacturer .
For now , all we know is that the starting price for this line of servers is $ 749 .
This week , we 'll look at the big picture and leave all the specifics for a couple of weeks .
The top - two server vendors ( IBM and HP ) control 60 percent of the market , and the top five account for all but 11.8 percent of revenue .
That does n't leave much wiggle room for a new entrant .
That wo n't bother Lenovo though , as the company has quietly but successfully edged its way into the desktop and workstation markets with its ThinkCentre and ThinkStation lines .
Note the naming conventions  ThinkPad , ThinkCentre , ThinkStation and now ThinkServer .
Very smart .
ThinkPad is a trusted brand , and Lenovo has done a good job in maintaining quality and brand integrity since it took over stewardship .
The company also retains a good relationship with IBM , which can only help in the U.S. market .
Presumably , IBM reps and business partners are advised not to " think " too much about what PCs , laptops and servers to recommend  the Think line will accordingly find itself provided with many opportunities in the United States .
Lenovo has a decent channel presence as well , which will also help .
Unsure About an Acronym or Term ?
Search the ServerWatch Glossary
Another factor in its favor is that Lenovo has actually been making servers for years for the Chinese market .
Loosely translated as the SureServer , these 1 - and 2 - socket models are very popular in what is a massive market .
Almost 1,000 of them powered the Olympics , and the company did n't miss the opportunity to let the world know .
With most of America tuning in to see Phelps break the gold medal record , the many commercial breaks heavily featured Lenovo logos and ads .
So the brand has already gotten a boost .
Note , though , that the ThinkServers are not the same as the SureServers .
As for the initial market entry , it is modest but sensible .
Lenovo is not attempting to be every server for every need .
Just a few towers and racks aimed squarely at the SMB space .
No hokey specs or sub -par components either  good grade Intel Xeon dual - core and quad - core , as well as Core 2 Duo chips , for example .
Presumably , once we get the complete pricing , the servers will measure up well against their counterparts from Dell and HP .
I 'm interested to see if they try to low - ball their prices or make them just a little higher than the others .
My money is on the latter .
Lenovo is rolling in lots of value to appeal to the IT - limited SMB .
Software to ease startup , updates and server management is included , and a 90 - day trial for support is a wise addition .
If it 's good , Lenovo will earn plenty of additional dollars .
Tom Tobul , executive director of the Enterprise Business Unit at Lenovo , is keeping his cards to himself with regard to the ultimate intentions .
" We are going into this to be successful for SMBs , and to get it right in terms of hardware , software and end - to - end ecosystem , " he told ServerWatch .
" Beyond that , let 's talk in six months when we see how it is going . "
So while this seems to indicate Lenovo does not have the aim of ousting IBM and HP at the top of the charts , it is probably hoping to take away some low - end business from HP and Dell .
The OEM that probably should be the most worried is Fujitsu .
It has worked hard to get a mention in the quarterly server charts .
But its meager 4 percent share means its number five spot is precarious .
Lenovo may well be after it .
If Lenovo succeeds , watch out Dell and Sun , which have been stalled at a little over 10 percent for quite some time .
The Wall Street Journal reports on another Sarah Palin firing -- one that sheds light on the way she mingled personal and political business :
" Whatever you did , you did it right , " she told Mr. Bitney and his team .
Seven weeks later she fired Mr. Bitney for what her spokeswoman now describes as " poor job performance . "
What happened in between ?
According to Mr. Bitney , Gov. Palin got a call from another old friend , Scott Richter , informing her that his wife , Debbie Richter , and Mr. Bitney were having an affair .
Mr. Bitney had kept that secret from the governor , even as he told her of his divorce , he said .
...
When Gov. Palin was notified by Mr. Richter in July 2007 , she called Mr. Bitney into her office .
She already knew he was going through a divorce , and , Mr. Bitney said , he had " led her to believe there were n't going to be any more surprises . "
Mr. Bitney said the governor " indicated to me that she was hurt , disappointed and upset , and that she did n't know what she wanted to do . "
A few days later , Gov. Palin 's chief of staff " indicated to me that I needed to leave the governor 's office , " Mr. Bitney said .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A giant inflatable pig that went missing from a Southern California music festival at the weekend has been found in tatters in a desert town .
A pig-shaped balloon is seen in the sky as Roger Waters performs at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio , California April 27 , 2008 .

The pig , which has been a signature Pink Floyd stage prop since its appearance on the 1977 cover of “ Animals ” and the song “ Pigs on Wings , ” broke away from its tethers on Sunday night at Coachella Valley Arts and Music Festival .
The festival organizers offered a $ 10,000 reward for the two - story inflatable pig belonging to ex-Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters .
Two couples said on Wednesday they had found the shredded plastic remains of the pig outside their homes .
The pig , bearing political slogans and the word “ Obama ” next to a ticked ballot box for U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama , was used by Waters during his set at the festival in the desert east of Los Angeles .
Steve Stoltz found a big pile of shredded plastic in his La Quinta , California , driveway early on Monday morning when he went to get his newspaper .
“ We did n’t even know what it was then , but that ’s all I hear about now , ” his wife Susan Stoltz told Reuters .
Her neighbor , Judy Rimmer , found an even bigger pile in her driveway .
Since then the neighbors have shared several pork jokes , she said .
“ My sons who are in their 20s will think I ’m pretty cool , ” said Susan Stoltz .
At first the couples thought they were victims of a practical joke .
But after reading mass media coverage of the missing pig they contacted festival organizers who authenticated the remains .
“ They were really anxious to have the pig ’s remains , but we kept souvenirs , ” Susan Stoltz said .
Stoltz said the two couples will split the $ 10,000 reward offered by the festival organizers and will each get four festival tickets for life .

stochastic nature of channel formation and the inherent difficulty in modelling the random behaviour .
Model predictions and experimental coreflood results are compared for linear systems .
The model predicts wormholing and the effects of acidizing parameters such as fluid velocity , mineral dissolution rate , and rock properties on channel structure and the corresponding rate of channel propagation .
Experimental data and model prediction support the conclusion that wormholing is necessary for matrix treatment effectiveness , but does not occur for the extremes of high and low values of the Damkohler number for flow and reaction , which controls the process .
The model thus accounts for the ineffectiveness of aqueous hydrochloric acid for matrix treatments in limestone due to rapid acid spending , and for the possible ineffectiveness of treatments in dolomite due to mineral dissolution rates that are too slow to promote channel formation .
Coreflood experiments have been performed and a two dimensional network model has been developed to study the flow , dissolution , and permeability increase in carbonates during acid stimulation treatments .
The goal is to be able to predict the behaviour of the random flow channels , called wormholes , that form in the rock as a result of acid attack .
Understanding this channeling phenomenon is essential in predicting acid penetration distances and the resulting injectivity or productivity increases during matrix acidizing , or in understanding acid leakoff behaviour during fracture acidizing .
Until now , relatively little has been known about the wormholing phenomenon because of the more »
With yesterday 's refresh to Apple 's iPod line , it was hard not to feel at least a little deja vu .
I 've been following new iPod announcements — which often come more than once a year — since 2001 , when the first iPod showed up in stores for an astronomical $ 399 .
In the iPod 's seven years , a sort of price mean has emerged , settling around $ 249 despite countless claims of " more space , " " more battery life , " and , err , " more smaller . "
It 's no surprise then that $ 249 is the price of a new 120 GB iPod classic , a few dollars more than a new model 8 GB iPod touch and $ 50 higher than the cost of a 4th Gen 16 GB iPod nano .

Health State of Listeria : Government Oversight Could Have Prevented Outbreak By Ryan McGreal
Published September 18 , 2008
If the epic finance fustercluck - in - slow - motion spilling out from south of the border demonstrates anything at all , it 's that the market does not self - regulate very well , and that it 's ultimately far cheaper to regulate before the fact than to clean up the inevitable messes after the fact .
Unfortunately , the simplistic mantra of deregulation and industry self - regulation is just so compelling a narrative , despite the mountains of evidence against it , that some political parties just seem to find it too irresistable to give up .
Stephen Harper has long advocated what he calls the incremental approach to shifting this country to the right so that it ceases to be , as he calls it , " a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term , and proud of it . "
He has already claimed during this election campaign that Canadians have become more conservative during his time as Prime Minister , though acknowledging that some of his party 's MPs are to the right of the national mainstream .
Unfortunately , even as he calls a snap election two and a half years into his minority Parliament , the right - wing policies he has advanced are already starting to unravel .
Food Safety
Luc Pomerleau , a biologist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for 20 years , discovered a non-secured document on the Agency intranet that detailed a controversial government plan to shift responsibility for food safety and labelling from the government to industry last May .
The plan was drafted by Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz and approved by the Treasury Board last November .
Included in the leaked documents was a letter from Treasury Board Secretary Wayne Wouters to CFIA President Carole Swan warning that the plan has " significant communication risks " - a statement eerily reminiscent of the infamous " selling job " memo the Mulroney Government distributed internally in 1985 about the planned Free Trade Agreement .
As a report in Canwest News noted , the plan reflects " a direction in which the agency has been heading for years and the union has long voiced concerns about the impact of such a shift on jobs and the food safety of Canadians . "
Pomerleau forwarded the letter to his union , the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada ( PIPSC ) , and the union brought it up at a subsequent union - management meeting .
The Agency discovered who had forwarded the document and fired Pomerleau for " gross misconduct " and breaching security , an action that was decried by whistleblower advocates .
When Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz was asked about the incident , he denied that Pomerleau was a whistleblower .
" The whistleblower was the gentleman who turned Mr. Pomerleau in . "
PIPSC president Michèle Demers wrote a withering assessment of the dismissal :
When an honest and dedicated food safety professional is fired just for the sake of a communications plan , we must all be very wary of the direction the country is headed .
Luc Pomerleau was fired by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( CFIA ) last week for releasing a government document implementing the shift of food inspection from government to food manufacturers and distributers . [...]
Mr. Harper and his minority Conservative government are secretly implementing their privatization agenda .
As months go by , that ideology has started to permeate all levels of government departments and services .
By handing public services over to a non-elected , non-accountable private sector , they are risking Canadians ' health and safety one decision at a time .
The Harper government has since backtracked on whether all the aspects of this plan will go ahead , though they do plan to proceed with letting the meat industry regulate its own product labelling .
This is so reckless to the public interest that even the meat industry itself is calling the plan " dangerous " .
While the government talks about " reducing the regulatory burden " on companies and letting the industry " take the lead in fulfilling their responsibility for consumer protection , " food policy experts warn that deregulation is akin to " playing Russian Roulette with the Canadian public .
"
Listeriosis Outbreak
The Pomerleau incident gained new prominence as the listeriosis outbreak spread across the country in August , with a dramatic recall from Maple Leaf Foods and at least sixteen confirmed deaths from 43 confirmed infections related to the outbreak .
Harper responded by issuing a food recall and calling for an investigation ( which conveniently will not take place until after the snap election ) .
The September 16 , 2008 issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal has a damning editorial ( PDF link ) that points the finger at the Federal government for dismantling the regulatory oversight that should have prevented this from happening .
The article identified the CFIA policy of food industry self - inspection ( including the operators of animal feed mills , whose unsafe practices had led to the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalitis , or " Mad Cow Disease " ) ; national standards that are lower than many other industrialized countries ( instead of raising its standards to match the higher American standard , the government actually lobbied the US government to lower its standards ) ; the lack of remedial steps after the outbreak began ; and eliminating the Public Health Agency of Canada Ministry that was created in response to the 2003 SARS epidemic .
In practice , the new policy meant that CFIA inspectors would rarely enter meat plants to test for bacteria and testing was left mostly to companies .
Self - inspection came largely to substitute for , and not just to supplement , government inspection .
Self - inspection mechanisms have worked effectively in other countries , but in Canada something went very wrong .
One troubling sign is that even now , months after the policy change , the CFIA 's required sampling procedure remains under development .
Maple Leaf Foods , the company at whose plant the Listeria contamination originated , was an early adopter of the government 's new plan .
And why not ?
The new policy made self - inspection easy : the company had to keep up good manufacturing practices in its plant and to test finished products just once monthly .
The editorial also criticized the Harper government for its choice in how to structure the investigation of the listeriosis epidemic : no truly independent investigator " at arms ' length from the government " , no power to subpoena witnesses or documents , no public input , and no promise to publish its findings , let alone act on them .
So much for Harper 's promises of transparency and accountability .
Death by a Thousand Cold Cuts
Gerry Ritz , the Agriculture Minister who drafted the government 's food safety deregulation , has since come under criticism for tasteless jokes he made about the listeriosis epidemic and its potential to harm the government 's image .
The Star reports :
" This is like a death by a thousand cuts .
Or should I say cold cuts , " Ritz quipped after fretting about the political dangers of the crisis .
And when told during the conference call about a new death in Prince Edward Island , Ritz remarked : " Please tell me it 's Wayne Easter . "
Easter , the Liberal MP for the P.E.I. riding of Malpeque , is his party 's agriculture critic .
Now , I 'm the last person to criticize someone for an irreverent sense of humour .
Ritz is not the first person to make inappropriate wisecracks about sensitive subjects with heroically poor timing .
( I have such an unfortunate tendency myself , as my frequently groaning friends can attest , so it would be hypocritical of me to decry this in others . )
The issue is not so much that Ritz was joking about Listeriosis deaths as it was that he was joking about Listeriosis deaths when it was his own party 's policies that allowed this preventable outbreak to happen in the first place .

More Ways That Open Source Could Benefit Schools
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 05 , 2008
In a previous post , I cited some data on how doable it might be to put a Linux netbook or notebook in the hand of every kid in school , paying for the effort by getting schools to go paperless -- or near - paperless .
With Linux - based netbooks such as the Asus Eee PCs dropping well below $ 400 for basic systems and stocked with lots of good open source software , every kid could have a personal computer .
This post caught my eye because it cites some good software applications that could boost Linux in schools .
Here 's the upshot .
Datamation 's post on Linux - for - school software cites the following applications as examples of how teachers and administrators could use free tools to inexpensively automate school - oriented process and interaction with students :
MyClassroomHelper is closed source classroom management software that is Linux supported .
Students can track grades , assignments , and information online with it at any time .
ClaSS is an open source student information management system that can be used by school administrators and teachers .
iTALC is freeware that lets teachers see what 's going on on networked computers and offer remote control assistance to students on computers .
OpenAdmin for Schools is an open source , web - based application for everything from tracking attendance to building and delivering report cards .
As lofty as all the goals above are , I doubt if we 'll see schools adopt Linux , open source and the concept of a computer for every kid anytime soon .
For one thing , just as the paperless office never quite took shape , it 's even harder to get schools and teachers to consider going paperless .
There are also long - standing prejudicial attitudes among school administrators , especially when it comes to Apple 's systems and software .
Despite the cost savings and efficiencies that open source could bring to many schools , parents should keep planning to shell out for those Macs .

Progress Energy ( PGN : NYSE )
By Calyon Securities ( $ 40.53 , July 17 , 2008 )
WE ARE RAISING OUR RATING on Progress Energy to Buy from Add and reiterating our $ 50 per share target price .
We believe Progress Energy is an attractive defensive investment opportunity in today 's volatile marketplace , with upside potential far outweighing downside risk .
Progress Energy is executing its corporate plan as laid out , and the regulatory picture in both the Carolinas and Florida remains strong .
Progress Energy shares have declined about 7 % since late June , and are down 16 % from its December 2007 high of $ 50.22 .
We see 23 % upside potential in the equity , plus an attractive and secure 6.1 % dividend yield .
Progress Energy shares are trading at a current - year price / earnings of 13.3 times versus its electric utility peers at 15.7 times , a discount we believe is unwarranted .
In addition , its 6.1 % dividend yield is well above its electric utility peer yield of 3.9 % .
The stock has traded at a peer discount over the past several years due to its corporate restructuring ( it sold approximately $ 3.6 billion of assets over the past several years ) and due to its payout ratio having exceeded 100 % in 2006 .
These initiatives are now complete , the dividend is secure , and the payout ratio is down to 0.8 times .
We expect continuing modest dividend increases for the next two to three years , with the company sticking to its stated goal of reducing its payout ratio to approximately 75 % , something we believe will occur by 2010 .
The company reiterated its commitment to the dividend , and there is nothing we can see that should jeopardize it .
There remains some uncertainty at Progress Energy 's PEC ( North Carolina / South Carolina ) utility operation regarding the impact of the Clean Smokestacks legislation in North Carolina .
While Progress received regulatory approval to recover the original $ 813 million of estimated compliance costs several years ago , the ultimate cost of compliance has increased to $ 1.1 - $ 1.4 billion .
A decision on the ultimate mode of recovery of this incremental cost is expected this quarter .
Cost recovery for these mandated initiatives is likely , as we believe it should be .
Customer growth has slowed in Florida to 1.4 % year over year , from a seven - year compound annual growth rate of 2.4 % , and could slow further ( but we would note that it still remains above its peer average ) .
Importantly , customer growth in the Carolinas remains only modestly below its 2.2 % seven - year CAGR level .
On a positive note , investor concern over rising bad debt industry - wide has not occurred at Progress in a meaningful way .
Progress noted that they have seen very little impact despite the rising cost of power generation .
Progress continues to pursue its $ 17 billion Levy County Nuclear buildout in Florida , including transmission , and recently received Florida Public Service Commission approval for its " determination of need " filing .
Preconstruction costs for the plant could total as much as $ 500 million through about 2010 , but all of these costs are fully recoverable in Florida via annual cost - recovery filings .
Florida appears fully committed to fuel diversification away from natural gas , particularly after the impact of several hurricanes over the past few years , and given that coal plants appear to be a nonstarter at this point in Florida .
While a big price tag , this should provide future earnings .
The impact over the next several years , however , is minor .

Unintended Effects of Genetic Manipulation A Project of The Nature Institute Project Director : Craig Holdrege
Email : nontarget@natureinstitute.org
Some Examples of Unintended Effects of Genetic Manipulation
Many unintended ( or , as I will usually refer to them here , " nontarget " ) effects of genetic manipulation have been recorded in the scientific literature .
Below we present a few examples of different types in order to give an impression of the broad spectrum of nontarget effects , ranging from alterations at the level of DNA to impact on the broader environment .
For more examples and further commentary on the issue of nontarget effects of genetic manipulation , click here .
Genes from GM crops escape into the wild
Creeping bentgrass is widely used on golf courses .
Monsanto and The Scotts Company have developed an herbicide - resistant variety of creeping bentgrass that they hope to market on a large scale .
In this case -- the only such to date -- the EPA and USDA requested an environmental impact report , since the GM creeping bentgrass could easily cross-pollinate with wild creeping bentgrass and other weedy grasses , possibly resulting in herbicide - resistant " superweeds . "
In 2003 The Scotts Company planted 400 acres of herbicide - resistant creeping bentgrass in a field trial .
EPA and university scientists then looked to see whether the herbicide - resistance gene spread into the wild ( Reichmann et al .
2006 ; Watrud et al. 2004 ; Zapiola et al. 2008 ) .
They found that it did , through seeds and via pollen .
The herbicide resistance transgene spread via pollen to an area up to 13 miles beyond the control area perimeter and had pollinated wild creeping bentgrass as well as a close relative ( redtop ) .
In the following three years , researchers found that a majority of the creeping bentgrass plants they investigated in an area up to 2.4 miles beyond the study area had become herbicide - resistant ( 93 % in 2004 and 62 % in 2006 ) .
The university scientists who were part of this investigation concluded that it is " unrealistic to think that a transgene could be contained in an outcrossing , wind - pollinated , small - seeded , perennial crop , even with expanded isolation distances and stringent production practices , " and the " elimination of transgenes is unlikely to be feasible " ( Zapiola et al. 2008 , pp. 5 , 7 ) .
Although The Scotts Company was fined $ 500,000 in 2007 by the USDA for failing to comply with " performance standards and permit conditions " ( USDA News Release No. 0350.07 ) , even the most stringent practices would probably not have prevented the transgenes escaping into the wild .
And now they are there and will most likely spread further .
Unexpected effects arising under field conditions
Sometimes the side - effects of genetic manipulation do not become apparent until the crops are grown commercially .
In the late 1990s some farmers in Georgia complained about the poor performance of their Roundup Ready soybeans under conditions of drought and heat .
Scientists then carried out a comparative laboratory study of transgenic and conventional soybeans ( Gertz et al. 1999 ) .
They found that the transgenic plants were shorter , had a lower fresh weight , had less chlorophyll content , and , at high temperature , suffered from stem splitting .
In another case , genetically engineered Bt corn , which produces its own pesticide , was found -- after five years of commercial planting on millions of acres -- to contain substantially more lignin in the stalks than unmodified corn ( Saxena and Stotzky 2001 ; Poerschmann et al. 2005 ) .
Lignin makes the stems woodier .
No one has investigated how the higher lignin content might affect the corn 's digestibility by the cattle or pigs that are fed on it .
What other biochemical pathways may have been repressed or altered as a result of the increased production of lignin also remains unknown .
Adverse effects on animals fed genetically modified plants
To make peas more resistant to weevils , scientists in Australia genetically altered peas with a gene construct containing DNA from beans , which have a natural defense against weevils .
Scientists isolated from beans the gene related to the production of a protein that blocks the breakdown of starch and thereby causes the weevils feeding on the beans to starve .
The genetically altered peas gained the same kind of defense against weevils .
To see if the transgenic peas might present a risk to human health , the peas were tested on mice ( Prescott et al. 2005 ) .
To their surprise , the scientists found that the mice developed an immune response to the peas , meaning they produced antibodies against the genetically modified protein .
The scientists discovered that the protein in the pea had , after initial formation , been altered ( post - translational modification ) and in this changed form elicited an inflammatory reaction in the mice .
Since peas are used as a component of animal feed , the scientists also investigated whether there were any marked effects on the animals fed with feed containing the GM peas ( Collins et al. 2006 ; Li et al. 2006 ) .
They found that starch digestion in the small intestines was markedly decreased in pigs and chickens fed a diet including the transgenic peas .
In addition , the growth rate of broiler chickens fed for forty days on a diet including the transgenic peas was reduced by eleven percent .
Australia 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization , which is the governmental organization that carried out the research , decided on the basis of these results not to pursue further work with these GM peas .
Genetic manipulations can alter overall plant structure and metabolism
Researchers genetically engineered canola plants to produce seeds with increased amounts of carotene , so that eventually canola could be used as a commercial source of carotene ( Shewmaker et al. 1999 ) .
Normally canola seeds do not accumulate carotene .
The manipulation succeeded and the transgenic mature canola seeds contained up to a 50 - fold increase in carotene ( mainly alpha - and beta - carotene ) , making the embryo visibly orange .
But there were many unintended effects :
The amount of chlorophyll produced by the plant in developing seeds was reduced .
Levels of gamma tocopherol ( a form of vitamin E ) were also decreased in seeds .
Some microscopic structures in the embryos were altered and thread - like bodies of unknown nature appeared .
The amount of phytoene in the plants was increased compared with controls .
Phytoene is normally an intermediate product of metabolism and does not accumulate .
The amount of lutein and xanthophylls was not higher , although they also are end products of the carotene metabolic pathway and " should " have been produced in increased amounts .
The composition of fatty acids was altered : there was more oleic acid and less linoleic and linolenic acid .
This change in fatty acid composition was wholly unexpected since there is no known link between fatty acid synthesis and carotene synthesis .
Germination in transgenic seeds was delayed by one or two days compared to control plants .
Evidently , it is naive to believe that we can change a single substance and nothing else .
Changing one thing has multiple effects and sometimes these are a complete surprise .
In another experiment , researchers produced five lines of transgenic potatoes that were genetically altered to produce insecticidal substances ( Birch et al. 2002 ) .
They wanted to determine whether the genetic transformation of potatoes to produce insecticide resulted in any unintended changes in the amounts of glycoalkaloids in the leaves of the plants .
Glycoalkaloids are normally present in the leaves and stems of potato plants and are highly toxic to mammals .
Ecologically , glycoalkaloid - containing leaves may be feeding deterrents to browsing mammals and some insects due to their toxicity and bitterness , so there is some concern about the possible unintended results of altered glycoalkaloid levels in genetically modified potatoes .
The researchers realized that " it is incorrect to assume that the current methods of genetic engineering used to express single transgenes in plants are completely targeted and will have no , or minimal , effects on unrelated biosynthetic pathways in transformed plants " ( p. 144 ) .
They found a number of nontarget effects :
Four of five transgenic lines produced significantly less foliage than the control plants .
In three of the five transgenic lines , stem production was significantly reduced , while in one of the lines stem production was significantly higher , which was reflected in the bushy growth form of the plants in that transgenic line .
All transgenic lines had significantly lower levels of leaf - glycoalkaloids than both the normal controls and the tissue culture controls .
For example , one line had a 24 % reduction in glycoalkaloid levels , while three lines had on average 44 % less leaf - glycoalkaloid content .
Four of five transgenic lines had significantly lower levels of glycoalkaloids in their stems .
In two of the five transgenic lines , the ratios of two different glycoalkaloids ( alpha - chaconine and alpha - solanine ) were significantly altered in the leaves .
In most studies the researchers do not investigate substances they assume to be unrelated to the metabolic pathway they aim to alter by means of the genetic manipulation .
In this case , as the authors found , there were significant changes in an important group of substances ( the glycoalkaloids ) .
These changes could have significant implications , since widespread planting of transgenic potatoes that inadvertently have lowered amounts of the glycoalkaloids in their leaves could lead to an increase in potato pests , thereby counteracting the very benefit that was intended by the genetic manipulation .
The authors conclude : " We think that it is as important to monitor unintended changes in the levels of such secondary plant compounds as it is to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the intended transgene product ( anti-insect gene products ) in the agro-ecosystem " ( p. 148 ) .
What causes a change in characteristics is not necessarily the target gene
Scientists wanted to make potato plants resistant to the potato leaf luteovirus , which is transmitted by aphids that feed on potato plants ( Presting et al. 1995 ) .
Potato leaf luteovirus infections can cause severe losses in potato crops .
Previous experiments had shown that transgenic potatoes with the gene for a viral coat protein ( CP ) had some resistance to the virus , even though the potatoes did not actually make the CP protein .
In this experiment the researchers created different transgenic lines of Russet Burbank and Ranger Russet potatoes .
Some lines of each variety contained the CP gene , and some contained a modified CP gene , which the researchers hoped would cause plants to produce the viral coat protein and thereby gain increased resistance to the virus .
Finally , they created control lines containing a gene construct that lacked a target gene ( that is , lacked both the CP gene and the modified CP gene ) .
All Russet Burbank transgenic lines containing the CP gene or the modified CP gene showed significantly lower virus infection than unmanipulated potato plants .
But this was not due to the coat protein , because none could be detected .
What caused the increased resistance remained unclear .
Only 4 of 15 transgenic lines of the Ranger Russet potatoes containing the CP transgene showed increased virus resistance .
Even more surprising was the discovery that the most resistant transgenic Ranger Russet line was the one that had been transformed with the control construct , which did not contain the CP gene or the modified CP gene .
The target effect arose without the target gene !
Finally , there were significant differences in virus resistance among the lines that had been transformed with the same construct , so that considerable variability in resistance was induced by the genetic transformation process .
This study clearly illustrates how a target effect in a transgenic plant -- virus resistance in this case -- can appear , although the relation of that phenotypic change to the genetic manipulation remains a complete riddle .
Transgenes can be silenced and those that are not may not produce the desired effect
In an effort to make spring wheat resistant to scab ( headblight ) , a major fungal disease in wheat , researchers inserted two genes into wheat that were known to be related to scab resistance ( Anand et al. 2003 ) .
After the manipulation , 24 different lines were found to contain one or both of the transgenes and to express one or both of the proteins that were meant to convey scab resistance .
Surprisingly , transgene activity in 20 of the 24 lines ( 80 % ) shut down after the initial generation .
This is known as transgene silencing .
In some unknown way , the plants respond to the manipulation by inhibiting the expression of the inserted genes .
The four other lines showed stable inheritance of the transgenes for up to four generations and produced one or both of the target proteins .
While one of these lines showed reduced scab infection under greenhouse conditions , none of them was resistant to scab infection under field conditions .
Moreover , plants of the line that had the highest transgene expression also suffered from a " lesion - mimic phenotype " in which the leaves developed patches of dying tissue during flower formation .
Integration of foreign genes into the host organism 's DNA is unpredictable
In a study carried out with the mustard plant Arabidopsis , which is the most thoroughly studied plant from a genetic perspective , researchers wanted to investigate how a gene construct is incorporated into the plant 's DNA ( Forsbach et al. 2003 ) .
Gene constructs containing a marker gene and various reporter genes were inserted into Arabidopsis tissue via a bacterium ( Agrobacterium ) and numerous transgenic plants were generated from tissue cultures .
The researchers found that in 80 % of the transgenic lines the gene construct had been inserted at a single site ( locus ) .
However , in only 22 % of these did the gene construct remain intact .
From this group , 122 lines were selected for further investigation ; in these lines the gene construct was of " sufficient length and quality to determine unambiguously the position of integration in the Arabidopsis genome " ( p. 165 ) .
In connection with these 122 lines , the researchers found :
Only three of 71 lines investigated contained a gene construct that corresponded precisely to the full - length strand of DNA in the originally inserted construct ; in all the others there were small deletions at one or both ends of the sequence .
In 88.7 % of the lines , the integration of the gene construct resulted in deletions of plant DNA at the site of integration .
Only 2.7 % " inserted exactly into the target site " -- that is , without such deletions or other changes ( p. 168 ) .
In over half the lines , short " filler sequences " of DNA were found between the borders of the construct and the plant DNA flanking those borders .
In those cases in which the origin of this filler DNA could be identified , it was found to consist of DNA fragments from either the plant or the transgenic construct .
In two of the lines " extensive chromosomal rearrangements associated with the integration " ( p. 169 ) of the gene construct were found .
Chromosomal fragments were swapped between different chromosomes ( reciprocal translocation ) .
The researchers summarize : " In the majority of cases , single - copy T - DNA [ i.e. the transgenic construct ] insertions were associated with small or large rearrangements such as deletions and / or duplications of target site sequences , deletions and / or duplications of T - DNA sequences and gross chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations " ( p. 161 ) .
The authors also point out that the frequency of DNA rearrangements " is likely to be even higher if transgenic lines containing multiple T - DNA inserts are analyzed " ( p. 173 ) , and they refer to other research .
In a different study , researchers investigated the integration of the foreign DNA construct shot into oat plants via microprojectile bombardment ( Makarevitch 2003 ; for a description of this technique see Table 2 in " Understanding the Nontarget Effects of Genetic Manipulation " in this issue ) .
In the majority of transgenic lines the construct was not integrated as a single unit into the host organism 's DNA : only 7 of 36 lines appeared to show simple insertion .
Two of these lines with simple integration sites were chosen for further examination .
Closer investigation of one showed that , in addition to the major integration site with the functional gene , there were two smaller integration sites , which had gone undetected in previous studies .
In addition , in both lines the gene constructs showed complex integration : " full - length and partially truncated copies of the delivered DNA were integrated in different orientations , interspersed with regions of extensively scrambled transgene and genomic [ oat ] DNA sequences , and , in two cases , flanked by rearranged genomic [ oat ] DNA " ( p. 429 ) .
Both these studies show that the integration of the foreign DNA into the genome of the host organism is more or less haphazard and can in no way be predicted .
The desired result at the level of DNA , namely the integration of a simple copy of the gene construct without an effect on the host organism 's DNA , rarely occurs .
Increased planting of glyphosate - resistant crops and application of glyphosate causes an increase in glyphosate - resistant weed species
Glyphosate - resistant crops -- especially soybeans , cotton , corn , canola -- are the most prevalent genetically modified crops and are grown on millions of acres of cropland in the U.S. and other countries .
Ninety percent of soybeans grown in the U.S. in 2007 were genetically modified glyphosate - resistant varieties .
The wide - spectrum herbicide glyphosate has been sold by Monsanto Company under the name Roundup since 1974 .
In 1996 the first glyphosate - resistant weeds were reported and in the decade since then -- which coincides with the increased cultivation of genetically modified , glyphosate - resistant plants -- ten different glyphosate - resistant weed species have been found in fields planted with glyphosate - resistant crops ( Cadeira and Duke 2006 ; Nandula et al. 2005 ; Owen and Zelaya 2005 ; www.weedscience.org).
These include common waterhemp ( Amaranthus rudis ) , common ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia ) , and horseweed ( Conyza canadensis ) .
The latter has evolved increased resistance to glyphosate since resistant populations were first detected in fields planted with Roundup Ready soybeans in Delaware in 2000 .
Since then , resistant populations have been found in fourteen other states as well as in Brazil and China .
In addition to these weed species that have evolved resistance in relation to glyphosate use , at least 13 other species of weeds possessing natural resistance to glyphosate are now being observed in fields grown with glyphosate - resistant crops in the U.S. , Brazil , and Argentina .
These include common lambsquarters ( Chenopodium album ) , velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti ) , and species of morning glory ( Ipomeoa ) .
In a greenhouse experiment , researchers found that glyphosate - resistant horseweed could form hybrids with its nonresistant close relative , dwarf horseweed ( Conyza ramosissima ) , which is also a common weed .
The hybrids were fertile , had superior resistance to glyphosate , and the resistance was inherited as a semi- dominant trait ( Zelaya et al. 2007 ) .
" Glyphosate - resistant crop systems are suggested to be simple and without great environmental consequences .
However , we have demonstrated that there are major ecological and economic consequences from these presumed simple systems .
. . .
We propose that if hybridization of new taxa with glyphosate resistance as a semi- dominant trait can occur with relative ease , the current agroecosystem is at considerable jeopardy " ( Zelaya et al. 2007 , p. 669 ) .
As one overview study concludes : " High levels of adoption of GR [ glyphosate - resistant ] crops by U.S. farmers have dramatically increased the use of glyphosate , with a concomitant decrease in use of other herbicides .
This has impacted weed communities .
. . .
The problem of GR weeds is real , and farmers have to understand that continuous use of glyphosate without alternative strategies will likely result in the evolution of more GR weeds .
Even in the short term , no one can predict the future loss of glyphosate efficacy due to weed species shifts and evolution of glyphosate resistance " ( Nandula et al. 2005 , p. 186 ) .

Wipeout HD is an odd game to review ; the tracks , music , and ships have been taken from the PSP games in the series .
The difference is that now , everything moves at 60 frames a second , even if you 're running the game at 1080 p .
To put it plainly , the game is so pretty that you wo n't mind playing on tracks you 've enjoyed in the past .
Everything from the menus to the UI is polished to a high shine .
This is the game that you use to amaze people when they come over and check out your system .
The music , in full 5.1 surround sound , is wonderful .
Of course , if you do n't like it , you can set up your own playlist from the music on your hard drive .
Yes , it sucks that more PS3 games do n't do this , but if there is one game that fully takes advantage of a kicking soundtrack , Wipeout HD is it .
Online runs well , although there are n't many options , outside of a single race and a tournament that seems to go on forever .
The game also features split - screen multiplayer , which is a nice touch , even if the graphics do take a hit playing this way .
I also was unimpressed with the Sixaxis controls .
You 're going to have a much easier time turning off the motion - control .
You 'll need every inch of your skills as well ; this is not an easy game .
Luckily , you can skip some events and still move forward : each grid is made up of multiple events , such as a simple race or a time trial across the track .
If you get hung up on one race , play around and try to find something a little easier .
The game also gives you the option of turning on an AI helper that keeps you from slamming into the walls .
There is also a photo mode you can use to take a few screenshots with different effects layered on .
Sure , the content is recycled , but it 's great content .
Taking a great game like WipeOut Pulse for the PSP , giving it a face - lift that 's this impressive , and then selling it for $ 20 is n't a bad deal at all .
Would this be worth the money as a full - release ?
Possibly , although this review would harp on the lack of new content a little more .
For $ 20 , this is one of the best purchases you can make on the PS3 right now .
Unfortunately , some popular people are still experiencing issues , so hopefully that will be fixed soon .
Thanks to unimental for the screenshot
I originally published this article 4 years ago during the last Olympics .
I thought it would be fun to revisit the list as we ’re enjoying the 2012 Olympics !
I updated a few of the news links , but as I was rereading it , ironically , most of the financial lessons still apply !
What do the Olympics and money management have in common ?
Plenty !
As I was watching the opening ceremonies and the first few events last weekend , I saw lots of ways to improve your finances .
Here are the financial tips that I found .
Feel free to add more lessons that you see during the next couple weeks !
Olympics and Money Management
What is your favorite part of the Olympics ?
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- John McCain accepted the Republican nomination for president Thursday night " with gratitude , humility and confidence " as thousands of delegates chanted his name .
Sen .
John McCain says the " do nothing " Washington crowd is in for a change .
" Let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election , " he said .
In a speech before a giant screen showing an American flag waving against a blue background , McCain promised to put the people first .
" I understand who I work for .
I do n't work for a party .
I do n't work for a special interest .
I do n't work for myself .
I work for you , " he said , to cheers from the crowd .
McCain portrayed himself as a fighter , saying he had fought corruption and big spenders , regardless of which party they came from .
" I 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
I 've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes .
I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon .
I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses . "
But , he said , he had learned through a lifetime of fighting " it matters less that you can fight .
What you fight for is the real test . "
" I fight for Americans .
I fight for you , " he said .
In a speech that used the word " fight " or " fought " 34 times , McCain vowed he would " fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God , as I thank Him : that I 'm an American , a proud citizen of the greatest country on Earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach . "
McCain rattled through a number of talking points designed to appeal to his Republican base .
iReport.com : Did McCain seal the deal ?
" We believe in a strong defense , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench , " the Arizona senator said .
He contrasted his aims with those of his " opponent , " who , he said , would raise taxes and institute a health care system that would force " small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government - run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor . "
Obama 's campaign issued a barrage of statements rebutting McCain 's attacks , some as the speech was still going on .
The campaign cited experts who said the Obama tax plan offered bigger cuts than McCain 's for the bottom 80 percent of earners , and asserted that McCain 's health care plan would " erode the employer - based health system " without reducing the ranks of the uninsured .
Much of the loudest applause during McCain 's speech came when he spoke about his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who received a rapturous reception when she gave her national debut speech Wednesday night .
But he also drew cheers for a promise to seek energy independence through more oil drilling , nuclear power , clean coal , renewables , and flex fuel and hybrid cars .
" We are going to stop sending $ 700 billion a year to countries that do n't like us very much , " he said in reference to American oil imports .
A respectful hush fell over the audience when McCain spoke of his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , a captivity that lasted 5 ½ years after he was shot down over Hanoi as a Navy flier .
That was when he " fell in love " with his country , he said : " when I was a prisoner in someone else 's . "
He closed his speech with an exhortation to service .
" Our country will be the better , and you will be the happier , " he said .
" Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself . "
" I thought it was a great speech , " Illinois state Rep. Dan Brady said .
" I thought that it showed Sen. McCain in one of his finest moments .
He articulated his message -- change . "
Will Barfoot , a delegate from Montgomery , Alabama , said the speech was " wonderful . "
" He is the only man that can lead this country in the time that we 're in now .
Thank God he 's the man we are going to elect , " Barfoot said .
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton disagreed .
" John McCain said that his party was elected to change Washington , but that they let Washington change them , " Burton said .
" He 's right .
He admonished the ' old , do - nothing crowd ' in Washington , but ignored the fact that he 's been part of that crowd for 26 years , opposing solutions on health care , energy , and education , " Burton continued .
" He talked about bipartisanship , but did n't mention that he 's been a Bush partisan 90 percent of the time , that he 's run a Karl Rove campaign , and that he wants to continue this president 's disastrous economic and foreign policies for another four years . "
McCain was interrupted at least once by protesters from the anti-war group Code Pink , who were shouted down by delegates shouting " USA , " as they had been instructed to do .
Protesters were physically removed from the hall .
McCain was formally nominated the night before .
If he defeats Obama in November , he will become the oldest person to be elected to a first term in the White House .

President Bush is opposing legislation creating a so - called copyright czar and might veto the measure .
The House on Sunday sent the president the " Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act , " ( .pdf ) a measure the Senate approved Friday creating a cabinet - level copyright czar charged with implementing a nationwide plan to combat piracy and " report directly to the president and Congress regarding domestic international intellectual property enforcement programs . "
The White House successfully lobbied the Senate to remove language tasking the Department of Justice with suing copyright and trademark infringers on behalf of Hollywood , ( .pdf ) the recording industry , manufacturers and software makers .
But the Bush administration also does n't want a copyright czar , a position on par with the nation 's drug czar Congress created in 1982 to wage the War on Drugs .
Lawmakers , however , sent him the package anyway .
The proposed copyright czar , a position which requires Senate confirmation , " constitutes a legislative intrusion into the internal structure and composition of the president 's administration .
This provision is therefore objectionable on constitutional separation of powers grounds , " the White House wrote lawmakers .
That was code for the Bush administration being in no mood to commence another war , this one the War on Piracy .
The government is too busy battling the War on Terror and the War on Drugs .
Whether the United States is winning the War on Terror is classified and can be neither confirmed nor denied .
The War on Drugs , however , is another story .
Whether it's a winner or loser is open to interpretation .
According to 2007 Bureau of Justice Statistics , about 84 percent of high school seniors reported they could obtain marijuana " fairly easily or very easily . "
When it came to amphetamines , the number was 50 percent , 47 percent for cocaine , 37 percent for crack and 28 percent for LSD .

California Attorney General Jerry Brown recently handed state police and marijuana activists his latest directive towards fulfilling the voter 's will , but it 's just another hopeful stab at getting the feds to stop busting anyone , and everyone , that grows marijuana , and the clinics that distribute it .
Since California voters said they wanted marijuana to be legal for medicinal purposes in 1996 , the feds have brazenly ignored the people 's will and have continued to hunt down medical marijuana growers , and bust pot clinics sanctioned by cities and counties .
The feds are so enthralled with their war on marijuana that they happily ignore state 's rights .
The wrongheadedness of this warfare is apparent when marijuana is classified as a Class One narcotic .
Putting the pungent herb in with heroin , cocaine , meth , and other serious drugs just displays the feds ignorance from the top down .
Anybody that has had the opportunity to research how marijuana became illegal knows that it was a racist and elitist law passed to run Mexicans out of American towns .
The propaganda that resulted was legendary and hopelessly inaccurate .
It was another way to go after African - Americans and put them behind bars .
The stereotyping that took place without challenge was a sad note in our history .
Once we grew hemp for victory , during WWII , and now we find that it can make a lot more than just great rope .
The clothing , oil , and other applications that come from marijuana are becoming more known and seeping into the mainstream .
The fact that marijuana has medical applications should give it more respect , but as long as there are feds that trample state 's rights , it 's going to be viewed as being on the wrong side of the law .
With this being a presidential election year there is the opportunity to ask all political parties to put in their two - cents on the issue of medical marijuana and state 's rights .
Now there 's some discussions I 'd like to see .
McCain would probably have a stroke during a debate about pot legalization , and Obama would mention that he tried it in his youth .
When it came to the VP's , Palin would prosecute anyone that defended pot , and Biden would just smile mysteriously .
I think it 's one of those hot - button topics that Americans need to hear the candidates weigh in on .
While we 're at it , let 's get them to talk about states rights .
The feds contempt for them have become too pervasive these days , and it 's time to start acting like we live in a Republic , and we 're not minions of some faceless central government .
Some medical marijuana activists are happily hailing the new guidelines by the state 's top law dog , and if reports are true , some police agencies are happy with the new guidelines for whose been naughty and whose been nice .
Humboldt County , the un-official pot capital of California and the USA - already had some pretty liberal medical marijuana laws going , and it 's district attorney had no problem going along with the new directives .
After all of these years of sparring between state and federal authorities , the new rule book is supposed to really be an improvement and will respect the legal patient 's right to puff pot .
The whole idea is supposed to make it easy to go after the bad guys while not hassling the good guys .
As It Stands , since when have the feds honored anything since the state 's new law was enacted a dozen years ago ?

With the threat of global warming looming , it 's more important than ever that all of us appear to care about the environment .
Maybe no one works harder on this than celebrities , who make it a point to show up in the papers every now and then with their latest eco-friendly gesture .
We would applaud them for this , if it was n't for the fact that the gestures are often mind - blowingly retarded .

7 Paul McCartney Gets a Hybrid ... Flown to Him by Private Jet Continue Reading Below Advertisement Earlier this year , Paul McCartney bought ( or may have been given ) a hybrid car from Lexus , after he had done some promotional work for them .
See !
This is what John Lennon was singing about , people .
So What 's the Problem ?
The car was specially flown in from Japan , thus creating several hundred times more emissions than it would ever save .
Reports differ as to whether or not McCartney bought the car and demanded it be flown to him , or if Lexus took it upon themselves to send it to him to make McCartney look like even more of a dick than he usually does .
In an interview , McCartney claimed to be horrified by the whole thing , but he could n't talk for long as he had to go protect animals from potential forest fires by chopping down the Amazon rain forest .

6 Jennifer Aniston Brushes Her Teeth in the Shower
On the eve of Al Gore 's Live Earth gigs in July 2007 , Jennifer Aniston said that because every two minutes of showering uses as much water as an African person has for an entire day , she restricts herself to a three minute shower ( why fuck just one African 's day up ? ) .
Also , she pointed out that she brushes her teeth in the shower to save on water , and that she painted her house green so it could be powered by photosynthesis .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement OK , we made the last one up .
So What 's the Problem ?
For the moment we 'll forgive the fact that dentists say it takes two minutes to brush your teeth properly , leaving Jennifer only one minute in the shower to clean the rest of her body ( though perhaps making it clearer why Brad Pitt left her ) .
The bigger problem is that two minutes of brushing in the shower uses about five gallons of water , where two minutes of modest faucet usage ( even if you 're the type who leaves it running the whole time ) only uses about two gallons .
You do n't need a spreadsheet to tell you which one saves the most water .
Also , we can say from personal experience that you can save way more water than either method by simply not showering at all .

Erik says : " Here 's a spectacular idea : many kids do n't seem to enjoy eating meat , so why not change the flavor so you can't taste the meat , give it an unappetizing color , and extrude it into spaghetti - like strands ?
The meat scientists who invented this stuff are hoping to bring it to market .
Judging from the video the news page offers , which could give you nightmares for weeks , it 's going to be an uphill battle . "
" It tastes like meat and it can look like meat but we can actually change the composition of the product quite a lot so we can mask the meaty flavour , " Mike North from AgResearch says .
And with busy families demanding more convenient yet healthy foods AgResearch believes it is on to something .
Kids love spaghetti but for many parents it 's hard to get them to eat meat – so the meaty , protein saturated , pasta version could be an innovative way of providing youngsters with vital nutrients and iron .
Most modern multi-processors implement relaxed memory models .
How much should you care about that ?
When you program in a high - level language , you should n’t have to worry about your processor ’s memory model , as long as you follow some simple rules .
In Java , for instance , you must make sure that access to shared variables ( both for reading and writing ) is protected by locks ( e.g. , synchronized sections ) .
If you are adventurous , and want to share variables without locking , you must declare them as volatile .
Finally , if you try to share non-volatile variables without locking , you are introducing data races and your program is considered incorrect ( it might still work on some processors ) .
This is what the Java memory model is about , in a nutshell .
C++ memory model proposal takes a similar approach , except that the use of volatile is replaced by the atomic library .
Renegade Java programmers beware–C++ volatile has no multi - thread connotations ( except in some vendor - specific extensions ) .
The D programming language tries to bridge the gap between safe and simple ( Java - like ) , and unsafe and efficient ( systems ) programming .
That almost requires two different memory models .
In the SafeD subset , we ’d ideally want to ban all races and deadlocks .
That could be accomplished only by eliminating lock - based programming .
It seems like a drastic step until you consider that ( a ) you could still use certified libraries that internally use locking , and ( b ) you ’d have futures , message passing , and STM ( Software Transactional Memory ) at your disposal .
There are languages , like Erlang , that base all concurrency on message passing .
And there ’s a lot of code written in Erlang , despite its idiosyncratic syntax .
On the systems - programming end , D might as well follow the C++ memory model , down to “ raw ” atomics , which let you introduce low - level data races .
The volatile keyword is reserved in D , but it ’s not clear what it should mean .
We might simply get rid of it or change its definition .
The problem is that volatile means many different things .
In Java , it ’s both a directive to the compiler to insert appropriate fences ( memory barriers ) , as well as a directive to the optimizer not to perform code motion or caching .
This is also how Microsoft implemented volatile in their C++ compiler .
In principle , code motion and fencing are orthogonal issues .
Hans Boehm ’s implementation of atomics , for instance , uses a low level primitive AO_compiler_barrier , which prevents code movement without introducing memory fences ( it ’s implementation is very compiler - specific ) .
Of course , the D atomics library would not be certified for use in SafeD ; but some lock - free data structures based on it , would .

Here 's one view of America circa 2008 : The US is a modern - day Roman Empire — overstretched , underperforming , slowly crumbling into history 's dustbin .
Here 's Parag Khanna 's view : Nonsense .
The geopolitical wooziness Americans are feeling is n't decline .
It 's realignment .
In his book The Second World : Empires and Influence in the New Global Order , Khanna , 31 , describes a planet dominated by a trio of superpowers : the US , China , and Europe .
In this tripolar era , America 's fate depends on tough national choices , not lame historical analogies .
If the US wises up — by tightening trade and energy ties to the rest of the hemisphere , pursuing economic innovation at home , and establishing a " diplomatic - industrial complex " — it can grow stronger even as the globe becomes less red , white , and blue .
Khanna himself is a peripatetic emblem of this post - American world .
Born in India , he lived as a child in the United Arab Emirates , and attended high school in the US and Germany .
He earned two degrees from Georgetown University 's School of Foreign Service .
Then he punched his ticket at places that might earn him early admission at the Trilateral Commission : the Council on Foreign Relations , the Brookings Institution , and the World Economic Forum .
" I think I 'm the only person who went to Davos seven times by the age of 30 , " the smooth - talking wunderwonk says .
" I 'm not sure that 's a good thing . "
From Canada to Uzbekistan , Khanna identifies the unexpected flash points , overstated threats , and hidden opportunities the next US president might confront .
8 Regions to Watch
Mexico and Canada
Integrate , do n't isolate
America 's oil comes from a volatile region half a world away .
That 's lunacy , Khanna says .
" An energy partnership with Mexico , Canada , Venezuela , and Brazil could make the US much less dependent on oil from the Middle East . "
That 's also why building a wall along our southern border is foolish .
" We should treat Mexico like Europe treats Turkey — integrating , elevating , and partnering with it . "
Colombia
Partner up
Bogotá is as close to Miami as Phoenix is to San Francisco .
" We should invest here , " Khanna says .
" Colombia now exports mostly flowers and drugs .
We can do better than that . "
Egypt
Make friends fast
Egypt is smoldering .
The people are restless after 27 years of the Mubarak dynasty , and the country is ripe for revolt .
We should " make friends , quickly , with other power centers in the country , including the Muslim Brotherhood . "
Iran
Regime change will lead to love
Khanna 's recommendation : " Make the West irresistible to Iranians . "
The US president should deliver a speech directly to the Iranian people that offers them a deal :
They can have , in Khanna 's words , " everything they want in terms of Western investment in energy , freer trade , diplomatic recognition , and increased cultural and student exchanges — if they oust President Ahmadinejad . "
China and India
The panda matters more
The race is n't even close .
" India will never rival China , " Khanna says .
" India accounts for less than 2 percent of the global economy .
It 's not a superpower . "
Meantime , China 's ever - accelerating " neo-mercantilist " freight train wo n't be slowed by demands for such democratic niceties as transparency or free expression .
" The communist leadership is the most powerful emperor China has ever had .
The Chinese people have a preference for stability over another revolution . "
Uzbekistan
Dangerous — and too long ignored
Khanna says this is the most important country no one ever talks about .
Sitting at the heart of the ancient Silk Road , Uzbekistan is the only state that borders all the other - stan nations , whose volatility and strategic significance intensify each day .
It 's also the most populous and industrialized nation in energy - rich central Asia and pivotal to a stable Afghanistan and region .
The challenge : dealing with an autocratic regime that 's not especially fond of human rights .
Russia
Overrated
On the surface , Russia glitters :
It ranks second only to the US in billionaires ; Moscow has a larger Prada store than Milan .
And the country 's army can still spank the neighbors .
But Russia is in " demographic free fall , " Khanna says , and faces alarming rates of tuberculosis and other health problems .
Meanwhile , Chinese immigration is blurring the border .
In the long run , this bear is going to spend a lot of time in hibernation .
Parag Khanna is Director of the Global Governance Initiative at the New America Foundation .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. House rejected on Monday a proposed $ 700 billion financial bailout package supported by the Bush administration , the Federal Reserve and the congressional leadership of both parties .
The vote was 205 for and 228 against .
The rejection of the plan could mean disruption in financial markets and another attempt by officials to craft a compromise plan that will get a majority vote .
The administration had been pushing for quick movement on the bailout , which officials have warned is necessary to avert serious consequences for markets and the economy .
Some critics said the plan was a giveaway to the very companies that created the crisis , while others said it amounted to socialism .

TR -03.214 A PERSONAL HISTORY OF APL
by
Michael S. Montalbano
International Business Machines Corporation
General Products Division
Santa Teresa Laboratory
San Jose , California A PERSONAL HISTORY OF APL Introduction I have several reasons for calling this talk a personal history .
For one , I want to make it clear that the opinions I express are my own : they are not the opinions of my employer or of any other organization , group or person .
If you agree with them , I am happy to have your concurrence : if you disagree , I 'd be happy to defend them .
In any event , the praise , blame or indifference my views may inspire in you should be directed to me and to no one else .
What I plan to discuss are things I have done , seen or experienced at first hand .
Thus , this talk is merely an opinionated collection of anecdotes .
I want to emphasize this from the outset : it is my second reason for calling this a personal history .
But my most important reason is that I feel strongly that we need a good , thoughtful , accurate history both of APL and of computing itself .
While I 'd be flattered to have this account included as part of that history , I do n't want anyone to mistake it t as an attempt at the real thing .
The Importance of History We neglect history at our peril .
The truly incredible growth of digital computer technology has transformed our world almost overnight .
This transformation is not only continuing , it is accelerating .
It gives every promise of continuing to change our institutions and the circumstances of our daily lives at a faster and faster rate .
If we are ever to understand where we 're going , it 's important that we take a long , careful look at where we 've been , where we are , and how we got from there to here .
If we do n't do this , we wo n't be able to control events ; they will control us .
As far as I 'm concerned , that 's what 's happening right now ; a runaway technology has us at its mercy because we have not developed techniques to understand and control it .
H. G. Wells described human history as a race between education and catastrophe .
This observation is more pertinent today than it ever has been in the past .
But , in the specific case of the proliferation of stored - program digital computers , the education - catastrophe race , in my opinion , takes a particular form : it is a race between technology and methodology , between gadgets and ideas .
We are developing gadgets at an explosive , accelerating , self - fueling rate we shall be swamped by these gadgets if we do n't hasten to develop and apply the ideas we need to control them .
To me , this need defines the importance and the mission of APL .
APL provides the best set of gadget - understanding and gadget - controlling ideas currently available .
Looking to the future , it provides the best base for the methodology we must develop if we are ever to bring our gadget - based technology under control .
This opinion is based on experience .
I was working with computers when they were merely gleams in the eyes of the early designers : I was working with APL when it was nothing but a collection of incomprehensible characters scattered through publications with catchy titles like : The Description of Finite Sequential Processes .
In other words , I 've been working with both computers and APL since their very early days .
And , in looking back on this experience of just over 34 years , ( which is my own personal experience of computing ) , I find that it can best be summarized in n terms of two key ideas :
The stored - program idea : the idea that a procedure or algorithm can be stored as a collection of switch settings in exactly the same way as the data on which the procedure is to work and , as a consequence , that executing such a stored procedure consists of starting it and letting it flip switches until it is done .
This was apparently first stated explicitly in n a paper drafted by John yon Neumann in n 1945 .
1
The efficient - notation idea : the idea that these vast collections of switches , changing their settings in thousandths , millionths , billionths , trillionths , ... of a second , would be pretty hard to manage if we did n't develop a good way to describe them and think about them .
I do n't know whether this idea was ever presented anywhere in just these terms .
Instead , it seemed to be implicit in the activities and writings of many people .
But , in my opinion , it received its most effective and fruitful expression in the writings of Kenneth Iverson and others who followed his lead .
The most important publication expounding this idea is the book from whose title the letters APL derive their significance .

The stored - program idea provided , and continues to provide , the basis for our current runaway technology .
The efficient - notation idea , if we take it seriously and do a lot of thinking and hard work , will help us curb the runaway and direct it t into fruitful and productive channels .
You may find this brief summary of computing history controversial .
I hope so .
We need vigorous , informed , philosophical controversy .
And , as a contribution to this controversy , let me state some of my other biases in n as controversial a manner as I can .
Biases of an APL Bigot
There exists a growing class of people , of which I am happy to consider myself a member , who are called " APL bigots " by friends and foes alike .
The friends use the term affectionately ; the others do not .
The bigotry consists in believing that APL is the way computing should be done .
I think it 's fair to say that no one can properly be called an APL bigot who does n't believe this .
In one respect , my bigotry may not be as great as that of the general run .
I believe that APL and assembler language are the way computing should be done .
To this extent , I am held suspect by true APL evangelicals .
In another respect , my bigotry is so much greater than theirs that , now that I am making it t known , I fear I may be excommunicated as a schismatic .
I believe that , important as APL is in computing , it is even more important as an instrument for rationalizing the management process .
Modern management is in trouble .
Do n't take my word for it .
Read the daily papers , the weekly newsmagazines and the flood of books and articles that describe management 's difficulties and offer cures .
Some of these , of course , assert that Japanese management is an exception to the general rule ; the cure these people offer to nonJapanese management is to learn from the Japanese how to do it right .
I do n't believe this .
I believe Japanese management is in as much trouble as any other .
Its current successes are no indication that its management is n't afflicted by the same difficulty as the management of organizations anywhere else in the world .
Expressed simply , this difficulty is : Nobody knows what 's going on .
Your reaction to this assertion may be emotional .
You may believe it passionately or reject it passionately .
If you have either of these reactions , you may not have understood what I said , so I 'll repeat it :
The problems of modern management are primarily attributable to one cause : Nobody knows what 's going on .
So there you have it : the basic message that motivates this talk : Management 's primary difficulty is that it has no good way to describe its processes and thus develop objective means to correct or improve them .
Other fields have faced this problem in the past .
The ones that have solved it most effectively are those that have developed a notation appropriate to their subject matter .
The most conspicuously successful examples of notations that have virtually created the fields they describe are , of ' course , the specialized symbologies of the so - called " hard sciences " .
The workings of management can be expressed as extensive , intricate digital procedures .
These procedures cannot be designed , analyzed or described effectively without a notation specifically designed for the purpose .
APL is such a notation .
There are , of course , many other important difficulties that management faces : obsolescent plant , intensified competition , environmental concerns , employee morale , strained labor relations , residues of past mismanagement ( reflected in such things as excessive debt , inadequate capital , incompetents in key positions , ... ) and so on .
But these difficulties are made unmanageable by our inability to describe - them in a way that promotes insight and facilitates communication .
Clearly , in expressing this opinion , I am swimming against the tide .
The widespread current belief is that we are experiencing an " information explosion " .
How can I accuse management of being inadequately informed when virtually everyone else says that they are overinformed ?
How can I say that management does n't have enough information when everyone else says they have so much information that they are swamped by it ?
Let me be blunt : I think the " information explosion " is a myth .
I do not deny -- how can anyone deny ?-- that we are generating vast quantities of paper , tapes , disks , etc. , with optical or magnetic symbols recorded on their surfaces .
What I am denying is that these recorded symbols , in themselves , are information .
They are not .
They become information only if , as a minimum :
They are accurately calculated .
They present a true picture of reality .
They are understood by the person to whom they are presented .
Of these three conditions , only the first stands a better than even chance of being satisfied .
For the purposes of effective management , all too much recorded data does not present a true picture of reality and is not understood by the person it is supposed to inform .
What does this all have to do with APL ?
Let me answer by recounting the pre-APL experiences ( at the U. S. National Bureau of Standards , the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory , and the Kaiser Steel Corporation ) that convinced me that the computing field needed , more than anything else , an efficient notation for describing digital procedures .
Then let me follow up with the post - APL experiences ( at IBM and Stanford ) that convinced me that APL was the notation we needed .
The U. S. National Bureau of Standards , 1948 - 1952
I started to work in May , 1948 as a mathematician in the Applied Mathematics Laboratories of the National Bureau of Standards in Washington , D. C. I was given a job description which , like every other one I have ever had , bore no relation whatsoever to what I actually did .
My first assignment was to program a division subroutine for the UNIVAC .
The UNIVAC that was then being designed by the Eckert - Mauchly Corporation could add , subtract and multiply but it could not divide .
( Division was added later .
The list of computer instructions or " order codes " , to use the terminology of the times , was updated and given an identifying C- number as the UNIVAC 's design progressed .
If my memory 's not playing me tricks , the- order - code 1 list list that was current when I started work was C - 7 . ) I was given a description of the UNIVAC .
It described acoustic delay lines , excess - three notation and end - around carry .
I had the feeling that I was entering a dark , eerie world in which words would be used as charms and incantations rather than to communicate definite meanings .
I was right .
I was surprised that no one took the trouble to show me the UNIVAC for which I was to program division .
After a few days I learned why .
The machine described so confidently and completely in the literature that I had been given had not yet been built .
( The first UNIVAC was not delivered until three years later .
But at least it was delivered .
Our group spent a lot of time programming what were then called " feasibility tests " for a lot of machines that never got off the drawing boards . )
Programming for nonexistent machines started to pall after a few months .
Our group had punched - card equipment ( including the 602 calculating punch ) with which we calculated mathematical tables .
I switched to this activity at just about the time the Office of the Air Comptroller asked the Bureau of Standards for assistance in using electromechanical ( later electronic ) equipment to calculate Air Force budgets .
With the procedures then in use , it was taking eighteen months to prepare a - yearly budget .
There was general agreement that this was not satisfactory .
I was assigned the task of getting budget computation mechanized under the direction of George Dantzig , who was in charge of the Air Force budget project .
His job was to devise the calculations we were required to perform , that is , he told me what was needed .
I wired the plugboards and , later , wrote the programs that gave him what he specified .
The original calculations were called " triangular model " calculations ( I understand they were given the acronym TRIM after I left the project . )
The later calculations were solutions of linear - programming problems , applying the simplex technique that George Dantzig originated .
The name of the Air Force project , SCOOP , ( Scientific Computation Of Optimum Programs ) , like TRIM , suggests that wherever a computer goes an acronym 's sure to follow .
I programmed the triangular - model calculations for the 602 , the 602A , the 604 ( the electronic calculating punch ) and was about to program them for the CPC ( the Card - Programmed Calculator ) when the SEAC became available and I switched back to programming instead of plugboard wiring .
The SEAC ( National Bureau of Standards Eastern Automatic Computer ) was the first stored - program digital computer to operate successfully in the United States .
( The first stored - program computer to run successfully anywhere in the world was the EDSAC , designed and built by the University Mathematical Laboratory at Cambridge , England . )
I introduce this information here because , computing history being what it is , it does not seem to be available anywhere else .
Of the many memories and ideas derived from my four years at the Bureau of Standards , three are relevant to our present purpose : I learned to be cautious about how I used the solutions of large systems of equations with uncertain coefficients .
I believe the triangular model is an extremely effective , and neglected , tool for a large class of planning problems .
But , if the coefficients used in its equations have a large measure of variability or uncertainty , you must use its answers with caution .
I learned how desperately we needed a good notation for describing algorithms .
I sat through many presentations and discussions of solution techniques for linear programming problems .
These presentations were largely chalk dust and arm - waving .
The essential ideas , which are extremely simple once they are understood , were obscured rather than illuminated by the terminology and notation used to describe them - .
1 learned that gadget development was outstripping idea development and would continue to do so unless we did something about it .
I suggested that we do something about it .
My management was receptive to the idea ( or told me it was ) but said there was no money in the budget for idea development .
That , of course , was the problem .
It has been the problem ever since .
This failure on the part of my management to fight for research in ideas was one of the reasons I left the Bureau .
U. S. Naval Research Laboratory , 1952 - 1954
At the Naval Research Laboratory , I became part of an interdisciplinary team applying the latest operations - research techniques to the development of man-machine systems . ]
Brave words .
The " disciplines " included physics , mathematics , philosophy , sociology , various brands of psychology , naval science ( represented by officers in the United States Navy ) , and I do n't know what all .
Our tasks were the obvious ones : develop ways to make naval operations more efficient by incorporating new gadgets into systems that used them to best advantage .
A typical assignment might be either general , for example design of a combat information center for a ship , a task force , or a shore - based control center or specific , for example , taking a new weapon , like a homing torpedo to be fired from the deck of a ship into the water near a distant submarine , and deciding how best to incorporate it into a system including a ship , sensing devices , communicating devices , and other weapons .
I learned many things during my two years at the Naval Research Laboratory ( among them that clinical and experimental psychologists tend to despise each other ) but for our present purposes the most important things I learned were :
It 's hard to plan effectively for a future you can't predict .
No numbers are frequently better than some numbers .
Nobody knows what 's going on .
3
Predicting the future is , of course , particularly difficult for the military since a future requiring military action is apt to be precipitated by some catastrophic event .
I attempted to develop techniques for dealing with this by first describing the three states in which the Navy might have to operate :
The peacetime state .
The transition state from peace to war immediately after hostilities have commenced .
The wartime state .
and then describing the transformations required to convert from one state to the other in n the most efficient way possible .
I did n't get very far with this , but , if I had the responsibility for con contingency planning for any organization , civil or military , I would return to the three - state model I started to develop for the Navy and build on it .
And , again , I would need an efficient notation .
It was during the time I worked at the Naval Research Laboratory that I first became aware of the ease with which people can deceive themselves with meaningless figures .
This is not a criticism of the Navy .
It is a criticism of virtually all modern management .
You are much better off with no numbers than meaningless ones ..
The minute you believe numbers uncritically , that is , without understanding how they 're calculated and how well they measure whatever they 're supposed to measure , you will generate a breed of employee who will produce numbers and not results .
Your data - processing system will then serve not to describe reality but to lie about it .
Kaiser Steel Corporation , 1954 - 1961
I started with Kaiser Steel as a mathematician , a new kind of employee requiring a new job description .
I started in the Fontana Procedures Department of the Controller 's Division .
The Industrial Engineering Department ( which was in the Operations Division and thus always in a kind of uneasy rivalry with the Procedures Department ) had the responsibility for administering job descriptions .
I learned later that the one we filed threw them into a tizzy ; they felt it was another sinister move on the part of the Controller 's Division to take over the work they were supposed to do .
I left Kaiser Steel , not quite seven years later , as Director of Research and Computer Planning .
In the interim , I learned about iron and steelmaking both at Kaiser and , through industry association meetings and literature , at other American and Canadian steel plants .
I learned about other industries by participation in the activities of cross-industry associations .
By the time I left Kaiser Steel , I had had several years in which to observe management in action .
The comments I 've been making , which you may have regarded as flippancies , are honest descriptions of what I observed .
Consider some examples .
They are from Kaiser Steel , because that is where I worked , but I can testify that they are representative of all management .
Precision Rounds .
At the time I was there , Kaiser Steel manufactured an alloy steel product called " precision " rounds because the diameters had to be controlled to very close tolerances .
There were two schools of thought about the place of precision rounds in our product line .
One school held that it was the most profitable product we made .
The other said we were losing our shirts on it .
How could this be ?
Could n't our cost accountants tell us whether we were making money or losing money ?
The answer is : no , they could n't .
Two different groups , working off the same set of figures , reached diametrically opposite conclusions .
This was the first of many experiences ( including attendance at a Stanford gathering of the most prestigious accounting firms in the world ) that led me to the conclusion that most cost accounting is applied metaphysics of an extremely ethereal kind .
Counting angels on the head of a pin is a useful exercise in data - gathering compared to much cost accounting .
The problem was , as it always is , the basic data with with which we had to work .
Rounds of any kind had to go through a finishing operation .
Scheduling finishing operations and describing what took place was one of the most difficult tasks in the mill .
Production figures out of the finishing operation were always suspect .
The difference between the two schools derived primarily from the different ways they interpreted those figures .
At least , that 's the best explanation I was ever given .
Tin Mill Flippers .
We installed a management incentive plan at Kaiser Steel while I was there .
The incentive plan for the tin mill was delayed for a while until we straightened out a rather embarrassing problem that cast doubts on the accuracy of our tin mill production recording .
We were reporting more tin plate coming out of our shears than we put into them .
Management was understandably hesitant about paying performance incentives on figures that were so obviously , stupidly wrong .
The difficulty arose from the way we processed rejects .
As the sheared plate went by an inspection station , it was examined for pinholes , surface blemishes and other defects .
When a defect was detected , the inspector pressed a button that switched the faulty plate to a reject pile .
Unfortunately , a few plates before and after the bad one were also diverted to the reject pile .
These were usually prime plates that we could not afford to sell at secondary prices .
The prime plates in the reject piles were separated from the true rejects by a group of women called " tin mill flippers " .
They worked at large tables , examining the plated surfaces carefully and separating the plates into prime and secondary piles .
The difficulty arose here .
Because of the way reporting was done , some of the plates were counted more than once .
We caught this bad data because it was so obvious .
A shear can't produce tin plate ; it can only cut it .
To shear more tin than you were given was clearly impossible .
But , of course , this kind of mistake indicated just the tip of the iceberg .
The errors that were n't so obvious were n't caught and corrected .
And they existed , let me assure you of that .
Even worse , they were almost certainly manipulated by people who were better at doctoring figures than at making steel .
Slab Inventories .
Steel ingots are broken down into blooms if they are to be processed into products like H - beams , I - Beams and the like and into slabs if they are to be processed into hot or cold - reduced product like sheet and strip .
Our biggest semi-finished inventory at Kaiser Steel was in slabs ; we had between 80,000 and 100,000 tons scattered in piles over wide areas of the mill grounds .
Slabs are big , heavy chunks of steel .
You 'd think it would be hard to lose one .
It 's not .
It happens every day .
Although I 've been out of the steel industry for more than twenty years , years in which we 've landed men on the moon , I 'm willing to bet that right now , somewhere in the world , a rolling mill is idle because it 's waiting for a slab that 's sitting on the ground not too far away .
My reason for discussing these examples is to illustrate the complexity of the activities we are trying to manage .
This particular example , as it happens , also shows how quick management is to seek a technological rather than a methodological solution .
There are many reasons why , despite the existence of a huge slab inventory , a rolling mill has to wait until the slabs it needs are found .
The problem as a whole is a complex one and does not lend itself to quick - fix solutions .
But a technological quick - fix for part of the problem was proposed and , after I had left the company , bought and installed .
It was a costly failure .
At the risk of teaching you more about steelmaking than you ever wanted to know , let me describe this attempt to solve a methodological problem by technological gadgeteering .
The steel produced by one open - hearth melt is called a heat .
A major part of a slab 's identification is its heat number .
Since the process of producing slabs from ingots usually grinds impurities into some of their surfaces , the slabs making up a heat had to be distributed among areas called scarfing bays where men with oxyacetylene torches would burn out the impurities .
The slabs then had to be reassembled into a heat ; the heat had to be deposited somewhere in the slab yard ; and the heat number and slab - yard location had to be reported to the production schedulers .
The existence of surface impurities that required scarfing thus caused much of the delay and confusion that attended the progression of the heat from the slab mill to the reduction mill .
The technological solution proposed for this problem was called a " hot scarfer " .
It burnt off all the surface of a slab immediately after it was reduced to its final dimensions .
This was supposed to eliminate the need for splitting a heat up into scarfing bays .
Thus , at this point , management had a choice : Methodological .
Put in the time , effort and money it would take to develop a satisfactory , realistic scheduling and inventory control system for slabs .
This would necessarily require investigation of all the many sources of difficulty , not just the kind of difficulty that the hot scarfer was supposed to eliminate .
Technological .
Buy a hot scarfer and hope the slab scheduling and inventory problem would go away .
No contest .
The lure of the tangible , glamorous gadget always wins out over the intangible , colorless idea .
They got a hot scarfer .
I say " they " because this was done after I left ; I am happy to say that I had no part in the decision .
To the best of my knowledge , the hot scarfer never worked satisfactorily .
It is one item of evidence justifying my belief that technological quick - fixes seldom achieve their objectives .
( This , incidentally , is even more true for data processing than it is for steelmaking . )
In this particular instance , the gadget was expensive to purchase and to operate , it burnt off good steel as well as surface impurities , and did not do what it was purchased to do : reduce wait - for - steel time in the mills that used slabs as inputs .
What does all this steelmaking jargon have to do with APL ?
In all of my computer experience , I have found that the chief obstacle to getting anything done is the absence of any clear , concise , precise , formally manageable way to describe and analyze what we 're actually doing and to describe and design a transformation to what we should be doing .
I gave several talks on this topic at professional meetings of various kinds .
( I later used the written form of these talks , and other papers I wrote during my employment at Kaiser Steel , as class notes in the Business Information Systems classes I taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business . )
One of the earliest of the talks , " Formalizing Business Problems " , was given at the first Electronic Business Systems Conference held in Los Angeles in 1955 .
This aroused the interest of Murray Lesser , at what was then the newly established IBM facility scattered throughout several locations in downtown San Jose ( the one that developed into the General Products Division in which I now work ) .
We met to discuss what we could do to develop some of the ideas we had in common .
The result of our discussions was a joint venture , called the Business Language Research Project , in which employees of IBM , Kaiser Steel and Touche , Niven , Bailey and Smart participated .
My contribution to the project was something I called " field - and - branch identification " which I later developed into the approach to systematic systems analysis that I describe in my book on decision tables .
4
I will discuss this more fully later .
Lest I leave you with the impression that nothing effective can be done about the data - processing problems of industry , let me assure you that this is not the case .
Among the accomplishments of which I 'm proudest are some of systems I installed at Kaiser Steel .
At least one of them , a tin-mill in - process inventory and production recording system impressed the phone company so much that , since we were using some of their equipment to record production and to communicate between processing points , they ran an ad in the Wall Street Journal featuring a picture of our tin mill and describing our system as an example of what could be achieved if you called in their Production Recording Consultant .
We never had the benefit of a Production Recording Consultant 's services because the phone company never told us they had one .
Maybe he was made available to some of the people who read the ad .
So things can get done .
But getting them done is slower , more difficult and more costly than it has to be .
That is why we have the application programming backlogs that we do .
We need a better , more systematic way of dealing with complex digital procedures .
We need systematic systems analysis .
Now do you see the connection with APL ?
IBM , 1961 - I started to work for IBM in the Advanced Systems Development Division , San Jose .
I have since worked in the Palo Alto Scientific Center , the Palo Alto Systems Center and the Santa Teresa Laboratory , where I am now in APL Development .
At the time I started my IBM employment , the ASDD library used to circulate a daily list of its acquisitions to all employees .
I am a kind of pack rat when it comes to written material and I acquired all kinds of library offerings that , I 'm sorry to report , I never took time to read .
Among the publications that I thus acquired , scanned , and filed for future reference were several reports containing a strange , exotic notation .
I was skeptical about the value of these reports since , by that time , I not only had my own ideas as to what was needed but I had also seen many attempts by many people to develop notations , charting techniques , and other descriptive schemes .
I did n't think much of any of them .
By and large , history seems to have agreed with me ; most of them are happily forgotten .
However , when I learned that the author of several of the papers full of Greek letters , slashes , little circles , curlicues , and other cabalistic symbols was coming out to San Jose to talk about his ideas , I decided that I 'd read one or two of his papers as a preparation for his talk .
My life has n't been the same since .
My first acquaintance with the notation that has since become APL ( for several years it was either " Iverson Language " , " Iverson Notation " , or just plain " Iverson " ) started with an IBM Research Report by Kenneth Iver - son called , The Description of Finite Sequential Processes .
I do n't have the paper handy at the moment so what I 'm about to tell you is all memory ; it may be mistaken in details but not in essence .
I seem to remember that the first page was mostly given over to heading material , possibly an abstract , so that there were only two short columns of reading matter on it .
And , again memory , it took me several hours to understand what those two short columns were all about .
The author 's approach was so different from anything I 'd ever encountered that I had a difficult time adjusting to his frame of reference .
At the end of the first page , a fair assessment of my state of mind would be that I had glimmerings but no hope .
The second page took about as much reading time as the first but , since it had twice as much matter , I was clearly improving .
The glimmerings were now fitful gleams .
One thing had definitely chanced , however .
I had no doubts about the value of what I was reading .
I was now virtually certain that the author had something to say and that I 'd better find out what it was .
The third page had an illustration that , in a few short lines , described George Dantzig 's simplex algorithm simply and precisely .
That was the overwhelming , crucial experience .
In the previous thirteen years , I had participated in so many murky discussions of what was here presented with crystal clarity that I knew that what I was reading was of enormous significance to the future of computing .
So , when Dr. Kenneth Iverson came out to talk to us at San Jose , I was not only a convert , I had a fair idea of what he had to say .
In the upshot , this meant that I was the only one who could ask him questions .
Ken had some good , sharp people from Research and Advanced Systems Development in his audience but I 'm pretty sure I was the only one who had been lucky enough to read what he had to say beforehand so that I had a fighting chance to follow him when he did what he usually does : hit you with one idea after another so fast that your mind goes numb .
I had been alerted to the fact that Ken might know what he was talking about by a fellow employee named Don Fisher who was working in the same group that I was .
After Ken 's talk , he came to visit Don and I got a chance to meet him .
It 's hard to believe that that first meeting took place more than twenty years ago .
But it 's true .
I 've been an APL bigot for a long , long time -- since before there was an APL , in fact .
Stanford , 1962 - 1967 ?
Shortly after I went to work for IBM , Dan Teichroew , a friend of mine from the Bureau of Standards days , asked if I would be interested in spending part of my time at Stanford , participating in a study of " Quantititative Management Techniques " being conducted at the Graduate School of Business .
Dan was a Professor of Management at the GSB and he wanted my permission to approach IBM about the idea .
Naturally I was delighted by his proposal and even more delighted when my management gave its approval .
The next several years were among the most satisfying and productive I 've ever spent .
And , in my opinion , not only did I benefit from them but so did everybody else who was involved : Stanford , IBM , the students who participated in the research program and attended my Business Information Systems classes and , more to the point of this talk , APL itself , whose first implementation was a FORTRAN - based batch interpreter that was developed on the IBM 7090 in Pine Hall at Stanford .
In the Formalizing Business Problems talk that I had given in 1955 , I asserted that the problems we were facing required a partnership among computer users , computer manufacturers and academic institutions if we were ever to develop the body of knowledge we needed to manage computers properly .
For a while there at Stanford we had two - thirds of what I 'd recommended and , as you will see , I concentrated a good deal of effort on seeing that the third was represented as well .
When I started at Stanford as an Industrial Research Fellow , the present School of Business building did not exist .
I occupied an office in Polya Hall , near the temporary buildings used to house Business School faculty and staff .
IBM , at that time , shared the 7090 with Stanford and thus had the use of a few offices in Polya Hall , the building which housed the university 's Computer Science faculty and staff .
I was assigned one of those offices .
This was ideal .
I not only participated in the activities of the Graduate Business School : I was also part of the Computer Science complex at the university .
Both of these associations had APL implications and I 'd like to tell you about them .
My activities at the School of Business can be described in n four parts Work with graduate students on the " Quantitative Techniques " project .
Guest lecturing in Business Information Systems courses taught by Dan Teichroew and John Lubin .
Development of my own Business Information Systems course after Teichroew and Lubin left the university .
Teaching Operations Research courses as a Lecturer in Operations and Systems Analysis .
APL and Quantitative Techniques .
My purpose in describing my preAPL history to you was to let you know how my ideas about what management needed were formed .
If you were paying attention , it should come as no surprise to you that , as soon as I was given an opportunity to do something about it , I started to investigate the implications for management of an efficient notation for describing , analyzing and designing digital procedures .
I investigated two techniques : decision tables and APL .
The latter is the one relevant to this talk .
I 've long regretted that I never wrote up what I did ; let me remedy the deficiency now .
A Programming_Language was published just in time for me to use in my researches at Stanford .
It was a godsend .
I used it to try to answer the question :
Is it possible to write programming specifications in such a way that ambiguities , misunderstandings and outright mistakes in programming are minimized ?
The answer I got surprised even me .
Here 's what I did .
For a set of problems , of increasing difficulty , I would write a solution procedure , using the notation of A Programming Language I would then ask the graduate student assigned to me to : program the procedure in any programming language he chose ,
execute the procedure for a representative set of data values
give me his program and answers so that I could compare them with the specifications I had written and the answers I had previously calculated .
The result , which I still find surprising and impressive , was :
In every case , what was programmed was exactly what I specified .
I 'll comment in a moment on how rare this is under any circumstances .
But these particular circumstances were so extreme that they merit some discussion .
A Programming Language was and is crammed full of ideas .
I studied it assiduously , and enjoyed it , but it was not easy reading , at least not for someone of my mental capacity .
I was lucky that my Stanford assignment provided me some time to spend on it so that I could both use it and explain it when my students asked questions .
But think of them .
The life of a graduate student is a busy one .
They had less time than I had to study strange notations .
How could they make sense of the chicken scratches I said were their programming specifications ?
Somehow , they did .
I gave them completely abstract procedure descriptions , even avoiding standard words where they might have provided clues to the nature of the procedure , and they programmed exactly what I specified even though they had no prior experience with the notation and never became expert at using it .
Thinking back on it , I understand why an intimate familiarity with this strange notation would have been desirable but was not essential .
The only part of the notation they needed to understand was the part I used .
I told them to look up the meaning of the symbols in Ken 's book but I also told them that I 'd explain and illustrate the meanings myself if they wanted help .
But I would n't do anything but explain the symbols .
They had to translate the symbolic description into a program .
They did , with no arguments and no discussions about what the procedure was supposed to do .
The procedure was described completely abstractly .
They had no idea what external significance it had .
They were not led astray by ideas of their own about it .
They figured out what I wanted done and then did it .
Contrast this with the usual way in which a business procedure gets programmed .
Somebody , usually called a system „s analyst , casts about , comes up with some general ideas , puts them down as programming specifications and presents them to somebody else , usually called a programmer , who asks the analyst lots of questions ,
programs what he thinks the analyst wants ,
is told that what he has done is s completely wrong ,
quarrels with the analyst about what he said and what it implied ,
forces a reworking of the specifications ,
tries another program ,
is wrong again , forcing another rework of the specifications ,
and so on until finally , after a long period of false starts and reruns ,
some program is accepted as an implementation of some set of specifications , both programmer and analyst now being so sick of the entire procedure that they no longer care whether what is finally programmed is what was originally wanted .
Is what I 'm describing familiar to you ?
Does it , perchance , occur in your organization ?
To me , specifications cannot properly be called specifications until they are as abstract as blueprints or mathematical formulas .
Specifications using the cords of everyday speech are always subject to misinterpretation .
Most of the costs , delays and other inefficiencies that attend the development of data - processing procedures are due to these misinterpretations .
The abstract APL program specifications I tested at Stanford strenghtened my belief in the opinion I 've just expressed .
Content .
What did I ask the students to program ?
Let me select four examples .
Rings - O - Seven .
The first example was from A Programming Language page 63 , Exercise 1.5 .
It was a solution of a " rings - o - seven " puzzle , in which rings on a bar were to be removed according to certain rules .
The bar was represented by a logical vector in which the presence of a ring was indicated by a 1 and the absence by a 0 .
This was just a warmup experiment , but it had an informative result .
My programming specifications , naturally , described the solution procedure I had devised .
It was wrong .
But it was programned exactly the way I specified it .
Think of it .
No arguments about who misunderstood whom .
The systems analyst was wrong ; the programmer was right .
Would n't you like to be able to make that determination without bickering , recriminations or tears ?
( After my blushes subsided , I wrote a correct procedure .
It was programmed correctly and gave the right answers .
I tell you this because I 'm vain and do n't want you to remember me for the only mistake I ever made in my whole life . )
Internal Rates of Return on Investment .
Financial theory at that time was troubled by the fact that the then current procedures for calculating rates of return on an investment gave ambiguous answers in some cases .
The difficulty arose when the cash flows that characterized the investment were a mixture of positive and negative amounts .
This led to an equation with multiple roots , so that , in many cases , two equally ridiculous rates of return were calculated .
Dan Teichroew felt that the difficulty lay in the assumption that the same interest rate should be applied to the negative cash flows as to the positive .
What he suggested was that there would be a unique , meaningful solution if we assumed that the rate to be applied to the negative flows , which were , after all , borrowings , should be a putative " cost of money " which would not , in general , be the same as the return on the investment .
Given this assumption , I provided a proof that an " internal rate of return " on the investment would be uniquely determined when a " cyst of money " was assumed .
I then specified , in " Iverson language " , a procedure that determined a rate of return for a fixed cost of money and a specified series of cash flows .
The actual calculation was programmed by J. P. Seagle , a graduate student .
I no longer remember what programming language Pete used , possibly a home - grown ( Stanford ) assembler for the 1401 .
The results were reported in a couple of papers by authors the very ponderosity of whose names ( Teichroew , Robichek , Montalbano ) testified to the validity , excellence and importance of the research they described .
Critical - path calculations .
Critical - path and PERT calculations were all the rage at that time , with many papers being devoted to efficient schemes for " topological sorting " and for detecting inconsistencies in precedence relationships .
I became interested in the problem and decided that the need for topological sorting could be eliminated and that consistency checking did not require a separate , special program .
I used APL ( Iverson language ) to describe a solution procedure in which topological sorting was not required and consistency - checking was a fallout from the basic critical - path calculation .
This time , in addition to having Pete Seagle program the calculation , I programmed it myself , in MAP , the IBM 7090 assembly language , and FORTRAN ( for input - output subroutines ) .
My program exploited almost every bit in the 36 - bit 7090 word .
This permitted me to store enormous networks internally , so that I was able to achieve calculation speeds far in excess of any other method then available .
I was not then , and have not since become , an expert assembly - language programmer .
I had risen to too august an eminence at Kaiser Steel to do much programming , though I snuck some in now and then , when no one was looking .
My critical - path algorithm was the first programming I had ever done for the 7090 which , like MAP and FORTRAN , was completely new to me .
With the precise specifications of the APL procedure as my guide , programming assembly language for a machine with which I had little experience went very quickly and with no errors other than mistypings .
The program I developed was a useful one that I later used in classes in the Business School and in the International Center for the Advancement of Management Education at Stanford .
I described it in a paper called High - Sped Calculation of the Critical Paths of Large Networks that appeared both as a Palo Alto Scientific Center report and as an IBM Systems Journal article .
The algorithm presented in the paper used the old notation ( the one in the book ) since the new ( the one for the typewriter ) had not yet been designed .
So APL turned out to be a particularly useful way to specify a program for an inexperienced programmer -- me .
Linear Programming .
The last program specification I want to discuss was done by a student , Don Foster , who had even less time than the general run of student I 'd been working with .
I believe it was his last term at the School of Business .
This is always a hectic time but in Don 's case he had the added distraction of planning for a European trip .
Even without my assignment he was leading a harried life .
I gave him a version of the simplex algorithm ( basically the one that had originally sold me on APL ) from which I 'd removed all clues like , " unbounded " , " infeasible " , etc .
The solution was programmed in jig time , since Don was champing at the bit anyway .
The programming language was FORTRAN .
The program ran the first time it was tried .
It produced the right answers .
What was interesting was Don 's reaction when I told him what he 'd programmed .
Like all good business school students of that era , he 'd received instruction in linear programming .
But he had n't been told how easy it was .
The arm - waving and chalk dust had concealed the basic Simplicity from him as they had from me .
Business Information Systems
As a guest lecturer in Business School courses , I advanced the argument that I 've been advancing throughout this talk , that we need an efficient notation for describing procedures .
I illustrated some of what could be done with APL and decision tables .
In my Business Information Systems course , I did the same , but I also encouraged activities that would permit students to find out for themselves whether or not I had valid reasons for what I was recommending .
One of the course requirements was completion of an approved project .
As an example of the kind of project I had in mind , I would suggest that they go to a local company , get a copy of an important report used by several departments , and visit each of the departments , asking whoever got the report what he thought the report told him , how much he knew about how the figures in the report were determined , what actions he based on the report , and how he decided on his actions .
Few of the students had had detailed business experience at that point in their careers .
Business to them was defined by the other business school courses they 'd taken : finance , marketing , micro- and macro-economics , accounting , theory of the firm , organizational behavior , and so on .
These were good courses but none of them were concerned with or had the time to devote to determining what was happening at the working or first - line management level of an organization .
The intent of my course was to forewarn my students that business was , in practice , a good deal more disorganized than they were likely to realize from most academic discussions .
I had some skeptics in my classes , people who felt I was overstating my case .
None of the skeptics who attempted the kind of project I suggested remained skeptics .
Some , shattered by their experiences , felt even more strongly than I that no one in management knew what was going on .
Several students caught the APL bug .
They went out on missionary activities of various kinds after graduation .
The effects of some of these are still being felt -- in , for example , organizations like IBM and American Airlines , to name the two I know most about .
Stanford 's Computer Science Department .
Although I was housed with members of the Computer Science Department , I had no official connection with it .
All of my interaction with faculty , staff or students was informal .
From the standpoint of APL as it now is , however , this interaction was the important one .
This was not because of anything I did .
It was primarily because I was a reminder of the existence of " Iverson language " and a kind of catalyst who served to bring together the right people at the right time .
The Computing Science Department of those days was an ALGOL stronghold .
It had a Burroughs B5000 , later upgraded to a B5500 , an IBM 7090 , and a PDP - 1 , probably the first computer I ever saw with a cathode - ray tube terminal .
I do n't know whether " Star Wars " ( the game ) was developed at Stanford .
I do know that a lot of " Star Wars " was played there .
Stanford had developed its own version of ALGOL , called SUBALGOL , for the Burroughs computer that had preceded the 85000 .
I believe the number was B220 , but my memory might be playing me tricks .
At Kaiser Steel , our first computer had been a B205 , predecessor of the B220 , if that 's what it was .
The significance of this information from the APL standpoint is that two , possibly three , of the people who played key roles in developing the very first APL system had been instrumental in producing SUBALGOL for Stanford : Larry Breed , Roger Moore , and ( the one I 'm not sure about ) Phil Abrams .
I met Larry as a result of a talk I 'd given as one of a series on " Programming Languages " conducted by the Computer Science Department .
He expressed an interest in what I 'd had to say about what I was doing in the School of Business with the notation described in A Programming Language .
He and Phil Abrams took action on this interest in a very real , very Productive way when the IBM Systems Journal article , appeared .
What they did , and its aftermath , is described in Appendix A , an annotated verse history of APL 's early days .
Larry and Phil not only developed the batch APL interpreter I mention in the verse , they did so many other things that I wish they and others involved in APL 's origins would get them down on paper .
For example , one of them should tell the story of Elsie ( for Low Cost ) , an APL mini before there were minis .
But , in essence , all I did was happen to be around , saying the right things to the right people .
Things took off when the right people got together .
Incidentally , one of the people involved in the Programming Languages seminar to which I referred above was Niklaus Wirth .
Unfortunately , Klaus did n't get the proper message from my talk .
He went his own way and developed PASCAL .
APL at IBM
The history of APL at IBM has been a curious one .
In the early days , those of us who believed in APL were regarded as being a little ( perhaps more than a little ) strange .
Since much of the strangeness was concentrated in IBM Research , this was tolerated .
Practical people ( the kind of people who make sales and meet payrolls ) expect research people to be strange and are usually disappointed when they 're not .
So the strange people in Research were written off as overhead and left to amuse themselves with their incomprehensible , impractical symbols .
What that particular Research group did , of course , was produce the most solid , dependable , useful time - sharing system anyone had ever seen .
I wish I could tell you what it felt like in those early days to have the use of a system that was up twenty - four hours a day , seven days a week .
No one had ever known such a luxury .
People who did n't bother to investigate never believed us when we told them about it .
But some people did investigate what the researchers had developed and started to use it to do IBM 's key bread - and - butter applications .
This way of doing business was so productive that it spread like wildfire .
By the time the practical people found out what had happened ; APL was so important a part of how IBM ran its business that it could not possibly be uprooted .
The wild - eyed researchers had produced a moneymaker .
No talks about product " strategies " and the evils of language proliferation prevailed against the simple fact that : if you worked for IBM and
had access to an APL time - sharing service and
had something you wanted to get done on a computer quickly and economically then the best way to get it done was to use APL .
I wish someone who knows the details of how that came about would write about it .
I can't do it .
I was three thousand miles away when it took place .
APL ( called VS APL for reasons beyond the ken of mortal man ) is , of course , now an IBM program product .
I do n't know how much more practical than that you can get .
Summary : Systematic Systems Analysis
I could go on but I see you 're falling asleep .
Let me end by rephrasing what is either explicit or implicit in what I 've already said .
In the preface to my book on decision tables , I say if you wish to use digital computers effectively , the first thing you should do is digitize your procedure descriptions .
As usual , this was something I realized I was doing after I 'd finished writing and took time to think about what I 'd written .
The key idea of the book ( the potential of which , incidentally , no one has as yet successfully exploited ) is that procedures can be digitized in the same sense that bubble - chamber and spark - chamber pictures are digitized for analysis by a digital computer .
A decision table is a digitized procedure description ; it describes a correspondence between vectors of decision values and vectors of action values .
The particular form of the digitizing is not important .
Decision tables may or may not be the most effective way to get the digitizing done .
The important thing is that it be done and done in a way that permits checking for consistency , redundancy , completeness .
But how is such a digitized procedure to be developed , maintained , managed , modeled , interpreted , translated , improved , extended , ...?
To me , the answer is clearly APL .
If we are ever to do " systems analysis " systematically , we must Digitize our procedure descriptions Manage our digitized descriptions with APL
We must divert our research to developing ideas rather than gadgets .
Good ideas are at hand .
Let 's develop them .
Epilogue - Twenty Years After
The latest IBM version of APL is an Installed User Program called APL2 .
For those of us who had to bootleg our APL efforts within IBM for a long time , the announcement of APL2 is gratifying because it indicates the kind of management backing and recognition that we missed when
We felt that APL was regarded as a limited tool for a small , specialized audience .
Management put its support on record in another significant way .
IBM recently instituted awards for outstanding technical achievements .
The first of these to anyone at the Santa Teresa Laboratory was just awarded to Jim Brown , manager of the group that developed APL2 .
I have n't had a chance to use APL2 very much yet .
I 've been too busy writing a workspace manual for VS APL .
So I can't pretend to an extensive knowledge of its details .
But , recently , I used APL2 to do something that I have n't been able to do for 20 years .
Page 19 of A Programming Language describes a bank ledger that has three columns : the first column contains customer names , the second account numbers , the third balances .
Unassigned account numbers had the entry " none " in the corresponding row of the name column .
Until APL2 , no system available to me within IBM would allow me to form an array of that kind .
Nor could I write , in any straightforward fashion , the four programs , producing reports from that ledger , that appear as one - liners in the book with which , twenty years ago , I started my investigation of " Quantitative Techniques in Management " at the Stanford Graduate School of Business .
With APL2 , I was able to do precisely that .
As a way of rounding out twenty years of APL history , I thought I 'd show you what I did .
It 's contained in Appendix B. APPENDIX A. APL BLOSSOM TIME -A HISTORY IN VERSE My contribution to APL 81 was the verse that I discuss below .
The most I 'd expected , when I wrote it , was that Jim Brown might play it at some informal gathering .
I could n't anticipate what actually happened .
A group including Jim Brown , Larry Breed , John Bunda , Diana Dloughy , A1 O'Hara and Rob Skinner rehearsed their guitars and voices until they were of a truly harmonious sweetness and sang " APL Blossom Time " at the APL 81 banquet as part of the evening 's entertainment .
I. P. Sharp 's Peter Wooster prepared overhead transparencies that made it possible for the audience to sing along .
And I 'm sure other people whose names I was never told contributed to what was , for me , an extremely heartwarming experience : the sound of people singing , laughing and giving every evidence of enjoying the words I 'd written .
Despite its frivolity , APL Blossom
Time is authentic history .
I thought it might be useful to get the details on record by annotating each section of the verse .
APL BLOSSOM TIME A nostalgic reminiscence of the early days of APL , remembered to the tune of The Battle of New Orleans .
Back in the old days , in 1962 , A feller named Ken Iverson decided what to do .
He gathered all the papers he'd been writing fer a spell
And he put them in a little book and called it APL .
Well ...
He got him a jot and he got him a ravel
And he revved his compression up as high as she could go And he did some reduction and he did some expansion
And he sheltered all his numbers with a ceiling and a flo ' .
If you 've read the earlier part of this book , this verse does n't need annotating .
If you have n't , go back and read it .
Now Sussenguth and Falkoff , they thought it would be fine
To use the new notation to describe the product line .
They got with Dr. Iverson and went behind the scenes
And wrote a clear description of a batch of new machines .
Well ...
They wrote down dots and they wrote down squiggles
And they wrote down symbols that they did n't even know And they wrote down questions when they did n't know the answer
And they made the Systems Journal in nineteen sixty - fo '
Though the scan required that I place Sussenguth 's name first , this is perhaps misleading .
Ed Sussenguth has done a lot of good work for IBM but , except for his participation in this paper , I do n't know of any other in n which he used APL .
Adin Falkoff , on the other hand , was one of those crazy - symbol Iverson - language authors whose papers I started requesting from the ASDD Library when I first joined IBM .
I remember one paper in particular .
It struck me because it seemed to be written by someone who hated jargon as much as I did .
One of the data - processing fads current at that time was the " associative memory " .
Adin , like the rest of us , had to use the term because everybody else was using it .
But he rather wistfully ( can you imagine Adin wistful ? ) pointed out that a more descriptive term would be " content - addressable memory " .
And , of course , as you all know ( or should know , if you do n't ) , Adin Falkoff , in both technical and administrative capacities , has been in the forefront of APL developments ever since the days of those early , incomprehensible reports out of IBM Research .
The paper referred to in the verse is A Formal E. escription of System / 360 , by Falkoff , A. D. , Iverson , K. E. , Sussenguth , H. IBM Systems Journal , Vol. 4 , No. 4 , October , 1964 .
About " questions where they did n't know the answers " : the paper was indeed , to the best of my recollection , the first to use the question mark as an APL function .
I gave my copy of that issue of the Systems Journal to Larry Breed .
( I had already ordered several more .
John Lawrence , editor of the Systems Journal at the time , had the APL functions in the article printed separately for more effective study .
I ordered several copies of those , as well . )
Larry and Phil Abrams conducted a seminar on the System / 360 paper that extended over several weeks .
They also produced a list of " cliches " , to assist in understanding regularly recurring patterns , and a list of errata , to remind the authors ( or the typesetters ) that they did n't know it all .
The sessions conducted by Larry and Phil were well attended .
When Ken Iverson came out to give a talk at Stanford , he drew the biggest crowd the Computer Science auditorium had seen up to that time .
I told my Business Information Systems class to attend since they would hear something better than anything I had to say ; this also gave me a chance to attend myself .
Now writing dots and squiggles is a mighty pleasant task
But it does n't answer questions that a lot of people ask .
Ken needed an interpreter for folks who could n't read
So he hiked to Californ - i- a to talk to Larry Breed .
Oh , he got Larry Breed and he got Phil Abrams
And they started coding Fortran just as fast as they could go And they punched up cards and ran them through the reader In Stanford , Palo Alto , on the seventy ninety oh .
Ken Iverson and Larry Breed first met in my office at Polya Hall .
Since this may be my only claim to fame , I 'm glad to put this historical fact on the record .
Larry was about to graduate .
Ken had a job to offer him .
We now have APL .
I remember a phone call of Ken's , shortly after Larry had joined him and Adin at IBM Research in Yorktown , in which he said something like : " This young man thinks he can write a translator in a couple of months . "
He sounded as if he were wondering whether he'd made a bad bargain .
I assured him that if Larry said he could do something in a couple of months he would probably do it in a couple of weeks .
He and Roger Moore were legends in their own time during Stanford 's SUBALGOL days .
Stanford has left a mark on APL second only to that of left - handed Canadians .
For a while , there was a theory that all of APL was being dominated by left - handed Canadians .
I have been told that when Mike Jenkins , at lunch in the Yorktown cafeteria , was observed to be left - handed , someone facetiously asked him if he happened to be Canadian .
He happened .
I tried to start a similar factoid5 about right - handed Brooklynites , hoping to get included along with Falkoff and McDonnell .
I forget what happened to that .
I think one of them is lefthanded .
I know I 'm not .
Well a Fortran batch interpreter 's a mighty awesome thing
But while it hums a pretty tune it does n't really sing .
The thing that we all had to have to make our lives sublime Was an interactive program that would let us share the time .
Oh , they got Roger Moore and they got Dick Lathwell , And they got Gene McDonnell with his carets and his sticks ,
And you should 've heard the uproar in the Hudson River valley
When they saved the first CLEANSPACE in 1966 .
APL bigots seem to be characterized by literacy and a feeling for history .
The first time - sharing APL system was implemented ( as IVSYS ) on an IBM 7090 at Mohansic .
In those days , there was no ) CLEAR command .
To get a CLEAR workspace , you had to load one .
The one that came with the system was called CLEANSPACE .
Although it was no longer needed when ) CLEAR was introduced , CLEANSPACE , along with the time and date it was originally stored , has been preserved in Library 1 of a continuous sequence of systems ever since : the Yorktown Model 50 , the Philadelphia Scientific Center Model 75 , the Palo Alto model 158 , the Santa Teresa model 168 and , as I discovered for the first time just a few hours before I wrote this , the Santa Teresa Model 3033 .
At one point , after a disaster had caused the loss of CLEANSPACE , it was carefully restored with the correct date and time .
The objective , of course , is to preserve a record of the moment when APL first became a time - sharing computer language .
Preserving CLEANSPACE in APL2 presented a problem , since workspace names are limited to eight characters in CMS , the first " environment " in which APL2 has been offered .
However , as you can see from the following exhibit , which is a copy of what appeared on the screen in response to a ) LOAD 1 CLEANSPACE command that I executed on our APL2 system ( which operates under CMS ) the problem has been solved , or , better , circumvented .
Note that not only is the time given , the time zone of the area in which the storing was done is also given , indicating that the original workspace was stored when United States Eastern Standard Time was in effect .
Note also that the original workspace size was 32 K and that the time zone in which CLEANSPACE was loaded to produce this example was Santa Teresa Daylight Savings Time .
What hard workers AP L. bigots are '
I 've checked my handy perpetual calendar and , as far as I can tell , November 27 , 1966 was the Sunday of what must have been a four - day Thanksgiving weekend .
What were those loonies doing working such crazy hours during the holiday season ?
The !' carets and sticks " reference is to a paper by Gene McDonnell on the logical and relational functions -- the ones whose symbols can be constructed out of " carets and sticks " .
Well , when A1 Rose saw this he took a little ride
In a big station wagon with a type ball by his side .
He did a lot of teaching and he had a lot of fun With an old , bent , beat - up 2741 .
Oh , it typed out stars and it typed out circles
And it twisted and it wiggled just like a living thing .
Al fed it a tape when he could n't get a phone line
And it purred like a tiger with its trainer in the ring .
A1 Rose was , and I assume still is , one of the most spectacular APL demonstrators there ever has been .
The verse refers to a vacation he took in which he was accompanied not only by his family but by what was laughingly called a portable 2741 .
This was a 2741 that came in two parts which , when ready to be " ported " , looked like two big , black pieces of luggage .
Wherever Al went , he 'd find some likely APL prospects , park the station wagon near an electrical outlet and a phone , lower the tailgate and start hammering on the keys .
In those days , getting connected to a working APL system was a chancy thing .
As a safeguard , A1 recorded , on tape , what went across the acoustic coupler during a sample session .
When he had problems getting to a real APL system , he`d play the tape into the acoustic coupler and produce a simulated computer session that was an exact copy of the real thing .
I remember that double - black - box 2741 very well myself .
I , too , did quite a bit of APL demonstrating in those days .
At the University of California at Davis , the demonstration was given on the second floor and there was no elevator .
I had to haul those two big boxes up a long flight of stairs .
I 'm glad I did n't find out until later how heavy they were .
When I sent them Air Express to an IBM System Engineer in Seattle , I learned for the first time that they weighed 120 pounds .
Well , I 'm not too bright but I 'm pretty strong .
Now , there 's much more to the story , but I just do n't have the time ( And I doubt you have the patience ) for an even longer rhyme .
So I 'm ending this first chapter of the tale I hope to tell Of how Iverson 's notation blossomed into APL .
So ..
Keep writing nands when you 're not writing neithers ,
And point with an arrow to the place you want to be , But do n't forget to bless those early APL sources
Who preserved the little seedling that became an APL tree .
Dedicated to the pioneers of APL with respect and affection by J. C. L. Guest J. C. L. Guest is the pseudonym I used for sore light verse I submitted to Datamation several years back .
There were four pieces in all .
The Far- flung Data Base , SYSABEND Dump , Virtual Memory and Decision Making .
If you were offended by the unkind things I said about modern management in this talk , do n't read Decision Making .
You wo n't like it .
APPENDIX B - TWENTY YEARS AFTER
The following four figures show how I applied APL2 to Program 1.9 ( Example 1.1 ) of A Programming Language , page 19 .
The first figure shows the sample bank ledger I used and the calculations I performed to illustrate the ledger 's shape and various facts about its composition .
Note that the name entry for an unassigned account number is a single blank rather than the " none " used in the original example .
The second figure shows two versions of the four reports ( P , Q , R , S ) required in the example .
In the first , the output is unformatted .
In the second , " picture format " is used to format the numeric part of the report .
The four required reports are : P - name , account number and balance for each account with a balance less than two dollars .
( Although the original example did not require this , the illustrated calculations do not include unassigned account numbers in the report . )
Q - name , account number and balance for each account with a negative balance exceeding one hundred dollars .
R - name and account number of each account with a balance exceeding one thousand dollars .
S - all unassigned account numbers
The third and fourth figures show the programs for the unformatted and formatted reports respectively .
They could have been written as the four one - liners of the original example , except that report P , the one producing a list of accounts with balances of less than two dollars would have included unassigned account numbers .
To avoid this , the unassigned account number report , S , was produced first and an array T , consisting of all assigned accounts , was used to create the subsequent reports .
The other lines in the report merely introduce spaces to separate the successive reports .

In making this comment here , and not earlier when I was describing the work I did for the Air Force , I do not mean to make an invidious comparison of the services .
The work I did for the Air Force did n't require me to know whether either the data we used or the answers we calculated corresponded to reality ; all I had to do was to supply plugboards or programs .
At the Naval Research Laboratory , on the other hand , it was my responsibility to get good answers from good data .
That 's when I found out there was n't any good data .
To even things out , let me observe that the Air Force does n't know what 's going on either .
As for the Armor , well , I served in the Army .
I can tell you about the Army .
Decision Tables , Michael Montalbano , Science Research Associates , 1974
In January 2005 , Rakan Hassan , 12 , was shot and paralyzed , and his parents were killed when their car was riddled with gunfire by a US Army patrol in Iraq .
Rakan was brought to Boston through the efforts of humanitarians determined that he receive medical care .
Now , with the news that Rakan was killed by a bomb planted at his home in Mosul , Rakan 's time in Boston seems more precious , more fleeting , more tragic for what could have been .

From Goldwater Girl to Hillary Girl
Nominating McCain is the gesture of a desperate party .
Republicans are so shell - shocked and demoralized by the success of the Bush Derangement Syndrome , they think they can fool the voters by nominating an open - borders , anti-tax cut , anti-free speech , global - warming hysteric , pro-human experimentation " Republican . "
Which is to say , a Democrat .
As the expression goes , given a choice between a Democrat and a Democrat , voters will always choose the Democrat .
The only question remaining is : Hillary or Obama ?
On the litmus test issues of our time , only partially excluding Iraq , McCain is a liberal .
He excoriated Samuel Alito as too " conservative . "
He promoted amnesty for 20 million illegal immigrants .
He abridged citizens ' free speech ( in favor of the media ) with McCain - Feingold .
He hysterically opposes waterboarding terrorists and wants to shut down Guantanamo .
Can I take a breath now ?
He denounced the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
He opposes ANWR and supports the global warming cult , even posturing with fellow mountebank Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of solar panels .
The only site that would have been more appropriate for Schwarzenegger in endorsing McCain would have been in front of an abortion clinic .
Although McCain has the minimum pro-life record demanded by the voters of Arizona , in 2006 , McCain voted in favor of using taxpayer funds to harvest stem cells from human embryos .
He opposes a constitutional amendment to protect human life .
And he frets that if Roe v.
Wade were overruled , women 's lives would be " endangered . "
This is the same John McCain who chides Mitt Romney today for " flip - flopping " on abortion .
At least Romney flips and stays there .
Of course the most important issue for pro-lifers is the Supreme Court .
As long as Roe v.
Wade is the law of the land , it does n't matter how many hearts and minds we 've changed .
So it 's not insignificant that McCain has called Justice Samuel Alito too conservative .
We ended up with David Hackett Souter when a Republican president was actually looking for an Alito .
Imagine how bad it will be when the " Republican " president is n't even trying .
McCain uses the boilerplate language of all Republicans in saying he will appoint " strict constructionists . "
This is supposed to end all discussion of the courts .
But if he 's picking strict constructionists , he will have to appoint judges who will commit to overturning McCain - Feingold .
That could be our litmus test :
Will you hold President McCain 's signature legislation restricting speech unconstitutional ?
In 2004 , McCain criticized the federal marriage amendment , saying , it was " antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of Republicans . "
Really ?
Preventing the redefinition of a 10,000 - year - old institution -- marriage , that is , not John McCain -- is part of the core philosophy of being a Republican ?
I had no idea .
I 'm not a lawyer -- oh wait , yes , I am -- but Republicans were proposing to amend the Constitution , a process the Constitution specifically describes .
It 's like saying it 's antithetical to the core philosophy of Republicans to require presidents to be at least 35 years old .
It 's in the Constitution !
And Republicans -- other than the ones who voted for McCain - Feingold -- support the Constitution .
You might say it 's part of our core philosophy .
Of course , back in 2004 , McCain was considering running on a presidential ticket with John Kerry .
Realizing that this would not help his chances to run as a Republican in 2008 , when he would be a mere 120 years old , McCain quickly withdrew his interest in being on Kerry 's ticket .
But he defended Kerry from the Bush campaign 's suggestion that Kerry was not tip - top on national security , saying on the " Today " show : " No , I do not believe that he is , quote , weak on defense . "
So that was helpful .
McCain also explained to an admiring press corps why he would n't want to be anyone 's vice president , not even a national defense champion like Kerry , citing the meager constitutional duties of the vice president as : ( 1 ) to assume the presidency if the president is incapacitated and ( 2 ) " to break a tie vote in the Senate . "
( At which point several members of the fawning horde were heard to remark , " What is this ' Constitution ' you speak of , Senator ? " )
But McCain conveniently forgot the second of these constitutional duties just a year later when Vice President Cheney was required " to break a tie vote in the Senate " on a matter of utmost importance to liberals : federal judges .
Just one year after McCain had correctly identified one of two jobs of the vice president , he was indignant that a Republican vice president might actually exercise one of them .
Better to let a gaggle of 14 Senate malcontents pick the president 's judges for him .
As part of the " Gang of 14 , " McCain hysterically opposed allowing the vice president to break a tie on judicial nominations .
Following the Constitution with regard to the role of the vice president , McCain said , " would be a terrible precedent . "
Yes , if members of Congress actually read the Constitution , they might realize McCain - Feingold is unconstitutional .
If Hillary is elected president , we 'll have a four - year disaster , with Republicans ferociously opposing her , followed by Republicans zooming back into power , as we did in 1980 and 1994 , and 2000 .
( I also predict more Oval Office incidents with female interns . )
If McCain is elected president , we 'll have a four - year disaster , with the Republicans in Congress co-opted by " our " president , followed by 30 years of Democratic rule .
There 's your choice , America .

A YOUNG man whispers a confession : as a university student , he killed six or seven of his peers .
He can not be sure of the number , since his shots were fired in gun battles .
He intimidated professors , burned their cars , and helped kidnap — briefly — their children to force them to give good marks to certain students .
He did it all as a member of a campus cult .
When he renounced his membership , he got death threats and moved to another city , where he lives today .
Nigeria 's university system used to be the finest in west Africa , but today 's classes are overcrowded , buildings are crumbling and the curriculum has remained unchanged for years .
The cults emerged from the shambles .
Having started life as confraternities for the most academic students , they have deteriorated into gang violence .
The Exam Ethics Project , a lobby group , says that inter-cult violence killed 115 students and teachers between 1993 and 2003 .
The real number may be much higher .
The situation is particularly bad in Port Harcourt , the capital of Rivers State , the country 's wealthiest and the centre of the oil industry .
Here cults have spilled beyond the campus walls to mix with the political militants , thugs and crooks responsible for a violent insurgency in the Niger Delta .
Most city residents believe that nearly all of today 's most prominent militant leaders were or still are cult members .
How did the cults become such a problem ?
Wole Soyinka , a Nobel prizewinner for literature , helped found the Pyrates Confraternity , the first such group , in 1952 at the elite University of Ibadan .
Slowly , splinter groups emerged : the Black Axe , the Klansmen Konfraternity , and countless others .
It was harmless fun to begin with .
But military leaders of the 1980s and 1990s saw the groups ' growing membership as a chance to confront the leftist student unions , often aligned with pro-democracy movements .
So the confraternities were given money and weapons .
They turned against student activists — and against each other .
By the mid-1980s , violence had become so fierce that Mr Soyinka tried unsuccessfully to disband his former creation .
As their strength grew , the cults ' influence on the universities became more malign .
They exacerbated the corruption that had already bred in unmanageably big classes and deteriorating facilities .
Today , older students and alumni flood campuses in the first weeks of the new academic year to recruit for the cults .
Omolade Adunbi , an anthropologist , says that some students , fearing that they are going to be failed in exams , believe the only way to protect themselves is to belong to a cult where they can “ harass professors ” .
Ban them — if you can
Rivers State outlawed cultism in 2004 , setting up rehabilitation committees and special courts to try those accused of membership .
But the law has had little effect , since politicians play a big part in keeping the groups rich in cash and arms .
“ In Rivers State everybody is fighting for the soul of governance in the state , and you need everything — everything — to get it , ” says Professor Chiedu Mafiana , a director at the National Universities Commission .
Politicians use the students to intimidate opponents , he says .
“ And so if a student has gone to commit some level of atrocities on behalf of a political group and comes back with good money , another person joins the bandwagon in order to make money for himself . ”
Though the cults charge membership fees of between 10,000 ( $ 85 ) and 30,000 naira a year , the boys can expect to make a profit on the streets .
The pay - offs after university can be no less rewarding .
With a well - connected alumni network , students hope that their cult membership will win them a job in a country where most graduates are unemployed .
Alumni of the Vikings Confraternity , for example , claim at least 11 members of the Rivers State House of Assembly .
Some progress has been made in tackling the cults at the Rivers State University of Science and Technology , thanks to 200 - odd security officers , covert surveillance and student informants .
For the first time in over a decade there were no gunshots on the campus last year .
Yet many students say the violence has not ceased ; it has just moved to the streets .
Recently , a new vice - chancellor took over the university .
Asking him to do the job , the Rivers State governor , Rotimi Amaechi , put the task simply : “ Go on a rescue mission for me . ”
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Ministers from six nations involved in nuclear talks with North Korea , including U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , held a rare meeting on Wednesday that China said showed a “ political will ” to move the disarmament process forward .
South Korea 's Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , China 's Foreign Minister Yang Jeichi , and North Korea 's Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun ( L - R ) pose before a meeting between foreign ministers of the six party nations and Rice on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Regional Forum in Singapore July 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Vivek Prakash
In a break with U.S. policy , Rice joined “ informal ” talks with North Korea on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian forum and said afterwards it had been a good meeting .
“ The spirit was good because people believed we have made progress .
There is also a sense of urgency about moving on and a sense that we ca n’t afford to have another hiatus of several months , ” Rice told reporters after the talks .
China ’s Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said the six foreign ministers would meet again in Beijing for a more formal negotiating session , but no date had been set .
This would mark a new chapter in the six - party talks , as all previous negotiations had been at the envoy level and Wednesday ’s meeting was billed as an informal discussion rather than full - blown negotiations .
In a symbolic gesture of better relations with North Korea , Rice made a point of shaking hands both at the beginning and end of the meeting with North Korea ’s Pak Ui-chun , and smiled broadly at him and other ministers as the meeting began .
However , a senior official said Rice had also been firm with North Korea , which tested a nuclear device in 2006 , and said it must quickly agree on a mechanism to verify its nuclear weapons , as well as settle the issue of Japanese abductees .
Yang said the six parties should aim for early agreement on a so - called verification protocol being worked out to check claims
Pyongyang made about its weapons - grade plutonium stockpile in a long - delayed accounting delivered last month .
“ The parties all agreed that it is important to achieve early , comprehensive , balanced and verifiable implementation of the second - phase actions , including reaching early agreements on the verification protocol , ” he said .
FAMILY PHOTO
Rice joined the foreign ministers from China , Russia , Japan , and the two Koreas at Wednesday ’s meeting -- the first such encounter since “ six party ” talks began in 2003 and at a time when Washington wants better ties with the North .
“ I think this is quite significant , ” Yang said at the start of the talks .
“ It shows that the six parties have the political will to move forward the six - party process . ”
The ministers posed for a family photo at the start of talks .
During the meeting , Yang was flanked by Rice and Pak , who were seated alongside the other ministers in comfortable armchairs arranged in a circle .
Yang said at the start : “ We have made major headway ” in the process of getting North Korea to dismantle a suspected nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid and diplomatic rewards .
The verification protocol is a key issue in the coming weeks and a four - page draft of the document had been circulated .
An agreement on the issue should be reached by mid-August at the latest , chief U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill told reporters traveling with Rice .
However , the verification procedure itself , which includes on - site inspections in North Korea , could take months to implement , possibly stretching into the next U.S. administration after Bush leaves office in January 2009 .
The North Korean delegation ’s spokesman , Ri Dong - il , told reporters on Wednesday that significant progress was made after Pyongyang blew up the cooling tower of its Soviet - era nuclear plant in Yongbyon and Washington took steps to lift some of its sanctions .

“ What ’s important is for the U.S. to fundamentally and entirely withdraw its hostile policy , ” he said .
After North Korea presented the account of its nuclear weapons program in June , a thaw of ties began with President George W. Bush launching a 45 - day process to remove Pyongyang from the list of state sponsors of terrorism .
Wednesday ’s meeting came at a time when the Bush administration was tweaking its policy towards North Korea .
“ I thought the atmosphere was really good , ” Rice said , although senior officials made clear it was too early to talk of a “ turning point ” in relations between the two countries .
Bush branded North Korea as part of an “ axis of evil ” together with Iraq and Iran after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , but the North is slowly moving away from that rogue status and Washington has slightly eased some sanctions .
Governor Palin 's administration is refusing to cooperate with investigators and is withholding 1100 emails that could prove critical to ongoing invesitigations into Palin 's behavior as Governor .
The administration is claiming the e-mails hold information which is covered by " executive " or " deliberative process " privilege and would keep the emails out of the view of anyone other than Palin and her aides .
Todd Palin , Palin 's husband , was CC'd on several of the emails , and he is not part of the Palin administration .
Part of the emails including Mr. Palin were regarding the Public Services Employee Association , a union which represents the Alaska State Troopers .
The emails may offer more clues into Palin 's direct handling and pressuring of the firing of former Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan .
Monegan was fired shortly after he refused to fire Palin 's ex-brother - in - law , who had been going through a bitter divorce with Palin 's sister at the time .
Some of the other emails had the subject heading " re Andrew Halcro " .
Andrew Halcro was Palin 's opponent while running for Governor in 2006 .
Halcro posted on his blog in July of 2008 after learning of his prescence in the emails :
" The serious concern about these emails is that they were prohibited from being released to the public due to executive privilege , even though Todd Palin was copied on these same emails .
Todd Palin is not a member of the executive branch , nor is he even a government employee .
Todd Palin is a member of the general public ...
These emails should be released to the public ... after all Todd Palin has no standing to claim executive privilege .
By including him in the email loop , the Palin administration has arguably breached any claim of executive privilege . "
I would have to strongly agree with Harlcro here .
If Todd Palin gets to see the e-mails , then there is no reason why I , or any other American , should not get to see them .
We are members of the general public just as Todd Palin is .
This story is unfolding ...
" The fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg , relative to the size of the mother , suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive , " said Dr Hedges .
People should stop picking on vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin because she hired a high school classmate to oversee the state agriculture division , a woman who said she was qualified for the job because she liked cows when she was a kid .
And they should lay off the governor for choosing another childhood friend to oversee a failing state - run dairy , allowing the Soviet - style business to ding taxpayers for $ 800,000 in additional losses .
What these critics do n’t understand is that crony capitalism is how things are done in Alaska .
They reward failure in the Last Frontier state .
In that sense , it ’s not unlike like Wall Street ’s treatment of C.E.O. ’s who run companies into the ground .
Look at Carly Fiorina , John McCain ’s top economic surrogate — if you can find her this week , after the news and her narrative fused in a negative way .
Dismissed as head of Hewlett - Packard after the company ’s stock plunged and nearly 20,000 workers were let go , she was rewarded with $ 44 million in compensation .
Sweet !
Thank God McCain wants to appoint a commission to study the practice that enriched his chief economic adviser .
On the campaign trail this week , McCain and Palin pledged to “ stop multimillion dollar payouts to C.E.O. ’s ” of failed companies .
Good .
Go talk to Fiorina at your next strategy session .
Palin ’s Alaska is a cultural cousin to this kind of capitalism .
The state may seem like a rugged arena for risky free - marketers .
In truth , it ’s a strange mix of socialized projects and who - you - know hiring practices .
Let ’s start with those cows .
A few years ago , I met Harvey Baskin , one of the last of Alaska ’s taxpayer - subsidized dairy farmers , at his farm outside Anchorage .
The state had spent more than $ 120 million to create farms where none existed before .
The epic project was a miserable failure .
“ You want to know how to lose money in a hurry ? ”
Harvey told me , while kicking rock - hard clumps of frozen manure .
“ Become a farmer with the state of Alaska as your partner .
This is what you call negative farming . ”
That lesson was lost on Palin .
As the Wall Street Journal reported this week , Governor Palin overturned a decision to shutter a money - losing , state - run creamery — Matanuska Maid — when her friends in Wasilla complained about losing their subsidies .
She fired the board that recommended closure , and replaced it with one run by a childhood friend .
After six months , and nearly $ 1 million in fresh losses , the board came to the same conclusion as the earlier one : Matanuska Maid could not operate without being a perpetual burden on the taxpayers .
This is Heckuva - Job - Brownie government , Far North version .
On a larger scale , consider the proposal to build a 1,715 - mile natural gas pipeline , which Palin touts as one of her most significant achievements .
Private companies complained they could n’t build it without government help .
That ’s where Palin came to the rescue , ensuring that the state would back the project to the tune of $ 500 million .
And let ’s not talk about voodoo infrastructure without one more mention of the bridge that Palin has yet to tell the truth about .
The plan was to get American taxpayers to pay for a span that would be 80 feet higher than the Brooklyn Bridge , and about 20 feet short of the Golden Gate — all to serve a tiny airport with a half - dozen or so flights a day and a perfectly good five - minute ferry .
Until it was laughed out of Congress , Palin backed it — big time , as the current vice president would say .
Why build it ?
Because it ’s Alaska , where people are used to paying no state taxes and getting the rest of us to buck up for things they ca n’t afford .
Alaska , where the first thing a visitor sees upon landing in Anchorage is the sign welcoming you to Ted Stevens International Airport .
Stevens , of course , is the 84 - year - old Republican senator indicted on multiple felony charges .
He may still win re-election thanks to Palin ’s popularity at the top of the ballot .
Alaskans will get $ 231 per person in federal earmarks — 10 times more than people in Barack Obama ’s home state .
That ’s this year , with Palin as governor .
If Palin were a true reformer , she would tell Congress thanks , but no thanks to that other bridge to nowhere .
Yes , there is another one — a proposal to connect Anchorage to an empty peninsula , speeding the commute to Palin ’s hometown by a few minutes .
It could cost up to $ 2 billion .
The official name is Don Young ’s Way , after the congressman who got the federal bridge earmarks .
Of late , he ’s spent more $ 1 million in legal fees fending off corruption investigations .
Oh , and Young ’s son - in - law has a stake in the property at one end of the bridge .
Some of these projects might be fully explained should Palin ever open herself up to questions .
This week she sat down for her second interview — with Sean Hannity of Fox , who has shown sufficient “ deference ” to Palin , as the campaign requested .
One question : When Palin says “ government has got to get out of the way ” of the private sector , as she proclaimed this week , does that apply to dairy farms , bridges and gas pipelines in her state ?
I did n’t think so .
As with recording any instrument , the choice of drum and the manner of its tuning and preparation can make a huge difference to the sound you capture , so this should always be the place to start .
do n't forget to tune the drums before you record
Even if the band uses one drum kit for the whole record , I want it tuned right for each song .
We 'll change the heads or tune it differently , all that kind of stuff .
Sometimes we change the beaters ...
It all depends on how those frequencies are responding to the key of the music , to the pulse of the music .
Every record is different , every song is different , every tape is different .
wide variety of opinions on how to get the best kick drum sound
Microphone Placement
" In most situations I tend to use two mics : one inside to gather the impact , and one outside to capture the “ tone ” – the overall note and picture of the drum . "
sound bleeding into this mic
experiment until you have the two mics in phase with each other

Old cassette decks with built - in limiters can deliver quite a quirky picture of a drum .
It instantly sounds like a processed drum loop .
Equalization
If you need more bottom end , try boosting @ 60 or 100 Hz .
Try rolling off lower mids ( 300 - 700 Hz ) to get rid of a box - like sound .
To add more attack , try boosting in the 1 K to 3 K range .

Kick / Bass drum is what drives rock music .
It 's what makes hip hop danceable .
It 's how jazz drummers push the band .
Such a special drum needs special treatment , especially in the studio !
First and foremost ... you need good source material .
Sound on Sound interviewed several professional engineers and it was nearly unanimous .
So - I would n't recommend the human - ear - sweet - spot positioning method though , unless you want to go deaf .
Nile Rodgers goes so far as to say ( in the SoS interview ) It 's important to note that there are aeven among sound engineers .
These are only some of the possibilities .
Joe Chiccarelli likes the two mic approach , which is especially popular in rock music .
If the drummer does n't have a hole cut in the front head , or does n't want one , you can point a mic at the contact point of the beater on batter head .
This will deliver a similar * click * sound to a mic inside the drum .
Be careful ofthough , since it's not shielded from the other sounds by the shell of the drum , you 'll need to be wary of phase problems .
Adjusting the distance of the outside mic(s ) is the best way to deal with phase problems , but if you do n't have the time to ( maximizing the amount of bass they pick up ) you can always add a fewof delay to one of the mics to get them in phase later on .
Chiccarelli also shares one of his tricks on how to get a processed / low - fi drum sound .
He specifically mentions putting said cassette deck inside the bass drum , to get a squashed sound , as well as putting it in the room to pick up the whole kit .
I 'm not the first to come up with this , and many other ( much more knowledgeable people ) have already written up how EQ affects the kick drum sound .
Here it is as Laskow states in his Taxi FAQ
For bottom end there isto find the fundamental frequency and boosting that specifically .
Believe me it works 100 times better than just randomly boosting some random low frequency .
Also , Boosting between 600- 900
Hz will give you more punch .
If necessary , you can try to reduce bleed from the cymbals by reducing above 3 k with aor a High Shelf .
Close mics ( the ones you put inside the kick , or point at the contact point of the beater )
These are for capturing the attack :
For the outside / distance mics , work well to capture the low frequencies :
If you 're only going to use , you 're better off using the one that canand using a triggering plugin or an exciter to get the low end .
Again , what really matters is that the drums fit the mood / atmosphere of the song , not just " objectively good " drum sounds .
Keep on kickin !
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
A little girl and her song captivated millions of viewers during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics .
But what they saw was not what they heard .
Lin Miaoke was the darling of the Olympic opening ceremony , but it turns out she was lip -syncing .
Games organizers confirm that Lin Miaoke , who performed " Ode to the Motherland " as China 's flag was paraded Friday into Beijing 's National Stadium , was not singing at all .
Lin was lip - syncing to the sound of another girl , 7 - year - old Yang Peiyi , who was heard but not seen , apparently because she was deemed not cute enough .
" The reason was for the national interest , " said Chen Qigang , the ceremony 's musical director , in a state radio interview .
" The child on camera should be flawless in image , internal feeling and expression .
... Lin Miaoke is excellent in those aspects . "
The decision was made at the highest levels , Chen said .
" We had to do it , " he said .
" We 'd been through several inspections .
They 're all very strict .
When we rehearsed at the spot , there were several spectators from various divisions , especially leaders from the Politburo , who gave the opinion it must change . "
Watch a Chinese official defend the move »
Few who watched the Olympic ceremony realized the deception .
" Tiny singer wins heart of nation , " read the headline in Tuesday 's China Daily newspaper .
" Lin Miaoke might be only 9 years old but she is well on her way to becoming a star , thanks to her heartwarming performance , " the article gushed -- without mentioning she never sang a note .
But as word has gotten out on the Internet , some Chinese bloggers are outraged .
" If you 're not good - looking , no matter how well you sing , you 'll not be onstage .
Do you know you 're twisting a whole generation ? " read one comment .
Another said , " If foreigners found out , they'd think we can't even find a girl who is good at both . "

As for Yang Peiyi , she 's been quoted as saying she was honored to have had a role in the opening ceremony , even though few realized just how big her part really was .

With a platoon of Senator Barack Obama 's campaign researchers travelling to Alaska to pick through her record , Mrs Palin could face several awkward questions over the coming weeks .
After less than two years running the state , preceded by two terms as mayor of a town of 9,000 , presidential scholars have pronounced her the most inexperienced candidate on a presidential ticket in the modern era .
FBI agents and state police raided an evangelist ’s headquarters Saturday as part of a child pornography investigation , and social workers interviewed children who live at the complex in southwestern Arkansas to find out whether they were abused .
The raid at the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries south of Texarkana started an hour before sunset , but state police said no one was arrested .
Armed guards regularly patrol the headquarters of the group -- which critics call a cult -- but there was no resistance as agents moved in , state police said .
Tom Browne , who runs the FBI office in Little Rock , said the investigation involved the Mann Act , which prohibits the transportation of children across state lines for criminal activity .
“ Children living at the facility may have been sexually and physically abused , ” Browne said .
In a phone call to the Associated Press from a friend ’s house in the Los Angeles area , Tony Alamo -- who was once accused of child abuse and has been convicted of tax evasion -- denied involvement in pornography .

“ We do n’t go into pornography ; nobody in the church is into that , ” Alamo said .
“ Where do these allegations stem from ?
The anti-Christ government .
The Catholics do n’t like me because I have cut their congregation in half .
They hate true Christianity . ”
About 100 state and federal law officers raided the 15 - acre compound housing the ministry , which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a cult that opposes homosexuality , Catholicism and the government .
The ministry ’s website says it is “ dedicated to spreading the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and the winning of souls worldwide . ”
John Selig , head of the Arkansas Department of Human Services , said state workers were talking to children .
“ I ca n’t say whether we will be removing any children , ” Selig said , adding that he did not know how many lived there .

U.S. Atty .
Bob Balfe said before the raid that he expected an arrest warrant would be issued later for Alamo .
The FBI and state police issued a statement saying that every minor at the Alamo complex would be interviewed and that officials hoped to reunite children with parents at the site as quickly as possible .
Alamo was once accused in California of directing the beating of a church member ’s 11 - year - old son .
In 1994 , he was sentenced to six years in prison on tax evasion charges filed in Memphis , Tenn .
The judge in the tax case ordered him held pending sentencing after prosecutors argued that the evangelist was a flight risk and a polygamist .
U.S. District Judge Jon McCalla said he was concerned over “ the very great control Mr. Alamo has over a number of people . ”
Chinese astronauts Zhai Zhigang , left waves near Liu Boming , center as Jing Haipeng is assisted out of the Shenzhou re-entry capsule after they landed on the plains of China 's northwestern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region , Sunday , Sept 28 , 2008 .
Zhai conducted the country 's first - ever spacewalk during the mission .
In the wake of the sterling success of its third mannedspace mission , China is sitting proud and looking ahead to its future in space .
Most experts agree the event , which included the nation 's firstspacewalk , went off without a hitch .
Before the Shenzhou 7 mission launchedSept. 25 , Chinese space officials said there were four main objectives to themission : to conduct a spacewalk , to do tests of a solid lubricant materialduring the spacewalk , to deploy a new satellite to take images , and to use a newdata relay satellite for communication , said Dean Cheng , China analyst withAlexandria , Va. - based think tank CNA Corp .
" From all accounts , that happened , " Cheng told SPACE.com .
"
If I were the Chinese , I would be very , very happy that all four taskscame off without a hitch .
And obviously they used the spacesuit , so that cameup good across the board . "
" Victory " for China
While conducting the spacewalk , astronaut Zhai Zhigang worea new , Chinese - built spacesuit ( called " Feitian , " meaning " flythe sky " in Chinese ) .
That it worked safely marks another significanttechnological achievement .
Zhai , along with crewmates Liu Boming and JingHaipeng , returned to Earth on Sunday .
Chinese premier Wen Jiabao pronounced Shenzhou7 " a victory of the Chinese space and technological field and amonumental achievement in the socialist causes , " reported official statenews agency Xinhua .
In another first for the Chinese space program , the majorevents , including launch , landing and the spacewalk , were broadcast live .
Themove signals both China 's growing confidence in its abilities , as well as a newwillingness to be open with the press and public .
" The success of Shenzhou 7 certainly shows China 's commitment to an ambitious manned space program , " said Joan Johnson - Freese , an experton the Chinese space program at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island .
" Iapplaud not only their technical achievements but the confidence in theirprogram exhibited by their increasing transparency about the mission .
I hopethat continues and expands into all areas of their space activities . "
Shenzhou 7 followed the 2005 Shenzhou 6 mission , which tooktwo astronauts to space for five days , and the 2003 Shenzhou 5 mission , whichlaunched China 's first astronaut , Yang Liwei .
Eyes on the moon
With each new mission , China is taking steps toward its ultimate goalsof establishing a more permanent presence in space through building a spacelaboratory , and perhaps even landing on the moon .
The latter goal has beenstated more explicitly after the recent success of Shenzhou 7 .
" We still do not have an exact timetable for a mannedmission to the moon , but I believe a Chinese ( astronaut ) will set foot on themoon in the not too distant future , " an unnamed official told the Communist Party newspaper the People 's Daily after the mission landed .
Wang Zhaoyao , spokesman for the manned space program , toldreporters Sunday that it is " necessary " for China to put a man on the moon , the Agence France - Presse news service reported .
" We believe that as long as we can make furtherprogress in science and technology , we can achieve the dream of a manned spaceflight to the moon in the near future , " he said .
These firmer declarations of intent are significant , because China is unlikely to set a goal it does n't believe it can accomplish .
" When you just have speculation , they 're under noobligation to try it , " Cheng said in a phone interview .
" But when the Chinese make an official statement that they want to do something , they doit . "
Near term
While moon plans may be a bit off , China 's next mission is likely to put the nation on the path to a space lab .?
A date hasnot yet been set for Shenzhou 8 or 9 , but there is a good chance the twomissions will be launched in close succession so they can try rendezvous anddocking , experts say .
" China 's next step will be clearer once a next launchdate is announced toward a docking , " Johnson - Freese said .
" Hopefullyit wo n't be another two years . "
There are also some speculations that Shenzhou 8 will carry China 's firstfemale astronaut to space .
There are currently no women in China 's corps of 14 spaceflyers .
However , some press reports hint that Shenzhou 8 and 9 may beunmanned missions intended to launch the capsules needed for a small space lab , and could go up in 2010 .
According to those reports , the next manned missionwould be Shenzhou 10 .
China also recently announced it was capable of trainingforeign astronauts , meaning that it could conceivably broker a deal withanother country to carry a person into space .
The United States and Russia have both engaged in similar arrangements ?
Russia flew the first South Korean astronaut intospace in April 2008 , and the first Italian astronaut rode aboard the U.S. space shuttle Discovery in 2007 , for example .
" Given China 's diplomatic use of space , there is a verygood chance they would be taking somebody from a new country , " Cheng said .
China has spearheaded the founding of the Asia - PacificSpace Cooperation Organization , a group intended to promote spacecooperation between Asian nations .
Cheng pointed out that both Iran and Pakistan are members of the group , and could be potential clients for Chinese spacetransport .
" I would strongly suspect that at this point in time the U.S. is probably unlikely to be taking any Iranian citizens into space , " Cheng said .
" But China has had successful sales of satellitesto Nigeria and Venezuela , both of which are oil - producing countries , which wouldmake Iran a candidate as someone who might send an astronaut up . "
A foreign astronaut could even fly as early as Shenzhou 9 , Cheng speculated .

At first , Rick Husong was stunned by the overwhelming wave of negative and sometimes crude reactions to his bid revealed in Whispers last week to build a pro-Sen .
Barack Obama movement around a hand salute dubbed the Big - O .
Among the hundreds of comments posted on the Whispers site were those comparing it to a gang gesture , a Nazi salute , or worse .
" This is how Sieg Heil got started .
And , no I 'm not saying Obama is Hitler .
I just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader , " wrote Jake of Tennessee .
Husong tells me that he was pretty depressed by the reaction to his idea and free design offered on the website of Loyalty Inc. , his California creative company .
That is until he heard of a fan walking on Venice Beach wearing a T - shirt displaying the artwork .
In fact , despite the tsunami of criticism , the artwork has been downloaded 7,700 times and his site has been hit 214,000 times since the first Whisper went live .
" I would call that a raving success , " he says , adding that he plans to make his Big - O the " peace sign of our generation . "
He also E - mailed me last night to say that the hits on the artwork have inspired him to push even harder to build a movement around the hand signal .
Here 's what he wrote : " Our symbol ' O ' is about much more than Barack Obama .
It 's a symbol of unity , hope , solidarity , and an end to the divisiveness that has plagued this country for too long .
It is the peace sign of our generation ; a sign for those who are tired of the fear , the hatred , the greed , and the ignorance .
There will be resistance , democracy requires it , but we believe that the good in the American people will persevere .

Bisa jadi hanya untuk iseng - iseng saja , ingin mencoba , atau ingin menjalaninya dengan serius .
Hal ini sangat penting karena saat sudah masuk ke dalam dunia perjudian , Anda sudah paham apa risiko yang harus diambil .
Contohnya , Anda hanya ingin mencoba - coba saja , maka siapkan saja modal taruhan dalam jumlah yang tidak terlalu banyak .
Saat ini banyak agen judi yang memberikan deposit dengan nilai kecil .
Paling tidak Anda bisa mencobanya terlebih dahulu sehingga kalau Anda ingin lebih serius bisa menambah nominalnya .
Cara ini juga bisa digunakan untuk mengatur pengeluaran Anda .
Selalu pelajari trik dan strategi bermain judi
Jika kita analogikan dengan perang , maka bermain judi bisa digambarkan seperti itu .
Kita datang ke medan perang tanpa senjata , maka hal terburuk adalah kita langsung mati .
Hal tersebut juga berlaku dalam permainan judi , kita harus memiliki strategi maupun trik dalam memenangkan pertandingan .
Untuk dapat memahami hal tersebut , Anda bisa bertanya pada pemain yang sering judi online atau mencari sendiri di Internet .
Saat ini akses informasi sudah luas dan mudah dijangkau sehingga kita tidak perlu bingung lagi .
Cara lainnya bisa melalui fitur chat yang ada di dalam agen judi bersangkutan .

Interesting Second Amendment Challenge to a Lengthy Firearm Sentence
Over at Sentencing Law and Policy , Professor Doug Berman has this interesting post about a motion he has filed on behalf of Weldon Angelos attempting to set aside at least part of his 55 - year prison sentence for carrying / possessing guns in connection with several low level marijuana deals .
Berman 's post links to a motion he has filed , arguing that part of the 55 - year sentence is now invalid after Heller because it punished Angelos for keeping firearms around his house .
Angelos , the argument continues , had a constitutional right to keep and bear arms , including arms at his house .
Here is a snippet of the argument :
Though the government may eventually dispute some facts set forth in the 2255 motion , there is no dispute that Angelos had no adult criminal record prior to the instant case and that he was subject to 55 years of mandatory federal imprisonment based principally on allegations of possession of firearms in his home , in his car , and on his person .
Specifically , the firearms providing the basis for one 25 - year mandatory sentencing term were those present within Angelos 's home .
And though there is a dispute concerning whether Angelos possessed a firearm during the marijuana sales engineered by the government 's informant , there is no evidence whatsoever or even any serious allegation that Angelos actively utilized firearms to facilitate three uneventful hand - to - hand marijuana sales .
Nevertheless , on the basis of ( suspect and perhaps incredible ) testimony of a single government informant , who belatedly asserted that Angelos possessed a firearm during two marijuana sales , the district court felt obliged under statutory sentencing provisions to impose another 30 years of federal imprisonment .
In light of the Supreme Court 's broad and forceful recognition of the right of all citizens under the Second Amendment to possess firearms to effectuate " the inherent right of self - defense , " District of Columbia v. Heller , 128 S. Ct 2783 , 2817 ( 2008 ) , the extreme sentence imposed upon Angelos for gun possession are now clearly unconstitutional and his 55 - year sentence must be at least partially vacated .
As explained more fully below , the Supreme Court 's landmark Heller ruling as applied to the unique facts of this case render unconstitutional ( 1 ) the Government 's pursuit of a superseding indictment threatening a 25 - year mandatory prison sentence based on the presence of guns within the Angelos home , and ( 2 ) the imposition of 55 years of federal imprisonment Angelos is now serving based on his gun possession .
In addition , the Heller ruling , considered together with the Supreme Court 's most recent explication of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and its application in Kennedy v. Louisiana , 128 S. Ct. 2641 ( 2008 ) , confirms that the 55 - year federal prison term that Angelos is serving based on the possession of firearms is constitutionally excessive .
Indeed , the combined force of the Heller and Kennedy rulings , along with the notable and constitutionally significant public reactions to both decisions , make plain that the sentence Angelos is now serving violates " the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . "
Id. at 2664 ( quoting Trop v. Dulles , 356 U.S. 86 , 101 ( 1958 ) ) .

Note : Professor Berman is trying to get me reversed here .
I was the federal district court judge who , very reluctantly , had to impose the 55 year sentence .
In another experiment , published in 2005 , Dutch psychologists had undergraduates sit in a cubicle and fill out a questionnaire .
Hidden in the room was a bucket of water with a splash of citrus - scented cleaning fluid , giving off a faint odor .
After completing the questionnaire , the young men and women had a snack , a crumbly biscuit provided by laboratory staff members .
Image Credit ... Jason Mecier
The researchers covertly filmed the snack time and found that these students cleared away crumbs three times more often than a comparison group , who had taken the same questionnaire in a room with no cleaning scent .
“ That is a very big effect , and they really had no idea they were doing it , ” said Henk Aarts , a psychologist at Utrecht University and the senior author of the study .
The Same Brain Circuits
The real - world evidence for these unconscious effects is clear to anyone who has ever run out to the car to avoid the rain and ended up driving too fast , or rushed off to pick up dry cleaning and returned with wine and cigarettes — but no pressed slacks .
The brain appears to use the very same neural circuits to execute an unconscious act as it does a conscious one .
In a study that appeared in the journal Science in May , a team of English and French neuroscientists performed brain imaging on 18 men and women who were playing a computer game for money .
The players held a handgrip and were told that the tighter they squeezed when an image of money flashed on the screen , the more of the loot they could keep .
As expected , the players squeezed harder when the image of a British pound flashed by than when the image of a penny did — regardless of whether they consciously perceived the pictures , many of which flew by subliminally .
But the circuits activated in their brains were similar as well : an area called the ventral pallidum was particularly active whenever the participants responded .
“ This area is located in what used to be called the reptilian brain , well below the conscious areas of the brain , ” said the study ’s senior author , Chris Frith , a professor in neuropsychology at University College London who wrote the book “ Making Up The Mind : How the Brain Creates our Mental World . ”
The results suggest a “ bottom - up ” decision - making process , in which the ventral pallidum is part of a circuit that first weighs the reward and decides , then interacts with the higher - level , conscious regions later , if at all , Dr. Frith said .
ACCRA ( Reuters ) - Abolishing subsidies on fossil fuels could cut world greenhouse gas emissions by up to 6 percent and also nudge up world economic growth , a U.N. report showed on Tuesday .

Subsidies on oil , gas or coal are meant to help the poor by lowering the price of energy but the report , issued on the sidelines of a 160 - nation U.N. climate meeting in Ghana , said they often backfired by mainly benefiting wealthier people .
The study estimated that energy subsidies , almost all for fossil fuels , totaled about $ 300 billion a year or 0.7 percent of world gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
“ Cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0.1 percent to global GDP , ” it said .
People forced to pay higher prices for energy would likely cut back on use of fossil fuels , the main source of greenhouse gases from human activities .
“ Governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones , ” said Achim Steiner , head of the Nairobi - based U.N. Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .
“ Many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy , ” he said in a statement .
Subsidies were biggest in Russia , with about $ 40 billion a year spent mainly on making natural gas cheaper , ahead of Iran with $ 37 billion .
China , Saudi Arabia , India , Indonesia , Ukraine and Egypt also had big subsidies on fuels .
“ Some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined ... they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies , ” Kaveh Zahedi , climate change coordinator at UNEP , told a news conference .
POOR
The report said liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) subsidies in India , aimed at getting fuel to poor households , totaled $ 1.7 billion in the first half of 2008 .
But the report said : “ LPG subsidies are mainly benefiting higher - income households ” .
Smarter subsidies such as tax breaks , financial incentives or other market mechanisms could generate benefits for the economy and environment if properly targeted , it said .
It pointed to subsidies to promote wind energy in Germany and Spain aimed at helping to shift from fossil fuels .
Well - devised subsidies in Chile had spread rural electrification to 90 percent of the population from 50 percent in 12 years , it said .
Governments in Accra are working on the building blocks of a new climate treaty meant to be agreed at the end of 2009 to help slow warming temperatures that may bring more heatwaves , more powerful storms and disruptions to water and food supplies .
UNEP also said Africa was starting to benefit from a U.N. project to help investments in clean technologies such as wind or geothermal power .
Nations such as China , India and Brazil have so far won almost all of the 3,500 projects .
New projects had been registered in recent months in Mozambique , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Madagascar , Mauritius , Mali and Senegal , UNEP spokesman Nick Nuttall said .
And a UNEP study projected that Africa might get 230 such projects by 2012 , generating up to $ 1 billion in credits .
Want to know what this Universe is , how it was born , how it grew to be this way , and what its ultimate fate is ?
So do we .
Let ’s take that journey together .
Edited to add : I have taken the topic of this post and logically continued it in a post about Pluto .
Every now and again I get an email from someone who tries to tell me that the moon orbits the Sun more than it orbits the Earth .
On the face of it , their claim appears to hold water .
For example , they 'll say that if you compare the orbital velocity of the Moon around the Earth ( about 1 km / sec ) to the orbital velocity of the Moon around the Sun ( the same as the Earth 's velocity around the Sun , about 30 km / sec ) , you 'll see that the Moon 's orbit is always convex to the Sun ; in other words , it does n't make a loopy pattern around the Sun , as you might expect :
That diagram is exaggerated ; on that scale the Moon 's combined path around the Earth and Sun would look pretty much like a circle ( and to be clear , the link above does n't make the claim that the Moon orbits the Sun more than it does the Earth , it 's just pointing out the patterns ) .
Moreover , if you calculate the force of the Sun 's gravity on the Moon , you find it 's more than twice the force of Earth 's gravity on the Moon !
Whoa .
So does the Moon orbit the Earth , or the Sun ?
Turns out , it orbits the Earth , despite these claims .
The above claims are true , but are not important in this argument .
Instead , you have to look at something called the Hill sphere .
Basically , it 's the volume of space around an object where the gravity of that object dominates over the gravity of a more massive but distant object around which the first object orbits .
OK , in English -- and more pertinent to this issue -- it 's the volume of space around the Earth where the Earth 's gravity is more important than the Sun's .
If something is orbiting the Earth inside Earth 's Hill 's sphere , it 'll be a satellite of the Earth and not the Sun .
The derivation of the math is n't terribly important here ( and it's on the Wikipedia page if you 're curious ) , but when you plug in the numbers , you find the Earth 's Hill sphere has a radius of about 1.5 million kilometers .
The Moon 's orbital radius of 400,000 km keeps it well within the Earth 's Hill sphere , so there you have it .
The Moon orbits the Earth more than it orbits the Sun .
In reality it does both , and saying it orbits one and not the other is silly anyway .
But what about those other claims ?
Well , the orbital shape is pretty meaningless for this argument .
You 'll get that always - convex pattern for any moon that orbits a planet far enough out compared to the planet 's distance from the Sun .
But as long as that moon is inside the planet 's
Hill sphere , it orbits the planet more than the Sun .
And the fact that the Sun 's force effect of gravity on the Moon is stronger than the Earth 's is interesting , but not relevant .
Why not ?
Because the Sun is pulling on both the Earth and the Moon !
Since both the Earth and Moon are roughly the same distance from the Sun ( the Sun is 400 times farther away from us than the Moon is ) , the force acceleration due to the Sun 's gravity on the Moon and the Earth is about the same .
That means the Sun 's gravity is important in keeping the Earth and Moon together orbiting the Sun , but does n't affect the Earth and Moon as a system .
The Moon is still gravitationally bound to the Earth .
Think of it this way : if the Sun were to disappear , the Moon would still orbit the Earth pretty much as it does now .
That means the Sun 's gravity does n't affect the Earth / Moon system much .
On the flip side , if the Earth disappeared , the Moon would continue to orbit the Sun as well .
That means the Earth 's gravity does n't much affect the Moon 's orbit around the Sun , either .
Now , if we moved the Earth / Moon system closer to the Sun , then this all starts to matter .
That 's because eventually you get to a point where the size of the Moon 's orbit gets to be significant compared to the size of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
In that case , as the Moon orbits the Earth , when its closest to the Sun , the gravity of the Sun gets significant compared to the Sun 's gravity on the Earth ( remember , right now that force effect is about the same ) .
But that 's exactly how the Hill sphere idea works !
It turns out that if you moved the Earth and Moon to about 40 million km from the Sun -- closer to the Sun than Mercury ! -- then the Hill sphere of the Earth would be 400,000 km , equal to the moon 's distance from the Earth now .
That means the Moon could be stripped from the Earth by the Sun , and so then you could say the Moon orbits the Sun and not the Earth .
But out here , 150 million kilometers from the Sun , the Moon orbits the Earth quite nicely , thank you very much .
You can keep your convex orbits and your forces and everything else , and examine them as matters of interest .
But the Moon will keep pacing out its orbit just the same , and it'll keep doing it that way for a long , long time .
The orbital diagrams in this post are from Helmer Aslaksen 's webpage at the Department of Mathematics , National University of Singapore .
I modified them a bit to compare them .
You should read that page , as it has an excellent description of the Moon 's orbital shape .
Oh , and stay tuned , because I have another thing to say about all this in a later post ...
Edited to add : in a couple of places I used the word " force " when I mean " acceleration " .
I fixed that , or used the word " effect " .
This may seem like a nitpick , but in fact they mean different things physically , and therefore their magnitudes , the sizes of their effects , changes .
That 's what I get for writing this at 4 in the morning .
THE militant Palestinian Islamic resistance movement Hamas was yesterday moving to quash an outbreak of violence in the Gaza Strip that left seven people dead .
A series of explosions on Friday , believed to be the work of Fatah , the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation , killed five senior Hamas members and a young girl .
The lethal bomb was planted at an intersection and detonated by remote control when a car carrying the five Hamas leaders drove past it .
The blast killed all five instantly plus six - year - old Seren Safadi who was standing near the intersection .

( CNN ) --
A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever : the body of Bigfoot .
The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds .
Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer , a pair of Bigfoot - hunting hobbyists from north Georgia , say they found the creature 's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive .
The carcass of the furry half - man , half - ape is 7 feet , 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds , they say .
However , the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures .
Tom Nelson , chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega , said he 's " pretty skeptical " the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday .
" That would certainly rock mammalogy , " joked Nelson , who specializes in the study of mammals .
" I see a research grant in my future . "
Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto , California , in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc .
A photograph on that group 's
Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large , hairy creature with an ape - like face , stuffed into a large freezer .
According to a written release , the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show , " Squatch Detective , " several weeks ago .
iReport.com : Do you believe in Bigfoot ?
" The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was ' the Real Bigfoot Hunter , ' Tom Biscardi , " Dyer said , referring to Searching for Bigfoot 's CEO , who has been looking for the elusive , legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971 .
Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit .
Dyer is a former prison guard .
DNA tests on the body have begun , said the statement , and " extensive scientific studies " will be done on the body by scientists , including a molecular biologist , an anthropologist and a paleontologist .
Nelson , the university professor , acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that , in science , " we always acknowledge the possibility of something new . "
But he said that even in north Georgia , home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail , it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7 - foot - tall creatures could have eluded hunters , hikers and creeping development until now .
" To the average person , these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you 'll find lions and tigers and bears , " he said .
" The reality is that you 're never more than a mile from a road . "
The group says the animal is male , has reddish hair and " blackish - gray " eyes and human - like feet , hands and teeth .

McCain ’s Dishonesty Tactic Tough to Beat

John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) ( WDCpix )
For a man who once considered the press his “ base , ” and the truth a trusted ally , part of a package of integrity and “ Straight Talk , ” Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the Republican nominee for president , finds himself on unfamiliar terrain these days .
Now , on the verge of the apex of his political career , McCain is in the dead center of a whirlwind of honesty issues that he might not have foreseen when he began this campaign .
He is a now man surrounded by a hostile press that questions his truthfulness , running a campaign that even former Bush strategist Karl Rove is calling “ one step too far ” in its attacks on Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee .
McCain , the one - time avatar of transparency and candor , finds himself shadowed by the media –people he now tends to call ” little jerks ” — yelling “ Liar ! Liar !
Pants on Fire ! ”
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
Of course , McCain still literally rides the Straight Talk Express , both in the air and on the ground .
He still belts out the same jokes about lawyers and congressional approval ratings and has deep rhetorical grace when speaking about his experiences in Vietnam and his concern for soldiers in the field .
He still stumbles through prepared remarks as if racing to get to the town - hall portion , where he eagerly speaks to admirers .
But the old soldier , who watched his 2000 presidential ambitions felled by dark tactics , ugly rumors and outright falsehoods during the GOP primary campaign in South Carolina , is now orchestrating those same kind of attacks .
Instead of being the one standing up to mis-truth , he is mis -truth ’s master — using outright lies about his opponent ’s record and stands , while exaggerating the strength of his own campaign .
This is not a statement created by the Obama campaign .
This is something based , as Marlon Brando ’s Jor-El once said in “ Superman : The Movie , ” in “ undeniable fact . ”
The New York Times , in a news story — * not an editorial *– chronicled McCain ’s misdeeds .
First , the GOP campaign twisted Obama ’s words regarding lipstick - gate ; then it ran an advertisement suggesting Obama supported “ comprehensive sex education ” for kindergartners as well as complete distortions of his rivals tax , energy and health - care plans .
Both the Washington Post and The Associated Press ran pieces in a similar vein and Bloomberg News questioned — correctly — whether McCain officials had begun over - estimating the crowd size at McCain - Palin events .
For god ’s sakes , a hapless McCain was taken — quite effectively — to task by the hosts of “ The View . ”
“ I am always reluctant to use the word ‘ lie ’ — but in this case there is no alternative , ” said Dee Dee Myers , the former Clinton White House press secretary who now serves as a commentator on MSNBC .
“ I think the McCain camp thinks the mainstream media is so discredited in the eyes of the Republican base , that they think any red flag raised will be ignored as something created by the liberal establishment . ”
The more pressing question , however , is what should be the proportional level of response ?
History does n’t do Obama any favors here .
Certainly he can find little that is instructive in the 2004 election , when the Vietnam career of Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry , who had earned two Purple Hearts and a Silver Star , came into question though the facts said there should have been none .
As a relative new player on the stage , Obama cannot appear to whine , though both the age and experience he brings to the Oval Office have been viewed scantly by even some within the Democratic Party .
Should Obama decide to remain above the fray and not answer these continuing attacks , he risks falling into the same dark hole that Michael S. Dukakis did in 1988 .
He was called a “ card - carrying liberal ” again and again and again , which in Ronald Reagan ’s America was a label only slightly less sinister than Communist smuggling atomic weapon plans to Fidel Castro in exchange for cigars .
Only a few weeks ago , on a warm night in Denver , Obama stood before the world and declared he would not be a punching bag for the Republican Party .
The question now is “ How ? ”
“ One of the problems we had is that we simply did n’t have the money to go after the Swift Boaters and for the general election , ” said Robert Shrum , the Democratic political adviser who served as the campaign manager for the Kerry effort in 2004 .
“ That ’s a problem the Obama campaign simply does n’t have .
“ The fundamental challenge of the Obama campaign is to get this back to the issues , ” Shrum said .
“ More than simply pushing back , he has to get it back to what was for at months was the center of the campaign — change , the economy , the war in Iraq .
The only change McCain offers is in subject matter , not in substance . ”
Gerald Rafshoon , President Jimmy Carter ’s communications director , has also dealt with his share of political attacks .
“ You have to respond to it and you have to knock it down , ” Rafshoon said .
“ You ca n’t let his message dictate your message .
He does this by coming tight back at them , as fast as he can .
He does it with surrogates and he does it with advertisements and you hope it will boomerang negatively for McCain . ”
Complicating matters is the way that many in this country feel about news outlets .
McCain has not actually talked to the reporters spending thousands of dollars to travel with him since before mid-August .
Palin herself has sat for two interviews , one with ABC and the other with Fox News , and has remained at arms - length from anyone else seeking to speak with her .
Moreover , as Myers pointed out , news outlets have become the virtual bogeymen in the eyes of the GOP ’s conservative base .
This makes fighting a proxy war through the press nearly futile .
We — and I include TWI here — are caught in the cross -hairs of the culture wars that still burn with fury in America .
We are mistrusted by both left and right .
On one hand , is the image of a scoop - driven machine gone mad , going to any lengths to humiliate conservatives , overstepping our bounds — as many would argue Dan Rather did in 2004 , while investigating President George W. Bush ’s time in the Air Force National Guard .
To the left , we are the weak lackeys who showed no vigilance in reporting the evidence that the Bush administration used to take us to war in Iraq .
Thus , if this McCain no longer cares about the press , or , for that matter , the truth , the key could be to use these well - documented fabrications to attack something he does care for : his moral code .
“ He ’s based his whole campaign around ‘ Putting Country First ’ , ” Myers said .
“ These attacks have begun to erode at something much more important .
It ’s eating away at the foundation of his campaign .
McCain ’s not a policy guy .
He ’s an honor guy .
“ Obama , when talking about these attacks on the stump , should use the word ‘ honor . ’
Use the word ‘ honor ’ and McCain ’s head blows up .
On some level he McCain knows what he ’s doing .
He ’s going to a very dangerous place with all of this
“ To question his honor , the very thing he thinks about in the dark of the night is the one thing that would work , ” Myers continued .
“ I think for Obama to do it in person , during the debates , would be pretty powerful .
You know , it would get McCain really mad , and it would have to force him to answer for his deeds .
No one likes negative ads — with the exception of Paul Begala — but Obama has to show he can throw a punch .
We ’ve seen that he can take a punch .
Now we have to see more . ”
Obama ’s true plans for dealing with these lies will certainly unfold quickly , for Nov. 4 is ever closer .
McCain ’s ads and actions have not only damaged his reputation as a maverick and besmirched his honor , they hold greater consequences for the American people .
The philosopher Sissela Bok wrote in her landmark book , “ Lying : Moral Choice in Public and Private Life , ” about the consequences one faces when lying becomes part of the norm .
Bok explores consequences not only for an individual , but assesses the damage on a wider level .
“ I do n’t think people understand how much it damages them , ” Bok said on the telephone from her home in Cambridge , “ maybe not in the short run .
In the short run , the cost of integrity , for instance , it might not seem to matter .
But they have to understand that when they lie simply to win an election , they must be prepared to sacrifice their self - respect .
“ Moreover , they ’re doing harm to society , ” Bok said , “ Once people have the notion that people in public service are all dishonest , the whole profession of public service , or journalism , is damaged .
Everyone is seen as dishonest — when we know there are good , honest people who choose to serve in public duty , in public life . ”
Now , McCain must ask himself the cost of such lies .
Has he come all this way , run this strong campaign , to win in this way ?
This is something only he can answer — and something he must ultimately answer for .
Should Biden Share Blame for Foreclosure Crisis ?
Experts : Many Americans may have lost homes due to a bill championed by Biden .
August 28 , 2008  --
Experts say hundreds of thousands of Americans may have lost their homes due to a bill championed by Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , Barack Obama 's vice - presidential running mate .
At least two studies have concluded that the United States ' foreclosure crisis was exacerbated by a 2005 law that overhauled the nation 's bankruptcy law .
That conclusion is echoed by other experts , although the banking and credit industry disputes it .
Congressional Republicans drove the effort to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act ( BAPCPA ) of 2005 .
But Biden – who has enjoyed hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from credit industry executives – endorsed the measure early on and worked to gather Democratic support for it .
Biden 's early and vocal support was " essential " to the bill 's passage , said Travis Plunkett of the Washington D.C. - based advocacy group Consumer Federation , which opposed the measure .
Biden " went out of his way to undermine criticism of the legislation , " and his efforts helped convince other Democrats to support the bill .
" Biden was a fairly strong proponent of that bankruptcy bill , " said Philip Corwin , a consultant for the American Bankers Association , which represents banks and lenders .
However , Biden was " not in our pocket in any way , " he added .
Biden 's Senate office did not provide comment for this story .
Asked if the Obama / Biden campaign was concerned Biden 's record was a liability when discussing economic security , David Wade , a spokesman for the Obama / Biden campaign , said , " Barack Obama and Joe Biden have real solutions for struggling families in danger of losing their homes because of the Bush economy and abusive lending practices . "
BAPCPA " is directly responsible for the rising foreclosure rate since the end of 2005 , " concluded a 2007 study by Credit Suisse .
The law " increased foreclosures and the number of homes for sale , " echoed a July 2008 study by U.S. Treasury researcher David Bernstein .
That study estimated the law had pushed foreclosures or forced sales on 200,000 homeowners since it went into effect , but noted that was a rough , " back - of - the - envelope " calculation .
" Trying to tie the forclosure crisis to the [ 2005 bankruptcy ] bill is a stretch , " said the ABA 's Corwin .
Corwin called the Credit Suisse report " junk " and said the Bernstein study was n't " worth the paper it was written on . "
The head author of the 2007 Credit Suisse report clarified his earlier findings in an email Wednesday .
" The law likely contributed to increased foreclosures early on , " said researcher Rod Dubitsky , but combined with other key factors , including subprime lending practices , to create the current crisis .
Bernstein did not respond to a request for an interview .
The bill was backed by banks and credit card companies including MBNA , which is headquartered in Delaware , Biden 's home state .
They wanted the bill because it would make it harder for Americans to use bankruptcy to avoid repaying credit card debt .
MBNA executives had been Biden 's single largest source of campaign donations , and MBNA has employed Biden 's son Hunter as a company executive , lobbyist and consultant .
The Obama campaign has said Hunter Biden did no work for MBNA on the bankruptcy bill .
MBNA has since been bought by Bank of America .
Over the past two years , sub - prime mortgage borrowing and a weakening economy have pushed increasing numbers of Americans into dire financial straits .
Under the old rules , many could have declared bankruptcy , shed much of their debt , restructured their mortgages and held onto their homes , according to experts and the two reports .
But the 2005 law Biden championed made it more expensive and more difficult to declare bankruptcy , experts conclude .
That forced hundreds of thousands of distressed homeowners to sell their homes , or default on their mortgages , after which the bank would sell their former home , according to the studies .
That flood of homes going up for sale in an already - weakening market further depressed home prices , according to the two reports , snowballing into the current crisis .
BAPCPA " increased home foreclosures , increased the dollar value of financial assets in default , and put additional downward price pressure on real estate markets , " concluded the Bernstein report .
Bernstein conducted the report as an individual , not as a representative the Treasury Department .

Expert : ' Caging ' scheme will backfire on GOP David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Election dirty tricks have been known to backfire in the past , and it may be happening again in 2008 .
According to the author of How to Rig an Election : Confessions of a Republican Operative , an alleged scheme to prevent voters who have encountered foreclosure proceedings on their homes from voting in November is " going to work against the Republicans . "
Last week , the Michigan Messenger detailed a plan by the Macomb County , Michigan Republican party to challenge voters whose names appear on foreclosure lists , describing it as one among numerous such GOP plans to challenge African - Americans and other likely Democratic voters on Election Day in crucial swing states such as Michigan and Ohio .
Olbermann was joined in his discussion of the story by Allen Raymond , who came by his expertise on vote - rigging the hard way , having been imprisoned in 2006 for his involvement in an illegal GOP phone - jamming operation during the 2002 elections .
Raymond explained that this threatened use of foreclose lists is a new form of what is called " vote caging , " which has traditionally meant that " you essentially send a first - class letter to a hoursehold where you suspect that that person no longer lives there but where they 're still registered to vote .
That letter comes back .
... Somebody [ at the local polling place ] then challenges that vote if that person comes in to vote . "
Vote caging first became notorious during the 2004 presidential election , when it was allegedly used against predominently black voters in Florida .
Olbermann asked Raymond whether the foreclosure scheme was " a big play " that might actually prevent some people from voting on Election Day or just an attempt to scare off potential voters through media coverage .
Raymond suggested in response that " ironically , it 's actually something that the Obama campaign can use now to gin up intensity .
...
It 's a bit of a ju- jitsu move .
It 's going to work against the Republicans . "
Joe Biden has already made use of the story , saying durng a speech in Michigan , " I was told yesterday that there 's a Republican County Chairman right here in your state , Michigan , that said that they 're keeping a list of foreclosed homes , suggesting that anyone who lost their home in foreclosure should also lose their right to vote .
[ crowd boos ]
Ladies and gentleman , if you 're worried about losing your home , you should vote for the guys who are prepared to help you keep your home , not those would take it away ! "
The Michigan Republican Party has since demanded a retraction from the Michigan Messenger and has threatened a lawsuit , but according to Olbermann , as of Wednesday afternoon no legal papers had been filed .
However , the Democrats have filed their own lawsuit , seeking an injunction against the tactic .
Raymond concluded by commenting that the initiative to deploy thousands of lawyers on Election Day might not catch every attempt at trickery of this sort , but " it 's such a close election , you 'd better be doing everything . "

■ 17年と13年だけ大発生?素数ゼミの秘密に迫る!
( サイエンス・アイ新書 72 ) 吉村仁 (著 ) 。
素数ゼミとは、北アメリカ大陸において13年もしくは17年ごとに大発生するセミである。素数ゼミナールのことではない。なぜ周期が素数なのか？以前どこかで、寄生虫との軍拡競争の結果だと読んだ*1。2年おきとか3年おきとか5年おきとかに発生する寄生虫を避けるためにどんどん周期が長く、しかも周期が素数になったという説だ。この説にはなんとなく納得できなかった。寄生虫が素数サイクルの原因だとしたら、他の地域でも素数ゼミがいてもよさそうだし、大量発生するほうが寄生虫に弱そうな気がする。本書では、寄生虫説ではなく、近縁種との交雑を避けるためという説を挙げている。私には、こちらの説のほうが説得力がありそうに思える。詳しくは本書を読んでいただくとして、だいたいこんな感じ。
素数ゼミの祖先は、氷河期に絶滅しかけた。気温が低くなったため幼虫の成長速度が遅くなり、成虫になるために10年以上かかるようになった。厳しい環境のため個体数が減り、交尾相手を確保するため周期を合わせるようになった。特定の周期から外れて発生した個体は、個体群密度が低すぎて繁殖に成功できず、淘汰される。ここまでが、長い周期性を獲得した理由。では、なぜその周期が12年とか15年とかではダメで、素数でなければならないのか？本書によれば、交雑を避けるためとのこと。たとえば、10年周期のセミ（遺伝子型AA）と14年周期のセミ（遺伝子型aa）が同時発生して交雑したとする。その子孫の遺伝子型の頻度比はAA：Aa：aa=1:2:1となる。10年周期が優性と仮定すると、交雑の10年後には遺伝子型AAとAaの混在した個体群が生じるわけである。この個体群からは遺伝子型aaの個体（14年周期）が生まれるため、次世代の個体群密度が小さくなり絶滅する可能性が高くなる。交雑の14年後は遺伝子型aaのみの個体群が生じて、こちらのほうは純系であるが、交雑の年と比較して個体群密度は4分の1になってしまい、やはり絶滅しやすい。
言葉で書いたからわかりにくいが、要するに交雑によってロスが生じると理解してもらえばよい。うまいこと条件を合わせればシミュレーションで再現できると思われるが、すでに「学生がやってくれた」のだそうだ*2。なるべく交雑が起らない周期が素数である。素数ならば11年でも良いような気がするが、幼虫が成長するのに11年では足りなかったのだろう。17年周期のセミは北部に、13年周期のセミは南部に分布していることからも、交雑を避け、かつ、気温が低くても幼虫が成長できるだけの長い周期が必要であったことが推測できる。寄生虫説では17年ゼミが北部に分布する理由が説明できないように思われる。また、北アメリカ大陸だけに素数ゼミが進化した理由も寄生虫説では説明できない。本書の説によれば、熱帯地域との移動を制限するカリブ海やメキシコ湾の存在という北アメリカ大陸の地理的条件が素数ゼミの進化に関係している。氷河期に南に逃れることのできる地理的条件の地域では、周期性は進化しない。
いくつか別の疑問も湧いてくる。周期が単純なメンデル遺伝に従うと仮定されているが、検証されているのだろうか（ただ、単純なメンデル遺伝に従わないとしても、交雑が不利であることには変わりないだろう）。交配実験で検証可能だけれども長い年月がかかる。F1世代の表現型を調べるだけで17年かかるのだ。しかし、DNAを比較することで、間接的な証明ならば可能かもしれない。周期は13年であるが、「酵素などのいろいろな遺伝子」が17年ゼミ*3と同じものを持つ新種*4が発見されたそうである。著者の吉村は、13年ゼミと17年ゼミの交雑によって周期遺伝子以外の17年ゼミの遺伝子が個体群に広がって新種が生じたという「遺伝子浸透仮説」を提唱している。力技で全ゲノムを調べれば検証できるかも。
そのほか、フィールド調査やメイトチョイスの話が載っていた。誤植や、メンデルの法則の説明におかしな部分はあるが、ご愛嬌。
Ryan Seacrest 's Mystery Woman ( Photos )
, television and radio host , was spotting leaving Mr. Chow restaurant in Los Angeles on Saturday evening .
He stopped to sign some autographs and pose for photographs with some fans and then he left the area with an unidentified woman .
It is possible that the woman is a bartender in NYC who owns an bartending service called BarCandy .
Seacrest , 33 , earned $ 14 million last year according to Forbes magazine .
He ended a two year relationship with actress Shana Wall in 2005 .
He was also briefly linked to Olly Girl Holly Huddleston .
Despite the documented female companionship , rumors continue to suggest that he is gay .
The television personality recently finished his seventh season as host of the FOX reality show American Idol .
Ratings dropped off leading to speculation that Seacrest may not be brought back for season eight .
Check out photos of Seacrest and his mystery woman .
The paparazzi also captured some photos of Randy Jackson leaving the same restaurant .

Not so far from Powell is the Jellico area ( which separates KY and TN ) where Aaron Lay was from .
He was involved in NC Republican Congressman McHenry 's campaign and some voting scandals .
Somehow this NC crowd is connected to Jason Drake , the Strategum killer .
Re : Gonzales and Abrami , witnesses die in this country whether in drug deals , financial schemes , organized crime hits , or political scandals .
There 's more than one underground American terrorist network , without a doubt .
Hate groups have increased by 50 % since the year , 2000 .
Even Todd Blodgett bought into a white supremacist record company at one point , and he was Reagan 's writer , and caught up in some Gannon escort ring , according to internet accounts .
Todd 's father is a former Iowa congressman and one time Bush appointed Federal Judge .
( WHY does it always lead back to the days of Iran Contra ? )

With regard to the DOJ affirmative action for members of neocon evangelicals .
We also know that the greatest numbers of unqualified supervisorial hires are recent graduates from Fallwell 's " bible before law " Law School .
These were the ones who decided which USDA 's were fired in the scandal .
As Ms. Goodling said she thought that she swore abllegiance to George Bush .
I do n't dowbt that somewhere these people have sworn to George Bush .
It gives me chills like the " Jesus Camp " scene where children are taught to pray to a cardboard image of GWB .
And this is where we also need to look at the Air Force Academy where non-evangelicals were harrassed and people were informed that there was no chance of quick advancement unless they became evangelicals .
We will have those people flying the planes containing nuclear bombs .
While these people will expect to be placed in higher positions after the next election due to the high positions where they began and who will demand that they have been discrimated against should they not be hired due to their low qualifications and questionable actions .

It 's time for the general public to DEMAND a return to balanced media .
One of the major reasons for our country 's descent into the midst of a GOP controlled propaganda machine , is the Left 's tolerance for the proliferation of pimps , whoring for the conservative fascist movement , i.e. , Limbaugh , O'Reilly , Beck ... rightwing lunatics dominating every facet of public opinion has done as much if not more to empower the psychopaths in the White House than nearly all of the election - rigging , Bill of Rights stripping , Capitol Hill computer hacking and other endless impeachable , treasonous offenses being plied against American citizens , daily .
In totalitarian regimes control of the media is always the # 1 priority ... wake up folks , we 've passed that point long ago .
Until liberals get a backbone and PUBLICLY confront and debunk each and every outrageous lie being spewed forth by conservatives , this country is doomed .

I 've been expecting something like this for a while now .
As the economy tightens up AND the political power on the right collapses , as McCain 's chances go further down the tube , expect more of the same .
It wo n't be anything organized , it 'll be nutcases like this guy .
I thought Democratic party chapter HQs would be hit first rather than Unitarians but whatever , the " goal " ( if you can call it that ) is the same .
Folks ?
You need to re-think that whole second amendment thing .
I 'm serious .
Tennessee is a state where gun carry permits can be had with a background check and training .
The next time something like this happens , somebody needs to return fire .

There 's an underground network and word has it stretches to Texas , up into NY and down into Florida .
But that 's just one of the networks .
Mafias come in all colors , flavors and nationalities .
Hate groups are on the increase .
" We 've got guns buried all over our back yards in plastic bags , " says one member .
" They 've got guns hidden in the walls of their houses , behind the drywall , " says a frightened witness .
You have to understand Mr. March , that criminals will always have guns and access to guns .
It 's the good people who , with every homeland war in the past , found guns a necessary personal possession .
Only in recent years is the government fighting to take them away from good people they apparently deem incapable of defending themselves and their families .
But then this government finds a mental illness for every pill pharmaceuticals can invent for profit and mind control .
Americans are the most sickly people on the planet , and " mental illness " is the most accepted of all .
I do n't trust police to defend my family , eradicate illegal drugs from my community , find my stolen tractor or recover stolen jewelry .
They 're too far away to come and kill the wild dogs killing my chickens , or be at my beckoned call when a crazed crystal meth addict attempts to break into my house to steal and support his habit .
While some believe they 're purely Liberal as opposed to being Conservative , in close examination of core beliefs most people will probably find they have a " little bit of both . "
The city mouse says , " chicken comes from grocery stores and is found in wrappers , " the country mouse says " chicken has feathers and comes from eggs . "
To understand the country mouse and the city mouse , you have to think like one .

( It 's networking and this is how it works . )
Gordon Bennett of Kentucky knocked on the door , switched on the TV and said , " You 're going to see some of it , now . "
It ?
This was the summer of 1999 , the same period JFK , Jr. perished in the plane crash .
But it was n't JFK 's story Gordon Bennett was excited about .
The Atlanta Stock market shootings were all over the MSM news and it's the news he carried .
When the story came on he stood back and watched it cautiously as though he was particularly interested in the content of the broadcast .
This was this story : http://www.cnn.com/US/99.../29/atlanta.shooting.04/
Gordon said some other things , regarding his associates :
" They brainwash you .
They put bags over their heads and stand around you and tell you what to do .
You do n't know who they are .
They showed me a video of a man raping a 12 year old boy .
Then they told me the man did n't deserve to live and he did n't deserve a trial .
So they told me to take my shotgun over to the man 's house and solve the problem .
I went to his house , knocked on his door , and when he answered the door , I blew his brains out . " \

Agent , I do n't know what " bubke 's " means .
I 'd testify to any of this in any court of law : anywhere .
Gordon Bennett is real .
Those statements were made to me in my presence , witnessed : first hand .
In fact , Bennett said much more than that , and it is frightening if you 'd like to know more details , particularly about " C - 4 " explosives , which at the time I 'd never even heard of .
In fact , he suggested Sally Denton 's book , " The Bluegrass Conspiracy " you 'll see some of these people were suspect of plotting a hit on Ted Kennedy , and one mentioned , Roger Barnard , an alleged Houston Mafia associate , died near my home two years ago .
I can give you that story , too , and Adnan Khashoggi was involved in " The Triad " farm , also near my home .
This is an organized network and they have people who will kill " rats " for talking about it .
And I have believed Gordon Bennett was part of a well - organized " HIT TEAM " from the time he pointed so proudly to the Atlanta stock shootings , 1999 .
I 'm not fantasizing about Gordon Bennett , Attorneys Gatewood Galbraith , Kenneth Schatten , Michael Broadbear , and others , or my dead son who disappeared and died so mysteriously in shady Baldwin County , Alabama where Governor Siegelman lost his election ; the death of Amy Frink which I became involved in trying to help solve her murder , or any of this .
I 'm not fantasizing about my dead animals of which you will see pictures , documents proving it at these sites .
Every bit of it is the truth .
Go out to the Googlepages sites and you 'll see a letter from Alabama AG , Troy King and many others .
The system is corrupt , and Al Quaeda did n't murder Amy Frink or my son .
They did n't imprison Don Siegelman , and they did n't butcher my show dogs .
The problem is in telling the truth in this country we 've been conditioned to believe people are insane , delusional , or " imaginative " before looking at the facts - as incredible as they might seem .
I 've been discredited by the ones who murdered my son and others , and these links below will show you the documents which prove the truth .
Yes Bill Canary and David Addington both are affiliated with American Truckers Association like I 've written in other blog sites .
And the Baldwin County , Alabama authorities said my son hitchhiked on a truck from Georgia to Alabama before he died .
Trucks somehow always play into the tragedies but it 's funny the police did n't have the trucker 's name , tag number , or company name .
I 'm only trying to put it all together and unravel the network , because there are many names .
My son did n't know a soul in Alabama , and there was absolutely no cause for him to go there AT ALL .
http://theloonusa.googlepages.com
http://a-loon.blogspot.com
Maybe my problems came from the political cartoons I created in North Carolina just before Amy Frink was murdered there .
Maybe I should n't have enraged the politicians who apparently wear the white sheets in secret .
http://whackedpolitics.googlepages.com
I must have been " crazy " to have ever involved myself in politics of any kind , apparently like the mafia , you wo n't get out alive and your family can suffer enormously .
You can remove my posts from this blog if you believe they 're too " incredible , " but I 've been watching these people from every angle since 1998 when they started throwing me in dirty Georgia jails only later to dismiss their silly , concocted charges when I demanded a jury trial and showed them I 'd call their bluffs : EVERY TIME .
Abramoff , Ralph Reed , Gonzalez , Abrami , the Paulding County , Georgia Republican plane crash , the " Facility Group , " Former Sheriff Bill Hutson of Cobb County , Georgia ; Indicted former Governor Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky , Steve Pence , Lt. Governor appointed as a US Attorney at the same time as Leura Canary ....
Atchison and the Republicans dropping dead , Palfrey 's hanging , and Casolaro and Lemme are all connected ; J. Marshall Hughes , and Disponett with Destin Florida and Bowen Ballard , .... all connected , if nothing else through the Republican party , land development , or retired military , or all of it .
I 'm not pointing the finger at KARL ROVE , because he 's not smart enough to have figured all of this out .
It would have taken a consulting team with computer software comparable to the CIA 's to create all of these disasters .
This has been my life for 10 years , because I 'm going to find out exactly what happened in Baldwin County , Alabama 12/9/98 , the day they said my son " blew his brains out with a shot gun " - the gun incapable of holding the number of shells recorded by incompetent , and apparently corrupt Baldwin County , Alabama police .
I have n't experienced a place in the South since 1998 , that 's honest - and I 'm ashamed to say it .
I believe the Ocean Isle Beach fire last year was connected into this same network and possibly the Virginia Tech shootings .
The " terror " is a way of saying , " Keep your mouths shut , " CIA style , and " Terror alert color " orange while the Jack of Spades has George Bush 's face on it and his Poppy Daddy 's apparently the Joker .
All the while Tasers are EVERYWHERE .
If you have any questions , theloonusa@yahoo.com is my present address and you have my permission to publish any and all correspondence unless otherwise noted and agreed upon .
In Florida check out Thomas G. Schlette and his candle business in the early 1990's .
He was working , 2003 - 2006 for Pinkerton at St. Lucie 's airport , near Stuart , " VOUGHT AIRCRAFT " in 2006 he mentioned Mark Foley just before he died of an apparent overdose on May 3 , 2006 .
Schlette said the Vought Facility was shipping boxes on boxes of documents from Milledgeville , Georgia to be shredded in Florida .
He read some of them , and I 've wondered what was being shredded since he said the Bush family owned Vought , ( via Carlyle , I guess . )
It was n't so long after Schlette 's life became bizarre , he began to suffer threats , and Foley 's personal problems were all over the news .
Schlette said some trucks were carrying " potted tropical plants " from South Florida to New Jersey in the form of white powder .
( There 's those trucks , again . )

Thanks !
Here 's a few more stories for you , which are true .
In one of many endeavors to seek assistance from authorities , I contacted Steve O'Daniel , detective for the office of Attorney General , Kentucky under the administration of Governor Ernie Fletcher regarding all of my problems there .
He explained there were these " gangs " .... the way he put it was , " one of those gangs , who bring people to the state and then rob them . "
Not long after , O'Daniel was adversely accused in the news , and here 's that story .
( If you google " Governor Ernie Fletcher , indicted " you 'll get the governor 's story and the stories of those pardoned . )
http://www.beloblog.com/.../odaniel_not_guilty.html
It 's also worthy to note that AG Troy King , Alabama was in the news days prior to his recent and painful , and career destroying " public exposure " story regarding his personal life .
One of King 's disclosures was his acknowledgment that several Alabama counties were , in fact , corrupted in voting practices with both Democrats and Republicans involved .
The other was he disagreed with United Nation reports that there had been mistakes in corrupt death row rulings in Alabama .
( This is all about discrediting and destroying witnesses , and how that game is played - often quite deadly ; sometimes fatal . )
The other note I 'd like to make while timely is that Mr. John Bizzack , as head of Criminal Justice Training in Kentucky is noted in Ms. Denton 's book , " The Bluegrass Conspiracy " as having covered up more than the murder of Melanie Flynn .
Bizzack shifts political parties , and in 2006 along with many other affluent people , Bizzack 's wife of many years perished in the Lexington Comair Crash .
Many Kentuckians , in attempting to avoid negative publicity for the state , and although the stories can be validated tend to refer to Denton 's book as a " fictitious novel . "

David Rogers , aka " Charles , " go read about Victor Ashe , former Mayor of Knoxville , TN ; now Polish Ambassador ( as incredible as such a promotion might appear . )
Seems
Ashe was jerked right out of Tennessee and placed in a higher position when " tennessee rivers " involving extortion , wrecker services and other issues became a little too warm .
I have some " extortion " stories about wreckers and wrecker services in Kentucky and Georgia , too .
Maybe these states took the enterprising wrecker business ideas from Knoxville .
( When I heard a couple years ago , that one of Kentucky 's more questionable citizens was moving to Cobb County , Georgia to set up a wrecker service , I had to wonder who the lucky future Georgia customers might be .
As a general rule , wrecker expenses are seldom budgeted , planned expenses .
Wreckers , like attorneys , generally profit from misfortune .
- m.l. )
Also if you can , " Charles , " investigate why " politics " allowed illegal poker gaming machines in certain Knoxville establishments , 1998 .
I found those in several Kentucky establishments a few years later .
Do you suppose the same " politics " people were involved ?
I have a few personal stories about that , too .
It is n't surprising the Unibomber had a book of Al Gore's .
I can personally recall few " liberal " activities surrounding Al Gore other than his recent environmental political and business objectives , which are bringing him tons of money and global recognition .
His wife , as I recall , was suspicious of rock and roll music , and I do n't know " a liberal " ( despising tags as I do ) alive who would share those views .
But then if I had a really good memory , I would n't be an American , would I ?
The great state of Tennessee is known for many good things , but " liberal " is definitely not one of them .
The Democrat tag does n't necessarily mean " liberal " and I 'm from an ancient era in the South when the word Republican appeared to be taken from a foreign language , or another planet .
Church and Democrats was the Southern culture and social club before 1960 and time has n't changed things too much .
My hunch says Al Gore is far from finished with politics , but temporarily removed to ride out the economic depression and Obamamania era and then return to a more conservative , tamed Democratic party in a few years .
Apart from Willie Nelson and the few who really care , seldom do Nashville 's videos depict the truth about the small Southern farm , like sweat , premature ageing wrinkles , drought , struggle , 15 + hour days - and eventual loss .
Nice , new shiny tractors , and well groomed , clean , happy faces depicting wholesome healthy living , shiny new boots , and clean , white tall ten gallon hats ; fresh new fence lines in the landscaping are pretty in pictures , but not so common in real life with American southern small farming .
-- Blood and Gore Investments --- ( from Wikipedia )
Generation Investment Management LLP is a London - based investment management firm with an investment style that blends traditional equity research with a focus on sustainability factors , including social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance .
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore is chairman of Generation , and David Blood — previously chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management — is CEO .
The pair has given the company its nickname , " Blood and Gore . "

BBC News , Tehran
Ahmadinejad is due to visit New York for the UN General Assembly meeting
To an outside observer , a row on Zionism and Israel in Iran has the arcane feel of a medieval theological dispute .
Indeed , if the topic was not so serious , it could almost be the subject for one of the more bizarre Monty Python comedy sketches .
Senior figures across Iran have been lining up as if for a contest - to prove quite how strongly opposed they are to Israel and Zionism .
In official circles in the Islamic Republic of Iran , it is , of course , accepted beyond dispute that Zionism is evil , possibly even the source of all evil in the world .
Today , Iran is friends with the American and Israeli people .
No nation in the world is our enemy
Esfandiar Rahim Mashae
Tourism minister President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been particularly outspoken in his comments on the matter .
His remark that Israel should be " wiped off the face of the map " was one of the first signs that his was going to be a most controversial presidency - even if the precise translation of those comments is still disputed .
So the most bizarre element in this episode is that it is a close ally of the president who has been accused of being too friendly to the Jewish state , or at least to its citizens .
In an interview in July , the vice president in charge of tourism , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , was quoted as saying that Iranians were friends with the Israeli people , despite the conflict between their governments .
" Today , Iran is friends with the American and Israeli people , " he said , according to the semi-official Fars News Agency .
" No nation in the world is our enemy . "
Ahmadinejad 's backing
It sounded just like the standard cliche from the US state department : " We are not enemies with the people of country x , just their leaders . "
Ayatollah Khamenei made it clear he had no sympathy for the Israelis But in Iran , in the present climate , even the slightest hint that everything about Israel is not pure evil unleashed a storm of protest , with sermons , newspaper editorials , complaints in parliament and demonstrations .
Yet the vice president refused to back down .
The controversy dominated a news conference given last Thursday by President Ahmadinejad - provoking numerous questions , and taking up more than half - an - hour of the proceedings .
The president supported his deputy 's comments , while making one of his strongest tirades to date against the ' leaders of Zionism ' .
Mr Ahmadinejad said that a handful - only around 2000 Zionists - dominated the centres of power in the West .
They were atheists , he said , who wanted to dominate the world and plunder the wealth of nations .
And Mr Ahmadinejad argued that that many of those now living in Israel had been duped into moving to the country by that handful of Zionists .
It was time to open the gates to let them return home .
He had sympathy for them , he explained , just as he had compassion even for US President George W Bush , who could have been a better person , despite his countless crimes .
Ayatollah 's attack
But despite the tough rhetoric against Israel , there was a quick rebuke from the Supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei .
Speaking at last Friday 's prayers , the ayatollah made it clear he had no sympathy for the Israeli people .
" Who are the Israelis , " he said .
" They are responsible for usurping houses , territory , farmlands and businesses .
They are fighters at the disposal of Zionist operatives .
" A Muslim nation cannot remain indifferent to such people who are stooges at the service of the arch - enemies of the Muslim world , " the ayatollah said .
Mr Mashaei immediately declared his loyalty to the supreme leader , but still did not retract his comments .
And there is plenty of evidence that the vice president spoke with the approval , perhaps even the encouragement , of President Ahmadinejad .
The two men have been close friends since they served together in the Revolutionary Guards .
They are even related - Mr Mashaei 's daughter is married to Mr Ahmadinejad 's son - one of many dynastic marriages in Iran .
Peace overture ?
Journalist Ali Pahlavan says it is quite possible that Mr Mashaei is being used as a mouthpiece for the president , enabling Mr Ahmadinejad to qualify his controversial comments about wiping Israel off the map .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes " He is trying to enhance and enlighten and broaden the idea of a world without Israel , " Mr Pahlavan explained .
To show , in other words , that Iran 's intention is not to wipe out the Israeli people in some new act of genocide , but just to see the end of the state of Israel , just as the Soviet Union disintegrated .
There has even been speculation that this might be the prelude to a peace overture from President Ahmadinejad to the United States .
It is an intriguing idea , just as Mr Ahmadinejad arrives in New York for his annual visit to the UN General Assembly .
What better opportunity for some ground - breaking diplomacy ?
Certainly , Mr Ahmadinejad is a believer that Iran 's best policy lies in negotiating directly with the " great Satan " - by contrast with others in the country , who believe their best hope is in using Europe as an intermediary .
But if this is a peace initiative , it is deeply misguided - even by the strange standards of Mr Ahmadinejad 's government .
To accuse your negotiating partner of being in the hands of a few evil atheist Zionists is hardly the best way to encourage constructive talks .
And there is absolutely also no sign that Tehran is willing to compromise on the more substantive issue on their agenda - Iran 's nuclear programme .
More likely , this seems to be an internal argument within Iranian ruling circles , a sort of theological refinement of exactly where the limits lie to the anti-Zionism that the country uses to help define its very raison d'etre .

These interviews were surreal .
I am honestly wondering if McCain is crazy like a fox or just plum crazy .
The case could be made for the former : Palin provided the social conservatives with red meat , she drew support and money from women and generally recharged the campaign .
Maybe McCain just used Palin as the campaign equivalent of the Dallas Cowgirls : someone who could get the crowd excited during the lull and then cartwheel off the field just in time for the actual players to come in and take care of business .

I have years experience with a neocon railroad executive , and they 're the most conservative men on the planet .
I do n't remember seeing one African American male in upper management at the lavish parties and gatherings .
Re : women , he said , " Women just ca n't cut the mustard but the law says we have to hire them and put them in high places .
Women are mere tokens in the corporate world . "
Maybe Republicans chose Palin knowing they can control her when / if McCain 's health fails , thinking her gender , looks and legs could compete with Hillary and get the women 's vote .
Women are n't stupid .
Republicans have lost touch with reality .
Their entire perception regarding the American People has been somehow clouded by an underlying religious perception or secret delusional Armageddon - bound army .
They 'll probably give her Karl Rove and David Addington as personal assistants , and then have a welcome mat in Alaska to endure the earth 's coming , final global battle .
Something like that , maybe ?
If they joke Obama is " The One , " then is Palin 's daughter " Virgin Mary ? "
Is this why they 're sensationalizing her daughter ?
Come on !
To Neocons , one winning race horse is worth more than 1000 American children born or unborn .
They have a distorted outlook , twisted values , and priority problems to be playing the God card .
Besides that , Fascists from both parties have been covering up crimes for fifty years or more .
When will they start telling the truth ?
After they drop the nuke somewhere and call it " Amageddon ? "

I know that there are dems and there are reps but when two non-partisan well - known professionals in performing their regular duties still manage to show what an incompetent , clueless , excuse for a vp then it is a frightening cause for concern .
Couric and Cafferty are not fresh faces that on occassion make mistakes or slips of the tongue , I commend them for their restraint and professionalism in having to report this as this is kids stuff , if they had been interviewing anyone else that behaved like this their reaction would not have been so restrained , they would have been sheep for the slaughter like every good journalist should in exposing the fakes .
I think Palin 's only ' stinking carcass ' is the end of her 15 minutes of fame .

I 'll admit , I was nervous when I heard Palin 's acceptance speech .
She deserves an Emmy for her performance , but , like John McCain and most Republicans I hear opening their mouth , there is no substance .
Her interview with Katie Couric really scares me , though !
Not because she is a , " 72 year old 's heartbeat away from being president ... " , but because there are a significant number of American voters who accept her and will vote for her to spite the Democrats .
Not to mention those people who are just " Palin " ignorant and believe anything negative about Sarah or McCain is propaganda .

The Dems are not gullible .
They work for the same people the Repugs do ( the corporations , Wall Street , the military industrial complex , lobbyists et al . )
How much more evidence does one need to see to understand this ?
We 've seen this since 2000 .
The day that most people finally realize who and what the Dems really are --- as opposed to what people want them to be and expect them to be --- will be the day that people stop asking " why are the Dems so gullible ? " or " Why are the Dems so spineless " or " Why are the Dems so weak ? "
Because none of that is true about the Dems , if one comes out of one 's Denial and finally sees the Dems for who and what they really are , and not what one wants them to be .
Because the latter is not going to happen .
Period .
That should be abundantly clear to most thinking people at this point in time .
The Dems have had a spine of STEEL for helping , enabling and being equally complicit with the illegitimate Bush regime and the Repugs since 2000 to guarantee that the Repugs / Bush / Cheney / Rove et al accomplish most of their anti-US Constitution / despicable goals since 2000 .
And the Dems have done a splendid job of helping Bush achieve most of his / Cheney 's / Rove 's goals since these Bush criminals stole the White House with the help of the Dems / Gore who refused to do all that they could have during the stolen 2000 " election . "
I mean , coward Al Gore did n't even have the courage to stand to contest the electoral college vote reading in January 2001 !
Sigh .
And wet - noodle Bush - enabler John Kerry could n't get to the microphone fast enough to concede to Bush during the stolen 2004 " election , " even though Edwards had said every vote would be counted .
Kerry was n't interested in counting votes .
He was n't interested in the job in the first place .
On a side note , I talked with a Bush / Cheney Repug relative recently .
We rarely discuss politics .
She brought up politics and she said : " these two parties are becoming one . "
I responded : ' Uh huh . '
But I was thinking :
Oh , you just now noticed that , did you ?
Where the hell have you been since 2000 ?
They became one in 2000 following the Judicial Coup .
I told you at a lunch date a couple of years ago that the " traditional " Democratic Party is DEAD .
Some people are slow .

With corrupt , fraudulent , easily - hackable electronic voting machines all over the nation , my vote ( if there is an " election " ) will likely get me the same thing your vote gets you .
I would think you would know that by now , considering the website you 're on .
You 're on one of the main websites that focuses on these damnable , easily - hackable electronic voting machines as well as fraudulent " elections . "
And the last 2 presidential " elections " were stolen .
So why would 2008 ( if there is an " election " ) be any different when the voting system is the same ?
Yet I sense from you that despite all that you STILL seem to think it would make a difference and that our votes will somehow be fairly and accurately counted regardless of which candidates we vote for .
Ha !
But , go ahead and think that just as you STILL think that the Dems are " gullible . "
LOL .
Even if we had fair , honest and legitimate " elections , " I would still be voting my conscience and for the candidates best for the nation / world : Nader / Gonzalez 2008 , if there is an " election . "
I want absolutely nothing to do with this corrupt , criminal , anti-US Constitution , pro-USAPATRIOT
Act , pro-torture , pro-spying , pro-war , pro-corporate , bankrupt Bush - enabling one - party " impeachment is off the table " system , charading as two parties .
And anyone STILL supporting this corporatist one - party system is serving as an enabler of all this shit as well .

That is so typical .

Palin 's interviews are just as hillarious as the Tina Fey skits .
The frightening thing , however , is that Palin is serious .
She 's not joking .
These are her actual responses to serious questions posed by so - called journalists in our failed forth estate , infotainers who are summarily just as terrified as we are that this numbskull stands a chance of having her finger near that blinking red button on Dick Cheney 's desk .
As much as I want to laugh , I can't help weeping bitterly .

How on Earth do you plan to change the dead Democratic Party from within when the very voting system that the public would vote on is fraudulent , corrupt and easily - hackable ?
No where in your comments do you say one word whatsoever about our fraudulent voting system yet you 're on the very site that focuses on it .
That 's incredible to me ... your Denial on this issue .
You give me the impression that you see nothing wrong with our voting system and that all votes are counted accurately and fairly to " change the Democratic party from within . "
Bull shit .
Do n't you read any of the articles that Brad writes or has written on e-voting ?
Or do you just ignore all those so you can continue to live in your comfortable Denial and pretend that a dead party can somehow be changed from within using a corrupt voting system that favors Repugs ?
Even if we had a fair , legitimate and honest voting system , it would be impossible to take over the dead Democratic Party .
And frankly , who the hell would want it or want any part of them !
To begin with , what 's left of this party does n't want to be taken over .
It enjoys being a Bush - enabler and Repug II .
And taking over the dead Democratic Party would be like me walking into Bechtel Corporation or Halliburton and trying to change them from within .
It ai n't going to happen .
Either I follow the " leadership " of the company or I 'm out the door .
Period .
With the corporatist congress , in order to have a successful career new people must follow the Bush - enabling so - called " leadership , " / DLC or the new politician is minimized like a Kucinich .

I just ca n't get why Katie did n't ask " ok , so if it 's the predatory lenders that are ' to blame ' , and you feel bad for the ' misinformed ' home owners , why are n't you in support of helping the victims ?
I mean , we can't do anything to the predatory lenders now that Wall Street bought and sold , over and over , those bad loans .. but we CAN help those homeowners while stabilizing the economy .. where do you stand on that ? " .
But .. no.. the media refuses to ask the TOUGH questions .. they simply show the ignorance of Palin to the smart people , who already get it .
G-d forbid they should make it OBVIOUS that the RIGHT - WING hates COMMONERS .
and , Floridiot , you know as well as Erma that the 2 party system is DOA .
The DNC went out of their way to keep Kucinich out of the limelight even though he _actually_ speaks more for the " average Dem " than Obama .. but Obama is a " company man " , Kucinich is just a good man .
It matters not how one votes .
Voting to put Obama in only extends the fleecing of America .
Putting McInsane in hastens it .
Much like letting Wall Street BURN with their poor choices , sometimes ripping off the band aid is better than slowly peeling it for hours .
If Obama wins , I 'll live in America for 2 more years until my kid graduates .. then look for an out .
If McInsane wins , I 'm getting my passport and looking for an out NOW ..
There 's no reason to think that the Ruling Elite are n't going to successfully turn America into a 3rd world nation sooner rather than later .

Savantster , I agree ... the fix is in .
It 's been in since 2000 .
The dead Democratic Party --- especially the so - called " leadership " --- has no interest whatsoever in being " changed from within . "
They know what they would have to do to be an " opposition party , " but they clearly have no interest in that otherwise they would vote in a unified block against the Repugs repeatedly .
And they would filibuster ( like Obama said he would do with FISA .
Remember ? )
Just like the Repugs do to the Dems regardless of whether the Repugs are in the minority or the majority .
The Repugs do n't care .
They get their shit through congress regardless of their majority or minority status in congress .
Remember with Bill Clinton ?
The Dems are quite comfortable where they are : as Bush - enablers .
It 's just that their gullible supporters need to realize who and what the Dems really are .
Unfortunately , that 's not likely to happen with most partisan D supporters because of partisan party - line programming instilled at an early age .

and again , THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A " LIBERAL MEDIA " , so no matter how many times you brainwashed rethuglicans spew it , does not make it so .
The vast majority of the MSM is extremely Reich wing and easily proven to be .

You are correct on one thing though .
Since the MSM IS extremely Reich Wing bias , they will cover up yet another stolen election just like they did in 2000 & 04 ' .
McSame probably will be the next pResident only because the S-election will be stolen AGAIN .
Gore won by over 1 /2 a million votes and easily won Florida by at least 80,000 + votes .
Kerry won by over 8 million votes .
The " Liberal Media " covered it all up .

Every where Obama goes he is getting between 20,000 up to 200,000 ( Germany ) people .
Over 30,000 + in Michigan yesterday .
Even in a traditionally Red state ( Virgina ) just recently there were over 26,000 at his rally IN THE POURING RAIN !
What is funny is when you see Reich wingers like this :
http://swacgirl.blogspot...t-mccain-rally-ever.html
Touting the " Largest McSame rally ever " !
also in Virgina was at most 20,000 and was his largest by far , was in a red state , was on a nice perfect sunny day , was with his miserable excuse of a VP which sadly brings more crowds than he does ( although thankfully that tide has turned now that they see she is insane ) .
Meanwhile about 2 weeks later Obama / Biden have a rally in Virgina , was pouring rain , was in a small venue that was over run with people where no more could even fit if they wanted to , over 26,000 people in a Red state in the rain .
http://www.huffingtonpos...000-virgin_n_129981.html
McSame rarely gets over a few thousand , some have had to be cancelled from the venues due to low turnout .
In some cases protesters outside would have out numbered the Rally crowd .
LOL http://thinkprogress.org...elling-fundraisng-event/
The only way he could manage to get some decent "
photo Ops " with larger crowds was to " crash " events like a Nascar race where everyone was there to watch the race and these idiots wonder up for a photo op .
McSame can barely fill a high school gym .
Obama regularly could fill a NFL stadium .
Clearly the polls are rigged in order to make it appear this race is close , obviously that is bullshit .
In reality I bet Obama is ahead by at least 15 - 20 % .
But when the MSM is busy covering up the election fraud and rigged polls , and the extreme Reich wing Christofascist are busy stealing the election then reality makes no difference .

Shock value is no qualification for Vice - President .

Well , many people ( Rs ) were willing to vote for this Bush and look at that damnable redneck dunce , the war criminal .
Blundering idiot .
And many suckers voted for him twice .
Many people can't conceive of voting anything other than how they were brought up to vote by their parents / guardians :
That party line crap .
That 's true for both D and R .
It 's part of most people 's programming .
Just like the hokus - pokus god superstitious shit .
Since the " election " ( if there is one ) will most likely be stolen ( just like 2000 / 2004 ) you would n't have to refer to either McCain or Palin with any title because they will both most likely be illegitimate .
I 've never referred to the current White House residents as " president " or " vice president " and never will because neither are legitimate .
Some so - called " liberals " / " progressives " started out referring to Bush as His Fraudulency and / or refusing to refer to him as " president " back in 2000 , but over the years they have caved .
Anyone surprised ?
So today , many so - called " liberals " / " progressives " refer to this piece of trash in the White House as " President " and they even use as capital P ( which denotes respect ) !
Ugh .
Makes me cringe every time I see that .
So one could just say McCain and Palin .
That would be sufficient and correct .

Speaking of signs , I remember when Traitor of the House Pelosi became speaker ( UGH ) and below her podium was a sign .
It was a blue sign and the design of it was identical to that of the Project For the New American Century ( PNAC ) design .
Same style .
At the time , I pointed that out to some people that the sign on her podium was strongly resembling the neocon 's PNAC design .
It was clearly a deliberate move ( to send a message to the neocons ) , based on her behavior / performance since then .
The useless piece of trash .
* Cindy Sheehan to replace Pelosi who is a Traitor to the US Constitution and her oath of office .
* Nader / Gonzalez 2008 , if there is an " election . "

Many people do .
Just because he still has a D behind his name is the only requirement for many people .
Then when someone starts rattling off the list of his pro FISA vote which shreds the US Constitution ( what 's left of it ) and his voting yes for all war appropriations ( while he postures as anti-war out of the other side of his mouth ) during the short time he 's been in the senate ( which has enabled Bush ) and his buying into Bush 's " war on terror " nonsense ( which enables Bush ) , and moving MORE troops into Afghanistan and his words about attacking Iran and Pakistan which really sound no different than Bush .... these things just for starters usually make most Barack people start squirming and getting defensive because they do n't want to hear the truth .
So you like Barack do you , which really sounds no different than Bush ?
And those things are the major components of Obama .
Some / many ( ? )
Barrack people have projected onto him ( this empty suit ) what they want him to be and do .
Wishful - thinking and false hope .
Good luck with that .
If this man were allowed to reside in the White House he will take orders from the corporations , Wall Street , the military industrial complex et al .... The same people the Bush regime and congressional scum answer to .
Got a e-mail from Cindy Sheehan earlier today .
The Dems voted FOR the bailout .
Anyone surprised ?
The Repugs voted against the bailout .
Quote :
As of this writing , the corporate welfare plan was rejected by the House of Reps .
It is a bad bill , and any of the amendments were only put there to try to pull the wool over our eyes .
Votes : Democrats : 141 voted " yea " and 94 voted " nay " Republicans : 65 voted " yea " and 133 voted " nay " So the bailout was rejected 227 to 206 ---- with Republicans killing it .
It is just " back to the drawing board " for the corporate elite : Pelosi , Reid , Hoyer , Boehner and Bush .. we still need to push for a bottom - up bailout !--- Cindy Sheehan End Quote

Barack has enabled the current Bush / Repug / Dem dictatorship with his yes votes , his complicity and his silence .
Most recently his FISA vote .
So I do n't know how on Earth anyone can write what you wrote and actually believe it , other than you 're living in Denial .
And what does Ralph Nader or Matt Gonzalez have to do with YOUR vote ?
Where does that thinking come from ?
Your Obama could have " been a sport " and endorsed Nader / Gonzalez if Obama were serious and sincere about legitimate positive change .
And Ralph is just trying to win an " election " just like your Obama .
You do n't seem clear on the concept .
And now your precious Dems have voted FOR the corporate bail out .
Transferring wealth to a few wealthy individuals .
And you STILL support these useless and worthless Bush - enabling Dems ?
Incredible .
We got where we are together by people / sheep voting this " lesser of two evils " bull shit .

We already have the GOP and that will remain so .
Period .
First off , you sound just like Floridiot .
You 're on this website which focuses on these damnable easily - hackable electronic voting machines which are all over the nation yet you make it sound like we have fair and legitimate " elections " when we do n't .
I 'm now beginning to question how many people on here actually believe what Brad reports on when it comes to this e-voting topic .
The last two presidential " elections " were stolen , so why would you think that 2008 ( if there is an " election " ) would be any different when the voting system is the same corrupt , fradulent system ?
We will continue with the GOP regardless of whether the candidate has a D or an R behind his name .
Obama is a pro-war corporatist Republican when the truth be told .
The same for McCain .
As I have said previously , the GOP gets their shit rammed through congress whether they are in the MINORITY or the majority .
The same cannot be said about your beloved Dems ( who spits in your face repeatedly and then you hug them ... talk about a dysfunctional relationship ! ) .
I want Nader / Gonzalez .
I do n't want the status quo and that 's what one will get with either your Obama or McCain .
And before someone chimes in with that " What about the Supreme Court , what about the Supreme Court ? " pabulum ...
The DEMS helped give us Alito and Roberts .
They were not required to vote for either , but to enable Bush they did .
So one can flush that Supreme Court argument down the toilet where it belongs .
And does anyone honestly believe that an Obama or McCain would nominate a " progressive " candidate to the Supreme Court ?
And do you really think that this Bush - enabling Senate would confirm a " progressive " candidate ?
LOL .
Yeah right .

I 'm not playing your game .
I 've already made myself quite clear as to my intention .
If you want to vote for Walk on Water Obama ( assuming there is an " election " ) , and you 've bought into his " hope and change " bullshit then you are certainly free to do so .
I have no intention whatsoever of doing so .
I will vote my own choice which I 've already stated ( if there is an " election " ) .
Voting or not voting is a personal choice .
No one should tell anyone else how to vote .
And no one should feel pressured in their vote just because " everybody 's doing it " like a bunch of sheep .
I want who I will be voting for , if there is an " election . "
Not that my vote OR YOURS ( or anyone else 's ) will be accurately counted on this fraudulent , corrupt , easily - hackable voting system .
To me , it is a given that McCain / Palin will be selected , mainly because they have a R behind their name .
Walk on Water Obama could be allowed to occupy the White House , if he has convinced the Bush regime that he will continue their anti-US Constitution agenda and their dictatorship .
And with his recent FISA vote that could likely be his signal to them .
Add to the pile all of his war talk , " war on terror " nonsense and other neocon rhetoric .
He also has bought into the official " 911 " story / lies .
Now , after we get past the " election " charade of it all , will the current occupants leave in January ?
As I 've said before , I 'll believe they are leaving when I see them leave .
I do n't think they are going anywhere .
There 's that Directive 51 they put in place .
I talked with a relative the other day who said she did n't think they were going anywhere either , to my surprise .
I never expected her to say that .

" I think we 're on the same side , we just have different ideas on how to get to the same place . "
The fundamental underlying issue is that we are given false choices in our electoral process .
Obama , while coming across as the MUCH better choice , is STILL a institutional tool .
He 's no " progressive " and he's no " liberal " and he's no " traditional Democrat " ... but , he's what the party has put out there , and he looks SOOOOO much better tan the " right - wing death trap " that 's being proposed .
But Erma 's point , and what is lost on most people is , Obama is still a team player of those looking to loot this country .
He 's no better than Bill Clinton with his NAFTA and his signing on to the Glasser removal which helped precipitate this current financial collapse .
They are ALL GLOBALISTS , and EVERY honest economist will tell you that we 're in uncharted water here .
Economics was never about looking into a " global perspective " .
America as we know it MUST DIE for GLOBALIZATION to be realized .
The people that own the Federal Reserve also own the major International Banks .
They stand to control just about everything once we fully go " global " , and Obama is content to usher that in .
Sure , he 's also trying to mitigate the damage to Americans , but that 's a pipe dream .
Here are some facts that you have to consider .
America is 7 % of the world 's population .
America consumes 40 % of the planets resources .
75 % of the planet 's population ( I 'm pulling that from my ass , but with China and India being near 50 % of the pop , I think I 'm close ) want to " live like Ameircans " .
That means we would need over 400 % of the resources we currently have .
Guess what .
Americans WILL become a 3rd world nation simply because that 's the ONLY way to " spread it all around " .
The ruling elite are trying to make sure THEY lose nothing in this .
And the Rethuglicunts are doing their damnedest to facilitate that .
Obama is trying to mitigate the pain .
Neither party at this point is trying to " save America " .
Reversing NAFTA , killing the Federal Reserve , restricting international trading .. those are what we need to do to keep Americans employed .
But 90 % of all politicians do n't see that , they see their 10s of millions tied up in stocks and bonds in the " market " and only want to improve bottom lines .
.... only about 45 % of America is vested in the market .. that leaves the MAJORITY of Americans NOT benefitting from " globalization " .
The 2 party system has failed us .
America will be destroyed , and there is nothing you can do about it .
Our Democracy is dead ( this site proves it with each new story about electronic voting and our usurped voting rights ) .
The ruling elite ( read : Congress and their big money bakers ) are all multi-millionaires , all with portfolios of 10s of millions of dollars , that 's the top 5 % or so .
One of the only " average " Reps is Kucinich , and the DEMOCRATIC PARTY shut him down .
While this current election might be about " how do we not shrivel up tomorrow " , the question of " how do we get back on track " is not being presented in the currently rigged game .
.... that 's Erma 's point , and I agree .

The big money people will always win , you just have to decide where your priorities lie because without them there will be no jobs .
You either lean towards fairness , or you lean towards Fascism that 's all there is .
If you do n't know who " Jo Bunker " are , you do n't know that history is actually a pretty good compass as to where we are headed .
1786 : The only legislature that was not subject to this appeal of fear in this way was that of Rhode Island , where the same elements as carried on the Shays Rebellion were now in actual control of the legislature .
Accordingly the Rhode Island legislature , realizing that the proposed convention was nothing more than an attempt to organize a coup by which the Cincinnati could take power , refused to have anything to do with the proposed convention ; from which arises the fact that the present Constitution of the United States had no signatures from Rhode Island .
It goes on to say at how Rhode Island was starved out in the end .
I ain't holding it against you for trying to change the way things are but you need a little perspective to see what you 're actually up against and how it turns out .

I do n't believe you said that ON THIS SITE OF ALL SITE !
No , it is NOT our choice .
We have absolutely no control over the nation 's corrupt , fraudulent , easily - hackable electronic voting machines no matter how one votes .
One does not know that one 's vote is being counted fairly and accurately , or counted at all .
Just as one example , did you not read and comprehend the story Brad wrote where his votes were flipped in Los Angeles ?
Or did you think he made the whole thing up ?
Or did you completely ignore his story because it had to do with " boring voting machines which I have no interest in because I do n't really believe that stuff .... I think it 's loony conspiracy theorist stuff even though I comment on his site all the time I just ignore all that nonsense . "
Well , here 's the link to his article in case you ignored it :
https://bradblog.com/?p=6043
Again , you seem / appear to be living under the illusion that we have fair , honest and legitimate elections .
WE DON'T .
Do you not believe ANYTHING that Brad has on this site regarding the easily - hackable electronic voting machines ?
You 've not said one word in any of your comments about them or the corrupt voting system in any of your comments .
And I find that astounding .
You and others could be on any other blog ( where the people there live in Denial about our corrupt voting system ) .
But you are on a blog that specifically focuses on this topic .
Yet at least to me , I get no sense from you that this e-voting topic is even in your mind or a passing concern .
None .
Then you wrote : " You either lean towards fairness , or you lean towards Fascism that 's all there is . "
Are you referring to Walk on Water Obama as " fairness " and McCain as " fascism , " by chance ?
Pssssssst :
Are you not aware that Obama voted for fascism with his FISA vote which shreds the US Constitution ?
Or are you going to make an excuse and apology for that , like Dem koolaid drinkers like to do ?
Jesus fuking christ .
Where do some people come from ?
I do n't say what I 'm about to say too often :
It was all over for this nation the night of the 2000 Judicial Coup .
Period .
Done .
Finished .
And I 'm not the only person who says this .
So whatever you are hanging onto , you 're wasting your time .
It 's over .
It 's been over .
Ever since the night of the 2000 Judicial Coup things have only gotten worse with every passing day in this nation with the help of the Repugs , Bush / Cheney / Rove et al and the Bush - enabling Dems .
The night of the Judicial Coup I told the people around me : " It 's all over .
If these Bush people will steal an election ( with the help of the Dems ) , they will do ANYTHING . "
And they have .
And will continue to do so .
That 's why I do n't think they are going anywhere in January .
And even if they do , NOTHING is going to change of substance regardless of how much false hope and delusional wishful - thinking one engages in .
It is absolute bull shit for anyone to think at this point in time that it is " our choice , " when the very voting system is fradulent and corrupt .
And I would not have expected to read such drivel on here .
Assuming there is an " election , " the final vote tally can be made to look however " the people behind the curtain " choose to make it look ( most likely we will be told by the corporate media that " it 's close " at 51 % to 49 % ) regardless of voter turnout or how people actually vote .
( When , not if , voters have the same experience Brad had ... see the link above ) .
We will be told a tally but that does n't mean anything .

Floridiot ,
On reflection , maybe somebody else would be interested in hearing the answer to my question I posed to you in Comment # 61 , but I 'm no longer interested .
It does n't make any difference to me at this point .
It is impossible to have a discussion with someone who ignores most of what one writes ( other than the rigged " election " part ) .
You did n't respond to anything else I wrote in Comment # 59 or in any other comments for that matter .
All you could do was to issue an ordering " Get with it " which is just meaningless pabulum .
So , I 'm not interested in any further discussion with you on any topic .
I see I 'm wasting my time .
I like people who are able to talk and communicate and write something , versus glib one liners and 1 - 2 short sentences as a response , which do n't really tell me anything .

The plan , as I understand it , is to make them steal our votes , and the more votes you make them steal from the lesser of two evils , the better chance you have of busting them .
It ain't much , for sure , but your bit about Nader does n't address it at all .
Not at all . "
I 've already addressed that in a previous comment I 'm sure .
I 'm voting my conscience .
Will they steal my vote for Nader / Gonzalez ?
Probably .
But I 'm still voting my conscience regardless .
Do I think that my vote for Nader / Gonzalez will be fairly and accurately counted ?
No , not necessarily .
There 's not much more to explain about that really .
They do with votes whatever they so choose to do with votes , including the votes for Nader / Gonzalez .
These scum do n't need to be " made to steal votes . "
It 's a given .
And they are not going to be busted anymore than they were in 2000 or 2004 or the " elections " in between .
Most people still think we have fair and honest elections and when most people think that , no one is going to be busted .

Since the consensus seems to be that it will be Republicans stealing votes again this time , rest assured they 're not going to steal yours .
Yours helps them .
They prefer you do n't vote at all , but voting for someone who takes votes away from the " liberal " is hunky - dory by them .
You are in all probability right about no one going to be busted ... unless there 's a revolution ... or someone gives Brad and Steve and the rest of the gang badges ....

A Clarification : " I 'm voting my conscience " .... meaning I think that Nader / Gonzalez would be best for the nation and the world .
That 's why I 'm voting for them , whether my vote is fairly or accurately counted or not .
My vote has nothing whatsoever to do with the " election " being stolen or it being a given to me that it will be stolen .
I 'm still voting my conscience regardless .
Even if " we " knew for a certainty that the " election " would be completely legitimate and all votes would be fairly and accurately counted , I would still be voting for Nader / Gonzalez .

I think what I 'm trying to say and Floridiot is trying to say is : since the elections are rigged , and the whole process of getting elected is rigged , the ONLY way you can make your vote count is to help landslide someone beyond what they have rigged against them .
Our point is that they 've actually made it so that voting your conscience , looking for the most decent person to run things and voting for him or her , is detrimental to everyone .

" The big money people will always win , you just have to decide where your priorities lie because without them there will be no jobs .
You either lean towards fairness , or you lean towards Fascism that 's all there is . "
Seriously , these are false dichotomies , and are why this country is failing .
First , it 's not " big money " that creates jobs , it 's people filling a need that 's too big for them to do it themselves so they hire someone to help .
Jobs are created because there 's demand of " something " , and the " big money " does n't create that demand , they are currently the ones filling it .
If we lived in a real Capitalistic society , anyone that wanted to produce something ( or provide a service ) would have access to the capital they needed to do it .
Hence , to assure that anyone that has an idea ( we 'll go so far as to say a reasonable plan ) , the Government must be willing to step in when " big money " will not .
Without new little guys out there , we have monopolies and that 's bad .
And since in America it 's getting harder and harder to start up a decent company ( ca n't compete with all the very cheap labor in China and India , which is why we need to redo our " trade " agreements to stop favoring big money ) , we are getting farther and farther from a functioning Capitalism .
Then you offer only 2 choices .. toward fairness or toward fascism .
What about toward progressive policies ?
In THEORY , we can vote for whom ever we want , and whom ever gets the most votes WINS .
So , if the " people " want a progressive leadership , they vote for that change .
In our current rigged system , they select so we can elect .
We are n't given " real " competing choices , so playing along in the game is to give up your _real_ " choice " and simply play their game .
All the many years of playing the game has gotten us here , to this dead end .
Our Founding
Fathers were given a choice at one point , too .
Bow to the Crown or be destroyed .
They chose neither , and here we are .
I do n't have any false illusions about where we are today .
And I do n't support good cop over bad cop , that wo n't ever bring about the change we need .
The " change " candidate was Kucinich , and his PARTY shut him down .
And if I had to chose between having a band aid ripped off fast , or slowly peeled ..
I 'll go for the fast rip every time .
McInsane / Failin '08 !
Let 's get this ball rollin ..
I 'd like to get this mess cleaned up before my child graduates college so she can live in a sane country with a fair and functioning economy .. and that ain't gonna happen if we stretch this out any more .
Get McInsane in there and let 's burn this bitch down so we can rebuild it sooner rather than later .
Snark off , I do n't think McInsane will win , and if he did , I do n't think the moron masses in America would wake up when it all goes up in flames .
Wanna know why ?
... I work with a fairly smart woman who 's 100 % Republican .
Today she said " we need to keep religion out of politics " .. " Good " , I thought ..
Then 5 minutes later , while talking about the 100 million folks in America that are suffering day to day and struggling to get by and how the Ultra Rich would n't miss some of their ill gotten gains and how much that could help the lowly masses .. she said " but how do we know that those people are n't suffering as part of g - d's plan ? " ...... fucking wow .
So , to sum up .. the right - wing , the christo - fascists , feel it 's a- ok for people to starve in the streets because , hey .. that might just be part of g-d 's plan ..
after all , the " better off " have been chosen by g-d too , then , by that logic .. right ?
So , the ruling elite and the middle class right - wing fucktards are all chosen by g-d , and those suffering are simply adhering to g-d 's plan .
I guess the part of their book where jesus said " as you do unto the least of these , you do unto me " just does n't matter .. cause letting the suffer is n't the same as letting g-d suffer , even though he said it was .
No , Floridiot .. we 're quite fucked .
Slowing it down , voting toward fairness , that 's the gimick .
The reality is that it wo n't matter much .
Obama has shown he 's a company man with his FISA support and the bailout support without massive constraints on companies .. demanding insurance on kids ( that 's going to be a strain on a lot of people ) instead of universal health care .. he 's anti-equal rights for gays ..
He 's no real Democrat , he 's a centrist that now looks like a Dem .
And , as Erma points out , we need to vote our conscience .
They have us convinced to vote their game , and that 's a losing bet in the long run .
Obama is 100 % a globalist , and that 's bad for Americans .
Great for the big money , though .

Look , I agree with Erma and everyone in the vote your conscience crowd .
I 'm out of my mind livid about this filthy state of affairs .
Obama 's positions are ultimately not great for this country .
When the globalists figure out how to protect the workers in this big corporate bonanza , then fine , but until then , it 's just suicide .
Quick suicide if you vote Republican or third party and slow suicide with the shred of a hope to live if you vote Democratic .
I want a goddam revolution very badly , but failing that , the absolute best anyone can do for the hungry and homeless here , and maybe even those we 're slaughtering elsewhere , is to vote by the bajillions for Obama .
I positively hate the Democrats for doing this to us , and they are as guilty of it as the Republicans .
I went to the Registrar 's office to make sure there was absolutely no chance there would be any mistaking that I am 100 % no longer in that party .
I think Nader is an ass .
I would LOVE to vote for Cynthia McKinney .
She 's the only one with the courage , the integrity and the selflessness needed in a president .
But the fuckers are rigging the elections by a thousand nefarious means , and the only hope of keeping outright criminals out of the White House , and doing the best we can for our suffering brothers and sisters , is to vote for Obama , whether we 're Democrats , Republicans , Independents or Greens .
THERE IS NO GETTING AROUND THAT , UNLESS WE RISE UP .
I console myself that it is a big step , the biggest step , for Martin 's dream , and that the rest of the world will instantly cease hating us so much if we manage to out - vote the rigged election and put him in the White House .

Well , to me it's a given that McCain / Palin will be selected since they officially have a R behind their name .
But Walk on Water Obama may be allowed to have it .
They let the Dems have the 2006 " election " most likely because they knew that nothing was going to change by letting the Dems have the majority .
And nothing has changed for the positive .
The same could be true with Obama .
That they know that he will continue their neocon PNAC agenda .
He 's certainly shown indications and neocon rhetoric that he will do just that despite all of people 's dreamland wishful - thinking and false hope that they have in this man .
But your comment is very similar to what Mike Malloy said a couple of months ago on his show , and he received lots of criticism from the Dem kool - aid drinkers also .
Some people even threatened to cancel or did cancel their Nova M membership .
Some listeners --- who do n't listen well --- somehow heard Mike say to vote for McCain .
Mike never said that .
What he did say was " let McCain have it . "
Malloy said " Let McCain have it .... do you really think Obama is going to be able to clean up this mess ?!
No , let McCain have it with a veto - proof congress . "
LOL .
A veto - proof congress , eh ?
Yeah , that 's likely to happen all right .
Have another hit .
And Malloy never explained how the veto - proof congress was to come about .
But after McCain chose Palin , Malloy started drinking the Dem kool - aid once again --- it does n't take him much to start sipping that kool - aid --- and now he intends to vote for Walk On Water Obama .
He thought that Biden was a pathetic choice ( which he was ) for Obama to choose .
Malloy is not a strong Obama / Biden supporter , but clearly Malloy prefers to stay in this rut of the " lesser of two evils " nonsense that helped get us where we are in the first place .
I want no part of that rut .
Been there .
Done that and not about to do it again as I see where it 's gotten us .
We hear this " lesser of two evils " fear - card nonsense every " election " cycle without fail .
It 's used as the tired excuse for staying in this rut by those who do n't have the courage to vote their conscience and instead vote out of fear .

Sadly Erma is 100 % correct .
There is no such thing as " making them steal our votes " that 's pure bull pucky .
Fact of the matter that it is just as easy to steal 20 Million votes as it is to steal 20 .
In fact they have already stolen the election a year ago when the MSM steered and manipulated everyone to believe that Obama & Clinton were the Democratic front runners .
In all of the early polls Kucinich was clearly in the lead until the media went to work on him .
So the real front runner , the real peoples choice has already been taken out of the picture .
Ron Paul was the clear front runner on the Rethug side .
Also if EVERYBODY voted their conscience then a REAL candidate would be elected , someone like Kucinich or McKinney , even Nader .
NOT voting your conscience is why we are FUBAR .
I have voted my conscience for the last 3 elections and will continue to do so until the vast majority of IDIOTS catch up to the reality of what is happening and stop voting for the slightly lesser of 2 insane evils .
Basically everyone ignorant enough to vote either Democrat or Rethug is simply proving Einstein correct .
“ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results ” .
I am not insane .
I vote Green Party .
If everybody voted Green then McKinney would win .
The old do n't vote 3rd party because if you do then a freaked out Christofascist NeoNazi will win is pure BS .
These bastards are going to steal the damn election because of 2 reasons .
The vast majority of us are way to weak & scared to do a GD damn thing about it even when 10s of millions of us all know the last 2 elections were blatantly stolen we did NOTHING .
And way too many have been brainwashed into believing that voting your conscience means that the most evil SOB will always win .
Personally I am embarrassed to be called American .
When I travel I have Canadian stickers on my suitcase and a say " Eh ? " a lot .
I rarely if ever disagree with 99 but this time I have to .

That 's something of an overstatement , but basically true .
The thing is :
We have seen that they have to PLAN how many they need to steal in advance , and if they fall short , they lose , even with the votes they stole .
THAT is why making them steal your vote matters in the real world , and idealistically speaking , it also matters not to just cave to their perfidy , to fight them .
They very desperately do n't want us voting at all , but they will be thrilled if we punch our tickets for Cynthia or Ralph or Ron or ANYBODY who is n't Obama .
And about being embarrassed to be an American ... sheesh ... tell me about it ....

Hmm after re-reading 99's last post again I actually understand your position better .
I take back 99 % of what I said in previous post about disagreeing with you .
The only thing I take issue with is just whether or not stealing 20,000 votes or 20 million is going to make any difference .
They stole at least 8 Million votes from Kerry in 04 ' without even batting an eyelash .
I am rather certain that Obama is ahead ( if a REAL poll was taken ) by at least 15 % not 5 % .
Its not going to make any difference .
The only way Obama gets in is if he sells his soul to the top 2 % of the cretins that really run this country .
If he does he wont be much better than McSame .
If he agrees and then reneges after he is " allowed " to win then they will just assassinate him .
It is a lose / lose situation and the ONLY thing that will bring real change is for We the People to TAKE this country back .
The only way that is ever going to happen is if we hit absolute rock bottom 3rd world status .

We have to make a better world , and they are not going to take to it willingly .
I honestly do n't see why the big boys would object to Obama as president .
He will do what they want .
But there is a whole layer of damn rich , so damn powerful , criminals now , who are big enough boys to insist on continuing ... with the hope of prevailing .

She 's a bizarre combo of

She sounds like a 14 - year - old kid , and is a half - step away from chirping , " Like , you know , so they go , like , ' Whatever , ' like , you know ... "
-- Assertive Nothingness ... that bizarre assertiveness - training ( or sales ) tactic in which the speaker yammers along in stream - of - consciousness style , allows no interruption , and does n't say a damned thing :
It 's all modifiers and dependent clauses and circularity , with no subject / object / meaning .
And worse , she 's not even good at THIS stuff , since she sputters along as if she 's uncomfortable speaking whole sentences , has no " organizing principle " in her head , and is just stringing together ( and repeating , and repeating ) a handful of cheat - sheet phrases , regardless of relevance .

I think that 's more wishful - thinking .
I suspect most people will say " get over it . "
That 's what I was told when I was in the streets with about ONLY 100 people in my major city following the 2000 stolen " election . "
Most people could n't be bothered .
2004 was stolen and most people just accepted that .
John Kerry could n't get to the microphone fast enough to concede to Bush .
There were no protests in the streets .
If there is " blood in the streets " that might be when martial law is declared and Directive 51 crops up and in a chain of events Bush / Cheney declare they are NOT leaving in January , as has been my suspicion since 2000 .
Would n't surprise me in the least .
And if some god were going to " help the USA " we would n't be in this dismal state to begin with .
And if one must drag out the god card , ask this god to " bless the world " not just the States .

Thanks 99 , I did n't know we were still posting way the hell down here anymore .

I have no idea if it is true or not but he seems to have a lot of knowledge of what was really going on back then , not the shit that the elites made up for our history textbooks in our schools today .
It is more of a perspective of what the regular people were fighting for back before the Constitution was was written .
( or if it was another Patriot Act type thing , who knows ? ) during the time when the Articles of Confederation were in force .

Definition of the term Outline of why it is important Geometric Interpretation
The geometric interpretation of a matrix property or theorem is generally described for 2 or 3 dimensions .
Words prefixed by + should be altered appropriately for other dimensions .
Thus the word + area should be replaced by volume for 3 - D spaces and by hyper - volume for larger spaces .
List of properties and theorems :
Theorems apply to real matrices or complex matrices of arbitrary shape unless explicitly stated .
Most but not all theorems are also true for matrices whose elements are from other fields ; in particular fields with characteristic 2 cause many properties to fail because x = - x does not imply x = 0 .
Matrix dimensions are assumed to allow the sums and products in a theorem .
If a theorem explicitly involves inv( A ) or division by A , then A is assumed to be non-singular .

If all matrices , vectors and scalars in a theorem are of a particular form , the theorem is prefaced thus : [ Real ] or [ Complex n#n ] .

A matrix can be specified explicitly by listing its elements and using a semicolon to separate each row .
Thus [ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ] is a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns .
This notation can be used to compose large matrices from smaller ones : [ A B ; C D ] .

I hate to be the guy that laughs every time some poor high school kid gets violated by some other kid or group of kids that think , " Hey , if I could stick something in this kid 's ass , why , that would just be fantastic ! "
Where 's the logic ?
It 's not that these things are suddenly happening out of nowhere , it 's that we 're finally hearing about them .
All of them .
But I 'm telling you something you already know .
The alleged assault took place in Las Vegas , New Mexico , at one of those sleepover football camps .
I guess what happens in Vegas does n't really stay in Vegas .
Even if you try to jam it up there with a broomstick .
New Mexico State Police are investigating possible criminal wrongdoing , a spokesman said , while the owner of the camp in Gallinas Canyon said investigators visited a couple of the bunkhouses on Friday afternoon where the students stayed .
At least one student alleged that he was pinned to the ground and sodomized with a broomstick — an accusation that district superintendent Rick Romero said appeared to be mostly false , although he said “ part ” of the allegation could be true .
What did occur is still unclear , Romero said , but it seemed to have involved some form of hazing or initiation in which some students were held down against their will .
“ The district is investigating acts of misconduct , ” Romero told the Journal .
Romero took over as the head of Las Vegas City Schools this summer .
The body count so far : six players , five coaches and one AD suspended .
This is what happens when you leave broomsticks in open areas around high schoolers .
You did n't think they were going to sweep the place , did you ?

Washington D.C. is the capital of the United States and home to many senators and congressional members who espouse anti-queer views .
However , the District of Columbia is heavily democratic and now it looks like marriage equality may be in the locales near future .
According to the Washington Blade :
" If Democrats expand their majority in Congress and California voters uphold same - sex marriage , a gay marriage bill is likely to be approved by the D.C. City Council as early as April 2009 , according to activists and City Hall insiders .
With Mayor Adrian Fenty and at least 10 of the Council ’s 13 members committed to passing a same - sex marriage bill , local activists and city officials have long said the only factor holding back such a bill has been the fear that Congress would invoke its powers to overturn it . "
Right now we need to work very hard to ensure the election of democrats to both houses , we must win the battle against proposition 8 in California .
We also can start preparing for the fight in D.C. although legislation is not yet on the table we must contact the three council members who are still up in the air as to their vote on same - sex marriage .
These members are not anti-gay and are debating whether to vote for marriage , so please politely urge them that when the bill comes up for a vote that they should vote in favor of equality .
Below are the 3 council members who we need to urge to vote in favor of marriage equality in Washington D.C.Councilmember Marion Barry ( D - Ward 8 ) mbarry@dccouncil.us Councilmember Carol Schwartz ( R ) At - Large carol.schwartz@dc.gov

Oral arguments in the case of Dr. Rafil Dhafir and the Help the Needy charity will be heard at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City on August 28th , 2008 , at 10:00 a.m. , Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse , 500 Pearl Street , New York .
Almost five and a half years to the day that he became the first and only U.S. citizen jailed for resisting U.S. economic sanctions against the people of Iraq , Dr Rafil Dhafir , a Syracuse oncologist who helped raise almost $ 5 million in humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people , will have his appeal heard at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City .
Sanctions initiated against Iraq in 1991 were the most severe in human history , and resulted in the premature deaths of well over a million Iraqi people .
The American government 's refusal to lift them , despite worldwide appeals , led to the high - profile resignations of UN humanitarian coordinators Denis Halliday and Hans Von Sponeck .
When Halliday resigned in 1998 , he stated : " I 've been using the word ' genocide ' because this is a deliberate policy to destroy the people of Iraq .
I 'm afraid I have no other view . "
The sanctions also drew a memorable response from Bill Clinton 's Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright who , when asked on the CBS program 60 Minutes in the mid 1990s if the sanctions - related deaths of a half million Iraqi children were worth it , replied , " We think the price is worth it . "
It is against this backdrop that numerous groups from around the globe gathered funds and humanitarian supplies to be delivered directly to the people of Iraq , completely bypassing the regime of Saddam Hussein .
Dr. Dhafir 's charity , Help the Needy , was founded in the1990s to buy food , clothing , and medical supplies .
For 13 years he worked tirelessly to help publicize the plight of the Iraqi people , personally donating $ 1.4 million of his own money to the charity .
As an oncologist , he was also concerned about the effects of depleted uranium on the Iraqi population which was experiencing skyrocketing cancer rates .
But Dr. Dhafir and Help the Needy came under the gun sights of the Bush administration that , following the events of September 11 , 2001 , raided and closed down six major and many smaller Muslim charities , accusing each of funding terrorism .
In each case , alleged " guilt by association " meant that the charities � assets were frozen and their principals arrested .
Yet despite new investigative powers , government authorities have failed to produce evidence of terrorist financing by any of these Muslim charities .
Arrested just weeks before the start of the Iraq war , the federal government repeatedly pitched this case as one that had national security implications , and Dr. Dhafir was held without bail for 31 months .
This denial of bail greatly impeded his legal defense , yet no charges related to terrorism were ever filed , nor were any links to terrorists proven .
Unable to get Dr. Dhafir to accept a plea agreement , the government piled on the charges and , after a lengthy trial , he was found guilty on 59 counts of ; violating federal regulations related to economic sanctions imposed against Iraq , money laundering , mail and wire fraud , tax evasion , visa fraud -- all related to running the charity -- and Medicare fraud .
He is the only person ever to be incarcerated for violating the Iraq sanctions .
" Each year , the U.S. Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control collects millions of dollars in penalties from American Corporations who have violated these sanctions ( from oil companies , banks , food and beverage companies , and entertainment companies ) , " says Katherine Hughes of the Dr. Dhafir Support Committee .
" No executive of any such corporation has faced criminal charges .
Individuals , businesses , and organizations that have openly defied the sanctions have faced only fines .
Criminal prosecutions have only been made against Muslims and people of Middle Eastern origin accused of violating these economic sanctions .
And unlike those corporations , there was no profit motive in Dr. Dhafir 's case . "
On the day of Dr. Dhafir�s sentencing the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) issued a statement that said ,
" Every person charged with a crime in the US deserves and is entitled to fair and equal treatment under the law .
In many ways , Dr. Dhafir was presumed guilty long before the trial began , and of much more than indicated by the charges filed against him .
For the NYCLU , this case raises serious questions as to whether Muslims accused or charged with crimes in the US can truly receive a fair trial .
Our government should not tout the conviction of Dr. Dhafir or the harsh sentence imposed by the court as a ' win , � or as any kind of advancement in national security .
When ' justice� is pursued with religious and ethnic prejudice , and through actions that intimidate and isolate an entire community , there is no victory - there can be no advancement in national security , or faith in the promise of equal treatment under law . "
The Dr. Dhafir Support Committee hopes that Dr. Dhafir will find justice through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .
Dr. Dhafir is currently incarcerated in the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute , Indiana .

This website was set up to publicise the campaign to prevent the deportation of Hicham Yezza ( Hich to his many friends ) .
Hicham has lived in Nottingham for 13 years while he studied for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and worked at the university , where he has built up a large network of close friends .
The huge campaign to prevent his deportation is a testament to this .
He served as a member of the University Senate for two terms ( 2004 - 5 ) and on the Student ’s Union Executive Committee , was President of the Arabic Society , was the editor of the influential Voice magazine for international students , and is the long - time editor of Ceasefire magazine , a political journal .
He was a prominent member of the artistic group ‘ Al - Zaytouna ’ , and weeks before his arrest performed the leading role in a feature play at Nottingham Arts Theatre .
Numerous references have been collected from reputable professors and prominent members of the local and national community that testify to his integrity and strong roots in the city .
He lives and works in Nottingham and has shown every intention of fighting his case , as he thinks he has excellent grounds to remain in the U.K .
His deportation follows his arrest under the Terrrorism Act 2000 .
This occurred after Rizawaan Sabir , a student acquaintance who was studying political Islam emailed a copy of an Al Qaeda training manual he was using for his research to Hich as Rizwaan could n’t afford to print it .
After the document was seen , the police were called .
They arrested Hich and Rizwaan , searched their homes , seized their computers and interrogated friends and family .
Both were released without charge and the university has subsequently been forced to admit that the documents were legitimate research material .
Despite his innocence , Hich was immediately re-arrested under immigration legislation on charges which he sought legal advice and representation over .
However on Friday May 23 his solicitor was told that Hich was being deported and he was moved to a detention centre .
It is clear from Hicham ’s legal documentation that there could be no reason to disallow him bail and push for his removal before his set trial date , except that the immigration services are determined to remove him without allowing him due process .
The circumstances of Hich ’s initial arrest sparked widespread protest from students and academics , and extensive critical media coverage .
Many people have drawn a link between this and the authorities ’ hurried attempts to remove him from the country .
Regardless of whether this is a politically motivated action or not , it is clear that he has not been given the chance to argue his case in court , which he his perfectly happy to do .
Most humans do not have the power to predict the future , but we can see it .
At least we can see one - tenth of a second of it .
The May - June issue of the journal Cognitive Science published a review by Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , claiming that the human visual system has evolved to allow us to see fractions of a second into the future .
When light hits our retina , it takes approximately 100 milliseconds , or one - tenth of one second , for our brain to perceive an image .
While it seems insignificant , the delay is consequential when dealing with moving objects .
Changizi uses the examples of walking through a crowd or catching a ball to illustrate the significance : A person moving at a slow walk can move at least 10 centimeters forward in one - tenth of one second .
A ball passing one meter away from you , traveling at one meter per second , moves six degrees from where you perceive it , in one - tenth of a second .
We must anticipate and compensate for these delays in perception , or humans would constantly be running into each other , and we could never play baseball .
Many scientists and theorists have hypothesized that humans ’ motor systems compensate for this delay in visual processing by adjusting our movements .
Changizi , however , theorizes that it is the visual system that compensates for the delay , effectively generating images of what will occur one - tenth of a second into the future .
This way , we are able to continually view the world in the present , rather than seeing what happened one - tenth of a second ago .
His theory is called “ perceiving the present . ”
The same ability , he explains , is what allows our brains to be tricked by optical illusions .
Many geometric illusions trick our mind into thinking we are moving forward .
Changizi explains that the illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future , but the perceptions do not match reality .
There are four main types of misperception : size , speed , contrast , and perceived distance .
Optical illusions affect one or more of these misperceptions .
Based on these hypotheses , Changizi was able to arrange more than 50 types of optical illusions into 28 classes , organized in a 7 x 4 matrix .
This classification is able to predict how variables , such as size or distance from a center point , will affect perception .
Other scientists have tried to explain one or two illusions , but no one has been able to devise a unified theory to explain this many illusions .
This new evolutionary theory about the visual system may have applications in enhancing visual displays or art , but it may also help scientists to explain the mechanisms of our visual system .

The Universe …
The incredible difference in scale between the tiny world we live in every day and the vastness of all time and space begs the question of whether we will ever be able to grasp the fullness of the cosmos .
But that does n’t stop us from trying .
In fact , contemplating the great unknowns must be one of the oldest hobbies in human experience .
The pursuit has given rise first to religion , then to philosophy , then to people who make fun of religion and philosophy .
We may never understand the entire universe , but we can sure appreciate the fact that it ’s so complex that it eludes us .
10 . Extraterrestrial Intelligence
This is really a simple mystery .
Is there other intelligent life out there in the universe ?
Carl Sagan reminds us that if we exist , then , no matter how rare intelligence is in the universe , given how huge the universe is , we must have many neighbors out there somewhere .
Frank Drake , an astrophysicist , created an equation that helps figure out how much intelligent life there is in the universe , and estimated that if only one in a billion planets has intelligent life , then there must still be over 6 billion planets with intelligence

Enrico Fermi , however , pointed out that if life is that common , then it is virtually impossible that we have n’t yet detected any signs of other intelligent life in the universe .
So , the real mystery is this : what is it about Earth that makes no one want to play with us ?
On the 30th of June , 1908 ( or the 17th , at the time ; the calendar has been revamped since then ) , at 7:17 am ( local time ) , something exploded over a region of forest in the Tunguska River Valley in Siberia , Russia .
Locals many miles away saw something bright blue streak toward the area and explode with incredible force , sufficient to register on instruments in England .
Later examination of the site showed that trees had been knocked down in a radial pattern from a central point , indicating an air burst of some kind .
To this day , scientists are n’t sure what it was , and generally figure that it was a meteor or a fragment of a comet .
Why did it explode in the air ?
Why have n’t we found any pieces ?
The mystery has kept UFO aficionados up at nights since then .
8. Rare Antimatter
Matter and antimatter are , in theory , created at the same time by the same event .
When a normal baryonic particle is created , an antiparticle of the same mass and opposite charge is also created .
However , while we have created antimatter in laboratories on Earth , we do n’t see it in the universe around us .
No one seems to know what happened to all the antimatter that should be there …
7. Consciousness
What is the mind ?
Behaviorists say that it is just conditioned responses .
But it ’s hard to deny that our ability to reflect on our own thoughts is something distinct and interesting .
Is it a mere side - effect of the way our brains work ?
If so , how long will it be before a computer becomes self - aware and asks for equal rights ?
How can you tell true consciousness from something designed to simulate it ?
Can consciousness survive the death of the brain that carries it ?
There are a lot of questions , but until we can have an equal conversation with either a robot or a ghost , there really wo n’t be any answers .
6. Dark Matter / Dark Energy
Current models of the universe , and observations made by high - tech instruments , point to there being an enormous amount of matter in the universe beyond what we can actually see .
In fact , we can only seem to perceive about 4 % of the stuff in the universe directly .
The rest is invisible , or “ dark matter , ” a term that just means that we have no idea what it is .
Accompanying this dark matter is some type of energy that , like dark matter , we ca n’t perceive directly .
We call this , in a moment of inspiration , “ dark energy . ”
Apparently , there ’s even more of this than there is dark matter .
Different theories abound , but perhaps , as mentioned in # 10 above , most of the universe is just avoiding us .
5. Time
You think you know what time is ?
Okay , try defining it without using any terms that rely on time .
Time is … well , it ’s time .
It ’s what keeps every event from happening simultaneously , and it ’s what distinguishes something that happened in the past from something that will happen in the future .
Is it a dimension , like space ?
Is it a quality of matter ?
Is it merely an illusion , possibly created to boost sales of digital watches ?
The smartest guys in the world get headaches from this one .
4. The Beginning of the Universe
How did the universe begin ?
Did the universe ever begin ?
If the universe includes everything that we know , including time , could there possibly even be a “ before ” before the beginning of the universe .
Current theories generally talk about a “ Big Bang , ” which is a massive expansion of all matter and energy from a single point , which is still continuing through the present day .
What started the bang ?
Where did all the energy and matter come from ?
Are these questions even meaningful ?
What about creationism , if that is for you ?
If God created the universe and all the physical laws in it , what is he doing now that it is running itself ?
3. End of the Universe
Following the question of the end of the universe is the question of the end of the universe .
Opinions vary on whether we can expect the universe to ever expire .
There are several possibilities .
One is that the universe will continue to expand , and eventually become so spread out that all matter and energy is just a homogeneous cloud of thin , lukewarm dust .
Another is that gravity will eventually catch up with all the matter , and the universe will slow down and fall back into a single point , which may spark another big bang .
Yet another theory notes that baryons and protons , the building blocks of matter , do n’t seem to be being created naturally anymore , and if they decay ( as some other particles do ) , the universe will simply fade out as all the particles just cease to be .
In general , nothing untoward is expected to happen to the universe for many billion years , which will probably be a relief to those with long - range investments .
2. Multiple Universes
Current quantum physics raises the possibility that there are many universes besides our own , existing in the same space and time , but only interacting in certain limited ways .
These universes may have their own separate histories and futures , and even their own laws of physics .
This is all vague theory for the moment , but some day it may be possible to travel to the universe where your favorite singer won American Idol or visit with evil Spock .
1. Grand Unification Theory
For decades , physicists have been trying to make sense of the difference between Isaac Newton ’s classical physics ( you know , what you use to play pool ) Einstein ‘s relativistic physics , that involve very large or massive things at enormous velocities , and Heisenberg ’s ( and others ’ ) quantum physics , which concerns things so small that you ca n’t even measure them without changing the result .
These three sets of physical laws seem to play by their own rules , largely ignoring each other , and yet they all relate to the same universe .
And so physicists have hunted for the Grand Unification Theory , which would substitute for all of these incomplete sets of laws and make sense of it all .
Perhaps it does n’t exist .
Or perhaps it ’s just too complex for human minds to grasp .
One way or the other , it ’s going to keep scientists arguing for some time to come .

The indictment of Sen . Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) on corruption charges Tuesday throws into question his grip on a Senate seat he has held for decades and offers Democrats a chance to strengthen their hold on Congress .
Stevens , the longest - serving Republican in the Senate and a towering figure in Alaska ’s political history , was indicted by a federal grand jury here on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from one of the state ’s most powerful employers .
The indictment accuses Stevens , 84 , of accepting more than $ 250,000 in improvements to his Alaska home , as well as other gifts such as a gas grill and a new Land Rover , from VECO Corp. , an oil field services company .
“ It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me , ” Stevens said in a statement in which he denied that he had ever knowingly submitted a false disclosure form .
“ I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that . ”
Stevens said he had relinquished his post as senior Republican on several congressional committees in accordance with Senate GOP rules that require members indicted on felony charges to give up leadership posts .

Stevens has served in the Senate since 1968 and has held some of its most powerful positions , including chairmanships of the Appropriations and Commerce committees .
He is legendary for bringing home federal dollars to Alaska ; the Anchorage Daily News once wrote that Stevens was “ the second - largest engine of the Alaska economy . ”
According to Citizens Against Government Waste , a Washington watchdog group , Stevens sponsored a total of 1,452 pork barrel projects worth $ 3.4 billion between 1995 and 2008 , making Alaska the No. 1 state in pork per capita every year since 1999 .
The indictment casts a shadow over Stevens ’ future .
He is up for reelection this year , and news reports questioning his ethics have already damaged his standing .
Alaska has not elected a Democratic senator for a generation .
But even before Stevens was indicted , polls showed him trailing his Democratic opponent , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich .
Stevens ’ defeat would be a big notch in the belt of Democrats hoping to expand their party ’s slim control of the Senate .
( The chamber ’s two independents typically vote with the 49 Democrats against the 49 Republicans ) .
Some analysts wonder whether Stevens will drop his bid for reelection rather than risk the loss of his seat to a Democrat .
Several Republicans are running against Stevens in the state ’s GOP primary Aug. 26 .

“ If Stevens runs , the likelihood of him getting beaten in the primary just went up 100 % , ” said Jennifer Duffy , who analyzes Senate elections for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
Reaction to the indictment Tuesday was muted on Capitol Hill , where the Justice Department has been conducting a number of corruption probes .
Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , the Senate ’s majority whip , described the mood among Democrats as “ somber ” and said his caucus was thinking of Stevens and his family .
“ I believe in the presumption of innocence , ” Durbin added .
“ At this point , we should just let the courts do their work . ”
Republicans largely avoided reporters .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) appeared alone before reporters at a regular briefing usually attended by most of the GOP leadership .
He appeared grim and spoke briefly on Stevens .
“ The Republican conference , like you , just heard of this news , ” McConnell said .
“ No doubt we ’ll have more to say about this later . ”
He turned from reporters ’ shouted questions and walked away .
Stevens is charged with seven counts of making false statements on his financial disclosure forms for calendar years 2001 to 2006 .
The post - Watergate Ethics in Government
Act requires lawmakers to disclose gifts over a specific monetary amount as well as liabilities in excess of $ 10,000 .
The indictment alleges that , over a six - year period , Stevens failed to report gifts from VECO , in exchange for which he “ received and accepted solicitations for multiple official actions , ” including helping VECO obtain lucrative federal contracts and providing “ assistance ” with company ventures in Pakistan and Russia .
The indictment does not accuse him of the more serious crime of bribery .
Legal experts said that may reflect difficulty that prosecutors had in identifying specific legislative favors that Stevens performed for VECO .
Bribery law requires that there be an identifiable exchange , known as a quid pro quo , between a thing of value and an official act .

The charges culminate a multiyear influence - peddling investigation that has led to the convictions of several Alaska state officials and the chief executive of VECO , Bill J. Allen , who last year admitted that he made more than $ 400,000 in payments to government officials .
Stevens ’ son , Ben , a former president of the Alaska state Senate , remains under federal investigation , as does Republican U.S. Rep.
Don Young of Alaska .
The indictment focuses on improvements to Stevens ’ home in Girdwood , Alaska , a onetime gold - mining town about 40 miles southeast of Anchorage that touts itself as the state ’s only year - round resort community .
The remodeling more than doubled the home ’s size , starting in the summer of 2000 , when Stevens and Allen first discussed the project , according to the indictment .
Over the ensuing six years , “ Stevens accepted from Allen and VECO more than $ 250,000 in free labor , materials and other things of value ” in connection with the home improvements , according to the indictment .
“ Stevens never paid Allen or VECO anything for these expenses , and Stevens never listed his receipt of these things of value on any of his yearly financial disclosure forms , ” the indictment says .
At one point , according to the indictment , the renovation work included jacking up and resting the house on stilts and building a new first floor with two bedrooms and a bathroom .
Wraparound decks reportedly were added to the first and second floors along with a garage with a workshop .
VECO employees and contractors allegedly bought and installed fixtures and kitchen appliances .
Advertisement
Stevens reportedly monitored the progress of the work closely .
“ We ’ve never worked with a man so easy to get along with , ” Stevens said in a September 2000 e-mail to Allen , lauding the work of a VECO employee .
“ You . . . have been the spark plugs and we are really pleased with all you have done . ”
The indictment says that Allen also helped Stevens outfit the remodeled home with “ new and used furniture , a new stationary tool storage cabinet with new tools , and a new professional Viking gas grill . ”
The indictment also accuses Stevens of accepting a $ 40,000 Land Rover Discovery from Allen in 1999 in exchange for a 1964 Ford Mustang that Stevens owned plus $ 5,000 .
The Ford was worth less than $ 20,000 .
The indictment said that Stevens wanted the new vehicle for one of his children .
Several other past and present Republican members of Congress are under investigation by Justice Department anti-corruption lawyers .
Some political observers believe bringing charges in an election year could sway some voters .
Advertisement
At a news conference where the indictment of Stevens was announced , Matthew Friedrich , acting chief of the department ’s criminal division , said the election would not affect the timing or decision to bring any additional charges .
“ When we bring cases as prosecutors , we bring cases based upon our evaluation of the facts and the law , and we bring cases when they are ready to be charged , and . . . that ’s what has happened here , ” he said .

Heated to 32 degrees Fahrenheit , a sample of soil being analyzed by NASA ’s Phoenix Mars lander let out a puff of vapor , providing final confirmation that the lander is sitting over a large chunk of ice .
“ We ’ve now finally touched it and tasted it , ” William V. Boynton , a professor at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona and the lead scientist for the instrument that detected the water , said at a news conference on Thursday .
“ And I ’d like to say , from my standpoint , it tastes very fine . ”
The main goal of the lander is to analyze ice in the northern arctic plains .
Since it arrived on the planet on May 25 , scientists have visually seen what they were almost certain was ice : a flat , shiny patch beneath the lander and tiny white chunks in a trench dug by the lander ’s robotic arm .
But the analysis performed in one of the instruments , heating the sample in a tiny oven and then observing what vaporized , was the first direct measurement .
Black Friday , one of the biggest shopping days of the year , is just around the corner .
Here are three quick tips to make the most of it without blowing a big hole in your budget .

John McCain is a diplomatic disaster just begging to happen .
A more generous observer than I might excuse his frequent factual gaffes - repeated references to countries and borders that do n't exist , forgetting that Sunni al - Qaeda and Shiite Iran are sworn enemies , putting events such as Iraq 's " Anbar Awakening " and the US military " surge " in the wrong chronological order - as the normal mental slippage anyone might experience while they near their twilight years .
What can not be so easily overlooked are those comments and actions of McCain 's which suggest that he really is a rather angry and hateful old man , not to mention something of a loose cannon on the deck .
Take for example his efforts at humor involving the fantasized slaughter of Iranian civilians :
His singing of " bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of the Beach Boys ' " Barbara Ann " back during the primaries and his more recent suggestion that exporting cigarettes to the Iranians might be a good way of killing them , neither of which should be coming out of the mouth of a prospective president .
Following the " bomb , bomb Iran " incident McCain 's lack of tact was made even more painfully obvious when he callously refused to admit any error in offending the Iranian people by suggesting that they would be better off dead .
Whatever we might think of Iran 's rulers , the Iranian people are not our enemies , and making jokes about killing them with bombs and cigarettes is no way to win " hearts and minds " in the Middle East or anywhere else .
McCain 's remarks about killing Iranians echo previous comments made by him regarding the people of Vietnam .
" I hate the gooks , " McCain told reporters during his 2000 primary campaign , " I will hate them as long as I live . "
However rooted these comments may be in McCain 's own war experiences , and however excusable they may be for any private citizen likewise scarred by war , they simply cannot be overlooked in a prospective president : the stakes are too high , the need too critical for a competent Diplomat - in - Chief in the Oval Office .
Taken in the context of his later remarks about killing Iranians , they would also seem to suggest a fairly callous and cold - blooded attitude on McCain 's part toward peoples he regards as enemies .
Made once - and on the basis of such deep - seated hostility as that McCain appears to harbor toward certain peoples of the earth - such remarks may all too easily be made again , and again , and again .
Then we have the matter of McCain 's infamous temper , such as when he reacted to disagreement on immigration reform from fellow Republican senator John Cornyn of Texas by screaming , " F*ck you ! " ; such as when he called fellow Republican senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico an " a** hole " ; and such as when he called fellow Republican senator Charles Grassley of Iowa a " f*cking jerk . "
Keep in mind that these incidents occured , not in private or among political enemies , but on the floor of the United States Senate among fellow Republicans ; and could therefore just as easily happen , say , at a G - 8 Summit or a gathering of NATO leaders .
How would it look on the world stage for a red- faced , whited - haired John McCain first to get all the countries wrong , then to make jokes about bombing one of them , then finally to blow his stack and call one of their presidents a " f*cking jerk " ?
Indeed McCain 's outbursts and insults have already , on occasion , occured before the eyes not only of America but of the world .
His hatred of " gooks " and his desire to kill Iranians have both been widely noted in the world press , and would likely precede him on any presidential tour of Asia or the Middle East .
While our French allies were fighting alongside US troops in Afghanistan , McCain had the following to say : " You know , the French remind me a little bit of an aging actress of the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but does n't have the face for it " - not only insulting , but irrelevant , and quite possibly a reason for pro-American French president Nicholas Sarkozy 's enthusiastic endorsement of Barack Obama .
Once in a 1987 meeting at the height of Central American tensions , according to fellow Republican senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi , McCain reached across the table and physically assaulted a Nicaraguan representative , seizing him by his shirt collar .
" The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine ... , " Cochran later said when endorsing Mitt Romney for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination , " ... He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . "
If McCain worries even his fellow Republicans , then how worried should the rest of us be ?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) filed a lawsuit against the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and other government agencies today on behalf of AT&T customers to stop the illegal , unconstitutional , and ongoing dragnet surveillance of their communications and communications records .
The five individual plaintiffs are also suing President George W. Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Cheney 's chief of staff David Addington , former Attorney General and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and other individuals who ordered or participated in the warrantless domestic surveillance .
The lawsuit , Jewel v. NSA , is aimed at ending the NSA 's dragnet surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and holding accountable the government officials who illegally authorized it .
Evidence in the case includes undisputed documents provided by former AT&T telecommunications technician Mark Klein showing AT&T has routed copies of Internet traffic to a secret room in San Francisco controlled by the NSA .
That same evidence is central to Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit filed by EFF in 2006 to stop the telecom giant 's participation in the illegal surveillance program .
Earlier this year , Congress passed a law attempting to derail that case by unconstitutionally granting immunity to AT&T and other companies that took part in the dragnet .
Hepting v. AT&T is now stalled in federal court while EFF argues with the government over whether the immunity is constitutional and applies in that case -- litigation that is likely to continue well into 2009 .
" In addition to suing AT&T , we 've now opened a second front in the battle to stop the NSA 's illegal surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans and hold personally responsible those who authorized or participated in the spying program , " said Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" For years , the NSA has been engaged in a massive and massively illegal fishing expedition through AT&T 's domestic networks and databases of customer records .
Our goal in this new case against the government , as in our case against AT&T , is to dismantle this dragnet surveillance program as soon as possible . "
In addition to suing the government agencies involved in the domestic dragnet , the lawsuit also targets the individuals responsible for creating , authorizing , and implementing the illegal program , including President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
" Demanding personal accountability from President Bush , Vice President Cheney and others responsible for the NSA 's dragnet surveillance of ordinary Americans ' communications is the best way to guarantee that such blatantly illegal spying will not be authorized in the future , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" Our lawsuit today should sound a clear warning to future occupants of the White House : if you break the law and violate Americans ' privacy , there will be consequences . "

The more anxious or angry you are about the political landscape the less likely you are to actually pay attention to the facts .
This according to a new study in Political Psychology .
While angry and anxious voters tune into the news more than more relaxed voters , they actually concentrate less effectively on the available information .
Researchers from the Universities of Michigan and Texas conducted two experiments in the 2004 presidential campaigns in which people answered questions on a computer that either induced a specific emotional state or a control condition to reduce all emotional arousal .
The first experiment found that anxious , angry and enthusiastic people claimed they were more interested than people in a controlled , relaxed setting , and that they would pay closer attention to the debates .
However , all three emotional states led people to take less time looking for information that was available to them , with anxiety impacting attention the most .
The second experiment suggested that typical campaign coverage can trigger powerful emotions which lead to hasty , uninformed decisions .
So , let ’s get this straight … the news runs on emotion , which leads to bad judgment , which leads to bad leaders , which pisses us off , which fuels bad news …

A Previous Message Repeated , Slightly More Forcefully
Dear Democrats , liberals and the like :
( tough love comments hidden behind the cut )
I know it ’s a lot to ask at the moment , but could you possibly please stop publicly losing your shit all over the goddamn place ?
Honestly , it ’s embarrassing .
Did you really not know that coming out of the GOP convention , the GOP candidate might have a poll bounce ?
Likewise , were you somehow surprised that the GOP might try very hard to make this campaign about something other than actual issues ?
Did you expect them to try to run on the last eight years , or even pretend that they own them ?
What the fuck is wrong with you ?
No , seriously :
What the fuck is wrong with you ?
The GOP picks a woman VP 24 years after you do , for the same goddamn reason you did ( a contentless call to shore up a shrinking base ) , and you act like you ’ve never seen this movie before ?
I just do n’t know what to say to you about that .
Also : squirting yourself messy over a vice presidential candidate .
Good fucking gravy , how off the fucking script can you possibly get .
For God ’s sake , she ’s scandal - plagued Atwater spawn from a state with the population of Fort Worth , Texas , whose job it will be to work the lights of the Naval Observatory for four years .
She ’s a walking , taking advertisement for how easily placated religious conservatives are at this moment in history .
She does n’t walk on water , unless it ’s frozen and the moose she ’s hunting has wandered out on it .
So will you please focus .
Please accept that this contest is going to be close .
Please accept that you will have to fight for it tooth and nail .
Please accept that the GOP will feast on every single fucking instance in which you show even the slightest hint of entitlement to the presidency .
Please accept that the GOP SOP is to win by any means necessary , and that they ’ve cultivated an entire generation of political strategists and media lackeys who ca n’t think in any other way , and whose allegiance to the party is reflexive and far stronger than their interest in things like facts .
Please accept that the entire thrust of the GOP strategy between now and November is to keep knocking actual issues out of the political news cycle .
Please stop acting surprised and resentful about any of this .
The GOP will crush you — again — if you keep doing it .
For fuck ’s sake , they ’ve played you exactly the same way since the 2000 election .
Will you please exhibit a learning curve .
You ’ve been here before .
Now , again , please :
Take a nice , deep cleansing breath , center yourself , have some tea , and get a goddamn grip .
It ’s going to be a long two months and if you ’re all going off the rails at the slightest hint that this election is not , in fact , a pro forma coronation , it ’s going to be even longer still .
And you know what ?
As long as the next two months will be for you , it ’ll be nothing like what the next four years will be like if you do n’t calm down , get your shit together , and fight like you mean it .
So settle down .
Get some perspective .
Focus .
Thank you for your attention .
In Polymorphic Algebraic Data Type Reconstruction , Tom Schrijvers and Maurice Bruynooghe create some magic : in addition to normal type declaration inference , they infer ADT definitions .
From the abstract :
One of the disadvantages of statically typed languages is the programming overhead caused by writing all the necessary type information :
Both type declarations and type definitions are typically
required .
Traditional type inference aims at relieving the programmer from the former .
We present a rule - based constraint rewriting algorithm that reconstructs both type declarations and type definitions , allowing the programmer to effectively program type - less in a strictly typed language .
Is the algorithm guaranteed to terminate ?

Dem Leadership Tout Law's New ' Exclusivity ' Provision , But None of Three Dems I Tried to Contact Can Adequately Explain Why They 're Not Being Fooled Again ...
Steve Heller Byon 7/1/2008 , 11:54 am PT
Guest Blogged by Stephen Heller of VelvetRevolution.us
House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer , ( D - MD ) , one of the new FISA bill 's strongest champions , spoke about the bill 's new " exclusivity provision " on the floor of the House on March 14 , 2008 .
He proclaimed that " It clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means of conducting surveillance in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes . "
On June 20 , Hoyer optimistically echoed his previous comment : " This legislation makes clear that FISA is the exclusive means by which the government may conduct surveillance . "
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , ( D - CA ) , in an email sent to some constituents , including myself , wrote that the new FISA bill : " Includes provisions I authored that make clear that FISA is the exclusive ( or only ) authority for conducting surveillance inside the United States ... FISA would be the only legal authority for conducting surveillance on Americans for intelligence purposes ... "
But the old FISA bill , which was the law when Bush began to spy on us without warrants , also had an " exclusivity " provision that stated :
[ P] rocedures in this chapter or chapter 121 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance , as defined in section 101 of such Act , and the interception of domestic wire , oral , and electronic communications may be conducted .
Since the " President " ignored the old FISA law , despite its existing exclusivity provision , what makes Hoyer or Feinstein or any of the other Dems think he 'll bother to obey the new version of the law ?
The existing law did n't keep Bush from breaking it last time , so it 's beyond me what makes law makers think he wo n't do the same this time around .
I decided to contact three different Democratic officials , all in favor of the new law , to try and find out why they believe they wo n't be fooled again ...
Regular readers of The BRAD BLOG , being smarter and better informed than the average person --- --- likely already know that the House recently passed the new FISA bill which includes a simple path to retroactive immunity ( amnesty ! ) for the big telephone companies , indemnifying them for agreeing with the Bush administration to break the law and illegally wiretap American citizens .
The House bill had bi-partisan support , with 105 Democrats joining 188 Republicans in voting " yea . "
The same version of the bill now awaits a vote in the U.S. Senate , which , as of this writing , is likely scheduled to occur on July 7th .
It 's widely expected that the bill will pass in that chamber as well , and Bush has indicated he will sign it into law .
I 'm not surprised he 's going to sign it , because as Sen. Kit Bond , ( R - MO ) said , " I think the White House got a better deal than they even had hoped to get . "
Ugh .
In this post , I 'm not going to deal with the maddening and terrible decision to have the courts decide not if the Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program was illegal , and not whether the telecoms who helped him spy on Americans without a warrant broke the law .
The new bill gives the courts only the power to determine whether or not the telecoms received assurances from the " President " that the program was legal , whether it was or not .
If so , the telecoms , and the Bush administration , will be given amnesty for any violation of the law .
This is retroactive immunity , although the bill 's supporters wo n't call it that .
And of course , perhaps most importantly , it also means retroactive immunity ( amnesty ! ) for George W. Bush .
But I 'll save my ranting and raving about the idiotic and horrible immunity provision ( as well as some other horrible provisions of this bill ) for another post .
This post is about the exclusivity provision in the new FISA bill , and the assurances we 're getting from some in Congress that this provision will somehow prevent the executive branch from doing any more illegal , warrantless spying on Americans .
Fooled Once ...
Bush claimed that legal opinions from the Department of Justice determined that the 1978 FISA bill , the one in force when he began his warrantless spying on Americans , did not apply to surveillance done in the name of national security .
He also claimed that the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force ( AUMF ) allows for warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans .
Bush also insisted that Article II of the Constitution gives him the power to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on American citizens as part of his War on Terror™ , and that Congress does not have the power to stop him .
So much for the co-equal branches of government , eh ?
I spoke with staffers at Feinstein 's office , and they were very helpful .
They told me that the Senator rejects the " President 's " legal arguments .
Feinstein , they said , believes that the new FISA bill 's exclusivity provisions do " as much as is possible in legislation " to prevent this " President " or future Presidents from engaging in warrantless spying on Americans by restating the 1978 FISA law 's exclusivity provision , and then making it clear that the new FISA law has criminal penalties for surveillance conducted outside of FISA , so the " President " can't claim that ignoring FISA is not a crime .
Also , Feinstein 's office insists that the new bill makes it clear to the DoJ , as well as the telecoms , Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) , and any other private companies that , should the government ask for help in domestic surveillance , FISA is the only avenue through which domestic surveillance may be legally conducted .
Another reason the Senator is comfortable with the exclusivity language of the new bill is because of a letter received from Attorney General Michael Mukasey and the Director of National Intelligence agreeing that the new FISA exclusivity provision goes beyond the 1978 statute , and that the new law will not interfere with or constrain intelligence activities that they deem necessary to protect the United States from attack .
Feinstein 's spokesman Scott Gerber sent me an email stating :
The clear goal of this language is to prevent this or any future Administration from thinking it can conduct warrantless surveillance inside the United States legally .
It cannot .
[ A ] nyone asked to carry out , assist , or render judgment on any potential future warrantless surveillance program will know that it is a federal crime to do so . "
Okay .
But ...
Fooled Again ... and Again ... and Again ...
I agree that the new FISA statute contains a provision that makes it clear FISA is , as Feinstein wrote in the email she sent to constituents , " the exclusive ( or only ) authority for conducting surveillance inside the United States . "
Just like the old FISA law .
And I agree that the new exclusivity provision is stronger than the old one .
But will Bush actually obey the new law ?
He ignored the old law , and I can't see why anyone believes he will follow the law this time .
Bush has decided previously that the law did not apply to him .
He knowingly broke the law and violated the Fourth Amendment .
That 's called a " crime . "
Perhaps even a " high crime " , since he did , twice , publicly swear to " protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic . "
He has not , and it seems likely that he will not , be held accountable for either that crime or any of his other crimes , high and otherwise .
The Democrats seem to lack the spine to do anything more than issue subpoenas they wo n't enforce or write Sternly Worded Letters™ .
This is a " President " who not only ignored the FISA law , he 's also ignored the Geneva Conventions and authorized the torture of prisoners .
He 's created secret laws .
He 's imprisoned children , detained American citizens without charges , kidnapped people through a " secret rendition " program , falsified details about U.S. troop deaths for political purposes , and engaged in a conspiracy to violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
I could go on , but that 's enough for now .
Is there any crime this guy wo n't commit ?
This kind of Executive branch behavior is unprecedented in our history and is so far off the rails of the Constitution and the law that it's a threat to the very foundations of our Republic .
Bush is , quite simply , a man out of control .
So I asked Feinstein , Hoyer , and my own House representative , Brad Sherman , who voted for the bill , what makes them believe that Bush , or any future President , will follow the law when there has been and apparently will be no punishment or accountability for not following the law ?
Their answers left me less than satisfied .
Feinstein 's office told me that they are essentially informing Bush that what he did was illegal , and they 're going to close every loophole they can so that he , along with future Presidents , can't do it again .
I can't imagine why she thinks this legislation will keep King George in check any better than the old legislation did .
Hoyer 's office said ... well , they did n't say anything , because his press secretary , Stephanie Lundberg , would n't return the two voicemail messages I left her .
Maybe readers of The BRAD BLOG , especially those in Maryland 's 5th district , should give Rep .
Hoyer a call at ( 202 ) 225-4131 and ask him why he thinks Bush will obey the new FISA law when he did n't bother to obey the old one .
And tell 'em The BRAD BLOG sent you .
If you get any response from him or his office , post it in the comments section below .
My own House representative , Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) , voted in favor of the bill as well , which surprised me ; he 's usually a very reliable Progressive .
His spokesman told me that " The decision to vote for the [ FISA ] legislation was a difficult compromise he [ Sherman ] felt he had to make . "
But there was no comment from his office on why Sherman felt he had to make that decision , whether or not he thinks Bush will actually obey the new FISA bill when it becomes law , and , if he does believe Bush will obey the new law , why he believes it .
Color me unimpressed .
I do believe that these three members of Congress are sincere in their efforts to reign in Executive branch abuses of power and to stop this " President " and all future Presidents from spying on Americans without warrants .
But I absolutely do not share their confidence that the new FISA law will accomplish this , unless Bush is actually held accountable for his past crimes .
Bush broke the law using flimsy legal " reasoning " that any first year law student could have cut to ribbons .
( By the way , if the " Just Us " Department had made it a point to hire good lawyers , instead of hiring only rightwingers who also happened to have legal degrees , this might not have happened . )
And Bush is going to get away with it .
I believe that since Congress continues to be supine to Executive branch bullying and disregard for the rule of law , Bush will again violate the FISA law .
And so will future Presidents .
Once someone is allowed to criminally abuse his authority and power --- a President , a governor , a mayor , a cop , a teacher , whatever --- he will almost certainly continue to abuse that power unless and until he is punished for his crime .
And when those who abuse their power and authority are n't held accountable , those who later assume power and authority are also likely to abuse it .
" Hey , the other guy did it and got away with it , so I can too . "
Bush is a dry drunk who has never had to face accountability for anything in his life , either before or after he was appointed President , and he's not been taught that doing naughty things like spying on Americans without warrants , or authorizing the torture of prisoners , or creating secret laws without approval of Congress or the courts , is illegal and wrong .
And because the opposition party --- if you can call the Democrats " opposition " --- wo n't punish Bush for his crimes , he 'll continue to break the law .
Bet on it .
Bye - bye , Fourth Amendment .
We hardly knew ye .
UPDATE : Lessig weighs in on the reaction to Obama ’s vote .
Lessig is the man .
His analysis of the possible reasons for this vote is very well stated .
It does n’t change my mind about unsubscribing from Obama ’s email money train ( for now ) .
Dear Barack ,
You know I love you .
Your voice and message has given me actual real hope in a presidential candidate for basically the first time in my life .
That ’s why it pains me to unsubscribe from your mailing list today and suspend my ongoing giving of time and money to your campaign .
On July 9 , 2008 you used your power as a U.S. Senator to vote for giving telecoms retroactive immunity for actions that they KNEW were illegal .
I ’m just … baffled by your action on this issue .
Perhaps you ’re playing some kind of election chess or something .
Maybe you have some masterful plan that you ’re just waiting to execute .
This was a pretty big disappointment for me , and many of my friends .
Whatever your reasons , it comes across as being very uncharacteristic of your previous strong stances for freedom , the rule of law , accountability , etc .
I want you to know that today I joined the ACLU and donated $ 50 to their efforts to defend American civil rights that I would have gladly given you instead .
So far , I ’ve contributed $ 700 of my own money to you to help you win , because I believed in you .
That you were intelligent ( finally ! ) , understood sensible and subtle approaches to policy , war , and other issues .
Lately , however , with your seeming backsliding on a number of issues that you previously strongly stated support for , well , it ’s been harder and harder for me to consider clicking the nice red Donate button that you include in each of your emails .
I hope you win the election .
I have zero desire to see McCain in the White House .
Do n’t be like Kerry , where in the end , it was like , oh well , guess he just was n’t strong enough or good enough or tough enough to win it .
Against Bush for God ’s sake .
Have fun at your ‘ open ’ convention in Denver .
I still hope that you really do , in fact , mean all the things that you said when you were busy drumming up support by delivering your inspiring messages .
You had me inspired .
Now you have me disappointed , and wondering if you ’re actually real , if you really and truly have the integrity you promised .
Your well - developed brand of authentic leadership has just taken a major , major hit .
Be the strong leader we want , that we need .
Being strong means taking a principled stand , and not backing down , watering down , or standing down .
I still want you to win .
With your recent vote , however , I ’ve been ‘ inspired ’ to take my own action , to go ahead and donate future contributions and time to other people and parties who have demonstrated their willingness to stand up against the errors of our day .
Thanks for the ride .
Good luck , and peace out .
Unsubscribed .

One of the adages of the storage industry has been “ Fibre Channel and SCSI drives are more reliable than SATA and PATA drives ” .
This has always confused me .
The technology in the spindles just does n’t change that much , and in the past the difference between the SCSI and ATA models of a drive may have been as little as different drive electronics on the same spindle .
How could SCSI drives have been more reliable ?
Could it have something to do with them costing three times as much for the same amount of storage ?
Hmmm …
It used to be easy to find comparable drives in SATA and SCSI flavors , but that ’s become increasingly difficult with the advent of 10 K and 15 K RPM drives .
The drive manufacturers have created a false segmentation in the market , where 10 K and 15 K RPM drives are only available in SCSI , FC and SAS flavors , and almost never in SATA .
Western Digital was the lone company that broke the rules of this cabal , but they seem to have been shamed back to offering only a single model , the VelociRaptor .
Let ’s hope the FTC decides to start looking into this .
So , today your performance requirements may lock you into paying extortionist prices for SAS drives .
But , where we can make comparisons , the reliability canard does n’t seem to make sense .
I looked at the data sheets for all of Seagate , Hitachi , and Western Digital ’s current drives , and they all have MTBFs quoted in the 1 million to 1.4 million hour range .
Two recent studies have shown that there ’s no observable difference in failure rate of SATA vs. SCSI / FC drives , although both are far less reliable than the manufacturers ’ quoted figures .
There ’s no enhanced spindle reliability with the pricey drives .
Where there is a difference between models , though , is with our old friend , the bit error rate .
The bit error rate is the rate at which a block just ca n’t be read from the disk , due to not being able to recover data from the PRML and ECC codes on the platter .
The whole drive does n’t fail , but you ca n’t read that block .
In a RAID system , this triggers reconstruction of that block from the remaining drives .
As I describe in the video “ The Trouble with RAID ” , this bit error rate is the biggest problem with RAID technology today .
In the event of a drive failure in a RAID 4 or RAID 5 set , every remaining drive must be read perfectly from start to finish or else data will be lost .
With a 7+1 set of terabyte drives , this means 7 TB must be read .
A bit error rate of 1 in 10 ^ 14 means that there ’s a 44 % chance that ca n’t be done .
With Seagate , every SCSI / FC drive has a bit error rate of 1 in 10 ^ 16 , except for the Cheetah 10K.7 , which is at 10^15 but maxes out at 300 GB .
With Hitachi , every SCSI / FC drive has a bit error rate of 1 in 10 ^16 .
With Seagate , Hitachi and Western Digital , every SATA drive has a bit error rate of 1 in 10^15 or even 10 ^ 14 , even with terabyte capacity drives !
Not one exception .
This means that if ( and only if ) you ’re using RAID , SCSI drives are hands - down more reliable .
SCSI drives have a better bit error rate , and are smaller in capacity ( so less data needs to be read for a RAID rebuild ) .
In the worst case , the Cheetah 10K.7 drives , there ’s only a 1.7 % chance that a block will be lost in reconstruction .
In the SATA worst case , the Hitachi Deskstar 7K1000 .
B or the Seagate DiamondMax 22 , there ’s a massive 44 % chance the RAID rebuild will fail .
This just goes to re-emphasize that in large enterprise archives , RAID technology just does n’t cut it anymore .
That ’s why Permabit developed RAIN - EC and our other on - disk data protection technologies ; only these can provide the level of reliability required for large - scale , long - term data storage .
The other big mystery , though , is why these vendors are n’t shipping SATA drives with better bit error rates .
Unlike spindle reliability , bit error rate is largely a software tweak — just use a few more bits of the disk for ECC purposes .
Take that terabyte drive down to 750 GB of capacity and make it ten times more reliable .
Drive vendors could do this tomorrow .
The false segmentation of drive interface and spindle speed is alive and well today , with Western Digital appearing to have largely given up .
Is there a false segmentation on bit error rate too ?

It ’s been tons of funs watching the dust settle over South Ossetia , watching everybody go crazy and do their best to avoid the fact that Putin kicked our proxy ass .
If you ’ve ever wondered how countries deal with military defeat , wonder no more , because you ’ve just lived through it , and if you watched any tv , you saw loser propaganda in action 24/7 .
It ’s something you ’ve almost got to admire ( remember that “ almost ” ) , the way people put their hands on their ears and hum away the bad news .
I can imagine Hitler down in the bunker in his last days : “ Ah , vee are holding zee Russians off in zee alley two blocks vrom here !
Vee have a full squad of twelve - year old veterans mit almost five bullets left , plenty of materiel !
If zat alley holds out , perhabz an army of Aryan ghosts vill come to zee rezz - cue like in mein dream last night ! ”
It ’s not quite that bad , OK , but it ’s still a hoot to see grown men making up stories to make themselves feel better .
My old public - library war porn mag , Aviation Week , ran a whole series of dumb -ass tech - geek stories about how the Georgian air defenses were “ winning , ” with headlines like “ Georgia Burns Russian Air Force . ”
What all that amounted to was that the Georgians shot down four Russian planes , three Su-25s and a recon bomber .
Considering that Russia has about 250 Su - 25s in service , and the sheer Hell the Russian CAS inflicted on Georgian armored units , that ’s a very small price for the Russkies to pay .
The only way Aviation Week could make it look like the Georgians had kicked ass was by comparing the Georgians ’ performance with the Syrian air defense vs. Israel .
The Syrians ’ total kills was , you guessed it , zero .
That ’s the same score they always rack up , has been since 1982 .
If it ’s a Syria vs. Israel dogfight , you can put up the Syrian half of the scoreboard before the game even starts : a big Arabic goose egg .
I ’d have a better chance than Syria if you gave me a driver ’s side mirror and sent me out into the yard to try to blind incoming pilots with the reflection .
Or I could stand by the nearest air force runway and yell stuff , try to hurt the pilots ’ feelings : “ Helmet hair , helmet hair ! ” I ’d outscore the Syrian air defense net easy .
Casualties are no way to score a war anyway , not unless you know how much the attacker considers “ unacceptable . ”
And this is the Russians we ’re talking about : they ’re not squeamish , whatever else you can say about them .
I do n’t read the Russian press , but I can bet they ’re not wringing their hands over those four pilots shot down , or the few soldiers they lost in the ground war — and they did n’t lose that many anyway ; nobody ’s even pretending the ground war was anything but a rout .
Consider the way we think about casualties and you ’ll see what a tricky calculation it is .
Remember when we lost 18 men in Mogadishu in Clinton ’s day ?
That was so horrifying we left Somalia instasntly .
So when the 2004 elections came around , I remember some stupid pundit betting his last creds that if US casualties topped a thousand KIA by Nov. 5 , Bush was outta there .
Well they did , and he was n’t .
We ’d adjusted our idea of unacceptable casualties quite a bit already .
From what I know about Russians , I ’d say they consider a year without casualties way worse than one where they kick ass in a small war like Ossetia .
I read somewhere that Russian villagers used to organize village vs. village fights where every man in the village would get a big club and form a line , then walk into a line of guys from the next village , trying to hit a home run on your neighbor ’s skull .
They called it “ Wall vs. Wall . ”
The Soviet Army actually had to make that little game illegal in the 1950s because they were having too hard a time recruiting .
It seems two out of three village kids were maimed or braindamaged or dead , thanks to “ Wall vs. Wall ” games , by the time they hit drafting age .
And proud of it .
So it ’s very , very dicey using losses to make your point .
Losing a few men in a winning battle probably made the folks in Moscow happy .
People are pretty good at handling casualties , till it ’s their own leg getting blown off .
Hell , nobody remembers the French lost 1.5 million men out of a population of 40 million in WW I .
And they held .
They had to put down a lot of frontline mutinies — that ’s where Petain made his name–and shoot a lot of gloomy Gustaves ( “ Cheer up , mon ami , or better yet we ’ll shoot you to cheer up the others ! ” ) but they held .
So please , do n’t tell me that losing four CAS aircraft is going to keep Putin awake nights .
Hell , he probably gets his cut on every new Su - 25 built , so replacement orders are good news for him .
All you had to do was listen to the new Russian front man , Medvedev , talking to Sarkozy and the Western press to see how cocky the Russians are feeling .
Medvedev is one of these short guys , so he loves nothing better than flipping off the world .
And that ’s what he did , not even pretending to play nice : “ We ’re staying in South Ossetia for good , we ’re staying in Abkhazia , get used to it , Losers ! ”
It was pretty much that simple .
What the war really meant was that Russia found a way to use all that conventional weaponry they paid so much for .
It ’s not easy these days for a big power to get its money ’s worth on all that conventional hardware .
It just does n’t apply to most contemporary warfare ; it ’s like trying to fix a skin ulcer with a bulldozer .
So when a big country can finally unleash all that expensive hardware like we did in the first Gulf War , and Russia just did against Georgia , you can hear the sex - grunt on the home front as loud as through a Motel Six wall , “ Oh yeah yeah YEAH !
Armored thrust !
Oh yeah , GRAD , GRAD , GRAD ! ”
What it takes is a weak country trying to play like the big boys .
That ’s what Saddam did against us , and that ’s what the Georgians did with a little whispering - in - the - ear from their new neocon friends .
These guys are living in the past .
You do n’t take land these days by sending your lame little conventional army into a place like Kuwait or South Ossetia that ’s protected by the big players .
That ’s dumb .
You either make a deal with the big power to betray their local client , like the Indonesians in the sixties persuaded the CIA to let them have the eastern half of New Guinea in return for massacring the whole membership list of the PKI , the Indonesian Communist Party , or you infiltrate some of your ethnic group in there , peasants who do n’t know how to do anything but pop out babies , and wait for the demographic map to change — you know , the Kosovo strategy .
The biggest tactical mystery of the Ossetia war is still the Roki Tunnel , as in , why did n’t the Georgians blow it up ?
Some interesting stuff has come out since the dust settled .
Well , new to me anyway .
Like did you know that the Georgians actually did try to blow up that tunnel way back in 1991 ?
Yup , and they used exactly the method I suggested in my last column , before I even knew they ’d already tried it : they sent a truck full of high explosives into the tunnel and blew it up .
I admit I got that idea driving through the Caldecott tunnel to Emeryville , where I spent some time this summer to get away from the Fresno heat .
Every time I go into that tunnel I think about how wonderful it would be to make my last commute in a gasoline tanker full of high - octane fuel , with a deadman switch in my hand connected to a detonator duct - taped to the side of the fuel tank .
It ’d be so damn easy .
They do n’t even check trucks coming into the tunnel .
And you can hijack a gas truck easy : just stage a fake accident , shoot the driver , move the body over to the passenger side and off you go .
Commuting to SF and Oakland would get a lot more interesting for a few months , or years .
I ’m not saying it would disable the tunnel forever ; that ’s a tricky prospect .
That article I ’ve linked to about the Georgians ’ 1991 attempt to blow up the tunnel has some interesting stuff about how you go about really destroying a tunnel .
Seems you have to know the geology of the rock it ’s built into .
The Roki tunnel apparently was built on a mix of granite and sand .
If you blow up your truck under the granite , you ’ve got a chance to repair the break , but if you do it smart and blast a section that ’s dug through sand , it ’s almost impossible to repair the break .
Of course the Georgians did n’t really have to destroy the tunnel totally , just close it down long enough to keep the Russian Army from reinforcing on the ground .
That should have been do - able , with their inventory of planes and air - to - ground guided munitions .
You know , I wonder if they fell for that same casualty - shy thinking that you see in the Aviation Week article trying to gloat over downed Russian planes .
It ’s a problem for American - advised armies ; we worry too much about casualties sometimes .
I ca n’t help wondering if the Georgians thought about attacking the tunnel mouth by air and backed off because they thought they ’d lose planes .
Which they probably would have .
And so what ?
It would have been worth it , way worth it .
If you think coldbloodedly about it , blocking that tunnel was worth way more than shooting down a few Russian planes over South Ossetia ( if the Georgian AF even did shoot them down ; from what I ’ve heard , it was SAMs that got those Su-25s ) .
It was a God - given chance to take the upper hand .
How often do you fight a campaign where there ’s only one road into the battlezone ?
Incredible they did n’t spend every plane , every commando , every dollar they had getting to that tunnel .
I say “ every dollar ” because one advantage of dealing with the Russian army is simple old bribery .
You would n’t believe how easy it is to bribe Russian troops .
When that crazy Chechen warlord Shamil Basaev was driving his convoy of guerrillas deep into Russia , he had to pass all kinds of Russian Army checkpoints .
He dealt with them real simple : “ Here ’s ten rubles , we ’re coming through ! ” Incredible .
You have to understand , Russians and Chechens hate each other like poison , but these Russian troops were willing to let a convoy of Chechen killers armed to the roof racks through their roadblocks just for vodka money .
And from what I hear , the Georgians have a long history of playing the Russian system , oiling the wheels with a little baksheesh .
Why did n’t they offer to make the guards at the tunnel mini-oligarchs in return for a little help stacking boxes of HE inside the tunnel and running a wire back to the detonator ?
I just do n’t get it .
There ’s some kind of big strategic hole at the center of this campaign , when you look at it from the Georgian perspective .
It just does n’t make any sense .
I kind of get the feeling somebody in Tbilisi made the fatal mistake of believing what they were getting told by Dick Cheney .
Next to marching on Moscow in September , that ’s the deadliest thing a war leader can do .

Last night I attended the Great Debate at the Wesley Centre in Sydney , where along with an audience of several hundred , I watched Dr. Michael Shermer debate Professor John Lennox on the Subject : " Does God Exist ? " .
Here is the transcript of that debate :
Moderator : Hello , I 'm that bloke from the ABC , you probably recognise my voice .
No ? Oh. OK then .
Anyway , here are the contestants who will enter thunderdome tonight .
Audience : two men enter , one man leave ... two men enter , one man leave ...
Shermer : Does God Exist ?
No .
Thank you very much I 'll see you after the show .
No but seriously , try the veal .

Lennox : [ further appeal to authority ] , [ sermonizing ] , I 've been to Auschwitz you know ..
Audience : OOOOH !
Godwin's Law is in effect , Lennox loses , let 's carry Shermer down the street shoulder - high .
Moderator : I know not of this Godwin of whom you speak .
Shut up , you lot .
Shermer : OK , if we 're ignoring Godwin : Gott Mit Uns on belt buckles , [ slight misspeak ] : First World War

Fuck Off .
And besides , Penzias 's prize was split with Robert Wilson .
What about his view ?
Shermer : Yeah , so what ?

And Dawkins still sucks .
I like E.O. Wilson though , ' cause he does n't say god 's stupid .
Moderator :
That was a very nice wee - wee .
Can we close now ?
I want warm milk and a story .

Denver cops get T - shirts that mock DNC protesters RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Denver 's police union is facing criticism for printing a commemorative T - shirt that makes light of the use of violence by police , particularly in the wake of 154 arrests during the week of Democratic National Convention this past August .
" We get up early , to beat the crowds , " the shirt reads , followed by " 2008 DNC . "
The words flank a grinning police officer holding a baton and wearing a hat with a crossed - out number " 68 , " presumably making reference to activist organization Recreate 68 , which staged several anti-war demonstrations during the convention .
" The people of Denver were assured by the city that it would respect First Amendment rights during the DNC , and that that police officers were being trained to do so .
The actions of police during the DNC , which involved numerous violations of people 's right to freedom of speech and assembly , put the lie to those promises , " said Recreate 68 's Glenn Spagnuolo .
" And now this appalling , tasteless t- shirt shows why .
The members of Denver 's police union clearly have no respect for the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution .
The Denver Police Department Operations Manual includes a Law Enforcement Code of Ethics , which begins , ' As a Law Enforcement Officer , my fundamental duty is to serve mankind , to safeguard lives and property , to protect the innocent against deception , the weak against oppression or intimidation , and the peaceful against violence or disorder ; and to respect the Constitutional rights of all men to liberty , equality and justice . '
The creation of this t- shirt makes a mockery of that statement . "
Detective Nick Rogers of the Police Protective Association said that the union predicts sales of about 2,000 shirts in addition to the ones given free to Denver police officers , and also told KMGH that he had n't received any complaints about the shirt .
A picture of the design , courtesy of KMGH , can be viewed at this link .
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain is a well - known critic of frivolous government spending otherwise known as pork : those pricey projects that legislators routinely — and surreptitiously — slip into appropriations packages to benefit their own districts and bring them coveted votes .
But scientists charge that an important study of grizzly bear DNA has gotten caught in the crosshairs as the veteran Arizona lawmaker attempts to showcase his creds as a crusader against wasteful government spending .
It is unclear why McCain , who has taken a firm stand on some other environmental issues — he believes more needs to be done to curtail global warming — considers the research to be a waste of time and money , and his press office did not respond to repeated e-mails and phone calls for comment .
Yet , he is apparently so " outraged " that he takes a dig at it in a campaign TV spot in which an announcer declares :
" 233 million for a bridge to nowhere .
Outrageous …
Three million to study the DNA of bears in Montana .
Unbelievable … A million dollars for a Woodstock Museum — in a bill sponsored by Hillary Clinton .
Predictable …
Who has the guts to stand up to wasteful government spending ?
One man .
John McCain . "
Currently the front - runner for the GOP nod , McCain also hits the research in speeches on the stump , cracking jokes about bear paternity tests and criminal investigations .
" I do n't know if it was a paternity issue or criminal , but it was a waste of money , " McCain railed last month during a campaign stop in Clawson , Mich .
Scientists , however , are not amused :
They insist that the study is not only worth every penny but that the $ 3 - million price tag cited in the ad is , in a word , wrong .
In fact , Congress over the past five years has forked over a total of $ 4.8 million to study the genetic material of Montana 's grizzly bears , according to Katherine Kendall , a research biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
Kendall heads the Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project , which is aimed at obtaining the first accurate population estimate of grizzlies living in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem — eight million acres of land in northwestern Montana that encompasses Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex .
" This is not pork barrel at all , " says Richard Mace , a research biologist with Montana Fish , Wildlife & Parks ( FWP ) .
" We have a federal law called the Endangered Species Act and [ under this law ] the federal government is supposed to help identify and conserve threatened species . "
The grizzly has been listed as a threatened species since 1975 and scientists say that it is essential to get a handle on the population to preserve it .
But , according to Kendall , until the feds decided to invest in this grizzly bear DNA study , researchers lacked the funds to conduct research at the scale necessary to get a reliable measure .
In 2002 Kendall assembled a scientific panel with representatives from the USGS , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and FWP , along with other scientific and environmental organizations to determine the best way to measure the remaining grizzly population of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem .
It recommended setting up barbed wire hair - snagging stations to painlessly pluck fur from passing bears that would be used for DNA fingerprinting , a technique employed to distinguish individuals of the same species by the differences in their genetic material .
This is the only way to accurately estimate population in such heavily forested terrain , where bears are difficult to spot , says Chris Servheen , a grizzly expert with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
In response , the USGS set aside $ 250,000 to launch the Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project ; the next year , Congress stepped in to provide additional funding , and from 2003 to 2007 appropriated $ 4.8 million to the effort , Kendall says .
She notes that her team of 250 scientists and researchers set up hair - snag stations at thousands of locations throughout the grizzly habitat , some as far as 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) from the nearest road .
These wire setups do not harm the bears in any way , Servheen says : " It 's no more than running a comb through your hair . "
The team collected 34,000 samples of bear hair over a 14 - week period in 2004 , which it sent over the border to the Wildlife Genetics International laboratory in Nelson , British Columbia .
By extracting and analyzing DNA in the strands , researchers were able to pinpoint the species ( grizzly or black bear ) , gender , and individual identity of host bears .
It took two years to analyze the large swath of samples and another to compile the data and conduct statistical analyses to estimate the size , distribution and genetic structure of the population as well as summarize the findings , which Kendall says she hopes to publish in a science journal by summer .
( She refuses to reveal the results prior to publication . )
But numbers are only part of the story .
Scientists say they also have to figure out how the population is changing to determine how to protect it .
Toward that end , the Montana state government four years ago launched a $ 250,000 per annum effort to monitor grizzly population trends ( separate from , but complementary to Kendall 's study on population size ) , according to Mace , who is in charge of that project .
" There are no answers yet , " he says , noting that it is too early to tell whether the population is increasing , decreasing or if it remains unchanged since 2004 .
But researchers are optimistic they will be able to fashion effective preservation measures once they have a better idea of [ to vary ] the population size — thanks to Kendall 's study — and a solid understanding of trends .
Still , for many Americans who have never seen and probably never will see a grizzly bear , the question remains :
Why should one bear population merit millions in taxpayer money ?
The reason , grizzly expert Servheen says : the bears are a threatened species .
He estimates that only about 1,500 still reside in the 48 contiguous states , compared with some 50,000 before the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century ( a 97 percent population decline ) .
The once far - reaching grizzly habitat , which stretched from the Mississippi River to California and ranged north to south from Alaska to Mexico , is today restricted to four western states : Wyoming , Idaho , Montana , and Washington .
In these states , only two populations — those living in and around Yellowstone National Park and in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem — number more than 50 bears and offer hope for long - term viability , Servheen says .
So is forking over huge chunks of change to protect grizzly bears " unbelievable " — or a joke — as McCain charges ?
No way , scientists and environmentalists say .
Protecting wildlife is expensive , but grizzlies are priceless , says Louisa Willcox , director of the Wild Bears Project for the National Resources Defense Council .
" Grizzly bears are a symbol of our frontier past — of untamed wilderness , " she says .
" Lewis and Clark saw them eating buffalo carcasses on the American plains . "
Not only are grizzlies " treasures of United States history , " Servheen says , but they help us understand how effective our conservation efforts are .
Despite their ferocious reputation , he notes , grizzlies are exquisitely sensitive to human activity and can only live on the wildest tracts of land .
" They are an indicator of the health of ecosystems , " he says , and they emblematize " the preservation of wilderness , which is becoming rarer every day . "
When Motel 6 opened in 1962 , it cost $ 6 to rent a room for a night .
Thanks to inflation , the cheapest room is now $ 29.99 .
The 99 Cents Only Store ( NDN ) may be heading for a similar fate .
The usual suspects ( near record - high oil prices , soaring food costs , fast - rising inflation , etc. ) are causing headaches for the 26 - year - old chain .
Rather than selling a dozen eggs for $ 0.99 , the story is now selling half - dozens .
Rather than selling full milk cartons , they 're selling pints .
The company has also just plain stopped stocking some items that are no longer profitable to sell .
But the company 's management is seeing the writing on the wall ( LA Times ) :
" There 's no question we 're going to need to do something , " Chief Executive Eric Schiffer said to analysts this month after the company reported its second consecutive quarterly loss .
" When you are part of a family that comes up with a concept , sometimes you 're the last to admit that it needs to be changed . "

He knew of other American prisoners in Vietnam long after the war was over .
He was supported by Vietnam veterans whose war records were impeccable ....
My sources included outstanding experts like former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Tighe and returned POWs like Captain McDaniel , who held the Navy 's top award for bravery .
With such advocates , it was hard not to consider the possibility that prisoners ( some 3,500 ) had in fact been kept by the Vietnamese as hostages to make sure the US would pay the more than $ 3 billion in war reparations .

This extraordinary news ran on page one of the country 's leading paper .
Unfortunately , it was the wrong country : Britain .

The office of the governor [ also ] illegally ordered the removal of felons from voter rolls–real felons–but with the right to vote under law .
As a result , 50,000 of these voters could not vote .

Obama Targets bin Laden , Defends Constitution and Shames Palin
Created : September 09 , 2008 17:25 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
FARMINGTON HILLS , Mich . —
In unusually pointed remarks at a rally , Sen. Barack Obama ripped into Republicans for undermining the rule of law , blasted Gov. Sarah Palin for “ mocking ” the Constitution and assailed the Bush administration for talking tough while failing to apprehend Osama bin Laden .
The Democratic nominee , in answering a question about civil liberties from a member of the audience at a school gym , proactively raised Gov. Sarah Palin ’s controversial attack from the Republican National Convention — when she claimed Democrats cared more about reading terrorists ’ their rights than national security .
“ First of all , ” Obama said in his biting rebuttal , “ you do n’t even get to read them their rights until you catch them .
They should spend more time trying to catch Osama bin Laden ; and we can worry about the next steps later ! ”
As the crowd applauded , Obama punctuated his point with almost mock exasperation .
“ Seriously !
These folks , ” he said , turning to his own commitment to killing terrorists :
My position has always been clear :
If you got a terrorist , take ‘ em out — take ‘ em out .
Anybody who is involved in 9/11 — take ‘ em out !
Yet unlike his Republican rivals , Obama argued that national security can be entirely consistent with upholding the Constitution :
But what have I also said is this :
When you suspend habeas corpus , which has been a principal dating before even our county –- it ’s the foundation of Anglo - American law — which says , very simply , if the government grabs you , then you have the right to at least ask , “ Why was I grabbed ” and say , “ Maybe you got the wrong person . ”
The reason you have that safeguard is because we do n’t always have the right person .
We may think this is Mohammed the terrorist , it might be Mohammed the cab driver .
Now I ’ll shift from reporting to speculating , and note that in the moment Obama proffered the Mohammed example , he seemed to consider how the line might be misconstrued .
Watching his voice rise in that packed Michigan gym , I think Obama knew he went farther than his typical line on racial profiling .
( As you can see in the video below . )
To recalibrate , he gamely inserted himself into the habeas hypothetical .
“ You may think it ’s Barack the bomb thrower , but it might be Barack the guy running for president . ”
Then , Obama delivered a rousing close to his extemporaneous constitutional address :
So the reason that you have this principle is not to be soft on terrorism .
It ’s because that ’s who we are – that ’s what we ’re protecting !
( applause )
Do n’t mock the Constitution !
( applause )
Do n’t make fun of it !
Do n’t suggest that it ’s un-American to abide by what the founding fathers set up — it ’s worked pretty well for over 200 years !
The crowd rose to its feet in loud applause .
It was one of the most warmly received arguments of the day , a departure from the economic policies that anchor Obama ’s current stump speech .
During the primaries , Obama ’s habeas corpus line usually drew applause , and he has been advocating the issue in Congress .
Obama is one of the 13 senators to co-sponsor the Restoring the Constitution Act , a bill to restore the rule of law and roll back major parts of the Military Commissions Act , which the Supreme Court recently found unconstitutional .
The 5 - 4 decision was praised by Obama , while Sen . John McCain derided it as one of the “ worst ” judgments in history .
Watching both parties ’ conventions , you would n’t know the rule of law has been seriously undermined by the Bush administration , or that torture , rendition , domestic warrantless surveillance and other crimes have become common tools of U.S. policy under a corrupted Justice Dept .
It was heartening , if only for a few moments , to watch a citizen raise those issues , and for a presidential candidate to respond with principle and passion for restoring the constitutional order .

At many points during my road trip this summer I had the opportunity to lie on my back and stare at the unpolluted stars .
After spending a minute to find the Big Dipper and follow its handle to the northern star , Polaris , I realized I had never seen the southern star ( some punk upstart named Sigma Octantis ) .
For that matter , I had n’t seen an entire portion of the night sky , merely by virtue of being a resident of the Northern Hemisphere .
Assuming a clear night and an unobstructed view to the horizon , you can see half the sky at night .
Part of that sky does n’t always change depending on what time of year it is ( Earth revolves around the sun on a fixed rotational axis ) , and for us Northern Hemisphere dwellers that includes Polaris .
If I ’ve spent my life in the Northern Hemisphere , how much of the sky have I never actually seen ?
The answer works itself out nicely if you abstract the nights sky to the inside of a near infinite sphere and calculate the surface area of the cap of the cone carved by your horizon over the course of a year .
If that explanation is n’t clear , just spend a little time staring at my diagram and equations .
It ’ll come to you .
The equation to calculate the portion of the night sky you ’ve never seen is on the bottom right , with the only input being your latitude .
That is , to calculate the percentage of the night sky that has remained forever hidden to you by Earth ’s mighty bulk , plug your latitude in for theta and get ( 1 – cos ( latitude ) ) / 2 . If you prefer Lisp notation , (/ 2 (- 1 ( cos latitude ) ) ) .
The closest I ’ve ever lived to the equator for more than a year was hurricane prone Galveston , Texas ( latitude 29.28 ) .
That means the percentage of the sky that remains unseen to me is ( 1 – cos( 29.28 degrees ) ) / 2 , or a tiny 6.4 % .
A lifelong resident of Wasilla , Alaska( latitude 61.58 ) who only got their passport last year would have missed out on a full 26.2 % of the night sky .
You can use the handy dandy form below to calculate just how much of life you ’re missing ( needs javascript ) :
Latitude ( in degrees ) :
Portion of night sky unseen :
There are a lot of reasons to travel around the world , but up until that night of looking up at the cosmos it had never occurred to me that stargazing could be one of them .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury ’s new money market guarantee program is aimed at maintaining investor confidence in money market mutual funds , but will be temporary and not be transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , a U.S. Treasury official said on Friday .
“ What we did n’t want was a significant percentage of Americans who have these money market funds to lose confidence in the safety and security of these funds and begin to seek redemptions , ” the official told a conference call .
Since such confidence is critical to market stability , the program is designed to ensure that around $ 2 trillion in money market funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission known as 2A7 funds maintain a net asset value of at least $ 1 per share , using around $ 50 billion in assets from the Exchange Stabilization Fund .
Funds also will pay fees to the Treasury for providing the guarantee .
The ratio of money market assets to Exchange Stabilization Fund assets is similar to that of insured bank deposits to the FDIC ’s $ 52 billion insurance fund , the official said .
The fund is “ similar in design but not a mirror image ” to the FDIC deposit insurance , and is designed to promote the same kind of confidence .
Unlike the FDIC fund , which is limited to $ 100,000 per deposit account , there are no limits for individual money market investments .
The official said participation in the guarantee program would not be mandatory for all money market funds , but he expected strong participation among 2A7 funds .
1822 : The College of Cardinals finally caves in to the hard facts of science , saying that the " publication of works treating of the motion of the Earth and the stability of the sun , in accordance with the opinion of modern astronomers , is permitted . "
It represented a major shift in dogma for the Catholic Church , a concession that the Earth , in fact , might revolve around the sun .
Unfortunately , it came 189 years too late to do Galileo Galilei any good .
Still , it would take another 13 years , until 1835 , before Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems – the work in which he defends the heliocentric theory – would be removed from the Vatican 's list of banned books .
As a theory , heliocentrism had existed since the ancient Greeks , who were the first to determine that the Earth is a sphere in a sky full of spheres .
It remained an unproven theory directly opposed to the geocentric view held by Ptolemy and Aristotle , and embraced by Rome , that the Earth is the center of the universe .
Galileo was greatly influenced by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus , who not only posited that the Earth revolves around the sun but that it makes a complete turn on its axis every 24 hours .
The Catholic Church , however , considered the theory heresy , and Galileo was convicted by the Inquisition in 1633 and remained under house arrest for the rest of his life .
Nearly two centuries later , however , the weight of scientific evidence was so overwhelming that the College of Cardinals finally reversed itself and allowed the teaching of heliocentrism .
Still , it would take another 170 years , until 1992 , for a pope – in this case , John Paul II – to officially concede that , yes , the Earth is n't stationary in the heavens .
Eight years after that , in 2000 , John Paul apologized for the way the Catholic Church treated Galileo .

Common genetic variations affecting nicotine receptors in the nervous system can significantly increase the chance that European Americans who begin smoking by age 17 will struggle with lifelong nicotine addiction , according to researchers at the University of Utah and their colleagues at University of Wisconsin - Madison .
The study , published in the July 11 , 2008 issue of PLoS Genetics , highlights the importance of public health efforts to reduce the number of youth who begin smoking .
These common gene variations , called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , are changes in a single unit of DNA .
Scientists call SNPs that are linked and inherited together a haplotype .
The researchers found that one haplotype for the nicotine receptor put European American smokers at greater risk of heavy nicotine dependence as adults , but only if they began daily smoking before the age of 17 .
A second haplotype actually reduced the risk of adult heavy nicotine dependence for people who began smoking in their youth .
The researchers studied 2,827 long - term European American smokers , recruited in Utah and Wisconsin , and to the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute 's Lung Health Study .
They assessed the level of nicotine dependence for all smokers , and recorded the age they began daily smoking , the number of years they smoked , and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day .
DNA samples were taken from all smokers , and the researchers recorded the occurrence of common SNPs , grouped into four haplotypes , which had been identified earlier in a subset of participants .
They found that people who began smoking before the age of 17 and possessed two copies of the high - risk haplotype had from a 1.6 - fold to almost 5 - fold increase in risk of heavy smoking as an adult .
For people who began smoking at age 17 or older , presence of the high - risk haplotype did not significantly influence their risk of later addiction .
The high - risk haplotype is common in the three study populations , and European American populations in general , ranging in frequency from 38 percent to 41 percent .
Although the authors caution that different haplotype frequencies would likely be observed in different ethnic populations , Robert Weiss , Ph.D. , professor of human genetics at the University of Utah and lead author of the study explains , " We know that people who begin smoking at a young age are more likely to face severe nicotine dependence later in life .
This finding suggests that genetic influences expressed during adolescence contribute to the risk of lifetime addiction severity produced from the early onset of tobacco use . "
According to Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , " In recent years we 've seen an explosion in the understanding of how small genetic variations can impact all aspects of health , including addiction .
As we learn more about how both genes and environment play a role in smoking , we will be able to better tailor both prevention and cessation programs to individuals . "
The study was funded in part by NIDA and the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) , parts of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The NIDA - funded 2007 Monitoring the Future Study showed that 7.1 % of 8th graders , 14.0 % of 10th graders , and 21.6 % of 12th graders had used cigarettes at least once in the month prior to being surveyed .
Although cigarette use has declined slightly in youth in recent years , just over 3 million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 , or 13 percent of those in the United States , still smoke cigarettes .

NEW DELHI -
The Centre has reacted strongly to the ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the Line of Control today .
( Watch
�� �Ceasefire violations by Pakistan are unacceptable , ��� said Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma .
���We���ve conveyed our concerns to Pakistan , ��� he added .
Earlier in the day Pakistani troops targetted Nowshera sector in Jammu and Kashmir and fired six mortar shells .
Pakistani forces resorted to intermittent firing of mortar shells in Jhangarh area of Nowshera sector in Rajouri district for 45 minutes from 0640 hours , defence spokesman Lt. Col S D Goswami said .
Indian troops exercised restraint and did not retaliate , he said , adding there was no loss of life or damage to property in the shelling .
" The troops are alert all along the Line of Control ( LoC ) to foil any evil design of the enemy " , the spokesman added .
This is 27th ceasefire violation in since the beginning of the year and 7th in the last one month .
Despite India asking Pakistan to respect the border ceasefire in force since November 2003 , the Pakistani army continues to indulge in cross - border firing across the Line of Control and the International Border .
Right since the beginning of this year , there has been a spurt in cross - border firings and infiltration bids in sectors like Krishnaghati , Bimbergalli , Gurez , Mendhar and Tangdhar , among others .
“ I want this to look more documentary - form , not a wedding video , ” says Phil .
“ I want it to be like you ’re watching an important moment in time . ”
He says he wants copies of the video to go out to every gay youth organization in the country .
“ This is going to help the kids that are dreaming about being married , ” he says .
“ We ’re not really doing this so much for us .
Some kid in the Midwest will see this and think ,
You know what ?
This is n’t a bad thing . ”
Normally Magazine does n't have too much worthwhile stuff in it .
The new issue , however , had a story I 'm glad I read , The Wedding .
Not being a huge marriage proponent , at least not on a personal level , I nearly skipped by it .
I 'm glad I did n't .
Basically Tim Murphy , the writer , took what was probably meant to be a cheerleader puff piece and turned it into something thoughtful and interesting .
It 's about two decadent , superficial , dizzy , spoiled circuit queens who drive a Hummer , a Rolls and a Jag .
Challenged , they define themselves as " A list .
" I started skimming .
Then I got to this :
It brought me back to a moment in time when I was living in San Francisco .
I was sitting with a good friend in the backroom of his camera shop .
He had recently been elected to the Board of Supervisors ( City Council ) .
He opened up a big bag of mail .
Tears still come to my eyes when I recall that afternoon , opening and reading those letters , many from young gay people in -- yes , the Midwest who were inspired .
One guy from Nebraska wrote about how he had been on the verge of suicide because of being rejected by his parents and his pastor .
Harvey Milk 's election to public office made him realize that he was n't alone in the world .
The two party boys in their Dolce & Gabbana and Armani suits ... if I thought that was what it meant to be gay I would have committed suicide when I first figured out I was .
Judging from the trailer ofthat I watched today I 'm going to guess that people will have an opportunity to see the not Philandean gay America when the film comes out November 26 .

Yeah , and we ’d almost have believed you , except that the “ joke ” was the same “ joke ” that McCain is himself quoted as saying by Scientific American .
Note the “ joke ” the McCain campaign is now saying an aide told earlier today about McCain helping to create the BlackBerry .
Asked what work John McCain did as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that helped him understand the financial markets , the candidate ’s top economic adviser wielded visual evidence : his BlackBerry .
“ He did this , ” Douglas Holtz - Eakin told reporters this morning , holding up his BlackBerry .
“ Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years , comes right through the Commerce committee so you ’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that ’s what he did . ”
Now note the non-joke in which McCain himself , using the exact same language as the “ joke , ” says that he helped create the cell phone and wi-fi :
I am the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation .
The Committee plays a major role in the development of technology policy , specifically any legislation affecting communications services , the Internet , cable television and other technologies .
Under my guiding hand , Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology that enables Americans to surf the web while sitting at a coffee shop , airport lounge , or public park .
So was McCain “ joking ” too – pretty stupid way to run a presidential campaign , putting our repeated “ jokes ” lying about your boss ’s record , or did the McCain aide in fact tell the truth as the campaign sees it , that John McCain thinks he created the Blackberry ?
It ’s pretty clear that the campaign thinks all of this is true , but now is running scared because this lie was one lie too many .
China has surpassed the productive capacity of the USA !
yapchongyee Updated : 2004-01-16 14:54
The truth ?
China has over - taken USA in production !
America is just the world 's biggest casino .
I preceeded the writing of this article with a couple of reprints of other writers under very chellenging titles but are all seriously thought out titles .
The article by the Chinese buraucrat Mr WANG JIAN is the most enlightening and I found a lot of arguements there reflecting my views which I wrote in my article
" WORTHLESS USA DOLLAR , MERELY PRINTED PAPER " .
I wrote it and posted it in Chinadaily .
However , I must admit that my articles are not the product of conscietious research ; but more from the perspective of sharp observation and lots of common sense .
It is on this point that I welcome the article of Mr WANG JIAN because he has invested a lot of his valuable time to research his article ; but all told the results of his research tallied with those of my opinion .
I therefore suggest that his article can be read alongside mine and the two opinions are compatible .
Recently there has been a hum of opinions posing the question " WILL CHINA OVERTAKE THE USA ECONOMY ?
The general opinion is that China will over - take the USA but the real issue is only when !
Most of the opinions of those who are reputed to know best put the time frame as soon as before year 2050 , and today I will stake a bolder position and SAY THAT CHINA HAS ALREADY OVER - TAKEN THE USA AS THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD .
I will place the USA as second to China and Japan will be third ( maybe in truth Japan ought to be behind Germany )
This assertion is so improbable , but this is the issue that I will prove today !
From all appearances my thesis is a HOOT !
However , this is a case that all that meets the eye is not necessarily so .
The issue that is creating the most problem between the USA and China is the value of the " yuan " .
America wants the Chinese to re-value the yuan to reduce the competibility of Chinese goods .
The American position vis a vis this issue in beyond rediculus .
When in the history has one trading nation been in the position to dictate what another nation can or cannot do .
Why should China pay any heed to the rumblings of the USA Administeration ?
China in their wisdom and experience have valued the yuan at just the right level and Chinese leders must not pay any heed to the American demands .
Today , AMERICA NEEDS CHINA MORE THAN CHINA NEEDS AMERICA .
IT IS SHEER NONSENSE FOR THE CHINESE TO GIVE IN TO THE AMERICANS ; because to do so is to make Chinese industries LESS EFFCIENT .
Who in his sane mind can think of such nonsense ?
TO MAKE CHINA LESS COMPETITIVE SO THAT AMERICANS CAN RETAIN THEIR JOBS ?
How insane do the Americans think we Chinese are ?
This attitude is not only naive but is an insult to the Chinese .
AMERICA THE HOME OF UNFETTED FREE ENTERPRISE !
and here we see the American arrogance to think that Chinese will do according to their dictate .
The second factor that exposes the USA economy as second class and the biggest factor that weighs the US economy down like a millstone around the neck of the US economy is the American " debt level "
The USA economy is kept afloat by the daily fix of US $ 2 billion foreign currency repatriation ; if this flow stops the USA bubble will DEFLATE and the US will spiral downwards into a depression that is worst than that of year 1929 .
The truth is , the USA is already teetering on collapse .
Just one nudge and the rotten economy will implode like what happened to the former Soviet Union .
There is no turning back for the Americans and the collapse is just on the brink !
Just before the invasion of Iraq , I had a discussion with my daughter during dinner , and the topic was , " what is the true the underlying cause for the war ?
The prevailing opinion at that time was that Iraq was invaded because the Americans were out to steal Iraqi oil .
I believe that this is still the prevailing opinion .
It was my opinion as well , but my daughter thought that the real cause was that good ole Saddam was uncoupling the USA dollar as the currency for the international oil trade .
This was the case because shortly after good ole Saddam required all payments to be made in Euros , our Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahatir also ominated that sale of Malaysian oil will be paid in Euros .
At that time the idea was too strange to me but since then I have come around to subscribe to this opinion .
I read the development of the " PETRO - DOLLAR " .
It was with the complicity of the Saud family that the USA was able to force all purchases of Saudi oil to be paid in US $ .
This monopoly forced all other oil producers to transact in US $ and it is for this reason that the US $ is called " the petro - dollar " and due to the fact that money for the purchase of oil formed the major expenditure of all nations the huge flows of US $ became the only currency that is the accepted currency for the oil trade .
Whether good ole Saddam knew it or not , he broke this monopoly by changing the rules in the oil trade and required that all oil purchases out of Iraq will henceforth paid in Euros .
This was promptly followed by Malaysia and then by Russia .
THIS ISSUE WAS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL INVASION OF IRAQ BY THE USA .
I am of the opinion that good ole Saddam can sleep well in his cell KNOWING THAT HE SINGLE HANDEDLY BROKE THE MONOPOLY OF THE PETRO - DOLLAR .
This is the cause of the imminent collapse of the USA .
Is this scenario too impossible ?
I do not think so ; ready examples are at hand .
Think of the collapse of Argentina , Brazil , Soviet Russia , Zimbabwe , Romania and etc....etc .
These types of collapse comes suddenly and like the busting of a balloon !
From the research of Mr WANG JIAN it is discovered that the total currency transactions in the world amounts to US $ 600 trillion and the USA accounts for 45 % of these total currency transactions ; and the American share of these US $ 600 trillion is 40 % of this amount .
All the money that flowed from the USA are mostly printed paper money , and they are happily circulating to all parts of the world .
These trillions of US $ are UNSUPPORTED BY AMERICAN PRODUCED GOODS OR SERVICES .
THIS IS THE CLASSIC CASE OF THE BANANA NOTES first introduced by the Japanese during the years of their colonial experience in Malaysia and Indonesia .
They were so freely printed that the local commander of any Japanese detachments can crank up any number of notes by himself .
If the truth be told the USA $ is a " banana note " ; it is not worth the paper it is printed on .
That being the case the truth is China has already well on the way to catching up to the USA .
There is no chance of redemption whatsoever .
The PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF THE WHOLE OF THE USA ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY 1 % of the US$ 600 trillion .
To redeem the credibility of the US$ , Americans will be required to bear the hardships 1000 times that borne by the Brazilians or 1000 times the hardships and the humiliation borne by the Russians .
I have written an article that argues for the Chinese leadership to dump the US $ before it implodes .
China now reputedly holds US $ 400 billion .
I believe that it will be a good idea to buy as quickly as China can of capital equipment of all kinds for our industrial expansion .
Spend for the purpose of gaining the value of the dollar before it collapses .
This will help the US economy to recover .
We do not want the US to implode because we hold US $ 400 billion .
What good will it do us to hold useless paper ?
We can buy Boeing air - craft .
While we do buy Air - bus from Europe as well , we need to buy from the US a bit more for the purpose of drawing down our reserves of US$ , because Europe is not in dire straits as much as the US is in .
Draw down our pile of US $ to the level of say US $ 100 billion .
In the process we also help the US to recover .
It is to our advantage to keep the US alive but not too strong because the USA is by their nature essentially predatory .
It is not as easy as the Americans pressure the Chinese to buy more from the USA , as I am sure the Chinese are doing .
A look at the discrepancies that exist between the relative costs structures of the two sides will show why China cannot buy from the USA .
I will illustrate the simple case of the relative costs of producing a bicycle .
In China it is produced at the costs of US $ 50 per unit but the same bicycle is produced at the costs of UD $ 1000 ; if China were to buy bicycle from the USA it means that China is LOOSING THEIR COSTS ADVANTAGE and it makes no sense .
Everything that is produced in both China and the USA has the Americans at a disadvantage .
Why buy an American bicycle for US $ 100 when you can buy the same machine in China for US$ 50 .
From this perspective it makes much more sense for China to draw closer to Russia than to be an ally of the USA .
China is at the same level of development as the Russians but of course they are for the moment at a disadvantage , but this will be temporary and Russia will recover to be worthy trading partner of China .
Both countries are not dragged down by debts and both are complimentary to each other as for example the joint production of the SU 28 .
In the field of science and technology the two countries are complimentary to each other .
A good start to such an alliance is to win over the Russians to China�s side to secure the conclusion of the Siberian pipeline , which is also courted by the Japanese .
I am all for setting aside the sum of US $ 200 million for BRIBES TO WIN OVER CRUCIAL VOTES TO THE CHINESE SIDE .
How do I arrive at my claim that China has already surpassed the USA ; because to most readers they will find this claim incredulous ; therefore what is the basis for me to so bravely make such a claim ?
I will at the outset state that I am not comparing the total wealth of the USA against the total wealth of China .
I treat these issues of total wealth as static and the relative worth of the two gives the advantage to the USA .
My analysis treats the ongoing productive capacity of the USA against that of China as reflected in our GDP .
I have no figures but my discussion is based on common sense and plain observation .
I already can anticipate �nit - picking ?
from my dissenters and critics .
Be that as it may my approach is to paint with a broad brush , because it will be too much to research by my lonesome .
My �straight between the eyes shot at the Americans ?
is the ever widening gap between the relative trade performances of the two nations .
In this year alone the balance of trade is in favour of China to the tune of US $ 100 billion .
This gap is widening and it is predicted that in the next year the gap will be US $ 120 billion .
This is not merely with China that the Americans OWE MONEY !
They owe Japan more than their debt to China and then there are the debts to Singapore , Malaysia Hong Kong , Taiwan and a myriad of other nations .
According to Mr WANG JIAN ( whose article I incorporated into my article that the next war is one fought on economics ) the USA printed and bought with these printed US $ notes the sum of 40 % of US $ 600 trillion .
Its is a staggering 40 % of these US$ 600 trillion that is money printed by the USA to buy goods and services from all the other countries of the world .
THIS US$ TRILLIONS TRANSLATE INTO A DEBT OWING BY THE USA TO THOSE WHO HOLD THESE US $ and US treasury bonds that indicate THE USA OWES 45 % of US$ 600 TRILLION TO THE REST OF THE WORLD .
I take the research of Mr Wang Jian as credible therefore the USA must honour these US $ trillions in goods and services ; but the research of Mr Wang Jian ALSO REVEALED THAT THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF THE USA CONSTITUTES ONLY A MINUSCULE 1 % of this huge debt
The apparent wealth of the USA has been amassed by CONFIDENCE TRICKERY ; it was a �con ? job , a BUNCKO JOB ! as the New Yorkers will call it .
Here is when I will illustrate my argument ; I will draw a graphical analogy .
The USA by USING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE US$ MUSTERED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ALL THE DEVELOPING NATIONS TO WORK FOR THE AMERICANS FOR FREE .
They achieve this �bancko job ? by paying for the work and toil and sweat of these unfortunates by paying for their hard work with printed paper US $ .
LOOK AT THIS PROPOSITION HARD AND ASK YOURSELVES WHAT DID WE GET FOR OUR EFFORT ?
Third world poverty and early death through work under inhuman conditions that promises more of the same poverty and humiliation .
WHAT DID THEY GET FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND GRINDING POVERTY ?
Printed Paper money that the USA uses electronic printing machine so that more can be printed and faster !
Of course most of you will ask the logical question ; that is wrong with getting paid with US $ because you can buy with the US$ , so how wrong can it be ??
What is wrong with this arrangement is that goods produced by developing world are all real goods ?
My argument is that each country has a limited capacity to produce goods and services .
We are limited by our ability to grow food ( so much land produces so much food ) ; this capacity is limited by land and fertilisers .
On the manufacturing side we are limited by our factory space and capital equipments etc ?
This goes for the Americans as it does for us .
The inequity of the present system that is dominated by the Americans , is that they have created a myth to enable the Americans to rob these poor developing nations of their produce by paying for their purchases with printed paper money .
And why should that be robbing the poor third world of their produce ?
America buys a pair of Reebok shoes for US$ 30 but sells it in the developed countries for US $ 500 a pair . ; thereby making a profit of US $ 400 a pair .
Reebok does not manufacture the shoes .
The sweat hard work and materials all supplied by the developing world�s manufactures .
America only acts as the middleman .
Why should this be a problem ?
America by this means TRANSFERRED THE GRIME AND THE POLLUTION TO THE THIRD WORLD ; and they make many times more profit than the manufacturer does .
This is not all because the developing world cannot buy produce from the USA because their costs is so high that they have to spend their US $ in other third world countries .
This will always keep the US $ from repatriation back to the USA .
Therefore what passes for profit from exports to the USA is a mere illusion .
The miserable sums that the developing country receives is so meagre that they can only buy in the third world .
That being the case so why don�t we in the third world trade among ourselves where our effort produces real things for trade and our sweat and toil is justly rewarded ?
We can only grow if we make real profit measured by an increase in real terms translated into real things .
The real produce of a nation is measured in terms of their GDP ; therefore let us go back to the real world of real things .
If this happens then the USA will be made to meet their obligations for the trillions of US $ that they have printed to rob the poor of the third world .
Following from the above illustration I will argue my second point .
Consider this proposition , the US $ can buy you a room in a Thailand hotel , but can the Chinese yuan buy a room in an American hotel ?
The answer is a yes to the first and a No in the case of the yuan .
Why should this happen .
What quality is there in the US $ that can pass as in Thailand and Not in New York .
The injustice of this illustration is that the holder of the Chinese yuan had to work to earn that yuan while the US $ was merely printed without any backing in gold nor in produce .
Which of the two currency is the more valuable in terms as a unit of worth in work or produce ?
It is exactly in this issue that Justice is perpetrated because THE AMERICAN PAID FOR HIS PURCHASE WITH A PRINTED PAPER AND HE TAKES AWAY THE PRODUCE OF THE POOR WORKER IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD ; THE DEVELOPING WORLD GETS POORER AND POORER AND THEY SINK DEEPER AND DEEPER IN DEBT TO THE USA .
THINK ABOUT THIS ILLUSTRATION AND TRY TO BALANCE LONG TERM !
I now come to the kernel of my argument !
The USA is today rich because they have TAKEN AS THEIR OWN THE WORK OF ALL THE POOR DEVELOPING NATIONS ( including China ) and PASS THESE PRODUCTS .
I have written an article using the �REEBOC ? brand as illustration ; to show that it is the work and sweat of Chinese workers that makes profits for the American multi-nationals .
THIS MUST BE REALISED AND STOPPED .
Following from the above point , consider this proposition : US $ 600 trillion has invaded the developing world , AND IF WE REPATRIATE THESE US$ 600 TRILLION BACK TO THE USA WHAT WILL HAPPEN ?
It will raise the price of a box of matches from 10 cents US to an inflated prices of US $ 20,000 a box of matches .
The Americans are today screaming foul that China�s yuan is unfairly manipulated to the disadvantage of the USA ; I SAY TO OUR CHINESE LEADERSHIP , CALL THEIR BLUFF !
What do I mean by this claim ?
I mean have a confrontational TRADE WAR AGAINST THE USA .
How do we do that ?
I have already argued that China SELL to the USA in Euros and buy American goods in USA $ .
This is to draw down our reserves of US $ from US $ 400 billion to the level of US $ 100 billion .
IF CHINA DOES THIS WE CAN ALLOW THE YUAN TO FLOAT !
If the Americans push our yuan up we keep buying the capital equipments that China requires because they will become cheaper .
China today has reached such a high level of development that we scarcely need the technology transfer that people say we still need .
There is no need to be too careful because it is a zero sum game ; we draw down on the US $ while we increase our reserves in Euros .
From this point it is very easy to point to the fact that China has already surpassed the USA in productive capacity because they are owing China in ever increasing level of debt .
Cash money is ever decreasing in value and if China keeps their level of American dollar reserves then we can only lament that it serves China right to loose money to the ever spiralling downwards of the US $ .
America cannot rescue the US $ from this point on .
The US $ is in crisis and China needs to dump US $ very GINGERLY SO THAT THE USA DOES NOT ROLL OVER THE BRINK !
This is not the scenario of a superpower !
China needs to draw closer to nations on the Indian sub - continent , South East Asia and East Asia ; and to form a UNITED NATIONS OF ASIAN NATIONS ? and have our own currency like the Eurolands ?
and then to seek equality in our trading with our trading partners .
We need to get full VALUE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES .
The prevailing trading system that is structured on the dominance of the USA $ is unfair and it is a scamp !

I ’ve got a lot to say today !
I want to chat about something that I ’ve never noticed before , but probably should have .
There ’s always been a stereotype out there of programmers being nerdy , anti-social people ( Q : How do you know when an engineer is outgoing ?
A : He looks at your shoes ! ) .
But my revelation of the week is that most programmers seem to be really insecure about their work .
I mean : really , really insecure .
My buddy Fitz and I have long preached about best practices in open source software development — how one should be open and transparent with one ’s work , accept code reviews , give constructive criticism , and generally communicate as actively as possible with peers .
One of the main community “ anti- patterns ” we ’ve talked about is people writing “ code bombs ” .
That is , what do you do when somebody shows up to an open source project with a gigantic new feature that took months to write ?
Who has the time to review thousands of lines of code ?
What if there was a bad design decision made early in the process — does it even make sense to point it out ?
Dropping code - bombs on communities is rarely good for the project : the team is either forced to reject it outright , or accept it and deal with a giant opaque blob that is hard to understand , change , or maintain .
It moves the project decidedly in one direction without much discussion or consensus .
And yet over and over , I ’m gathering stories that point to the fact that programmers do not want to write code out in the open .
Programmers do n’t want their peers to see mistakes or failures .
They want to work privately , in a cave , then spring “ perfect ” code on their community , as if no mistakes had ever been made .
I do n’t think it ’s hubris so much as fear of embarrassment .
Rather than think of programming as an inherently social activity , most coders seem to treat it as an arena for personal heroics , and will do anything to protect that myth .
They ’re fine with sharing code , as long as they present themselves as infallible , it seems .
Maybe it ’s just human nature .
Check out some of these stories I ’ve collected :
Requests at the Google I/ O booth :
A couple of weeks ago when my team was at the Google I/O conference , we ran a booth demonstrating our Open Source Project Hosting service .
Over and over , we kept getting requests like this :
“ Can you guys please give subversion on Google Code the ability to hide specific branches ? ”
“ Can you guys make it possible to create open source projects that start out hidden to the world , then get ‘ revealed ’ when they ’re ready ? ”
Translation : “ I do n’t want people to see my work - in - progress until it ’s perfect . ”
: A couple of weeks ago when my team was at the Google I/O conference , we ran a booth demonstrating our Open Source Project Hosting service .
Over and over , we kept getting requests like this : Requests on the Google Code mailing list : Sometimes users need their googlecode.com svn repositories wiped clean .
Legitimate reasons include the accidental commit of sensitive data , or the need to load code history in from a different svn repository .
But most of the time we get ( invalid ) requests like this :
“ Hi , I want to rewrite all my code from scratch , can you please wipe all the history ? ” Translation : “ I do n’t want people to be able to find my old code , it ’s too embarrassing . ”
Call it vanity , call it insecurity … the bottom line is that coders want prior mistakes or failures to be erased from history .

Code - reviews taken as personal attacks .
Fitz tells a funny anecdote about a friend of his who went from the open source world to a corporate software job .
Vastly paraphrased :
During his first week , he started emailing friendly code reviews to each of his coworkers , receiving strange stares in turn .
Eventually his boss called him into his office : “ You know , you really need to stop with the negative energy .
Your peers say that you ’re constantly criticizing everything they do . ”
Moral : not only is code review not the norm in corporate environments , most programmers are unable to separate their fragile egos from the code they write .
Repeat after me : you are not your code !
.
Fitz tells a funny anecdote about a friend of his who went from the open source world to a corporate software job .
Vastly paraphrased : Distributed version control — in a cave .
A friend of mine works on several projects that use git or mercurial .
He gave me this story recently .
Basically , he was working with two groups on a project .
One group published changes frequently …
“ … and as a result , I was able to review consistently throughout the semester , offering design tweaks and code reviews regularly .
And as a result of that , [ their work ] is now in the mainline , and mostly functional .
The other group [ … ]
I have n’t heard a peep out of for 5 months .
Despite many emails and IRC conversations inviting them to discuss their design and publish changes regularly , there is not a single line of code anywhere that I can see it . [ … ]
Last weekend , one of them walked up to me with a bug [… ] and I finally got to see the code to help them debug .
I failed , because there are about 5000 lines of crappy code , and just reading through a single file I pointed out two or three major design flaws and a dozen wonky implementation issues .
I had admonished them many times during these 5 months to publish their changes , so that we ( the others ) could take a look and offer feedback … but each time met with stony silence .
I do n’t know if they were afraid to publish it , or just do n’t care .
But either way , given the code I ’ve seen , the net result is 5 wasted months . ”
Before you scream ; yes yes , I know that the potential for cave - hiding and writing code bombs is also possible with a centralized version control system like Subversion .
But my friend has an interesting point : “ I think this failure is at least partially due to the fact that [ DVCS ] makes it so damn easy to wall yourself into a cave .
Had we been using svn , I think the barrier to caving would have been too high , and I ’d have seen the code . ”
In other words , yes , this was fundamentally a social problem .
A team was embarrassed to share code .
But because they were using distributed version control , it gave them a sense of false security .
“ See , we ’re committing changes to our repository every day … making progress ! ”
If they had been using Subversion , it ’s much less likely they would have sat on a 5000 line patch in their working copy for 5 months ; they would have had to share the work much earlier .
Moral : even though one should n’t depend on technical solutions to social problems , default tool behaviors matter a lot .
This was my main theme way back when I wrote about the risks of distributed version control .
OK , so what ’s the conclusion here ?
People are scared of sharing their unfinished work , plain and simple .
I know this is n’t headline news to most people , but I really think I ’ve been in deep denial about this .
I ’m so used to throwing my creative output up for constant criticism , that I simply expect everyone else to do it as well .
I think of it as the norm , and I ca n’t comprehend why someone would n’t want to do that … and yet clearly , the growing popularity of distributed version control shows just how thrilled people are to hide their work from each other .
It ’s the classic “ testimonial ” for systems like git ( taken from a blog comment ) :
“ Do n’t tell me I should cooperate with other people at the beginning and publish my modification as early as possible .
I do cooperate with other people but I do want to do some work alone sometimes . ”
Hm , okay .
Please just do n’t work alone for too long !
Sidetracking a wee bit , I think this is why I prefer Mercurial over Git , having done a bit of research and reading on both systems .
Git leans much more heavily towards cave - hiding , and I do n’t like that .
For example , the ‘ git rebase ’ command is a way of effectively destroying an entire line of history : very powerful , sure , but it ’s also a way of erasing your tracks .
Rather than being forced to merge your branch into a parent line , just pretend that your branch was always based on the latest parent line !
Another example : when it comes to pushing and pulling changesets , Mercurial ’s default behavior is to exchange all history with the remote repository , while git ’s default behavior is to only push or pull a single branch — presumably one that the user has deemed fit for sharing with the public .
In other words , git defaults to all work being private cave - work , and is happy to destroy history .
Mercurial shares everything by default , and cannot erase history .
I know this post has been long , but let me stand on my soapbox for a moment .
Be transparent .
Share your work constantly .
Solicit feedback .
Appreciate critiques .
Let other people point out your mistakes .
You are not your code .
Do not be afraid of day - to - day failures — learn from them .
( As they say at Google , “ do n’t run from failure — fail often , fail quickly , and learn . ” )
Cherish your history , both the successes and mistakes .
All of these behaviors are the way to get better at programming .
If you do n’t follow them , you ’re cheating your own personal development .
Phew , I feel better now .

This project by HC Gilje has found its home in the woods of Lillehammer Norway .
Part of the UT - 21 project that invited 7 Polish and 7 Norwegian artists to work outside galleries in Norway .
By using low energy xbee wireless radios in conjunction with the Arduino platform , the artist was able to create a mesh network .
The birds peck every 5 minutes .
In between pecking and at night they are asleep to conserve energy .
The actual woodpeckers consist of the circuitry , an actuator that hits a wooden block and a small curved metal roof .
The amazing part is that it took 15 minutes for an actual live woodpecker to end up on a tree next to one of these fake ones .
Probably completely confused the live bird .

I ’ve put together a list of ten tips and tricks you can use to add some flavor to your game when creating and portraying the NPCs that interact with the PCs .
The NPCs , after all , are what actually lends most of the depth and character ( pun intended ) to a campaign world during play .
If they ’re all cardboard cutouts and cookie cutter clones , the game lacks a lot of the flavor that might otherwise make it memorable .
When you need inspiration for how to imagine an original and unique NPC personality , draw examples from co-workers , classmates , and other people not among your fellow gamers and their friends .
Obviously , if your fellow gamers and their friends are your classmates , you may have to adjust the list of candidates to exclude them .
This keeps your NPCs from merely being the result of spiteful and mocking caricatures , or from accidentally insulting someone — among other potential problems .
When you want an NPC to provide a humorous reference to someone familiar to your players , draw inspiration from celebrities ( and the characters they play , if they ’re actors of some sort ) .
You might also draw inspiration from pictures you ’ve seen .
Visual stimuli such as paintings by talented fantasy artists serve as excellent grist for NPC concepts .
Build concepts off characters from non-fantasy fiction .
My favorite example is actually that of a PC being inspired by the idea of playing a Batman type of character in D&D .
The idea was initially to play the concept as a paladin , but by the time we were done with it the player had settled on the monk class .
Avoid silly voices .
If you ’re a talented enough actor to actually fit unique mannerisms and speech patterns into portrayals of NPCs without hamming it up too badly , go for it — but unless your intent is to run a comedy game , you might want to avoid doing a campy overdone French accent or doing the Diablo merchant ’s Scottish “ Wot c’n ah dew fer ye ! ? ” brogue .
In most games , it ’s better to have an immersive atmosphere to your game than memorable cartoon voices that break the mood of a tense encounter by either embarrassing yourself or making people snicker at your Bill Clinton impression .
Get some detailed information about your players ’ characters ’ personality quirks — pet peeves , potent desires , strange habits , and so on .
Draw inspiration from them when making NPCs .
If you think you ’re weak at making NPCs who will disagree with or stand up to PCs , focus a little on NPCs whose pet peeves match the PCs ’ habits , and vice versa .
In general , just find ways to play on the PCs ’ personality quirks via your NPCs .
Make sure your players have some kind of idea of their characters ’ backgrounds .
Consider that , every once in a while , a coincidental meeting with someone or some thing from a PC ’s past can add some punch to an encounter — or create an entire encounter in and of itself .
If you suddenly find you need to save the PCs from certain doom because everybody was rolling poorly while you kept rolling 20s for the kobolds they were supposed to be able to wipe out in short order , using someone from a PC ’s past as your deus ex machina to rescue them ( and subsequently to draw them into some other adventure hook , thanks to this chance meeting ) makes you look like a GM who plans ahead brilliantly rather than one who is really bad at fudging rolls effectively .
This also shakes loose the usual expectation that all background NPCs are enemies , murder victims who must be avenged , hostages , or forgotten entirely .
Keep track of your PCs ’ chance meetings and NPC traveling companions .
The fact someone is no longer part of a given adventure does n’t mean he or she ca n’t show up again later and lend some familiarity and color to the game .
Just as the game can be made more interesting by bringing in NPCs from a character ’s background , so too can you do the same thing with NPCs from earlier game sessions who “ just happen ” to be in the same part of the world .
Such NPCs from earlier sessions can also serve as more deus ex machina saviors — and an earlier session ’s friend might be more fun if he or she turns up later as an enemy thanks to unfortunate circumstance , lending some humanity to the PCs ’ foes .
Let an enemy get away now and then .
They do n’t all have to fight to the death .
Plan out escape tactics in advance for NPCs , and trigger points ( maybe having lost a certain number of hit points , or a certain number of rounds having passed , for instance ) for fleeing .
Keep in mind that even if your PCs are getting their butts kicked , the enemy is probably also unhappy with some hit point losses ( or even friends dying around them ) — so you can save your PCs from accidentally overpowered NPCs by having the NPCs flee .
Then , for an interesting twist on the recurring NPC idea , maybe you can have a former enemy show up later and save the PCs ’ collective bacon because the former enemy happens to be on the same side of a new and different conflict .

When we think of alarm clocks , they are usually meant to wake us up at a specific set time , so we could start our day or get ready for a certain occasion .
This may be the common concept of alarm clocks , but would n’t an alarm that keeps us awake also be beneficial ?
Many of us have been in a few dangerous driving conditions , where we were extremely tired and keeping awake would not just get us to our destination quicker but keep us alive .
On a lighter sense , there are also gamers that play for hours upon hours and cannot ‘ afford ’ themselves the time to nap .
A third example where we would like to stay awake is a studious environment with individuals who are attempting to pass a White Night of studying and find it difficult to follow through because of the tremendous lack of sleep .
None of these examples are meant to condone such acts or habits , but many still experience them and choose to .
If you must go through such times and staying awake is necessary and desired , then there is the Anti Sleep Driving Alarm from ThinkGeek.com
.
The Anti Sleep Driving Alarm is meant to keep you awake .
It is not set by a specific dead time or lack of activity but by the tilt of your head .
The device sits nicely behind your ear during your action ( driving , gaming , reading , etc. ) and senses when you are getting really drowsy by the tilt of your head .
In order to wake you , alarm you of the situation , and snap you out of the dreamy state , a high pitched alarm sounds off if your head tilts more than 30 degrees .
Again , I do not recommend driving once you are tired and fatigued , and rest is probably the best remedy in such a state .
Unfortunately , we do n’t always do what is good for us and casually think we can outsmart our own bodies and minds .
In case you want to be ready for those certain times , the Anti Sleep Driving Alarm may be able to keep you awake and ready , so you can finish the task you set out to do …hopefully not anything that could cause harm in case you do actually fall asleep .
An athlete ’s fridge and cabinets should be stocked full of nutritious , muscle building , healthy foods .
The biggest problem with that is the fact that today ’s economy does not allow most of us to spend as freely as we used to in order to eat healthily but it ’s definitely easier when you budget with a spreadsheet template .
It is much harder these days to spend $ 200 a week on bodybuilding food than it was 10 years ago .
Besides , most of us want to squirrel away as much loot as possible so we can retire early .
Also , I do n’t know about you , but I do n’t want to spend an hour a day preparing food .
I ’m not trying to cook a chicken every day for lunch .
I do n’t have time to whip up a 7 veggie , 2 cheese omelet ’s every morning .
However , the reality is that we need lots of healthy foods to helps us build muscle and lose fat .
That being said , let ’s examine how we can eat properly while minimizing the grocery bill and food preparation time .
Here are 22 tips to help you to quickly eat healthy on a budget .
Whole foods are cheaper and more nutritious than processed foods .
Try to stock up on cheap protein sources , as they are the foods that will most likely build muscle rather than be stored as fat .
Here are some examples : Proteins : frozen chicken breasts , fish in a can , cottage cheese , yogurt , eggs , whey protein , and milk .
: frozen chicken breasts , fish in a can , cottage cheese , yogurt , eggs , whey protein , and milk .
Carbs : whole grain pasta , brown rice , uncooked oats , beans , fruits , and veggies .
: whole grain pasta , brown rice , uncooked oats , beans , fruits , and veggies .
Fats : olive oil , flax seeds , real butter , natural peanut butter , and assorted nuts .
Frozen fruits are easy to thaw , and can be eating with yogurt , cottage cheese , or alone as a snack .
Store them in the freezer and they wo n’t go bad , plus they were probably frozen fresh and so they are still packed with nutrients .
Frozen vegetables are cheap , can be stored for long periods of time in the freezer , and are easy and quick to cook in a pinch .
As with frozen fruit , save time with these pre-washed , pre-cut foods .
Fruits and veggies in - season , are cheaper than any other time of the year .
You will also find that food grown in season is more nutritious and tends to taste better .
Check this link to find out when certain fruits and vegetables are in season .
Supplements tend to be cheaper , quicker , and easier , although I have to admit that whole food is better .
All the same , use supplements when you ’re pressed for time , or if you just ca n’t afford the whole food version .
Here are some examples of healthy supplements : Protein Powder : Optimum nutrition protein powder is the highest quality powder that you can get in bulk .
I wo n’t offer a free trial on this one .
Just take my word for it and buy Optimum Nutrition , you wo n’t be sorry .
Essential Fats : Pharma Omega is high - quality omega - 3 fish oil that you can pick up inexpensively online .
There are also plenty of options at your local whole - foods store or even Walmart .
Multi-Vitamins : I found an obscure , pretty tight multi-vitamin that is much better than your hard , white Centrum or generic vitamins that you can buy at Walmart .
12 - in- One Soft - Gel Multi-Vitamin has everything you need , so you can fuel your body right with more than 117 nutrients , 72 trace minerals , and 47 fruit and vegetable concentrate .
These soft - gels are much easier to swallow than many of the large vitamin pills I ’ve purchased in the past .
Anti-Oxidants : Read this article on the Extreme Acai Berry weight - loss superfood , and I think you ’ll be able to understand why this is your best anti-oxidant supplement .
Generic and store - brand foods are often much cheaper than brand name foods and are often secretly made by the same companies that make the brand named versions .
Even if they taste slightly different , make the switch today and you ’ll be used to the change within a couple of meals .
Buying in bulk will save money every time .
You will easily find such foods as pasta , rice , oats , and frozen chicken breasts for sale in bulk .
Especially look for promotions and sales , where you can get twice as much food for the price of one .
When buying online , you will get free shipping and great discounts when you buy in bulk .
Calorie dense foods are great for gaining weight .
Buy foods like whole milk , nuts , potatoes , brown rice , whole grain pasta & uncooked oats because they are filling , healthy and cheap .
Buy age - discounted foods .
After one day , grocery stores often discount bakery goods by up to 70 % .
After a couple of days , they will discount meat products by the same 70 % .
Buy several pounds of meat and bread before it reaches its expiration date , and store it in your freezer .
Local farms or farmers ’ markets will sell fresh , nutritious foods .
Often when you buy in bulk you ’ll get some extra free goods .
Minimize travel time .
Try to buy as much as you can from 1 - 2 locations , whether that location is online or the local grocery store or the local farm .
Often you can order all your supplements and oils online , then get the rest of what you need at the Hannaford ’s down the street , picking up some fresh fruits and veggies at the farm stand along the way .
Filter and mix your own beverages .
By filtering and drinking tap water , and by mixing up your own drinks like Crystal Lite and protein shakes , you ’ll save a fortune .
Bottled water is just glorified tap water anyway .
Cut and save coupons .
You will find them in newspapers , magazines , and on the back of supermarket receipts .
Grocery stores offer special sales for customers with membership cards .
I know for sure that Shaws does this .
It only takes about 3 minutes to sign up , so just do it .
Compare prices of competitive brands by checking the unit price .
Often the biggest package by the store brand product will be the cheapest item .
Plan to lose weight by eating fewer calories .
Eat less , buy less , spend less .
Make a shopping list so that you can shop with a plan .
Write down everything you need for your diet , for the next 2 weeks , and buy only those items .
Make sure to either shop alone , or shop with someone that shares your commitment to diet and savings .
Avoid taking the kids into the store at all costs !
Never shop hungry as this will make you want to buy items that are not on your list , especially junk food .
Bring food with you rather than buying it when you ’re out .
Fast food is bad for you , and healthy commercial food is expensive .
By preparing your own food , you can control portion sizes and ingredients .
Bring whole meals and snacks too .
Prepare your food in advance : for the week , all at once ; or prepare your food for the next day , at night .
You ’ll find that you can save time by cooking meat for the week , on Sunday .
Use spices and sauces with low carbs to make it all so tasty .
Try some of the healthy recipes on Project Swole , or purchase a tight cookbook like Gourmet Nutrition .
Start a garden !
This way you can control chemicals and pesticides , and all you ’ll ever have to buy is seeds .
Invest in plants and trees that grow veggies and fruit , and you ’ll be living well all spring , summer , and fall .
The ultimate solution : start a farm !
Grow all the fruits and veggies you need .
Get chickens , pigs , and cows to supply you with free meat , eggs , and milk .
Sell the excess food at the market to make money to buy what you ca n’t grow yourself .
The Harsh Reality
You can follow this list to a T and still end up spending over your budget .
Face the facts : if you want to eat healthily you have to pony up the dough .
If you do n’t have enough dough , it might be time for a second job , a new job , or maybe a new career .
If you do n’t work , do n’t go to school , are not disabled , and you do n’t take care of kids full - time , stop reading my blog you lazy free - loader .

On August 1st , 2008 , starting in the morning , over northern Canada , observers on Earth could watch this years only total solar eclipse .
While a partial eclipse could be seen over a larger area , the shadow of totality passed over Greenland , Norway and Russia , then evaporated into the night sky over China .
Here you will find a collection of photographs of this eclipse , and people here on Earth , taking it all in .

On September 6 , a poster named 我是农家 女 ( “ I Am A Peasant Girl ” ) posted on Sina : “ Late 70s Peasant Girl ’s hopeless survival , would rather be a mistress than marry a poor person . ”
I know that after seeing this topic , you will all scold me , but may those who have the energy to scold me please carefully finish reading the content below , then consider if I should be scolded .
I was born in a remote hamlet in the north of China .
I have heard from someone , who never been to the genuine villages , that the countryside is very nice .
But in fact , no public road was built and the nearest bus stop is 20 kilometres away , so we always had to walk on foot or ride a bicycle to get out of the village .
The street in the village was made of soil and was not flat .
On a sunny day , wind with sound and soil blew you .
On a rainy day , rain with the mud poured you .
The mud on the road was added with shit from animals raised by villagers , because animals always shit on the road but not in their own country yard to keep it tidy and clean .
No fresh vegetables were supplied to the villagers in the whole year because only radishes and cabbage were planted there .
It also had sweet potato , if that is a vegetable .
So , as dishes , what they could have were only salted radishes and cabbage .
Some may ask , why did we not fry ?
The truth was that there was not much cooking oil for frying because of poverty , so fried dishes were always rare for them except in the case of Spring Festival or when some relatives come for dinner .
I remember I had my first “ you tiao ” [ a fried bread stick ] in the dining hall at my university .
And health care was not ensured either .
Take my grandpa for example , he could n’t help but wait for death once he fell sick .
After he was sent to the hospital ran by the State , they refused to diagnose my grandpa even though we knelt down begging them to cure him .
The reason was simply because we did not have 2 yuan for medicine .
We could do nothing but see my grandpa die in the hospital .
Some may say that the countryside is developing these days .
But the truth is that there has been almost no change for my village since I was born .
I really cannot say whether change will happen or not in my life .
I was born at the end of the 1970s .
We had 5 children , including me , 3 sisters and 1 brother .
Some people may wonder why my mother had so many children if my family was so poor ?
These people may not understand China clearly .
These days , only really poor people or rich people can have more than one child , and we belonged to the poor group .
In the countryside , in my opinion , there are 2 reasons for having more children .
First , no entertainment in the countryside .
So after working in the daylight , sometimes having sex on the “ kang ” ( bed made by soil and brick ) at night may be the only amusing thing for them .
Although they did not want more children , no one told them effective means of contraception .
I saw with my own eyes that my mother wanted to abort using tied rope or eating tobacco ash for contraception .
The second reason was the traditional concept and environment of the countryside .
There must be a man in every home because working in the countryside is so hard that only men can deal with them , so people in the countryside always held the concept that birthing a boy in every generation is necessary for the continuance of the family .
If you could not give birth to a boy , you would be looked down upon .
Before my brother was born , my mother was always looked down upon by my family members , I was always hit by other children and had the nickname of ‘ jue - hu - guo , ” meaning “ no boy no generation continuance . ”
The goodness of the farm is not what you think because of the poor and narrow opinions of countryside life .
At that time , there were several children in every family , and every child struggled for subsistence without caring for others .
I remembered that when I was 5 years old , my parents had gone to work farming , I took care of my sister at home , and one of my neighbours came to borrow a kitchen knife but also secretly stole a dinner pan .
After my parents came back , they found the pan missing , so they went to that neighbour , but failed to get the pan back because my neighbour refused to acknowledge that he took the pan away .
The result of this was that I was beat fiercely by my parents and we cooked without the pan for a long period .
And another time when I was 9 years old , I saw a sister - in - law in my village stealing the cotton from my uncle ’s field , then she was caught by my uncle and warned that he would show villagers what she did .
In order to prevent this , she promised that she could have sex with my uncle if my uncle would set her free .
Then my uncle had sex with her in the field .
I did not know what they did when I was 9 years old , but after I realized the meaning of what happened , it made me feel sick every time I thought of it .
But , in the end , what they did was discovered and spread in my village .
My uncle probably told some people , but that sister - in - law thought I had told my mother and that my mother spread it to the villagers , so she came to the gate of my home and scolded for several days .
After that , I was beat by her on my way home and she hurt my mouth .
When my mother asked what happened with my mouth , I lied that I was not careful and had a fall .
I did not think to tell them the truth because I was afraid that my mother would go quarrel with her and cause a bigger conflict .
I knew that , at that time , it was difficult for my mother to raise us .
In brief , there are good people and bad people anywhere , and farmers are not synonymous with goodness either .
I was the first and only female undergraduate in my village .
As a girl , it was a miracle that I could get into university from a place where boys could not always get an education .
My father made all of this come true .
My father is a veteran , his outside experiences led him to send me to be educated .
His original intention was that I could read the characters and distinguish the toilet .
At that time , we had to go to the school approximately 10 kilometres away .
There were dozens of children for primary school , but after graduating from primary school , I was the only one that persisted with studying .
I had 2 reasons for that , one was that I had worked so hard .
I always represented my school to compete with others from primary school to middle school , so my father might get the hope of getting out of the countryside through my excellent performance .
Second reason was that when I was in school , I could do some work made of grass at the same time .
We called it “ cao - bian , ” which can be used for the straw making .
In that period , a “ cao - bian ” could sell for 0.2 yuan , and I could knit 5 .
I never did my homework or notes in class , I earned money when I was at school .
This is another reason that I could continue my education .
But my 3 other sisters paid the price by dropping their studies for my continued education .
My youngest sister went to the brick plant with my father to carry bricks , my thin and weak father pulled the handcart and she assisted him by pushing it .
They had to carry the brick to the place 2 kilometres away , and the whole process only could earn them 0.2 yuan .
Then I went to middle school .
I lived at school and far away from home , so I stopped knitting the “ cao - bian . ”
I was always the youngest student , because I had skipped several grades .
I was also mature for my age because I knew that it is very difficult to get an education , and if I could get out of school early , I could start earning money earlier .
So I got into campus at the age of 16 .
I chose to go to university because of the existing financial support from the government for students in campus .
If you could get a high score , you could pay less for your education .
I could get 40 yuan to 60 yuan for living expenses every month .
I spent nearly 600 yuan when I got into university .
A fat pig my father had been raising for a long time was sold for this 600 yuan .
If it was like the present standards , it would have been impossible for me to continue my campus life at that time .
Although I got 50 yuan every month , I could save 20 yuan to post back for my family .
I ate very simply every day , I never bought clothes and wore the uniform every day .
I never used makeup either .
The campus life made me realize how degrading being poor was .
I had no friends on campus , first because I was younger and did not have similar topics with my dorm -mates .
We rarely had a chance to chat with each other because I always came back to the dorm late after working to earn money to live .
So , it might be unbelievable to you that I did not recognize all my classmates completely in 4 years ’ studying , but this is the truth .
They were enjoying their lives on campus but I was making a living .
Second reason was the different experience of growing up .
At that time , usually only those whose families were well - off could get into university , so my classmates could not understand my life and also looked down upon my dress .
I remembered that a mother of my classmates even demanded to adjust the dorm for her daughter , since she thought her baby daughter could not live with a little beggar like me .
In fact , my clothes were not dirty , they were tidy and neat but old .
I had a strong capacity for self - care , I knew how to dress up myself and clean my clothes , but I was so poor that I could not buy new ones .
What I wore was usually given by my relatives .
And if it was unsuitable for me , I would pitch it and post back home for sisters .
Some clothes had to be re-seamed for others , such as underwear , if it became old .
I was good at sewing and I even sewed a beautiful skirt for my sister out of a sheet thrown out by my classmate .
The fine working made those who ever looked upon me all supposed that it was as same as the one they bought .
The governmental policy changed when I graduated from university scarcely .
They would not take responsibility for the jobs of graduates who had to find jobs by themselves .
It was impossible for me to go back to my home town , first reason was that I was no longer suitable for the life of the countryside , another one was that I would be a negative example for the villagers : 4 years ’ learning in city resulted in nothing but going back home .
This would be their excuse to persuad their children to drop learning .
I had to live in the city , and it was impossible for me , not like others , to find a suitable job slowly .
I had to find a job that could offer me dinner and a place to live , since I had no money in my pocket and I must n’t ask for money from my family either , I had to earn money by myself .
In order to earn money , I changed several jobs and cities .
My mother needed money for medicine , my brother needed money for learning and my sister needed money for skill learning .
But , I found what I earned was not enough and was not very much , even thought I was very thrifty .
My brother ’s high tuition fees of 10 thousand yuan scared me and my family extraordinarily .
We could not get the certificate of loan because the village head did not want to attest to our poverty .
Only those who were orphans or only had a single parent without self - reliance could get the certificate , but my family did not belong to those categories because I had graduated from university and had a job to earn money .
In fact , the reason of this was so simple .
The village head envied 2 undergraduates in my family and he deliberately wanted to make it difficult for my family because he was always the king of the village .
I could not borrow money from my neighbours firstly because they were so poor too , second because they were not fervent and kind - hearted in that kind of environment .
If you were poorer than your neighbours or relatives , they would look down upon you because they were afraid that you would come to borrow money ; but if you were rich , they would come to please you for benefits from you .
My family was poor because of the high tuition fees of my brother .
Guys without education went out to work for construction and earned some money , and if it was busy in the village , they could come back for busy season .
But I and my brother could do nothing after graduating from university because we had not enough power to do some works in the countryside .
After that , I followed my father to the university where my brother was studying and brought some presents to seek help from the vice - chancellor .
He promised us to let us pay the tuition fees by stages .
However , the money was not enough either .
At that time , I feel how difficult a person subsisted , I even thought of suicide .
I just wanted to study hard to find a good job and earn money for my family before , but in fact , a girl from the village , without good - looks and English skills ( in schools of villages , English was not a course ) , trying to find a good job was so difficult .
I was not willing to indulge myself , so I felt everything was meaningless without aims .
The idea of suicide always emerged in my brain , but if you wanted to die , you had to choose some way that benefited yourself .
In order to get enough money for my brother and my family , I could sacrifice my life .
Finally , being hit by a car was my choice .
In a tangled street , I found an expensive car to collide with , I also put my ID in pocket , if this would come true , my family would get some compensation from the owner of the expensive car who would never care about it .
This idea , however , was so impudent , I did really .
When I went to collide with the car , the driver stopped his car quickly without injuring me .
Instead of dying after being hit by a car , I was beaten damnably by him .
But after his angry hitting , he took me to the hospital .
What I said may be beyond someone , but everything I have described is the truth , I described the whole story so simply , but this is the truth and most valuable memory in my life .
The driver sent me to the hospital and asked me if I wanted to die .
I nodded my head and told him my story , then he gave me five thousands yuan and left .
This was the man I met who helped me the most , I did not know what his name was or what he did , but I always wanted to find him to thank him .
But before I found him , he was detained by police for drug trade .
I got his name after the police came to find me when investigating him , and the name I will remember for my whole life .
Please do not suspect the truth of this story , though I may not have described everything very well .
After the case was published on the local newspaper I knew he got life imprisonment , and I remembered the police that investigated me .
Then I went to jail to find him , I got nothing but was conned 100 yuan by the police who were working in the jail .
Up to now , I did not know the place where he was kept .
I am in Shanghai now , I came here because I heard the salaries here are high .
But as a girl who is from the countryside , nearly at the age of 30 and without English skills , finding a job with high salary is almost impossible .
Even as an officer in a company , the salary was only 1800 yuan without bonus .
I share a rented apartment with others and have to pay 600 yuan every month for it .
I also had to post 800 yuan to my family and that left me 400 yuan for my daily life , including dinner , traffic and others expenses .
In order to save money , I always have one meal a day .
The most terrible thing for me is being sick .
Once I had fallen sick , not only did I lose my salary , I also failed to pay the rent and medicine cost .
The medicine cost in Shanghai is high .
I fainted and was sent to the hospital because of malnutrition .
After I got to the hospital , I woke up and the doctors said I was OK .
But doctors checked me a lot and gave me a bill of more than 1000 yuan .
It really was a dreadful bill for me .
Now , I lost my job because of China national identity card .
I was fired during the Olympic Games period because I got my national identity card when I was in school and now it is expired .
I even went back to my village to keep my hukou , but they refused me for the reason that my hukou did not belong there because of my education .
Then , I went to the town for that , but I got nothing either .
So I just have the hukou booklet which cost me 200 yuan .
Without a job , my financial resources will be cut off and I may be evicted by my landlord since I cannot pay the rent , and I may die of hunger .
Before my death , I summarize my miserable life was just because of poverty .
I rented an apartment with 3 other girls when I first came to Shanghai .
But we have completely different lives after several years .
One of us has become a concubine to a man from Hong Kong .
She lives in a top house , wears famous brands , has expensive dinners , and she gets spending money of 10,000 yuan per month .
Another one went on the streets in the night clubs .
She will not worry about her bread and cheese , however , being a prostitute is always disgusting .
The third one married a guy from the countryside , they worked hard together and earn 5000 yuan a month .
Although they have to rent an apartment , they feel happy .
Their biggest dream is to earn enough money to buy a house in their hometown .
It is just a dream to buy a house in Shanghai for them .
But now , her husband is ill and was fired by his company .
He is recuperating at home now .
There are no safeguards for people who do not belong to this city so she has to pay the rent , water and gas fee .
She also has to spend money for her husband ’s medicine with her little salary .
Working during the day , washing and making dinner at evening , the difficult life changed her a lot .
They do not dare to have a baby because they can not afford the cost of raising a baby .
It is so hard for her but her husband ’s mother always asks for money , because it was very difficult for his family to help her husband graduate from university , so they need her to return what they have paid for that .
This girl once told me that if you want to marry , you had better not marry a poor man , because 2 poor people will only get a poorer life , so you should marry a man who has an apartment and you would not have to fear eviction at any time .
I am not a concubine because I have no chance to be .
But if someone wants me , I think I will be a concubine for him .
What I ask for is not so high , I just want to find a place to live and have every meal .
I think this is better than a prostitute .
Comments from Sina :
legend张 :
Terrible fate .
However , being open - minded , if you want to be a concubine , you still need to find a good man .
chutianpeng1 :
Were all concubines and mistresses forced by reality to be what they are ?
If they were really forced to be helpless , then perhaps they deserve some sympathy ; otherwise if your life has not been forced to that level , just lead a normal life !
老头 ( lao tou ) :
After reading your experience , I feel very bad , I also am similar to you , but I am very willing to help you , please contact me after reading this message , QQ351720201 .
缘思梦境 ( yuan si meng jing ) :
Ai !
This is just how society is these days , without money you are nothing , with money you are part of the elites .
Good luck !
I will always support you .
一杯咖啡半包烟 ( yi bei ka fe ban bao yan ) :
You have also been scared by poverty .
To be honest , who is willing to be a concubine / mistress ?
济南浪溪河 ( jin an lang xi he ) :
Life really is hopeless sometimes , I can understand your suffering , hope you can stay strong , strong , and more strong .
tgrwf1 :
To tell the truth , you writing this kind of hing as a Chinese university graduate is embarrassing to Chinese university graduates .
Second , according to when you said you were born and when you went to university , you should have graduated before 2000 .
At that time , the number of university graduates were not many , and many could participate in exams for local government positions .
Those test subjects should not have been difficult for a humanities student , so why did you not participate in this kind of test ?
You so - called university student makes people suspicious .
xxx2608 :
A female university graduate , and you are afraid of dying of hunger ?
My child suffers from congenital immunodeficiency disease , cannot be cured , must depend on injected immunoglobulin his whole life , an injection once every four week , each injection needs 3 immunoglobulin , each 400 yuan , the dosage increasing with his age and weight .
We are from the countryside , without any insurance , we are the truly helpless !
霜冷青河 ( shuang leng qing he ) :
Those who are criticizing the poster have never personally experienced what she has gone through .
I completely understand and completely sympathize with the lou zhu ’s circumstances .
Lou zhu , if you are free we can talk , I will risk my life to help you once .
到底是鬼装的人 ( dao di shi gui zhuang de ren ) :
All I want to say is , at the time when you first got into university , China did not yet have many university students , right ?
If so , finding a job simply was effortless .
( For example , according to your educational qualifications )
Why can you not support yourself ?
This is obviously a problem with your ability , you cannot blame others or society !
吾苯善良 ( wu ben shan liang ) :
Poverty chills ambition , are you even willing to accept a wealthy but uncharitable man who keeps mistresses ?
If you cannot solve the problem of survival –go be a concubine or mistress–if you cannot solve the problem of dignity –what is the point of surviving ?
A person who is ignorant can only be happy !
But you have knowledge , can you be happy selling your dignity ?
Look before you leap .
barry :
I support you , you have integrity .
As a 80s generation university student , I profoundly know that this society requires us to have academic qualifications and skills , so I resigned from a stable job in a state owned enterprise .
A person who does not think about the future will have problems with the present .
Even though I am very poor right now , I have several opportunities to choose from , because I work very hard , spending almost 15 hours every day learning , so I am full of confidence for my future .
No matter what , do not give up hope .
青砖客 ( qing zhuan ke ) :
A lot of writing .
I can relate to your emotions .
This world may indeed be this brutal .
We have a teacher who once said :
The poor will get poorer , the rich will get richer .
So if lou zhu really has no other choice , and has thought to go become a prostitute , then it can be considered a choice of last resort .
danzhu12 :
What is a university diploma worth ?
Do not think that going to college will automatically result in a good job !
In reality , this diploma only gives you a foundation / platform .
How high you can jump , how far , depends on your own ability and diligence .
Of course , your family background and luck are also important .
Today ’s university students , actually not just university students , even the children of peasant families who have never gone to college , are all already different from those 20 years ago , with less down to earth , less able to bear headships , etc. character .
But these are exactly what is needed to enter society and what is needed to be successful ( except for those with advantageous family backgrounds ) !
diaochayuan2008 :
My wife is from the countryside , her family is very poor , and up to now her old father of over 60 - years - old must work , her mother manages the farm at home , everyday eating vegetables ( no meat ) .
She is not very pretty , but has a lot of will , studied hard , got a scholarship .
I was attracted to this , to her getting a good diploma and then finding a good job .
Marrying her , I am very satisfied .
If you are so afraid of being poor that you can throw away everything and use supporting the family as an excuse to go become a concubine / mistress , then go , and see what the result is .
I can tell you a precedent : getting rid of all previous concubines / mistresses , being gotten rid of , made a toy , no dignity , you may not fear not having food or clothes but you can only feed yourself , or even having to find for your your own food or clothes , or reversed the man uses the money you earn .
lyf_0103 :
The essence of man is an animal with thoughts .
Living is to do something meaningful , not to covet a life of pleasure .
Lou zhu cannot find a job , the feeling of being unemployed I can understand .
But you must live with integrity .
This way an employer will accept you .
If you lose your dignity , who will employ you ?
Ask yourself , who would date employ you ?

10 Ways To Make a Kick Ass Version of ‘ Space : 1999 ’
By The Geeks of Doom @ | Share Tweet By Broadcasting Brain Space : 1999 , the first major science fiction television series to follow Star Trek , deserves a second chance at life .
Space : 1999 , which ran from 1975 - 77 , chronicles the adventures of an international crew of scientists and specialists on Earth ’s Moon .
Although it was cancelled after two seasons , fans still fondly remember the series .
In light of other pop culture recycling that permeates today ’s creative content , why not see what can be reused from this series ?
As Space : 1999 begins , Commander John Koenig arrives at Moonbase Alpha , charged with ensuring the successful launch of a manned deep space probe after a series of mysterious crew deaths .
His old colleague Professor Victor Bergman is there as chief scientist and advisor , while Chief Medical Officer Dr. Helena Russell tries to determine the cause of the deaths .
The cause is determined to be radiation poisoning from unstable nuclear waste disposal sites , which explode , blasting the Moon out of Earth ’s orbit , on an unknown trajectory at unknown speed , towards open space .
The series is a story of survival , adventure , and hope as the crew of Moonbase Alpha , the only manned settlement not on the Earth , searches for a new home in space .
They encounter aliens , other humanoid civilizations , space phenomena , fearsome machines , and have several failed encounters with planets which could have provided homes for the lost Earthlings .
You might see some parallels with later series like Battlestar Galactica ( both versions ) and Star Trek : Voyager .
Despite a small but loyal fan following , Space : 1999 never achieved mainstream popularity .
The British TV series did not receive critical acclaim and the lack of popular success led to its cancellation following the end of its second season .
The science , the writing , and the acting ranged from awful to the occasional good episode .
The second season , designed to inject some action , sex appeal , and humor into the show , destroyed the moody , scary vibe that helped make the series successful in season one .
The execution fell flat most of the time and the show was cancelled after year two .
Nevertheless , Space : 1999 made a impression on 1970 ’s science fiction and it ’s still remembered with some fondness today .
The series spawned toys , lunchboxes , novels , comic books , and a series of successful fan conventions .
A fan - made film , starring one of the original Space : 1999 cast members , served as a coda to the series .
The original stars even reunited for a short 19th century parody of the show !
I ’ve watched the show at different times over the years and although I ’m more aware of its faults , I see lots of potential with the concept .
It occurred to me that if someone could ( very ) successfully remake Battlestar Galactica , why could n’t someone do the same thing with Space : 1999 ?
Heck , they ’re even trying it with Star Trek !
Why could n’t someone take the best elements of the show and them to re-imagine Space : 1999 ?
The key concept of Earth ’s Moon traveling through space would have to be preserved , as would many of the characters and conventions ( e.g. , Moonbase Alpha , Eagle transport ships , key characters like Koenig , Bergman , and Russell ) .
However , this would be a chance to do it better .
Had I the resources and finances , there are ten things that I would do to make a kick ass remake of Space : 1999 .
Change how the Moon left Earth ’s orbit .
Author Harlan Ellison put it well :
If the explosions occurred on the Dark Side of the Moon ( the side that faces away from the Earth ) , then why did n’t the Moon slam into the Earth ?
Or fracture and explode for that matter ?
And , if the Moon is moving that fast , how do small reconnaissance ships ever catch up to it ?
My solution : a space warp is created that shifts the Moon to a new position in space .
Moreover , I would make this “ shifting ” a regular event that ca n’t be prevented .
Change the meaning of 1999 .
Clearly , basing a new SF series in 1999 might be a hard sell .
However , there ’s still brand recognition that come from the name Space : 1999 .
Therefore , I would keep 1999 as a recurring value or theme in the reimagined series .
The 1999 theme would reveal itself throughout the series in several different ways :
One of the main characters will receive a secret communication on Sept. 13 , 1999 ( in honor of the date of the Moon blasting out of Earth orbit in the original series ) but the new series will be set in 2039 .
A mysterious Project 1999 will be an ongoing plot element during part of the series .
Give bigger roles and more meaning to the secondary characters , as per the reimagined Battlestar Galactica .
Minor characters like David Kano ( computer expert ) , Sandra Benes ( data analyst ) , Dr. Mathias ( physician ) , Alan Carter ( Chief Eagle Pilot ) , and Paul Morrow ( second in command of Moonbase Alpha ) could be developed to add more color to the show .
John Koenig would suffer from some form of mental illness .
This could be used to create ongoing tension and suspense in the series , i.e. , will he finally crack under the pressure ?
In the original series , Koenig was a bit uptight and aloof , but he did occasionally explode .
The continual possibility of Koeing having a breakdown would make things interesting .
Moreover , if people started to doubt his ability to lead , then it would put Paul Morrow into the spotlight and force him to make difficult choices ( loyalty to a superior officer vs. the welfare of the entire moonbase crew ) .
Give the chief medical officer a debilitating illness .
What if Helena Russell became horribly sick ?
I originally thought of cancer , but since that ’s awfully close to what happened with Laura Roslin on Battlestar Galactica , I would have Russell develop the symptoms of multiple sclerosis or the same disease that Stephen Hawking has .
Let ’s turn up the pressure a few more notches !
Compromise Prof. Victor Bergman ’s character .
Prof. Bergman was the kindly “ space uncle ” and wise old man of the original series .
I ’d like to keep that , but at the same time , I think Bergman would have to be compromised in some way .
Maybe he ’s a double agent of sorts , serving multiple agendas ?
I think he would be the one who receives the secret signal that I mention in point 2a .
Moonbase Alpha .
When I hear that name , I think “ the first moonbase . ”
What if there was more than one moonbase ?
If there were , what happened to them ?
I think the stories of other moonbases could tie in to some bigger mysteries in the new series .
Arch - enemy / nemesis .
Space : 1999 should have its equivalent of the Cylon , the Romulans , the Shadows , or the Borg .
Maybe a race of shape - shifters like the Skrull from Marvel Comics would add some excitement .
And , speaking of shapeshiftersâ€ ¦ Maya 2.0 .
Maya was a shapeshifting character introduced in the second season of Space : 1999 .
She replaced Bergman while providing a love interest for one of the other main characters .
She could be a sex- changing sexpot or another Odo .
Maybe a traitor ?
A purpose for their journey through space .
Just as Battlestar Galactica should end when the Colonials reach Earth , the journey of Earth ’s Moon through space should lead to some destination .
It does n’t have to be a physical destination , but we do need some answers !
Sometimes a great idea goes awry as a result of loss of direction or poor execution .
There were good idea seeds in Space : 1999 that really deserve a chance to flourish again .
Hopefully some brilliant creative crew may someday read this article and use it to launch a new , better Space : 1999 .

As ‘ Space : 2099 ’
By By Susan Duclos Sep 28 , 2008 in World Scotland Yard has foiled an alleged attempt by Islamic extremists to assassinate Dutch publisher Martin Rynja , because of his intention to publish a controversial novel featuring Muhammad and his child bride Aisha .
According to officials the motive behind the alleged plot was because Rynja 's publishing firm , Gibson Square , is preparing to publish a romantic novel about Aisha , child bride of the Prophet Muhammad .
The book is called Jewel of Medina and it was withdrawn from publication last month by Random House because they feared a violent reaction by “ a small radical segment ” of Muslims after receiving information saying the book could incite violence .
Random
House reacted after Islamic scholars objected to its contents , saying it treated the wife of the Prophet as a sex object .
One of them , Denise Spellberg , of the University of Texas at Austin , described the novel as “ soft - core pornography ” , referring to a scene in which Muhammad consummates his marriage to Aisha .
She called it “ a declaration of war ” and a “ national security issue ” .
The author of the book , Sherry Jones , received death threats after Random House withdrew the book from publication , yet she maintains the book is not disrespectful to Islam , saying , " Anyone who reads the book will not be offended .
I wrote the book with the utmost respect for Islam . "
After Random House withdrew , Gibson Square evidently agreed to publish the book and the Metropolitan police were tipped off with information saying Martin Rynja would be the target of an attack .
After receiving the tip , the police then went undercover and started following the suspected terror gang arresting them after they put a " petrol bomb " through the door of Rynja 's north London home .
The fire brigade smashed down the front door and put the fire out and the undercover police arrested three men who are alleged to have been responsible for the attempted murder plot .
A
Met spokesman said three men had been arrested in “ a preplanned intelligence - led operation ” at about 2.25 am on Saturday .
Two of the suspects were arrested in the street outside Rynja ’s four - storey townhouse in Lonsdale Square , Islington , while the third was stopped by officers in an armed vehicle near Angel Tube station .
They were being questioned yesterday on suspicion of the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism , a spokesman said .
It is believed that Rynja is now under police guard .
Sherry Jones ' agent Natasha Kern , expressed shock when she learned of the attack and said the book had been " misinterpreted by its critics and did not contain sex scenes , " further stating , " I honestly believe that if people read the book they will see it is not disrespectful of Muhammad , and moderate Muslims will not be offended .
I do n’t want anyone to risk their lives but we could never imagine that there would be some madmen who would do something like this .
I ’m so sad about this act of terrorism .
Moderate Muslims will suffer because of a few radicals . ”
When asked whether she thought the book should be withdrawn as Random House had done , she replied , " That ’s up to Martin , and I still need to absorb the fact that he was at risk .
I ’m just so glad he has not been hurt . ”
The Jewel of Medina is scheduled to be published next month .
TimesOnline reports that undercover officers from Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorist command arrested three men after they put a firebomb through the door at the home of Martin Rynja .
According to officials the motive behind the alleged plot was because Rynja 's publishing firm , Gibson Square , is preparing to publish a romantic novel about Aisha , child bride of the Prophet Muhammad .
The book is called Jewel of Medina and it was withdrawn from publication last month by Random House because they feared a violent reaction by “ a small radical segment ” of Muslims after receiving information saying the book could incite violence .

The RubyFringe Videos : Vids From The Summer ’s Hottest Conference
By Peter Cooper
Remember RubyFringe , the avant - garde Ruby conference held in Canada this September ?
According to most reports , it went down as possible the best Ruby conference ever and spawned some very interesting presentations - that those of us who did n't go would n't have seen ..
Luckily , in conjunction with InfoQ , videos from RubyFringe are making it online - so far there are four to check out :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted Sen . Joe Lieberman on Wednesday for making what she called " totally irresponsible " remarks about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and warned that the Senate might retaliate by revoking Lieberman 's committee chairmanship .
Pelosi also chastised some of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's supporters for being " less than gracious " toward Obama , although she praised the New York senator for rallying behind the party 's nominee after a bitter primary fight .
Pelosi's remark in an interview with KGO Radio talk show host Ronn Owens in San Francisco is certain to anger Clinton backers , including some who are pushing to have Clinton 's name placed into nomination at the party 's convention in Denver later this month .
But the House speaker 's rebuke of Lieberman , the Connecticut Democrat - turned - independent , is likely to please Democratic activists , who are irate at Lieberman 's sharp jabs at Obama .
Campaigning for Republican John McCain in York , Pa. , on Tuesday , Lieberman appeared to question Obama 's patriotism when he called the election a choice " between one candidate , John McCain , who has always put his country first , worked across party lines to get things done , and one candidate that has not . "
Pelosi was asked by a caller on Owens ' show what could be done about the attacks from Lieberman , the Democrats ' 2000 vice presidential nominee who , though an independent , still caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate .
" You 're right , " Pelosi said .
" Joe Lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to Barack Obama .
Here we have a leader for the future , really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then , and they know it so they have to undermine him .
And one of their best weapons , of course , is someone who is considered by some to be a Democrat . "
Pelosi explained that Senate Democrats are leery of challenging Lieberman over his comments because his vote is crucial to preserving the Democrats ' 51 - 49 majority in the Senate .
But she warned that Lieberman 's top spot on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee could be in jeopardy if Democrats gain seats in the Senate in November .
" The Democrats in the Senate are in a tough spot .
They have 51 votes .
Joe Lieberman organizes with them , " she said .
" In 85 days or something , they will have five more Democrats .
They wo n't need him to make the majority .
And it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the Senate , the Democratic leadership in the Senate , does at that point in terms of Joe Lieberman 's chairmanship of his committee . "
Lieberman 's Senate spokesman could not be reached for comment late Wednesday .
Pelosi , who was on the show promoting her new book , " Know Your Power , " was also pressed about why former President Bill Clinton declined in a recent ABC News interview to say whether he thought Obama was ready to be president .
" I ca n't answer for Bill Clinton , " Pelosi said .
" It 's hard when you 're in a primary election .
Losing is very , very difficult . "
Pressed about whether Hillary Clinton could have been more gracious to Obama , the San Francisco Democrat responded , " I think Hillary Clinton has been very gracious .
I think some of her supporters have been less than gracious . "
Pelosi also offered new clues about how she might handle the touchy issue of domestic oil drilling when Congress returns in September .
After months of opposing a vote on new drilling , Pelosi seemed to reverse her stance on CNN's Larry King show Monday night .
She said she would be open to a vote on new drilling in protected areas as part of a much broader energy package .
Pelosi told
Owens the package could pair some new offshore drilling with Democratic energy proposals that Republicans have opposed , including expanding subsidies for renewable energy , revoking tax breaks to oil companies and forcing the Bush administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
" We can have a piece of offshore drilling , but we have to renegotiate the terms , " she said .
" Here we have Big Oil drilling , getting the profits , not paying the royalties .
We want to say , in a very protected way , you may be able to drill here in the context of a fuller package of renewables , and when you do , the taxpayers should benefit from that . "
In 2003 , after 13 years of research , the Human Genome Project ( HGP ) was completed .
On the one hand , it was heralded as a major scientific breakthrough , and a landmark in our biological understanding ; on the other , it was criticised on ethical and other grounds , and accused of being radically less valuable than had been claimed , most consistently by evolutionary geneticist and philosopher of science Richard Lewontin .
Bill Clinton lyrically described the goal of the project as “ learning the language in which God created life ” , but five years after completion , what exactly have we learned ?
Like Lewontin , I was highly sceptical of the value of the Human Genome Project , which seemed to be woefully naïve in its assessment of what was being attempted , although ultimately it seems some good has come from the $ 2.7 billion project – but not so much of the kind that its advocates advanced at the time .
The HGP has hammered fresh nails into the coffin of naïve belief in genetic determinism and dogmatic adaptionist philosophies , and undermined the assumptions that motivated the research in the first place .
I consider this to be a great success in terms of philosophy of science !
I originally intended to title this piece , rather cryptically : “ One Down , Four Billion to Go ” , since a first and obvious criticism of the HGP is that it does n’t map the human genome , it maps a human genome .
Much of the DNA for the public project came from an anonymous male donor from Buffalo , New York , codenamed RP11 .
One wag noted in respect of the project that once all the chromosomes were fully mapped and sequenced “ they 'll tell us everything there is to know about one French farmer and a lady from Philadelphia . ”
We ca n’t claim to have complete human genetic knowledge until we ’ve mapped a reasonable sample size , and that is n’t what ’s been done .
In fact , because of the genetic variation between individuals , there simply ca n’t be one definitive human sequence – and suggesting there can be creates serious questions about an appropriate definition for what should be considered ‘ normal ’ .
But that ’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to issues .
The HGP claims to map a complete genome , but in fact what it has focused upon is identifying the 20 - 25 thousand genes present in DNA – and this is n’t necessarily the same as the complete genome .
In fact , it ’s about 5 % of the genetic data .
Some scientists , secure in their beliefs concerning genes , think this is sufficient , but this rests on very simplistic ideas about DNA .
The non-coding regions , conventionally dismissed as “ junk DNA ” actually serve very important roles .
Putting aside the putative role in the creation of new genes I have touted previously , the non-coding DNA contains many regulatory signals that are vital to understanding the relevant biology .
To cast light upon some of the major misconceptions , I ’d like to make an analogy between the data contained within DNA and a telephone directory .
Mapping the genetic data is much like collating a list of telephone numbers – that volume of data is certainly useful , when you know what it ’s for .
But having a human gene sequence without the biological knowledge to go with it is like publishing a telephone directory without inventing the telephone .
Actually , if you examine some of the bizarrely optimistic claims concerning the possibilities of genetic engineering that might be unlocked by the Human Genome Project , the metaphor becomes something like the belief that one can work out how to build a telephone by studying the telephone directory .
There 's a similar problem here to the one I discussed previously concerning genes and behaviour : scientists had ideas about inheritance prior to Watson and Crick discovering the DNA double helix , then assumed that genes would explain everything that was known about inheritance .
This has lead to what Lewontin has called “ the doctrine of DNA ” – a belief that genes are the ultimate explanatory device , and that genes can be linked to everything in biology , psychology and beyond , that deciphering the genetic code gives us the knowledge to program our own organisms .
He parodies this by saying : “ Any computer that did as poor a job of computation as an organism does from its genetic ‘ program ’ would immediately be thrown into the trash and its manufacturer would be sued by the purchaser . ”
The genetic engineering we are currently conducting is not really akin to what a programmer does in writing a functioning utility ; it is much more like what a hacker does when they subvert an existing utility they did n’t write , and do n’t necessarily understand .
There are serious ethical issues surrounding modern genetics that stretch far beyond just the Human Genome Project .
David Heyd noted that : “ tampering with the natural biological process of species evolution and individual evolution … [ is ] a form of metaphysical trespass . ”
The Senior Editor of Science , Barbara Jasny , admitted that “ the Human Genome Project [ stretches ] the limits of the technology and the limits of our ability to ethically and rationally apply genetic information to our lives . ”
Abby Littman of Montreal ’s McGill University is another outspoken critic of the project .
She contends that “ Everything that 's been done so far is about managing the genome project instead of questioning the whole issue of whether there should be a human genome project . ”
She accuses the molecular geneticists involves of focussing on the wrong part of the problem if the goal is better health , and of not having adequate public consultation on the project .
She asks :
Why are we so busy mapping the genome ?
Why do n't we map the environment instead of mapping the genome and worry about things that really make us sick that we do n't know anything about ?
Why do we think it 's so much easier to change genes than environmental conditions that put us at risk ?
Because it 's more expensive to clean up the environment than to deal with people who are at medical risk because of the environment .
Her view is that most human disabilities happen after we are born , and are caused by accidents , injuries or environmental factors .
She also questions the eugenic implications of this kind of project : “ Do we want to live in a society where nobody is born with Down 's syndrome ?
If so , why ?
That 's an ultimate aim of these tests .
Does this make us a better society ?
I 'd like to make geneticists think about these questions as they do their work . ”
If the critics are correct that the health benefits of the HGP to the public are far lower than has been suggested , who are the benefactors of this research ?
One obvious candidate is biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies .
Lewontin notes : “ No prominent molecular biologist of my acquaintance is without a financial stake in the biotechnology business . ”
The data produced by this research could have been extremely valuable to pharmaceutical companies as a potential source of new drugs , and to other biotech companies , but even this value appears to be less than was anticipated .
Craig Venter , the president of Celera , the company which conducted the private portion of the genome mapping , stated that “ the drug industry has been saying ' one gene , one patent , one drug ' , but the uses for this approach can be counted on the fingers …
The notion that one gene equals one disease , or that one gene produces one key protein , is flying out of the window . ”
A more likely benefactor from the research are health insurance companies , who can potentially use information obtained from a sample of DNA to reject people who show genetic predisposition to certain medical conditions .
Thomas Murray suggests that “ the most important movement in the ethics of workplace genetic testing has been away from the original vision of a public health measure , to screening as a way of reducing illness - related costs with no effect on the overall incidence of disease . ”
So now we are looking at the Human Genome Project not as a great advance in health care , but as a means of insurance companies denying medical cover – the health benefits for the general public are thus worse than they were before the project began .
All this makes it sound that nothing good has come from the Human Genome Project , but as I said earlier there is a significant silver lining : by exposing the naivety of overly simplistic interpretations of genetics , the HGP has helped improve our understanding of biology by undermining old fashioned deterministic models .
Venter notes , in assessing the impact of the project his company has assisted in completing :
There are two fallacies to be avoided : determinism , the idea that all characteristics of a person are hard - wired by the genome ; and reductionism , that now the human genome is completely known it is just a matter of time before our understanding of gene functions and interactions will provide a complete causal description of human variability .
In everyday language the talk is about a gene for this and a gene for that .
We are now finding that that is rarely so .
The number of genes that work in that way can almost be counted on your fingers , because we are just not hard - wired in that way .
We have learned that organic biochemistry is not as simple as dialing a telephone number .
There are complex multi-dimensional relationships between the tens of thousands of genes involved in building and regulating our bodies , and these can only be fully understood when taken also in the context of the conditions we live in .
To understand an organism requires more than a knowledge of its genes , we must know how those genes interact ( something we barely understand ) and how those interactions relate to the organism ’s environment .
The assumption of the linear influence of individual genes has suffered a fatal , yet long overdue , blow .
Critics of the Human Genome Project have been saying this for decades now , but the biotechnology community has simply ignored the practical – and ethical – implications of their work , in the blind lust for either knowledge , money , or both .
A statement issued by Celera in 2001 admitted “ because of the relatively low number of genes … it will be necessary to look elsewhere for the mechanisms that generate the complexities inherent in human development . ”
Responding to this , Ari Patrinos of the US Department of Energy ( who funded much of the public research ) said : “ It ’s kind of humbling , is n’t it ? ”
Any project that can inspire a meek outlook among scientists is certainly exceptional , but at a cost of $ 2.7 billion I ca n’t help but wish that there were cheaper ways of teaching humility to the scientific community .

People are loving the C# Interactive Shell .
In the past people have embedded languages like Boo into their applications ( MonoDevelop and Banshee for example both have options to embed Boo and a shell ) .
Zoltan designed a new system for Mono that allows developers to inject and execute code into running Mono applications .
Paolo provided significant feedback and design guidelines for the code to be incorporated into Mono .
Thanks to both Zoltan and Paolo this functionality is now available through the Mono .
Management assembly : you provide an executable and a PID , and the executable is injected and its Main method executed on the target process :
using Mono .
Attach ; [.. ] //
Get a handle to a running Mono process .
VirtualMachine vm = new VirtualMachine ( pid ) ; // Load hello.exe into the target process , and run it vm.
Attach ( " /tmp/hello.exe " , " " ) ;
You can use this for billions of things of course .
You could patch running programs , you could attach logging software to a running program , or you could inject a C# evaluator into a live application and examine its state , or tweak it live .
Zoltan came up with a really cool extension to the the csharp command ( this is the command - line C# Interactive Shell ) .
The csharp command now takes an -- attach command line argument and a PID .
The csharp shell can now use the Mono .
Attach .
VirtualMachine to injects itself into the remote process and then the client and server communicate through a couple of sockets .
For example , this is the sample that Zoltan used to pitch his idea for supporting attaching to the virtual machine .
With the following you can pause a live Banshee process :
$ ps aux | grep banshee miguel 12359 17.0 2.7 141372 55708 pts/5 Sl + 14:30 0:02 banshee - 1 /usr/ lib64/banshee-1/Nereid.exe $ csharp -- attach 12359 csharp > using Banshee.ServiceStack ; csharp > using Banshee .
Gui ; csharp > var s = ServiceManager .
Get ( ) ; csharp > s.PlaybackActions [ " PlayPauseAction " ] .
Activate ( ) ;
All of the code is now on SVN , you need both the mono and mcs modules from trunk .
A GUI Shell
The above commands are a tiny bit risky and are also limited to the shell .
The above commands will execute on a separate thread from the application , and any commands that you execute would be executed on a separate thread which could corrupt the state of your application .
So this weekend , I wrote a tool that integrates with Gtk# applications , its called gsharp and you can find it in the mono - tools module ( it borrows some code from Banshee ) .
gsharp is a Gtk# version of the csharp command .
What is important is that it also supports injection of the code on other programs , but makes sure that all the code executes in the Gtk# thread , by issuing all of its commands from the Gtk# idle handler .
This means that it is safe to use gsharp with your Gtk# applications .
GUI version of the tool .
Here you can select which project you want to inject the GUI into :
Needs some work , show process names .
This version shows the gsharp tool attached to F - Spot , as I am not very familiar with the codebase , I can not do very much with it :
We will need to implement one of these as well for Windows .
Forms applications .
This should luckily be easy to do as most of the smarts live in the Mono .
CSharp assembly ( our embeddable compiler ) .
Security of Agents
A couple of weeks ago , I asked for people to weigh in on a security concern for temporary files .
This was for Zoltan 's attach functionality .
The code is now implemented and I would love if security experts could do a source code audit of our implementation .
And validate whether our assumptions are safe .
Here is the source code .

When PolitiFact did a fact - check of the “ Is Obama the Antichrist ? ” question back in April , I thought it was a touch ridiculous .
They got multiple professors of religious studies to chime in and did a serious examination of the text of Revelation .
They found that not only is Obama not the Antichrist ( stunning ! ) , the chain email that suggests he is has no familiarity with the Bible and is a pretty pathetic piece of work , even for a smear email .
But that ’s not a surprise , right ?
This is an email claiming a prominent American politician is the Antichrist .
Of course it ’s insane .
No one needs a fact - check to prove that .
Right ?
Oops .
The mayor of a South Carolina town apparently does .
He forwarded the email after receiving it and when called on the fact that he was perpetuating a smear , he said , “ I was just curious if there was any validity to it .
I was trying to get documentation if there was any scripture to back it up . ”
I ’m going to start sending out emails claiming that this man is a half - wit .
I ’m just curious if there is any validity to it .
IT IS ugly , but deleveraging is the word of the moment .
Financial institutions , desperate to repair the damage inflicted on their balance - sheets by mortgage - related securities , sell assets .
In doing so , they exacerbate the problem .
Forced sales push down the prices of assets , worsening the balance - sheets of other investors , forcing more asset sales , and so on .
In the end , the government is the only entity left in the game with a balance - sheet strong enough to keep buying .
The Bush administration 's bail - out plan , even if it gets through Congress , may not be the end of the finance industry 's problems .
The travails of investment banks will inevitably cause problems for hedge funds , which depend for their finances on institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
Many hedge funds have already cut positions since the credit crunch started in the summer of 2007 , and banks have tightened the terms on which they will do business with them .
This has been particularly true for those that sought funding through the prime - brokerage arms of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers before they were wiped out .
The volatility of financial markets may intensify the pain , since both brokers and hedge funds use models which lead them to sell assets when prices move down sharply .
Some hedge funds may have to give up altogether .
Around 15 % more were liquidated in the first half of 2008 than in the first half of 2007 , according to Hedge Fund Research , a consultancy .
What hurts finance affects the rest of the economy in spades .
Tim Bond , of Barclays Capital , reckons that , thanks to the gearing effect , a shortfall of bank capital of around $ 170 billion may reduce the potential supply of credit by $ 1.7 trillion .
A cut in overall lending would be a complete reversal of trend .
Morgan Stanley reckons that total American debt ( ie , the gross debt of households , companies and the government ) has risen inexorably since 1980 to more than 300 % of GDP ( see chart ) , higher than it was in the Depression .
Consumers , in particular , were encouraged to borrow by low unemployment and interest rates and ( until last year ) rising asset prices .
Their debt jumped from 71 % of GDP in 2000 to 100 % in 2007 , a bigger increase in seven years than had occurred in the previous 20 .
If consumers start to save more or borrow less , spending suffers .
In the last three months , America has seen the weakest car sales since 1993 , according to Bloomberg .
A general decline in demand will cause businesses to shed jobs , creating further falls in demand and more bad debts .
Once started , the process is hard to stop .
“ What the financial and household sectors are doing is unwinding more than ten years of a credit boom , ” says George Magnus , an economist at UBS .
“ The idea that they can rid themselves of this problem in a matter of months is pie in the sky . ”
Then there are businesses .
Thanks to strong recent profits , many firms are less geared than they were earlier this decade during the telecoms bust .
Nevertheless , there are plenty of big borrowers around , including carmakers and businesses bought by private - equity groups .
They may struggle to refinance their debts as they fall due .
Martin Fridson , of Fridson Investment Advisors , says that the default rate on high - yield bonds may climb to 10 % .
Even firms that are not heavily in debt may think twice about expanding .
According to Morgan Stanley , changes in bankers ' attitudes to lending tend to lead business investment by three quarters .
If the past pattern holds good , by the summer of next year investment may be falling at an annual rate of more than 10 % .
That will further depress economic growth .
The danger is of a “ second - round effect ” , as the crisis in finance affects the economy , leading to further problems in finance .
Mortgages may be the problem asset of the moment but next year the worry may be about credit cards , car loans and corporate debt .
The Bush administration 's rescue plan aims to arrest this deleveraging cycle .
But it will not be easy .
“ Eventually they will put the fire out , ” says Nick Carn , a partner at Odey Asset Management , a hedge fund .
“ The question is how much gets burned between now and then . ”
Cells topped with barbed wire to be used to hold protesters rounded up in mass arrests
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , August 15 , 2008
A CBS news crew has uncovered a huge warehouse holding facility in Denver , consisting of steel cages topped with barbed wire , ready to receive thousands of protesters at this year ’s Democratic National Convention .
“ This is a building filled with metal holding cells , ” described CBS reporter Rick Sallinger .
“ We showed up at the facility unannounced today , the doors were wide open , and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a Denver sheriff ’s captain asked us to leave . ”

PODLESNY , Russia 
The fields around this little farming enclave are among the most fertile on earth .
But like tens of million of acres of land in this country , after the collapse of the Soviet Union , they literally went to seed .
Now that may be changing .
A decade after capitalism transformed Russian industry , an agricultural revolution is stirring the countryside , shaking up village life and sweeping aside the collective farms that resisted earlier reform efforts and remain the dominant form of agriculture .
The change is being driven by soaring global food prices ( the price of wheat alone rose 77 percent last year ) and a new reform allowing foreigners to own agricultural land .
Together , they have created a land rush in rural Russia .
“ Where else do you have such an abundance of land ? ” Samir Suleymanov , the World Bank ’s director for Russia , asked in an interview .
Below the headlines about rocketing food prices and rocking governments , there lays a largely unnoticed fact : bananas are dying .
The foodstuff , more heavily consumed even than rice or potatoes , has its own form of cancer .
It is a fungus called Panama Disease , and it turns bananas brick - red and inedible .
There is no cure .
They all die as it spreads , and it spreads quickly .
Soon – in five , 10 or 30 years – the yellow creamy fruit as we know it will not exist .
The story of how the banana rose and fell can be seen a strange parable about the corporations that increasingly dominate the world – and where they are leading us .
Bananas seem at first like a lush product of nature , but this is a sweet illusion .
In their current form , bananas were quite consciously created .
Until 150 ago , a vast array of bananas grew in the world 's jungles and they were invariably consumed nearby .
Some were sweet ; some were sour .
They were green or purple or yellow .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A corporation called United Fruit took one particular type – the Gros Michael – out of the jungle and decided to mass produce it on vast plantations , shipping it on refrigerated boats across the globe .
The banana was standardised into one friendly model : yellow and creamy and handy for your lunchbox .
There was an entrepreneurial spark of genius there – but United Fruit developed a cruel business model to deliver it .
As the writer Dan Koeppel explains in his brilliant history Banana : The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World , it worked like this .
Find a poor , weak country .
Make sure the government will serve your interests .
If it wo n't , topple it and replace it with one that will .
Burn down its rainforests and build banana plantations .
Make the locals dependent on you .
Crush any flicker of trade unionism .
Then , alas , you may have to watch as the banana fields die from the strange disease that stalks bananas across the globe .
If this happens , dump tonnes of chemicals on them to see if it makes a difference .
If that does n't work , move on to the next country .
Begin again .
This sounds like hyperbole until you study what actually happened .
In 1911 , the banana magnate Samuel Zemurray decided to seize the country of Honduras as a private plantation .
He gathered together some international gangsters like Guy " Machine Gun " Maloney , drummed up a private army , and invaded , installing an amigo as president .
The term " banana republic " was invented to describe the servile dictatorships that were created to please the banana companies .
In the early 1950s , the Guatemalan people elected a science teacher named Jacobo Arbenz , because he promised to redistribute some of the banana companies ' land among the millions of landless peasants .
President Eisenhower and the CIA ( headed by a former United Fruit employee ) issued instructions that these " communists " should be killed , and noted that good methods were " a hammer , axe , wrench , screw driver , fire poker or kitchen knife " .
The tyranny they replaced it with went on to kill more than 200,000 people .
But how does this relate to the disease now scything through the world 's bananas ?
The evidence suggests even when they peddle something as innocuous as bananas , corporations are structured to do one thing only : maximise their shareholders ' profits .
As part of a highly regulated mixed economy , that 's a good thing , because it helps to generate wealth or churn out ideas .
But if the corporations are n't subject to tight regulations , they will do anything to maximise short - term profit .
This will lead them to seemingly unhinged behaviour – like destroying the environment on which they depend .
Not long after Panama Disease first began to kill bananas in the early 20th century , United Fruit 's scientists warned the corporation was making two errors .
They were building a gigantic monoculture .
If every banana is from one homogenous species , a disease entering the chain anywhere on earth will soon spread .
The solution ?
Diversify into a broad range of banana types .
The company 's quarantine standards were also dire .
Even the people who were supposed to prevent infection were trudging into healthy fields with disease - carrying soil on their boots .
But both of these solutions cost money – and United Front did n't want to pay .
They decided to maximise their profit today , reckoning they would get out of the banana business if it all went wrong .
So by the 1960s , the Gros Michel that United Fruit had packaged as The One True Banana was dead .
They scrambled to find a replacement that was immune to the fungus , and eventually stumbled upon the Cavendish .
It was smaller and less creamy and bruised easily , but it would have to do .
But like in a horror movie sequel , the killer came back .
In the 1980s , the Cavendish too became sick .
Now it too is dying , its immunity a myth .
In many parts of Africa , the crop is down 60 percent .
There is a consensus among scientists that the fungus will eventually infect all Cavendish bananas everywhere .
There are bananas we could adopt as Banana 3.0 – but they are so different to the bananas that we know now that they feel like a totally different and far less appetising fruit .
The most likely contender is the Goldfinger , which is crunchier and tangier : it is know as " the acid banana " .
Thanks to bad corporate behaviour and physical limits , we seem to be at a dead end .
The only possible glimmer of hope is a genetically modified banana that can resist Panama Disease .
But that is a distant prospect , and it is resisted by many people : would you like a banana split made from a banana split with fish genes ?
When we hit up against a natural limit like Panama disease , we are bemused , and then affronted .
It seems instinctively bizarre to me that lush yellow bananas could vanish from the global food supply , because I have grown up in a culture without any idea of physical limits to what we can buy and eat .
Is there a parable for our times in this odd milkshake of banana , blood and fungus ?
For a hundred years , a handful of corporations were given a gorgeous fruit , set free from regulation , and allowed to do what they wanted with it .
What happened ?
They had one good entrepreneurial idea – and to squeeze every tiny drop of profit from it , they destroyed democracies , burned down rainforests , and ended up killing the fruit itself .
But have we learned ?
Across the world , politicians like George Bush and David Cameron are telling us the regulation of corporations is " a menace " to be " rolled back " ; they even say we should leave the planet 's climate in their hands .
Now that 's bananas .

While Google throws its brand behind all sorts of projects , it hesitates to use its tremendous reach to corral users toward political goals .
But it did so in mid-August — and for the first time — when the company launched its " Free the Airwaves " campaign .
The goal was to generate pro-" white spaces " broadband pressure on the five FCC commissioners , who may vote on the idea this fall , and so far , the company is more than pleased with its success .
The site 's key action item is a petition that people can sign ; when the campaign is complete , it will be presented to the FCC .
" Opening up unused TV spectrum might be one of our best remaining chances to address the digital divide by creating affordable and truly universal broadband wireless coverage in the US , " the petition says .
" I urge you to take this rare opportunity to connect millions more people to the Internet . "
In a conversation with Google , Ars has learned that 13,000 people have signed the petition already , which a Google spokesperson characterizes as a " very positive initial response . "
The entire campaign is of interest because the white spaces broadband issue has been brewing for years , but until now backers have largely said , " Let the science decide ! "
Since the main objection raised by TV broadcasters and wireless microphone makers is interference , the pro-white spaces alliance ( represented by groups like the Wireless Innovation Alliance ) have said that the issue should be decided by the nonpartisan Office of Engineering Technology at the FCC , which has been testing the devices .
But it 's becoming increasingly clear to the various parties we have spoken with on the issue that the OET wo n't issue a " yes / no " recommendation .
With the second wave of testing now complete and the OET report apparently being drafted , most parties are convinced that it will offer maximum wiggle room to the commissioners and fodder for both sides .
The decision will come down to a nontechnical , political choice ( how much likelihood of noninterference do we need to approve this ? ) rather than a simple binary question ( will this interfere or wo n't it ? ) .
That means the campaign for and against white spaces will become explicitly political rather than technical in the next few months .
Broadcasters will claim that the risks are simply too high , while white space backers will stress the tremendous potential opportunity of big swaths of prime , unlicensed spectrum .
Hence Google 's campaign , which is a purely political gesture intended to counter the massive lobbying leverage of groups like the National Association of Broadcasters .
Google recognizes this , of course , and has launched a linked advertising campaign last week that features videos from ordinary white spaces backers to go along with the petition drive .
So why would Google finally put its brand on the line and attempt to rally users directly in support of this cause ?
Why not others , including the now - approved merger with DoubleClick , which is arguably of far more financial value to the company ?
A Google policy spokesman tells us that Larry Page , the company 's co-founder , has a " personal interest in this " and believes it to be an incredible opportunity to expand broadband access .
Page recently traveled to Washington , D.C. , —his first trip there — and white spaces broadband was high on his agenda .
WALKING A FINE LINE ….
Where some see a crisis , others apparently see an opportunity .
As unintended consequences go , Hurricane Gustav does present some political opportunities for Mr. McCain .
He looked like a man in charge on television Sunday as he described meeting with Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and federal disaster officials . [ … ]
In St. Paul , the McCain campaign chartered a plane to fly a dozen members of the Louisiana delegation home and created a Gulf states briefing committee , made up of top Republican officials from the region .
What ’s more , “ Mr. McCain appeared on television with a semi- presidential bearing , briefing Americans on emergency preparations and calling on the nation to put aside partisanship . ”
I ’m curious about something .
John McCain has been in Congress for about a quarter of a century .
There have been plenty of hurricanes and other natural disasters , some of them horrific and devastating , during that time .
Exactly how many times , throughout his lengthy congressional career , has McCain felt compelled to visit emergency - response teams in advance of a disaster , form briefing committees on the eve of the disaster , and return to the scene of the disaster immediately afterwards ?
If the answer is “ zero , ” it certainly suggests McCain ’s new - found interest in natural disasters may have something to do with political opportunism .
John McCain does n’t have a background in emergency response or disaster relief .
None of the people working on the ground answer to him directly , so it ’s not like he can give orders or manage the response .
Indeed , there ’s literally no reason at all to think McCain will be in a position to help recovery efforts in any substantive way .
So , what ’s the justification ?
We can probably guess the actual reason , but I ’m wondering what the official line is .
If the answer is , “ Because he cares , ” that ’s not exactly compelling .
As I suspect even McCain would concede , everyone cares .
A hundred senators , 435 House members , the White House , and 301 million Americans care .
There has to be some other official explanation .
I ’m just wondering what it is .

Mr Tusk said negotiations with Washington were ongoing
Poland 's prime minister has rejected the latest terms offered by the US to host a missile defence shield .
Donald Tusk said any deal must increase Poland 's own security , and he dismissed the latest offer as unsatisfactory .
" We are ready to co-operate but we are waiting for an answer from the American side , " Mr Tusk told a news conference .
The US wants to place 10 missile interceptors in Poland as part of a defence shield against possible attack , a move condemned by Russia and China .
Russia has said the project would upset the military balance in Europe and warned it could have no choice but to point its own missiles at the installations .
The US is also seeking permission to build a radar station in the Czech Republic as part of the defence shield plans .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to sign a deal with the Czech government next week in Prague .
Washington says the shield will help protect the country and its allies from so - called " rogue states " like Iran .
But Mr Tusk said that the presence of the missile shield in Poland would increase certain threats and risks for the country .
He did not , however , rule out the possibility of the issue being resolved .
" I would n't talk about the end , suspension or interruption , " Mr Tusk said .
" Negotiations , in my opinion , are continuing . "
Poland has requested the additional security of a Patriot missile battery and has also sought billions of dollars worth of investment to improve its air defences .
Once I learned just how much pork Sarah Palin got via earmarks I could barely believe the commerical media were glossing over it .
But for McCain to try to reclaim the maverick personna after how he toadied up to Bush since 2000 , and trying to paint his ticket as conservatives that can bring change ?
That 's the epitome of unbelievable Rovian tactics .
We may not know much about Palin yet , but we do know votes for John McCain are votes for more of the same .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Oil prices are falling sharply , and that 's good news .
But not nearly as good as you might think .
No doubt the drop , down to $ 120 by mid-day Monday , gives strapped consumers relief at the gas pump .
Prices have dropped below $ 4 a gallon and could be headed toward $ 3.50 , going by trading in wholesale futures markets .
Any decline will be welcomed by Americans struggling under the burden of falling house prices , rising layoffs and stagnant wages .
But falling oil prices also suggest that the recession the U.S. has so far avoided is well on its way , as consumers pull back from the spending spree that drove economic growth earlier this decade .
A weakening economy will mean more layoffs , further pressuring already reduced spending .
" There is no doubt that with gasoline prices dipping below $ 3.90 a gallon we have a bit of a reprieve on the energy front , " Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg wrote in a report Monday , " but the reality is that this is a chicken and egg game because the decline is reflecting the consumer recession . "
Energy use down
Perhaps the biggest factor behind the recent 18 % drop in the price of a barrel of crude is sinking North American demand .
Federal Highway Administration data show the number of miles driven in the U.S. dropped from year - ago levels for the seventh straight month in May .
May 's decline was the third - largest monthly drop on record since 1942 , says Stephen Schork , editor of the Schork Report energy and shipping newsletter in Villanova , Pa .
Americans are driving 4 % less now than they were a year ago , Rosenberg writes , while energy use in inflation - adjusted terms has dropped 2 % - an event he calls " extremely rare . "
The pullback comes after the recent crude - price surge - the cost of a barrel doubled between Labor Day of 2007 and July 11 - seriously damaged the industrial economy , which despite its long decline remains a crucial source of better - paying jobs .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) on Friday posted a $ 15.5 billion second - quarter loss , as sales plunged 18 % from a year ago .
The company and rival Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) have slashed truck production , laid off thousands of workers and refocused on smaller cars as buyers flee the light trucks that had made the companies so much money .
Americans ' decision to drive less comes at a time of rising stress .
The economy has been hemorrhaging jobs and real wages , adjusted for inflation , have been flat to lower for a decade .
Americans have enjoyed a rising standard of living in the meantime by borrowing - but with banks choking on subprime mortgages gone bad , the loan window is closing .
Rosenberg calls a recent rise in the savings rate " a vivid sign that frugality is now replacing frivolity . "
Meanwhile , the weak economy is spurring more companies to cut back .
Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Monday that layoff announcements jumped 26 % from a month ago in July .
The unemployment rate recently hit a four - year high at 5.7 % .
How low can it go ?
One unhappy fact is that a drop in the price of oil wo n't bring back many of the jobs lost over the past year to the energy - cost surge .
Even were gas to fall to $ 3 a gallon - a move that is by no means assured - no one is going to beat a path to the dealership to buy pick - ups and SUVs that are now , in many cases , being phased out .
GM recently announced plans to shut four SUV plants .
On a happier note , there is hope that the decline in oil prices has just begun .
While Schork says it 's anyone 's guess where crude will trade - " By the end of the third quarter , there 's a good chance oil could be below $ 100 a barrel , and a good chance it could be above $ 150 , " he says - others see a chance that the commodity , having enjoyed a head - spinning runup , could also drop more than anyone expects .
Economist Jim Griffin notes at the ING Investment Weekly that crude 's rally earlier this year became " nearly parabolic " - a sign that the decline could be steep .
Now a return to double - digit oil may not rescue the Hummer .
But as the government 's fiscal stimulus program did earlier this year , it could give consumers a little more change in their pockets , either to spend , salt away - or pay down their debts .

Rachel Hoffman is dead .
Rachel Hoffman , like many young adults , occasionally smoked marijuana .
But Rachel Hoffman is not dead as a result of smoking marijuana ; she is dead as a result of marijuana prohibition .
Under prohibition , Rachel faced up to five years in prison for possessing a small amount of marijuana .
Under prohibition , the police in Rachel ’s community viewed her as nothing more than a common “ criminal , ” and threatened her with years in jail unless she cooperated with them as an untrained , unsupervised confidential informant .
Under prohibition , the law enforcement officers responsible for placing Rachel in the very situation that resulted in her murder have failed to publicly express any remorse — because , after all , under prohibition Rachel Hoffman was no longer a human being deserving of such sympathies .
Tonight , ABC ’s 20/20 will shed a national spotlight on the tragedy surrounding Rachel Hoffman ’s untimely death — and the tragedy that is marijuana prohibition .
Are pot users criminals ?
The tragic case of Rachel Hoffman via ABC News
After being caught twice with a “ baggie ” of marijuana , 23 - year old Rachel Hoffman was reportedly told by police in Tallahassee , Florida that she would go to prison for four years unless she became an undercover informant .
The young woman , a recent graduate of Florida State University , was murdered during a botched sting operation two months ago .
Her case will be profiled Friday on 20/20 .
“ The idea of waging a war on drugs is to protect people and here it seems like we ’re putting people in harm ’s way , ” said Lance Block , a lawyer hired by Rachel ’s parents .
The Florida Attorney General ’s office says it is reviewing the procedures and protocol of the Tallahassee police .
Rachel ’s case also has raised new questions about state and federal laws related to marijuana possession .
“ I ’m calling her a criminal , ” Tallahassee police chief Dennis Jones told 20 / 20 , who maintains that both drug dealers and drug users are considered criminals to his department .
Under Florida law , possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana is a felony .
Rachel was also found in possession of two ecstasy pills , a felony under Florida law no matter the quantity because it “ has a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States . ”
The Tallahassee police chief says Rachel was suspected of selling drugs and she was rightly treated as a criminal .

GAITHERSBURG , Md. — Fires in the 47 - story office tower at the edge of the World Trade Center site undermined floor beams and critical structural columns , federal investigators concluded Thursday , as they attempted to curb still - rampant speculation that explosives or fuel fires were responsible for the building ’s collapse of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The long - delayed report by engineers here at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in suburban Washington is intended to solve one of still lingering central questions about the 2001 attacks :
Why did 7 World Trade Center fall , if it was not hit by an airplane .
“ Heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail , ” said Shyam Sunder , the lead investigator .
“ Video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oils played a role in the collapse that brought the building down . ”
No one died when 7 World Trade Center fell , nearly seven hours after the twin towers came down .
But the collapse of the adjacent tower — once home to branch offices of the Central Intelligence Agency , the Secret Service and to the Giuliani administration ’s emergency operations center — is cited in hundreds of books and Internet sites as perhaps the most compelling evidence that an insider secretly planted explosives , intentionally destroying the tower .
It is the first skyscraper in modern times to collapse primarily as a result of a fire .
Mainstream engineers and government officials have rejected the speculation as ridiculous .
But national polls have shown that perhaps as many as 1 in 7 Americans believe that the destruction of the World Trade Center towers was an inside job .

Guantanamo's Camp Delta compound has housed prisoners since 2002 Foreign suspects held in Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detention in US civilian courts , the US Supreme Court has ruled .
In a major legal setback for the Bush administration , the court overturned by five to four a ruling upholding a 2006 law which removed such rights .
It is not clear if the ruling will lead to prompt hearings for the detainees .
Some 270 men are held at the US naval base , on suspicion of terrorism or links to al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
US President George W Bush said he would abide by the court 's ruling even if he did not agree with it .
Human rights groups have welcomed the move , Amnesty International saying it was an " essential step forward towards the restoration of the rule of law " .
We 'll study this opinion to determine whether or not additional legislation may be appropriate
US President George W Bush
Fallout from the ruling Thursday 's ruling potentially resurrects several cases which had been put on hold in recent months .
Federal judges , law clerks and court administrators are studying the 70 - page opinion to work out how to proceed .
And a military lawyer for Osama Bin Laden 's former driver , Guantanamo detainee Salim Ahmed Hamdan , is requesting that charges against his client be dismissed .
" The entire basis for the existence of Guantanamo Bay is gone , " said Navy Lt Cmdr Brian Mizer .
The military judge in the case had postponed Mr Hamdan 's trial , which was scheduled to start earlier this month , pending the Supreme Court 's judgement .
' Extraordinary times '
Wednesday 's ruling related to two test cases brought by Lakhdar Boumediene , an Algerian arrested in Bosnia in 2001 , and Fawzi al - Odah , a Kuwaiti seized in Pakistan in 2002 , which were consolidated and brought on behalf of 37 foreign nationals at Guantanamo .

Court strikes blow for detainees Supreme Court ruling ( 640 KB )
Brushing aside the government 's arguments that the detainees were enemy combatants being held at a time of war outside the US , the court said they had " the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus " .
This is the right of detainees under the US constitution to be heard by an independent judge .
Justice Anthony Kennedy said : " The laws and constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times .
Liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law . "
This is the Bush administration 's third setback at the highest US court since 2004 over its treatment of prisoners who are being held indefinitely and without charge at the base in Cuba .
The court has ruled twice previously that Guantanamo inmates could go into civilian courts to ask that the government justify their continued detention .
There have been accusations of torture and mistreatment at Guantanamo
In 2004 , the judges found that existing law gave federal courts the right to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals held at Guantanamo because of the unique control the US government had over the land leased from Cuba .
Two years later , it ruled that the president did not have the authority to order the " enemy combatants " there to face military commissions .
The government responded both times by obtaining congressional legislation restricting judicial review of the detentions .
The Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) passed in 2006 removed the right of habeas corpus and set up tribunals to try detainees who were not US citizens .
Last week , five detainees , including key suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , appeared before a military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed dismissed the trial as an " inquisition " .
' Restoring credibility ' President Bush made it clear that the government would " abide by the court 's decision " , although he did so without enthusiasm .

" It was a deeply divided court and I strongly agree with those who dissented , " he told reporters in Rome .
" We 'll study this opinion to determine whether or not additional legislation may be appropriate . "
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , who voted against the ruling , warned that " it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving in a civilian court ... that evidence supports the confinement of each and every prisoner " .
But the human - rights group Amnesty International urged the US government to " finally bring its detention policies and practices in the ' war on terror ' in line with international standards " .
For the American Bar Association , the ruling helped restore the credibility of the US as a " model for the rule of law across the globe " .

Introduction
Oooh this is dangerous .
It started with Intel quietly ( but not too quietly ) informing many in the industry of its plans to enter the graphics market with something called Larrabee .
NVIDIA responded by quietly ( but not too quietly ) criticizing the nonexistant Larrabee .
What we 've seen for the past several months has been little more than jabs thrown back and forth , admittedly with NVIDIA being a little more public with its swings .
Today is a big day , without discussing competing architectures , Intel is publicly unveiling , for the first time , the basis of its Larrabee GPU architecture .
Well , it is important to keep in mind that this is first and foremost NOT a GPU .
It 's a CPU .
A many - core CPU that is optimized for data - parallel processing .
What 's the difference ?
Well , there is very little fixed function hardware , and the hardware is targeted to run general purpose code as easily as possible .
The bottom lines is that Intel can make this very wide many - core CPU look like a GPU by implementing software libraries to handle DirectX and OpenGL .
It 's not quite emulating a GPU as it is directly implementing functionality on a data - parallel CPU that would normally be done on dedicated hardware .
And developers will not be limited to just DirectX and OpenGL : this hardware can take pure software renderers and run them as if the hardware was designed specifically for that code .
There is quite a bit here , so let 's just jump right in .
PARIS 
Is the United States no longer the global beacon of unfettered , free - market capitalism ?
In extending a last - minute $ 85 billion lifeline to American International Group , the troubled insurer , Washington has not only turned away from decades of rhetoric about the virtues of the free market and the dangers of government intervention , but it has also probably undercut future American efforts to promote such policies abroad .
“ I fear the government has passed the point of no return , ” said Ron Chernow , a leading American financial historian .
“ We have the irony of a free - market administration doing things that the most liberal Democratic administration would never have been doing in its wildest dreams . ”
The bailout package for A.I.G. , on top of earlier government support for Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , has stunned even European policy makers accustomed to government intervention  even as they acknowledge the shock of the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
“ For opponents of free markets in Europe and elsewhere , this is a wonderful opportunity to invoke the American example , ” said Mario Monti , the former antitrust chief at the European Commission .
“ They will say that even the standard - bearer of the market economy , the United States , negates its fundamental principles in its behavior . ”
The RIAA 's campaign against filesharers follows a standard procedure : find a computer offering files for download , get a court to force the ISP or organization that provided the computer 's IP address to reveal the computer 's owner , and then sue the owner .
The group has contracted with MediaSentry to do the work of identifying the infringing computers , but that company 's methods have been called into question in a number of states that have licensing requirements for private investigators that include the computer - based snooping required to gather the data .
Michigan was one such state and , if there was any doubt about the licensing issue there , it 's gone now : the state passed a law that specifically calls for computer forensics groups to be licensed .
To an extent , the law is somewhat redundant .
Michigan 's Department of Labor and Economic Growth is responsible for licensing private investigators and , in February , it determined that the company was acting as an unlicensed private investigator .
The Department recommended that the anonymous state resident that filed the complaint contact his local prosecutor if he / she wanted to press the matter .
Despite this ominous warning flag , the RIAA 's lawsuits in the state have continued apace .
But , if MediaSentry felt it could successfully challenge the Department of Labor 's decision if called on it , its chances of doing so dropped precipitously .
In May , with no one in the press apparently noticing , Michigan enacted a revision to its licensing requirements , entitled " An act to license and regulate professional investigators . "
A reader of Recording Industry vs The People apparently did notice , and tipped off the blog ; a copy ( PDF ) of the legislation is being hosted by intellectual property attorney Ray Beckerman .
The law is intended " to protect the general public against unauthorized , unlicensed and unethical operations by professional investigators . "
It clearly does n't directly target MediaSentry ; it was presumably in the works before the Department of Labor 's ruling , and includes provisions for CPAs and insurance adjusters , as well as covert surveillance and tracking devices .
Nevertheless , there are definitely clauses that put the company directly in the legal crosshairs .
Those engaged in computer forensics are deemed to be in need of licensing , and that activity is defined as the collection of information " held on , or retrieved from , computers , computer networks , computer storage media , electronic devices , electronic storage media , or electronic networks , or any combination thereof . "
Which is precisely what MediaSentry does on behalf of the RIAA .
So far , the RIAA appears to hope the matter never comes up in court .
The cases it has filed continue to rely on its standard evidence - gathering procedures , and it has not responded to our request for comments on the matter .
If someone does choose to take on its evidence - gathering methods in Michigan , however , the legislation is likely to make the decision even more one - sided than it previously was .
The Silence of the Lambs Optical Illusion is based on the origin of the skull on the moth of the cover .
The Death ’s Head Moth features a skull over its head , but the skull is not an actual Skull .
The Skull was originally the Dali Portrait which features nude women arranged in such a way to make the outline of a skull .
Manny did not notice this til much after the the movie was released , if you still have n’t seen it .. check it out !
this illusion is very fitting for the movie .

This AT&T security suggest bloggers talk to police Moderate Democrats are turning away Democrats , even those with press passes .
On Monday night , AT&T held a ' Blue Dog ' fundraiser for the group of congressional Democrats who endorsed the recent bill that gave immunity to telecoms for President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The affair was held at Mile High Station , which is one of the closest buildings to Invesco field at Mile High Stadium in Denver , Colorado where the Democratic National Convention is being held .
While delegates came in and out of the party , it was n't as easy for approved Democratic bloggers and reporters .
Amy Goodman of DemocracyNow , Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake and Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com were ushered away by event security .
All three had valid press passes to cover the Democratic National Convention .
As they tried to enter the event , security guards curtly refused to permit them to enter , and ordered them away from the entrance , giving few details .
Even the guests who came and went refused to say who invited them to the affair , or give their names .
Only a pair of talkative men , who identified themselves as a lobbyists , and a Republican , replied .
" Can I just ask a question ? " Goodman asked .
" If this is open to the delegates , why is nt it  "
" Other side of the property , please , " an unidentified guard replied .
" The other side of the property , where the public can stand . "
" But is nt this open to the delegates ? " Goodman said .
" No , it s not .
You could talk to the police right now .
Go to the other side of the property , where the rest of the public can stand , please .
Here comes an officer to talk to you . "
" We re confused , " Goodman said .
" We re press for the DNC to cover the Democratic National Convention , and I m just wondering  "
" Unfortunately , " the guard said .
" Im just telling you what Ive been told . "
Video follows of Goodman , Hamsher and Greenwald as they cover the events of the evening .
Additional transcript AMY GOODMAN :
And what have you been told ?
UNIDENTIFIED : I need you guys over there or over there .
AMY GOODMAN : So are you saying theres no press allowed in ?
UNIDENTIFIED : Correct .
Im saying that its a private party , is what I m saying .
AMY GOODMAN : So what is the party about ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : No idea .
Thank you .
AMY GOODMAN : How did you get invited ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : No idea .
AMY GOODMAN : Hi.
Can I ask you about the party inside ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : That s right .
Thank you .
AMY GOODMAN : Can I ask about the party and who invited you ?
Are you guys delegates ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : Hi .
How are you ?
AMY GOODMAN : Good
PARTY PARTICIPANT : No . No .
GLENN GREENWALD : Im Glenn Greenwald from Salon.com , and this is Jane Hamsher from FireDogLake , and we were here to try and cover the event , at first , and have press passes , and were trying to gain access .
And we were told we couldnt get in even .
AMY GOODMAN : But you have press passes .
GLENN GREENWALD :
We have a press pass .
JANE HAMSHER : We have legitimate press passes .
GLENN GREENWALD :
We have legitimate press passes from the convention .
JANE HAMSHER : Issued by the DNC .
AMY GOODMAN : Are you going into the party ?
Are you going into the party ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : Yeah .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about who invited you ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : Excuse me .
AMY GOODMAN : Were press .
GLENN GREENWALD : Yeah , it s amazing .
And essentially , we probably tried to interview twenty - five , thiry people going in , and every last person refused to even give their name , identify themselves , say what they re here for , what the event is for .
It s more secretive than like a Dick Cheney energy council meeting .
I mean , its amazing .
AMY GOODMAN : So , what are you here for ?
Why do you want to interview people ?
GLENN GREENWALD :
Well , because , I mean , its extraordinary that the same Blue Dogs that just gave this extremely corrupt gift to AT&T are now attending a party underwritten by AT&T , the purpose of which is to thank the Blue Dogs for the corrupt legislative gift that they got .
So AT&T gives money to Blue Dogs , the Blue Dogs turn around and immunize AT&T from lawbreaking , and then AT&T throws a party at the Democratic convention thanking them , and then they all go in and into this exclusive club .
AMY GOODMAN : [ inaudible ] ask someone .
Why dont you ask this person ?
GLENN GREENWALD : Hi .
Can we are you going to the party ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : I dont know .
GLENN GREENWALD : Can we ask you a couple of questions ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : Rather not , thank you .
GLENN GREENWALD : Alright , can we just ask this gentleman here ?
UNIDENTIFIED :
That s private property , right here .
GLENN GREENWALD : OK , well take care of this , sir .
No problem .
UNIDENTIFIED : OK .
GLENN GREENWALD : No problem .
Remember , we kind of 
JANE HAMSHER : Who are you with ?
Are you going to the party ?
PARTY PARTICIPANT : Yeah .
GLENN GREENWALD :
This is area right here is where it is , right here ?
JANE HAMSHER : Are you going to the party ?
GLENN GREENWALD :
This is the magical D line ?
UNIDENTIFIED : No , the next one over .
GLENN GREENWALD : Oh , I see .
UNIDENTIFIED : Almost .
LOBBYIST : You know where the Blue Dog Democrats started out ?
They all used to meet in Louisiana , in the office of the one conservative Democrat in the state , who had a portrait of a blue dog over his fireplace .
And from that point on this was in the late 1800s , early 1900s other conservative Democrats used to come to have this secret meeting in this place in Louisiana , and thats how they became the Blue Dog Democrats forever more .
AMY GOODMAN : Are you both delegates ?
LOBBYIST : No .
REPUBLICAN GUEST : No .
LOBBYIST : Im a lobbyist .
AMY GOODMAN : Oh , a lobbyist ?
LOBBYIST : The other L word .
AMY GOODMAN : A lobbyist with who ?
LOBBYIST : I do financial services and real estate .
REPUBLICAN GUEST : Im just a guest tonight .
Ill tell you a secret : Im a Republican .
We just got invited , so
UNIDENTIFIED : Free dinner .
REPUBLICAN GUEST : Free dinner .
AMY GOODMAN : Do you feel right at home ?
REPUBLICAN GUEST : Yeah .
It s a party .
Hey , what the hell , right ?
AMY GOODMAN : So , Medea Benjamin , why are you all out here ?
MEDEA BENJAMIN : Code Pink is has always been dogging the Blue Dogs , because the Blue Dogs are supposed to be fiscally conservative , yet they are the ones that keep cheerleading for this war and keep funding the war .
But we also see that the Blue Dogs are big into the corporate sponsorship , and were here to say that , as the convention starts to begin tomorrow , the Blue Dogs should be ashamed of themselves for taking corporate money and then turning around and giving immunity to the telecoms industry for illegally spying on us .
CODE PINK PROTESTERS : Blue Dogs take cash from AT&T and give telecoms immunity .
So Code Pink is here to give the dogs a bone , tell AT&T dont tap my phone !
AMY GOODMAN : And that is the Code Pink singers , outside of Mile High Stadium .
In fact , that venue was Mile High Station , where AT&T was sponsoring a party for the Blue Dog Democrats .
Dallas , TX – Scientists from the Evolutionary Acceleration Research Institute ( EARI ) announced that the first test of the Giant Animal Smasher ( GAS ) will begin on December 19 , 2008 , the 41st anniversary of the premiere of Dr. Dolittle .
Dr. Thomas Malwin , head of the research project , said , " The first test runs will only accelerate microscopic life - forms like bacteria and viruses to high speeds , but theoretically the GAS can handle animals as large as squirrels , hence the squirrel smasher moniker . "
Biologists from around the globe hope the GAS will unlock the secrets of the so - called " Darwin particle " that could unlock the secrets to life .
" If we discover the Darwin particle we could possibly create new life - forms , or accelerate evolution to unimaginable levels , " said Malwin .
The GAS is a 25 mile tube buried ten feet below the surface , and accelerates the animals up to a speed of 6,000 meters per second using a series of pulleys , levers , Whirlpool parts and fusion reactors .
Malwin dismissed critics who claimed that smashing animals together at high speeds was cruel to the animals , and some animal rights activists even left critical messages on Malwin 's telephone answering service .
He said , " The animals wo n't be feeling anything .
The collision will vaporize the squirrels in a fraction of a second .
Their brains wo n't be able to transmit pain at those speeds , so it 'll be painless for them . "
Scientists currently rely on computer simulations to smash biological units , but simulations can only do so much , and without the visceral enjoyment of seeing two squirrels collide at thousands of miles an hour .

Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del .
Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has chosen for his running mate Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , a man who once proposed the bottom half of the Democratic presidential ticket would best be filled with an unusual selection : Republican John McCain .
In two separate television interviews in the spring of 2004 , Biden suggested the best way to bring unity to a divided nation was for the then - Democratic presidential candidate , John Kerry , to select McCain as his running mate .
" I think John McCain would be a great candidate for vice president .
I mean it .
I know John does n't like me saying it , but the truth of the matter is , it is , " Biden told Tim Russert of NBC's " Meet the Press . "
Only a few months earlier , Chris Matthews of MSNBC TV's " Hardball " asked Biden if he thought McCain would consider joining Kerry on a " fusion ticket . "
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
" I think that this is time for unity in this country , and maybe it is time to have a guy like John McCain – a Republican – on the ticket with a guy he does like .
They do get along , " answered Biden , " and they do n't have fundamental disagreements on major policies . "
Leading up to the interview with Matthews , McCain expressed on ABC's " Good Morning America " that he might show interest in joining a Democrat on the ticket .
" John Kerry is a close friend of mine .
We have been friends for years , " McCain told the ABC morning show .
" Obviously I would entertain it . "
By the time he faced Russert on " Meet the Press , " however , McCain had reshaped his comments .
" I will always take anyone 's phone calls , " McCain told Russert .
" But I will not , I categorically will not do it . "
Biden expressed both skepticism that McCain would accept and support for him if he did .
" Do I think it 's going to happen ?
No , " Biden told Russert .
" But I think it is a reflection of the desire of this country and the desire of people in both parties to want to see this God-awful , vicious rift that exists in the nation healed , and John and John could go a long way to heal that rift . "
When Matthews asked Biden if he would support John McCain as VP candidate on a Kerry ticket , Biden said , " I would .
Yeah , if John Kerry said that 's who he wanted , and McCain – I 'd encourage McCain to say yes . "
RELATED : Did fake signatures get Obama on Indiana ballot ?
In the latter of the two interviews , Biden even praised McCain 's readiness to serve as president .
Tim Russert suggested Biden eliminate McCain from consideration and recommend another VP choice , but Biden refused , citing the importance of the vice president being qualified to fill the president 's shoes , if necessary .
" I 'm sticking with McCain , " Biden said .
" I think the single most important thing that John Kerry has to do is … to say that makes sense , that guy could be president , or that woman could be president .
I think that 's the single most important thing for people , when he or she is announced , say that person could be president . "
For many years , fingers have been pointed at agriculture whenever pesticides are detected in rivers and streams .
Studies carried out by Eawag and Empa now show that built - up areas also account for a considerable proportion of such inputs .
For example , substances can be leached out of facade renders and paints by rainwater and enter the environment , where they may have toxic effects on organisms .
In cooperation with manufacturers , cantonal authorities and other partners , the researchers have studied these leaching processes and are currently discussing ways of tackling the problem .
The Zurich Office of Waste , Water , Energy and Air ( Awel ) routinely analyses surface waters for pesticides , and excessive pesticide concentrations are regularly found in individual watercourses .
Recent measurements carried out on the Furtbach stream ( at Würenlos ) and on the Glatt river identified 26 active substances .
In the case of 22 compounds , the quality standard specified in the Federal Water Protection Ordinance ( maximum level of 0.1 µ g/l ) was exceeded , with concentrations in some cases being several times higher than permitted .
Not all of these substances can be of agricultural origin : certain agents are prohibited for agricultural applications , or their concentrations do not exhibit the seasonal pattern typical of products used in the fields , so they must come from a different source .
These findings are confirmed by studies performed by Eawag on effluents from wastewater treatment plants and on rainwater runoff in the catchment of Lake Greifen , which clearly indicate that non-agricultural sources also contribute significantly to water pollution via urban drainage .
Up to 300 tonnes of biocides a year
As part of the URBIC project , researchers from Eawag and Empa ( the materials science and technology research institute ) have demonstrated – under both laboratory and real - life conditions – that a number of biocides are leached out of building facades .
To provide antialgal and antifungal protection , these substances are standardly added to synthetic resin- bound paints and renders for exterior insulation systems .
It is estimated that 60–300 tonnes of biocides are used for such applications in Switzerland each year .
The use of biocides has risen sharply as a result of improved thermal insulation and current architectural trends ( short or non-existent roof overhangs ) .
Peak concentrations with first rainfall
To quantify leaching , facade elements in the laboratory were subjected to artificial rainfall and exposed to ultraviolet light and various temperatures .
Tests were also carried out in the open air under real - life weather conditions , using a specially constructed small building ( see photo ) .
Finally , researchers also performed experiments on several new buildings in the Zurich region .
Biocide concentrations were found to be extremely high especially in the first facade runoff collected from freshly rendered or painted houses .
For example , the concentration of diuron ( herbicide ) measured in the first litre of facade runoff was 7000 µg / L.
If released into a stream , this litre would therefore have to be diluted by a factor of 70,000 so as not to exceed the standard specified in the Water Protection Ordinance .
This shows the problems that may be associated with the infiltration of facade runoff and drainage from urban areas into small waterbodies .
Subsequently , however , concentrations declined rapidly , both during prolonged rainfall , and following further rain events .
Leaching rates are dependent not only on the solubility of the agent in question , but also on the photochemical degradation of substances and on the quality of the renders and paints .
Effective in minute concentrations
According to the study , there is no doubt that the biocide concentrations measured in the facade runoff and additionally estimated using a computer model have toxic effects on algae and aquatic plant and animal life .
Contaminated facade runoff can enter watercourses directly via drains or stormwater sewers .
Substances that inhibit algal growth on facades exert the same effects in waterbodies – even when heavily diluted .
It is known that even a few nanogrammes per litre of certain substances can produce toxic effects ; these include the marine antifouling agent cybutryne ( also known as Irgarol ® 1051 ) .
It is thus important not only to bear in mind the general legal quality requirements but also to identify substances that are of particular ecotoxicological concern .
In addition , a great deal of research is still required to elucidate the environmental effects of “ cocktails ” of substances .
Developing solutions with practitioners
Michael Burkhardt , who coordinated the URBIC project , points to the existence of a regulatory gap in the Biocidal Products Ordinance , since direct inputs of material protection agents from facades into receiving waters are not covered at present .
Burkhardt emphasizes that , in general , greater attention needs to be paid to the selection of construction materials and water quality in the disposal of rainwater from urban areas .
In his view , it is also legitimate to question the need for the routine use of biocides , since algal and fungal growth is certainly not to be expected everywhere .
In addition , many facade - related problems could be avoided : architects could include moisture control as a design element .
Likewise , property owners could assume greater responsibility through upkeep measures such as facade cleaning or tree pruning , rather than demanding warranties .
As a result of guarantees , in particular , manufacturers feel increasingly obliged to incorporate biocides into synthetic renders and facade paints .
However , the research team is also involved in discussions with manufacturers concerning innovative embedding processes for biocides and the use of less problematic agents or biocide - free coatings , and it is promoting a close dialogue between academia , industry and the authorities .
Box : Additives
Additives are substances added to products in small quantities to confer or enhance certain properties .
This general term encompasses , for example , antioxidants , ultraviolet filters and flame retardants .
Although biocides are also additives , they are governed – in view of their specific effects on organisms – by the Biocidal Products Ordinance ( VBP ) .
This regulates the authorization procedure , use in products and product labelling .
The Swiss VBP , which has been in force since 2005 , is in line with the EU Biocidal Products Directive ( 98/8 / EC ) .
To protect facades against fungi and algae , a relatively small number of biocides are available .
These are used in combination as mixtures in synthetic resin- bound renders and facade paints .
In some cases they contain agents also used in agriculture , e.g. the herbicides diuron and isoproturon , which also have algicidal properties .
Some of the substances are no longer approved for agricultural applications ( e.g. terbutryn ) or are known from other areas – such as the algicide cybutryne , which is used in marine antifouling paints .
About the author
( NewsTarget )
Many of you may be familiar with the extraordinary life and story of Norman Cousins , diplomat , editor and author .
He died in 1990 but in the mid 1960s he was diagnosed with a fatal disease and told that his death was imminent .
Almost completely paralyzed , Cousins decided to leave the hospital , throw away his medications , check into a hotel and surround himself with things that would make him laugh .
He watched Laurel and Hardy movies , read positive message books , enjoyed comic books from his childhood , and pored over inspirational writings .
Detailed in one of his books , " Anatomy of an Illness , " Cousins chronicled his journey and the unbelievable restoration to complete health with another kind of medicine : laughter along with a changed outlook and attitude .
Can optimists really heal themselves ?
Can humor impact your health ?
If you make statements like , " I 'm sick with worry " or " I 'm scared to death " , could you be fueling an illness ?
Long tern and current research now tells us that the mind and immune system are inexorably connected and do not exist independently .
For example , if you expect illness , you increase the odds of getting an illness .
If you expect good health , your chances of enjoying good health are increased by that attitude .
Duke University reported in the journalthat the way we perceive our health has a dramatic effect on our actual health .
They found that in a group of 3,000 heart patients who were asked to rate their health , those who said it was " very good , " had three times the survival rate of the others who answered " poor " regardless of the variables in their health .
Johns Hopkins University confirms what Duke University reported and says that their researchers interviewed more than 5,000 people over the age of 65 , and regardless of risk factors , those who saw themselves as having poor health , roughly doubled their risk of death within five years .
Hard to believe , but pessimism proves to be more deadly than congestive heart failure or smoking 50 or more packs of cigarettes every year .
Gunnar Engstrom , MD , a professor at Lund University in Sweden has studied self - ratings of health and says , " A positive attitude about health can ward off mental distress and may help provide important protection against diseases .
"
In 1973 Dr. Grossarth - Maticek tested the attitude of thousands of elderly residents in Heidelberg , Germany .
Amazing results surfaced twenty - one years later when he compared the test scores with their current health : " the 300 people who had scored highest turned out to be thirty times more likely to be alive and well 21 years later than the others .
" A seven year study at the University of Texas found that people with an upbeat attitude about life could actually delay ageing suggesting that psychosocial factors play a role along with genes and physical health in determining how fast we age .
They speculate that positive emotions might alter the chemical balance of the body .
Leading the research , Dr. Glenn Ostir told BBC News Online : " I believe that there is a connection between mind and body -- and that our thoughts and attitudes / emotions affect physical functioning and overall health .
" Past president of the Association of Applied and Therapeutic Humor , Steven M. Sultanoff , Ph.D. and clinical psychologist in Irvine , California says , " Humor stimulates laughter and we know that physiological stimulation through laughter leads to a number of health benefits by reducing stress and boosting antibodies that fight infection .
The research , particularly on heart disease , is dramatic .
People who are chronically angry are four to five times more likely to have a heart attack than people who are not .
" There are other studies revealing that depressed people may be 42 percent more likely to develop diabetes .
Sadness seems to stack the odds against you .
John Barefoot , Ph.D. research professor at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina initiated a 25 year study of medical students from the 1950s and discovered at the end of the study in 1980 that the ones who had been hostile were the ones who were more likely to have died .
Later expanded studies have confirmed those same findings .
Support groups can have a powerful impact on your health as well when you 're dealing with sadness and depression or a circumstance that is painful .
In a study at Stanford University researchers found that cancer patients who were included in a support group lived longer .
Our mind is a powerful weapon that can be used to defeat our enemy , disease , or as an ally to heal us and give us great health and a long life .
Maybe there is something to the old adage Laughter is the Best Medicine .

Former Governor : “ Absolutely ” danger of false flag as pretext to attack Iran
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , July 15 , 2008
Former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura warns that Neo-Cons are so desperate to maintain a grip on power that they could stage a terror event in order to create a pretext for attacking Iran .
Speaking on the Alex Jones
Show before last night ’s announcement that he would not be running for U.S. Senate , Ventura said a conflict with Iran was all but inevitable .
“ I do n’t see any way of avoiding it because I think it ’s gonna be Bush ’s last hurrah , ” said Ventura , adding that another war front would only help the Republicans and John McCain .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ We are now a first strike nation , 9/11 changed our entire foreign policy , we will now attack another country before they attack us , which we proved in Iraq , ” he added .
Asked if we were in danger of seeing the Neo - Cons stage some kind of Gulf of Tonkin false flag or other terror event as a pretext for attacking Iran , Ventura responded , “ Absolutely , read the last epilogue in my book , I wrote that a year ago . ”
“ Remember , these two political parties are in bad shape right now , McCain ’s trailing , Republicans look like they ’ll get slaughtered in the Congressional races and they ’re gonna lose all their power so rest assured that some type of decision they will have to come up with in an attempt to continue to keep themselves in power – that ’s their objective , ” stated Ventura .
“ How much more stupid can we be if we buy into this , ” concluded the former Governor .
Ventura said that the war in Iraq is now taking its toll on the U.S. economy and that Americans needed to “ feel the pain ” in order to understand that war is not profitable for the middle class and in fact has the opposite impact .
“ I ’ve always believed what goes around comes around , and we ’re gonna get our comeuppance I think pretty quick here if we do n’t change the path we ’re on and start leading with diplomacy , ” said Ventura .
“ A war is the result of failed political leadership , it ’s that simple , ” added the former Governor .
Rhetoric surrounding a military strike against the Iranians has heated considerably over the last few weeks , with Syria today warning that such an action “ would have grave consequences for the US , Israel and the whole world . ”

Comment on this article
The teary - eyed college student he overpowered in a downtown hotel room gasped and dabbed her eyes as Flory replied to Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Peter Corrigan 's question , " Are you indeed guilty ? "
" Sure - yeah , " Flory said .
She and some supporters lamented when the incident became public last winter that Flory and his followers within the Republican organization had been smearing her reputation in retaliation for accusing Flory of rape .
[ Assistant County Prosecutor Carol Skutnik ] said she found that to be true .
" People were using every opportunity to try to trash her , on Web sites or whatever , " the prosecutor said .
" He 's been running around telling everybody what a piece of trash she is , so she was very happy to see him plead guilty . "
( That 's the appropriate headline , though the Cleveland Plain Dealer went with the gentler Michigan Young Republican pleads guilty in sex case . )
Michael Flory , a 32 - year - old attorney from Jackson , Michigan once hailed by the Michigan Young Republicans ' website as " one of the rising stars of GOP politics in America " who " has earned a great name for himself " doing things like giving a nationally televised speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention , pleaded guilty to sexual battery yesterday .
As eloquent as he is ethical , I see .
Since last summer 's Young Republicans convention , where Flory escorted the young woman back to her hotel room after a party then " violently forced several sex acts upon " her as she slept , he 's spent his time rallying his Republican troops to try to ruin his victim 's reputation for having the temerity to report him .
What a charmer !
So charming , in fact , that Skutnik may soon " present evidence of several ' other incidents of sexual misconduct ' in which Flory took advantage of vulnerable young women .
" Wonkette adds : " Oh , and obviously he was on the Young Leaders Committee or whatever for John McCain ’s campaign . "
Wow .
McCain sure knows how to pick 'em .

The father of a little girl sucked 150 ft ( 46 m ) along an underground drain has told how she had stopped breathing when he pulled her from the River Wear .
Leona Baxter , three , was playing in a puddle when she disappeared .
She had been washed into the uncovered drain and was thrown out into the river .
Her father Mark , 34 , of Leeming , North Yorkshire , jumped into the water and pulled her to safety .
Police officers said the child " miraculously " avoided serious injury .
Leona 's mother Beverley , 32 , performed first aid on the youngster who also suffered a cut to her head .
' Coughing and spluttering '
Mr Baxter said when his daughter disappeared from view he realised she had fallen down a storm drain and that if it was going to go anywhere it would go to the river .
" I ran across the river and I saw what I thought was Leona 's coat and I realised it was Leona floating face down in the river , " he said .
" So I jumped over the side , jumped in , grabbed her and the water went up to my shoulder .
" I put her over my shoulder and patted her back because she was n't breathing .
Leona is recovering in hospital after her ordeal " I could n't move holding Leona as my wellies had filled with water , so I stayed balanced and handed her to Bev who was on a bank .
" As soon as Leona was coughing and spluttering and being sick , I felt much happier because she was breathing then . "
Police said Leona travelled about 150ft underground before being swept into the River Wear , near Durham Cricket ground , on Sunday evening .
Leona was playing with her sister Kiah , six , and the family pet dog Brophy in a puddle at a playground in Riverside Park , Chester - le - Street , when the accident happened .
It is believed the storm drain cover , which had been under about 8in ( 20 cm ) of water , was pushed off by a sudden release of water pressure .
Certain death
The dog , which was also sucked into the drain , is still missing .
Sgt Keith Wardle , of Durham Police , said : " Fortunately when the girl and her dog disappeared her dad quickly realised what was happening .
" He ran to the river bank and plucked her from the swollen river . "
A police spokeswoman said the girl 's father had saved her from " almost certain death " .
Alistair Baker , spokesman for Northumbrian Water , said : " This was obviously a horrendous ordeal for such a little girl .
" A tragedy was averted thanks to the heroics of her father . "

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Last week , falling oil prices looked unstoppable .
The last few days have seen a halt in that slide .
Still with prices well below the record set in July and a shaky world economy threatening demand , the question remains :
How low can oil go ?
Many analysts say oil is unlikely to go much lower than $ 100 a barrel , and it has to do with the rising cost of production .
The overall cost to produce oil has gone up , especially oil from tough to reach places like Canada 's tar sands and the deep water Gulf of Mexico .
These areas require massive investment and materials to produce oil and that expense has risen as the price of commodities surge .
And while they represent a small fraction of total worldwide production , they 're important because some analysts believe prices wo n't fall below the cost of the most expensive barrel of oil .
" I do n't think it will go down below $ 100 for very long , " said Christopher Ruppel , an energy analyst at Execution LLC , a broker and research firm for institutional investors like hedge and mutual funds .
" Once you go down too low , you 'll shut down new production , and prices will go right back up . "
Tar sands : A sticky situation
Oil from Canada 's tar sands , currently producing about 1.2 million barrels a day , is arguably the most expensive oil in world , and is getting even more expensive .
Last year analysts estimated it cost around $ 60 a barrel to produce light oil from here .
The most recent estimate from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers ( CAPP ) now puts that number at $ 75 to $ 90 .
Comparatively , Saudi Arabian crude is said to cost around $ 1 a barrel .
The main culprit behind the increase is the price of steel .
With the world undergoing a boom in building , steel 's price has surged - it 's up 80 % just since the start of this year .
From the massive trucks it takes to mine the oily sand , to the miles of pipes , tubes and towers it takes to refine the heavy oil into a desirable light , sweet crude , it takes a huge amount of steel make the tar sands run .
CAPP estimates 50 to 60 % of a tar - sand operation is affected by steel prices .
Beyond Tar Sands
Other analysts think oil prices have room to drop below $ 100 saying that production from expensive places would n't stop even if it became unprofitable .
The thinking goes something like this :
Since it costs billions to invest in an oil operation like tar sands , it will still cost less to pump and sell that oil than it would to pay the interest on idle equipment .
" Even if you 're not covering all your costs , it 's still a source of cash coming in , " said Paul Weissgarber , an energy expert at the management consultants AT Kearney .
Alex Archila , chief executive of Madagascar
Oil argues that it's not the cost of current oil that sets the price of a barrel , but what it would take to bring future oil online .
" I 'm not sure the logic of relating the most expensive barrel of oil and floor for oil prices is really right , " Archila said .
Even if it 's all about future production , things still do n't look good for a return to $ 50 crude .
Peter Robertson , vice chairman of Chevron , recently told lawmakers that the cost of new production in the deep water Gulf of Mexico could exceed $ 95 a barrel .
Even Archila thinks the cost of the next barrel of oil is somewhere around $ 80 .
" And next year , it could be $ 90 or $ 100 , " he said .
Oil in a volatile environment
Events over the last few days - from talk of an OPEC production cut , trouble in Georgia , and renewed credit fears pushing investors into oil futures - have helped crude prices regain some of the ground they lost over the last month .
It 's hard to tell if the rise over the past few days will be a longer - term trend , or merely a blip as a slowing global economy and slackening demand cause oil prices to fall further .
On the trading floors , talk seems to be of prices going higher , with or without expensive barrels of oil leaving the market .
" I'm a bull here , " Ray Carbone , a broker and trader at Paramount Options , recently told CNNMoney .
" If anything , non-OPEC production has gone down , we 've had no change in supplies , and we have to watch out for OPEC threatening a production cut . "
" Perception is developing that the worst is over on the downside for several reasons , " Nauman Barakat , an energy trader at Macquarie Futures , the trading arm of Macquarie investment bank , wrote in a research note Thursday .
" It looks like the sands are shifting and the sentiment is to buy . "
Pop quiz : are you moderating a presidential debate this fall ?
( Hint : are you old , white , and male ? )
You may be wondering what you 're supposed to ask about !
Sure , you could just ask them to talk about their positions on various issues , politely step back as they lay out policy proposals and debate the merits of said proposals , but then everyone will get bored .
Your job is to stir shit up and force them both into making gaffes !
That is how we decide what to talk about when we talk about campaigns .
So .
Because we dislike John McCain , personally , we will now explain how best to cause him to say or do something stupid during a debate .
But do n't worry , Republicans : we have a trick to trip up Obama too !
Foreign Policy
This one 's a gimme , because John McCain does n't know a goddamn thing about the rest of the world except that he wants to bomb it .
There was the " Iraq / Pakistan border " thing , which could maybe be explained by him saying Iraq instead of Afghanistan , and the Czechoslovakia thing , which is pretty much just explained by him being lol old , and mistaking Sunnis with Shiites constantly and also thinking al - Qaeda was training in Iran , which can really only be explained by not giving a shit about minor details like who we 're " fighting " besides Muslims in general .
But now that his confusion has spread to Western Europe , his handlers should be worried .
" John McCain does n't know where Spain is " is basically a gift to the Democrats .
Of course McCain can and will play off any debate question about his gaffes with a condescending " of course I know [ blank ] " statement , followed by a carefully coached recitation of lessons his handlers drilled into him , which defuses the issue , but it 's a clear sign that he 'll be tripped up by a different lame gotcha question about world leaders or geography .
Do people actually care when a candidate does n't know " trivia " ?
Not really , but if he plays further into the " confused old man " routine it 'll hurt him way more than idiocy did Bush .
The Economy Ask him just about anything about the current Wall Street crisis .
Wait for weird disjointed pseudo - Democrat talk about regulation .
Followup with any serious statement John McCain has made on the economy during his 100 years as an anti-regulation Republican .
Watch him forced to either sell out his Capitalist base or deliver some decidedly not - populist rhetoric .
Torture Ask him , Andrew Sullivan style , if he believes the CIA should be allowed to use " interrogation techniques " similar and in some cases worse than the torture inflicted on him by the North Vietnamese .
Offer to demonstrate !
( Though , of course , 24 viewers definitely think the CIA should be allowed to torture , and McCain is maybe helped by any mention of his POW years , but still , this shit was indefensible . )
His Commercials , Campaign , and Surrogates Just ask him if he " stands by " or can defend almost any number of questionable things his campaign has done .
As we saw on The View , he will not apologize , but he will look pissed off as he half - heartedly defends shit he used to hate .
Which is way worse than apologizing would be .
Bonus : How to Trip Up Barack Obama
Ask a serious question about a complex and important issue .
Make it one that requires Obama to speak extemporaneously .
He 'll answer , as he thinks through it , with something pretty reasonable , but complex , and he will say " Uh , " and then McCain will say " shut up , Brainiac !
Babies are tiny angels , why do you want to kill them ? "
THE END .
In what could be the biggest bailout since the Great Depression , top government officials and congressional leaders agreed late Thursday to quickly develop a comprehensive plan aimed at defusing the nation ’s roiling financial crisis .
The plan would relieve financial institutions of the mortgage - backed securities and other bad assets that are threatening the nation ’s economic health .
Under the proposal , details of which were not announced , Washington would buy the distressed assets , allowing banks to resume their usual borrowing and lending , according to people familiar with the plan .
The approach could be similar to the formation of the Resolution Trust Corp. during the 1980s to resolve the savings and loan crisis .
In a meeting between lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , the top officials suggested that once the financial system was rebooted in this fashion , the government would be able to sell off the assets to recover taxpayers ’ money and perhaps even turn a profit , according to the people privy to the plan , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .

The plan could be unveiled as early as today and voted on by Congress by next week .
News of the rescue plan sent Asian markets soaring this morning .
Lawmakers emerging from a 90 - minute session in the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) said they expected a detailed proposal from Bernanke and Paulson overnight and to work through the weekend in an effort to pass it quickly into law .
The tone at the meeting was deadly serious , as Paulson and Bernanke stressed to lawmakers that the crisis could get far worse .

“ I think we had some sobering news tonight , ” Sen . Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , top Republican on the Senate Banking committee , said as he left the meeting .
Members of both parties pledged in a brief news conference to work cooperatively .
“ It ’s clear that even though we ’re just six weeks away from an election , our job is to put our partisan differences aside and to work to help solve this crisis , ” said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
The meeting capped a day of high drama as government officials , lawmakers and traders sought to keep the financial contagion that staggered markets on Wednesday from resuming its destructive course .
To ease the credit crisis , the Fed announced early Thursday that it would boost to nearly $ 250 billion the funds available for major foreign central banks .
Meanwhile , the Securities and Exchange Commission signaled its intention to follow its British counterpart in issuing a temporary ban on short selling .

Short selling is a means of betting that a stock ’s price will fall by selling borrowed shares in hopes they can be repurchased at a lower price .
The practice has been increasingly blamed for causing sudden drops in companies ’ stock values , frightening away lenders and leaving the firms financially beached .
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox was meeting with commissioners late Thursday .
“ We are likely to take additional steps in the days ahead that are more particularly addressed to this urgent situation , ” Cox said .
Early reports that a comprehensive rescue was in the works caused U.S. stock prices to reverse course from Wednesday .
Traders on the New York Stock Exchange broke into cheers Thursday as the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average switched from a 200 - point loss to a rise of 410.03 points , or 3.9 % , at 11,019.69 .
The Nasdaq composite index gained 100.25 points , or 4.8 % , ending at 2,199.10 , and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index climbed 50.12 points , or 4.3 % , to close at 1,206.33 , its largest one - day percentage gain in nearly six years .

Paulson and Bernanke acted on their new plan after two tumultuous weeks in which policymakers took ad hoc steps that failed to reassure panicky investors .
They seized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as insurance behemoth American International Group Inc. , and effectively pulled the plug on investment banks Lehman Bros .
Holdings Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co .
They also coaxed a group of 10 big financial institutions to kick into a $ 70 - billion self - insurance pool and pumped out billions of dollars more to try to reverse a new and dangerous credit market freeze - up .
The full dimensions of Washington ’s intervention came into focus late Thursday when the Fed issued figures showing it had made nearly $ 100 billion in special loans to financial firms around the world in the last week alone .
Separately , Treasury announced that it would double to $ 200 billion the amount of government securities it would sell at special auctions to raise money to bolster the Fed ’s finances .
The department had announced Wednesday the first $ 100 billion in auctions .
According to those familiar with Bernanke ’s and Paulson ’s thinking , both of these efforts would be dwarfed by the new plan -- the price of which could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars or more .

Much about the plan remained uncertain , and working out the details promises to be difficult for lawmakers , who are on edge because of the upcoming election .
A protracted legislative battle over the plan could have a calamitous effect on the battered financial system -- a possibility that congressional leaders seemed to recognize in their pledges for quick , bipartisan action .
For example , would the government take the bad assets on its own books or create a separate entity ?
Would the government allow only certain types of institutions like banks to sell their troubled investments to Washington , or would auctions be open to all comers ?
Advertisement
Would only certain kinds of assets , such as mortgage - backed securities or so - called collateralized debt obligations , be eligible for sale , or could institutions unload any kind of bad investments ?
And behind all these questions lurks an even more difficult one :
Is there any way to determine what the bad assets being sold are worth to ensure the government does n’t get cheated in the deal ?
In fact , it is the assets that are the hardest to sell and therefore the hardest to value that are at the heart of the current crisis .
They are also the ones financial institutions will be most eager to hand over to the government .
Paulson and Bernanke apparently hope to solve this problem by using an auction where the government would buy the troubled assets of those asking the lowest prices .
Advertisement
But the simple fact of such a giant government intervention in private markets and the lack of any effective guide to tell whether Washington is paying a reasonable amount could prove a political obstacle .
“ I ’m deeply troubled by this plan , ” Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) said .
“ What is missing from it and from the recent string of bailouts is a commitment to return to a free enterprise economy .
. . .
What we need now is not what could be nearly a trillion dollars in new taxpayer bailouts but pro-growth policies that allow our markets to correct and start growing again . ”
After keeping a low profile on the economic crisis all week , President Bush stepped before the cameras Thursday .
He canceled plans to travel to Florida and Alabama for political fundraisers and instead received a briefing on the financial situation from Paulson and other advisors , then delivered a short statement .
“ As our recent actions demonstrate , my administration is focused on meeting these challenges , ” Bush said .
“ The American people can be sure we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence . ”

Bush ’s comments appeared to make little impression on the markets , which continued to fall until the final hour of trading , when rumors of a comprehensive rescue plan set off a rally .
“ I ’ve been running funds in this space for 12 1 / 2 years , and this is the craziest day I ’ve seen , ” said Anton Schutz , manager of Burnham Financial Funds in New York .
“ One minute you ’re terrified and stock prices are melting and the next minute they ’re bouncing back . ”

The government works on a plan to buy distressed assets from banks and other institutions to be resold in an orderly fashion .
The Dow Jones industrial average jumps 3.9 % , the largest one - day percentage gain in nearly six years .
U.S. regulators look to curb short selling -- bets that stocks will go down -- after Britain bans short selling in the country ’s major financial stocks for the rest of the year .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s decision to send troops to Georgia has set a new standard for defending its national interests and the United States must learn to live with it , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday .
Russia crushed its southern neighbor in a brief war last month after Georgia tried to recapture by force its pro-Moscow , separatist region of South Ossetia .
It drew Western condemnation by pushing far beyond the disputed area , bombing and deploying troops deep inside Georgia proper .
“ Through its response to the Georgian aggression , Russia has set a kind of standard for reaction , which fully complies with international law , ” Lavrov told students of Moscow ’s diplomatic college in a speech to mark the start of the new academic year .
“ Russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens . ”
Any doubts about this should have been dispelled by its action in Georgia and recognition of two pro-Russian provinces as independent states , said Lavrov , whose harshest words were addressed to Washington and NATO .
“ America needs to acknowledge the reality of the post - American world and start adapting to it , ” Lavrov said .
“ An attempt to live in its own unipolar world has gone on too long , and this is dangerous in every respect . ”
He added : “ There is a feeling that NATO again needs frontline states to justify its existence . ”

However , he reiterated Moscow ’s commitment to continue dialogue with the United States .
“ We will deal with any America , ” Lavrov said , urging Washington to exercise “ reciprocity and absolute honesty ” in ties .
“ We will continue talking to Washington as long as there is a tiny hope of understanding each other and making a deal . ”
“ MOMENT OF TRUT H ”
The speech , focused on new relations between Russia and the West , was made hours before EU leaders were due to gather in Brussels to discuss a common stance in the Georgian crisis .
Lavrov made clear Russia would not bow to any pressure .
He was expounding new foreign policy guidelines set by President Dmitry Medvedev , who despite Western expectations of a softer line has formalized the assertive stance of his predecessor Vladimir Putin .
Medvedev said in a television interview on Sunday that Russia would adhere to international law but not accept a U.S. - led “ unipolar world ” , and laid claim to specific spheres of national interest that Russia would defend .
Over the past few years , the West has been watching with alarm the increasingly assertive policy of a resurgent Russia , fearing a revival of Soviet - era imperialism .
Russia , in turn , has accused the West of building new lines of division in the world by failing to treat it as an equal .
Lavrov said the conflict in Georgia had come as a “ long - cherished moment of truth ” , adding that “ today ’s clarity is better than any ambiguity . ”
Europe ’s inability to produce a new collective security system , “ open for everyone and taking into account everyone ’s interests ” , was to blame for the Georgia crisis , he said .
“ Something should be done because otherwise Euro - Atlantic affairs will keep returning to square one . ”
Russia has proposed calling a security conference in Europe , to create new arrangements for neutralizing threats in the continent .
It views NATO ’s eastward expansion and the deployment of parts of a U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security .
Plans to grant NATO membership to ex-Soviet Georgia and Ukraine are anathema for Moscow .
“ In the absence of a reasonable multilateral dialogue we will be forced to react unilaterally , ” Lavrov said .
“ But we would indeed prefer joint work on European security issues . ”
Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev today said it would be " no great loss " if Nato decided to call off its relationship with Moscow , adding that the Kremlin was unconcerned by possible sanctions from the west over its invasion of Georgia .
Medvedev said ties with Nato had " worsened sharply " following the war in Georgia earlier this month , which he said came from Georgian " aggression " .
" We are ready to take any decision [ from Nato ] , up to halting relations altogether , " Medvedev declared .
Speaking in Sochi , where he was meeting Russia 's hawkish ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , Medvedev said " collaboration " with Nato was more in the alliance 's interests than Russia's .
" If this breaks nothing terrible will happen to us , " he noted .
Medvedev 's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia 's already fraught relations with the west .
He spoke after MPs from Russia 's upper and lower houses voted this morning to back independence for Georgia 's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
France 's president Nicholas Sarkozy has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia to consider future relations with Moscow .
It comes amid growing European dismay at Russia 's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops .
The US vice president , Dick Cheney , will also visit Tbilisi next week .
Yesterday the Germans - who together with the rest of the EU , continue to insist on Georgia 's territorial integrity - condemned the Russian votes as unhelpful .
They were " in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions , " the German government said .
Russia 's upper house , or Federation Council , voted 130 - 0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia 's independence .
The Duma passed the same motion 447- 0 .
Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin .
Several MPs compared Georgia 's president Mikheil Saakashvili to Hitler - likening his incursion earlier this month into South Ossetia to the Nazi's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union .
The Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh thanked Medvedev for his " courageous " support , adding : " It 's a historic day . "
Russia has previously stopped short of recognizing the regions ' independence .
But Moscow is now likely to use the votes to pressure the international community to accept that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are no different from Kosovo - which won US - backed independence in February , despite vehement opposition from Russia and Belgrade .
Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could " forget about " its territorial integrity .
But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia - which faces growing insurgencies in its own southern ethnic republics , and has fought two brutal wars battling separatism in Chechnya .
One analyst yesterday said he though it unlikely the Kremlin would unilaterally recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia 's independence .
" This would be more troublesome and problematic for Russia , " Fyodor Lukyanov , the editor - in - chief of Russia in Global Affairs said .
Russia 's preferred " scenario " would be for both territories to eventually win Kosovo - style acceptance , he said , rather than suffer the lingering unresolved fate of Turkish - backed North Cyprus .
" My guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations , " he added .
Georgia national security council secretary , Alexander Lomaia , said the Kremlin would isolate itself if it recognised the regions , which have enjoyed de facto independence since civil wars in the early 1990s .
" If it does this Russia will further isolate itself from the entire world , and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia , " he told Reuters .
Georgia today said Russian troops continued to occupy much of the country .
In the Black Sea port of Poti , Russian soldiers rolled into the port terminal and took away computers and photocopiers in armoured personnel carriers , Georgian officials said .
The deputy chief of Russia 's army staff , Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said his troops were merely performing peacekeeping duties .
He said the EU - brokered ceasefire deal allowed them to be there , despite the fact it calls for Russian forces to go back to the positions they occupied before the war started .
Nogovitsyn said Russian troops were needed in Poti , not least because of the arrival in the area of Nato ships .
" The fact that there are nine western warships in the Black Sea can not but be a cause for concern , " he suggested .

PALIN’S CONSTRUCTION BONDS ….
The good news is , Sarah Palin felt confident enough yesterday to actually answer a question during a public appearance .
The bad news , she answered a question during a public appearance .
During a quick stop at a diner in Cleveland , Ohio , Sarah Palin was asked for her reaction to the AIG bailout .
“ Disappointed that taxpayers are called upon to bailout another one , ” she said .
“ Certainly AIG though with the construction bonds that they ’re holding and with the insurance that they are holding very , very impactful to Americans so you know the shot that has been called by the Feds it ’s understandable but very , very disappointing that taxpayers are called upon for another one . ” [… ]
Though she has been on the campaign trail for nearly three weeks , Palin has yet to hold a press conference , and this morning ’s stop marked the first time she answered a question from the press on the fly , prompting concerned looks from staffers .
And why were staffers overcome with “ concerned looks ” ?
It might have something to do with Palin ’s belief that AIG holds “ impactful ” “ construction bonds . ”
I ’m afraid this does n’t make sense .
As Kevin put it , “ Construction bonds ?
What is she talking about ?
Maybe performance bonds ?
Not that that makes any more sense .
What ’s more , I ’m pretty sure that AIG ’s consumer and commercial insurance business was n’t in any danger .
So why focus on that ?
I mean , if you ’re only going to give the press a single sentence , why not spit out something about counterparty risk and leave their jaws hanging ? ”
Hubris in an unprepared candidate is not a positive trait .
Putting this in the broader context , in just the last two weeks , we ’ve seen Sarah Palin get confused about foreign policy , housing policy , entitlements , and now , economic policy .
Dan Drezner , a conservative who does n’t understand Palin ’s appeal , added , “ Her best skill displayed to date was delivering a speech off a teleprompter ( not insignificant in politics , mind you ) and she ’s apparently exaggerating that skill as well . ”
It occurs to me that first - time candidates for national office often struggle to get over the learning curve .
Governors and senators will visit a coffee shop in Iowa City eight months before the caucuses , get confused about a policy detail , but improve as the campaign rolls on .
They take their time , go through extensive briefings , and learn to get good .
By the time the conventions are done , these candidates are supposed to be on the top of their game .
In this sense , Palin is in a situation where failure is almost impossible to avoid .
She ’s never expressed any knowledge of national or international issues , she ’s never expressed any interest in national or international issues , and she ’s making humiliating mistakes under the glare of the national spotlight , with less than two months until Election Day .
With some time in government , Palin might become a less embarrassing candidate .
But at this point , it ’s almost unfair for McCain to set her up for this kind of fiasco .
Here at SubHub , we like to keep up on what is happening on the Internet and in particular watching how business owners are making money online .
When it comes to making money online , change tends to be evolutionary , rather than revolutionary .
However by keeping an eye on the small moves it is usually possible to predict the bigger trends .
So here are my thoughts on what is happening in the Internet market at the moment :
1 ) Advertising and Affiliate Networks Want Control of Content
The big advertising and affiliate networks are starved of good quality online content .
They have the advertisers ; they just do n’t have enough good places to display the ads .
As a result , the ad networks are trying to buy content websites so they have greater control over the quality .
Example deals include :
• Facebook buying CTRL - labs
• Salesforce picking up Tableau
• Twilio acquires SendGrid
Prediction :
The ad networks will continue to buy content websites so they have more control over their advertising inventory .
Pros :
The quality of content on these sites will continue to improve .
Cons : Advertisers , via the networks , will be able to influence the content .
Independence could be sacrificed to keep advertisers happy .
2 ) Content Websites Will Deal Direct with Advertisers
The big content sites and content networks have enough traffic and influence that they can deal directly with advertisers , cutting the networks out of the loop .
This trend is particularly clear in the blogging arena where groups of successful bloggers are joining forces to sell their content directly to advertisers .
Examples include :
• Federated Media – www.federatedmedia.net
• B5 Media – www.b5media.com
• Gawker – www.gawker.com
Prediction : Content owners will become more powerful .
Advertisers will want to deal with the organ grinder , not the monkey .
This trend is one of the reasons the ad networks are buying up content websites .
They are worried about being cut out of the loop .
Pros : Content owners and creators who are part of these networks will earn more money .
Cons : Content independence will be put in jeopardy .
3 ) Clustering of Niche Content
There is a trend towards clustering together lots of niche sites that cover the same subject and target a similar audience .
This niche network of sites can then be marketed to advertisers and ad agencies .
In the early days of the Internet , advertisers were only interested in reaching as many people on the Internet as possible .
They focused their spend on the handful of sites with huge audiences – Yahoo , MSN , AOL , etc .
Today advertisers are far more street wise and are starting to focus on the quality of visitor , rather than the quantity .
Examples of companies focused on aggregating niche websites include :
• Adify – www.adify.com
• Gorilla Nation – www.gorillanation.com
Predictions :
Highly targeted niche content will become more valuable as advertisers start to focus on results rather than reach .
Advertisers will still want to buy big blocks of inventory , so niche aggregators will become more important .
Pros : Niche content providers will develop more earning power for making money online .
Cons : Niche markets will become more competitive .
4 ) Merchants Will be More Ruthless About Who They Use as Affiliate Partners
Merchants who use affiliate marketing as their primary focus for making money online usually make at least 80 % of their affiliate revenues from less than 20 % of their affiliate partners .
However in the past they have spent a lot of their time persuading their less active partners to sell more .
This is changing .
Most merchants are now getting rid of their poor quality partners and focusing on their very productive ones .
Prediction :
It will become harder for website owners to dabble with affiliate marketing .
They will have to either do it properly or not do it at all .
Pros :
Those website which take affiliate marketing seriously are likely to get a lot more support from the merchants and as a result make more money .
Cons :
It will be harder for new websites to get started with quality affiliate partners .
5 ) Drop Shipping Will Come of Age
Drop shipping is where a manufacturer or wholesaler holds stock and takes care of sending goods to customers on behalf of a website owner .
An online retailer sets up a shop on their site .
When an order comes through they take payment and send the request to the drop shipper , who then packs and posts the product to the customer and invoices the website owner .
Drop shipping has been around on the Internet for many years , but the industry has had a bad name because of the very mixed quality of the suppliers .
Now many manufacturers and wholesalers are getting their act together and setting up divisions dedicated to fulfilling internet orders .
Take a look at Shopster.com to get an insight into the ways things are going .
Prediction : Drop shipping will grow rapidly and become an important revenue stream for thousands of internet businesses .
Pros : Drop shipping will become another good source of income for niche website owners .
Cons :
It will take time for the cowboys to be pushed out the industry , so many website owners will have bad experiences before they crack this opportunity .
6 ) Ecommerce Will Continue to Grow
Ecommerce has passed the tipping point in terms of making money online .
It will continue to grow and prosper .
However , buyers will become far cleverer at searching for deals .
They will research and compare prices .
This will squeeze the margin out of many generic products ( books , cds , electronic goods , etc ) .
Predictions : Selling generic goods will be a volumes low margin business .
This will be dominated by a few huge players , like Amazon .
These companies wo n’t bother with low volume niche products , which will still be sold through niche sites .
Pros :
Niche websites with loyal audiences will be able to grow their ecommerce revenues as more shopping moves online .
Cons : Small online businesses selling generic goods will go out of business .
7 ) Paid - for Content Will Have to Be Unique and Exclusive
Finding good quality free information on the web continues to get easier .
Internet users will not pay for free content that is easily available .
In that sense , making money online becomes more difficult .
However evidence and research suggests that people will continue to pay for niche content that is not readily available elsewhere .
They will also pay to be part of a specialist community where they can mix with their peers .
Prediction : Websites trying to sell access to me - too content will fail .
Specialist content providers who create unique content and online communities will continue to prosper as print publications fail or move online .
Pros :
The best content websites will grow bigger and more profitable .
Cons : Some paid - for sites will fail as free alternatives become available .
Conclusion
Making money online continues to evolve .
With every change new opportunities emerge .
Website owners should put aside time each week to keep up to date with what is happening .
Making money online is something everyone can do , but the people who make a lot of money are those that ride each new wave .
I Have Bailout Burnout
By now everyone knows how I feel about the bailout , I hate it .
But I have to think that there is only one thing more boring than writing about it and watching the news about it and that is actually reading my posts on how I feel about the bailout .
With the possible exception at the conclusion of the bailout deal this will be my last post on the bailout .
I have bailout burnout .
Allow me to vent .
( Warning it may not be pretty . )
A plea to all involved , JUST FINISH IT .
As long as you are going to sell our economic system into socialism in the end , than just finish it .
I m sick of hearing about it , I am sick of writing about it , and I am sick reading about it .
If this is such an emergency that the free market needs to be sold into socialism than DO IT NOW !
Than we can get on to finishing the transition into socialism .
You have already taken over the mortgage industry and there are other industries that you must focus on taking over once you have your greedy little hands on all of our economic system .
Once you have secured the nationalization of America ’s economic system it will be time for a government takeover of other industries that are floundering .
The next logical step would be for the government to seize and bailout the struggling auto industry and this bill also begins that process .
But why stop there ?
There is another industry that is in trouble and in need of a seizure and bailout , the airline industry .
They have been struggling since 9/11 and it is about time for the government to take them over and form a centralized airline industry .
And then the government can continue on to an industry that they have already threatened to socialize , the oil industry .
Government will now have control over the economy and mortgage industry , the automobile and airline industry , and BIG OIL , but wait there ’s more .
It does n’t get any better .
Liberals already have control over the mainstream media , television and most newspapers and are able to spread their propaganda , liberals already run the schools and are able to indoctrinate innocent school age children into their socialization mindset .
Then comes the “ issue ” of global warming and it ’s true hidden agenda of taxing and regulating the American people .
More taxes , and less freedom through regulations in the name of global warming is just another subtle subjugation of the American people .
And as if the prospect of the left leaning media and schools is n’t scary enough , the last remaining place where conservative talk is still prevalent , talk radio and the blogs , will be shut down with the re-institution of the fairness doctrine .
Thus all opposing views will no longer have an outlet to oppose this socialist agenda .
And just in case you were thinking that there may be a revolt , do n’t forget that Barack Obama is opposed to the second amendment , no matter what he says now .
Forget that revolt .
As the government takes more of our money and gives it to others , as the government restricts our freedoms , and as the government begins to take over more and more of once private companies it make me wonder what the hell is going on in our country .
How did we get here ?
I am frustrated and I am tired of hearing about this bailout and how it is needed , and then when you hear that if the government ever turns a profit on these loans that the first 20 % of the profits will go to community groups like ACORN , a fraudulent and corrupt agency that participates in election fraud year after year , it is enough to drive me crazy .
This post is probably proof of that .
I think that I am suffering from BDS , Bailout Derangement Syndrome .
This post was meant to be kind of tongue in cheek , and a little sarcastic .
I do n’t know how it will come across , maybe people will just think that I lost my mind .
It does n’t matter though .
What does matter is that we are reaching a crossroads in this country , a fork in the road .
And we have to decide whether we are going to turn left or right .
I fear we are going to turn way too far to the left .
As the government begins to get involved in matters concerning private companies and citizens we have to ask ourselves , “ is this what the founders envisioned ? ”
Instead of buying costly new appliances for your kitchen , it 's cheap and easy to give the old ones a face lift .
With cleaning fluid , a toothbrush , and some stainless steel contact paper , you can make old appliances look new , and the Handyman Fix Home Repair site details how .
The instructions detail the process for a refrigerator and stove , but it 's probably easier to start off with a smaller appliance .
The same principles apply — do a deep cleaning and go slow and steady with the paper .
Cut a few strategic holes for buttons and knobs , and that hand - me - down toaster is looking a lot more usable .
Thanks Kevin !

Andrew Sullivan at The Atlantic hits it right on the head .
John McCain has gone back on his word not to play up his POW experiences during the presidential campaign , so this is absolutely fair game .
He 's not just exploiting his time as a POW , he 's lifting other people 's stories to gain sympathy .
Couple that with his vote in the Senate to allow Americans to use the same torture " enhanced interrogation techniques " that were used on him and he leaves himself wide open for this one .
It was just a matter of time ... ( h/t Jamie )
In all the discussion of John McCain 's recently recovered memory of a religious epiphany in Vietnam , one thing has been missing .
The torture that was deployed against McCain emerges in all the various accounts .
It involved sleep deprivation , the withholding of medical treatment , stress positions , long - time standing , and beating .
Sound familiar ?
According to the Bush administration 's definition of torture , McCain was therefore not tortured .
Cheney denies that McCain was tortured ; as does Bush .
So do John Yoo and David Addington and George Tenet .
In the one indisputably authentic version of the story of a Vietnamese guard showing compassion , McCain talks of the agony of long - time standing .
A quarter century later , Don Rumsfeld was putting his signature to memos lengthening the agony of " long - time standing " that victims of Bush 's torture regime would have to endure .
These torture techniques are , according to the president of the United States , merely " enhanced interrogation . "

DAMASCUS , Syria ( CNN ) --
Syria hopes a series of indirect talks with Israel will soon lead to direct negotiations , President Bashar al - Assad told CNN's Cal Perry Thursday in an exclusive interview .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy ( right ) and Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad meet in Damascus .
Al - Assad said that possibility was discussed during a summit attended by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the leaders of Turkey and Qatar .
Word of the Syrian proposal came during a landmark visit to Damascus by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
He and Syrian President Bashar al - Assad took part in a summit Thursday that also included the leaders of Turkey and Qatar .
" The dialogue today was about the peace , " al - Assad told CNN 's Cal Perry in an exclusive interview .
" I could not say we achieved something but starting the dialogue is a positive issue . "
Al - Assad told CNN : " We are talking about the future , the role of Europe and especially France in particular during the next phase which is the direct negotiations , " he said .
Syria and Israel have been involved in indirect talks in Turkey for the past few months .
There have been four rounds of talks so far , and Syria hopes to begin a fifth round early next week , according to a senior official close to the negotiations .
The Syrian government has put forward a six - point proposal outlining goals for furthering indirect talks with Israel , a senior Syrian government official .
The Syrian government handed the proposal to Turkey to pass along to Israel , the senior official said .
Israeli officials did not immediately confirm whether they had received a copy of Syria 's proposals , but they did say they were trying to set up another round of talks with Turkish mediation .
" We are still interested in the continuation of the talks with a genuine intention to reach an agreement , " an Israeli official said .
U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the United States wants to see Syria " play a more productive role in the region . "
" I think it remains to be seen just how serious Syria is about engaging in peace discussions with Israel , " Wood said .
" If Syria is serious about it , about making peace with Israel , I think what is important is to see actions not words . "
Al - Assad has consistently said the United States must be involved in the process before any direct talks can begin .
He has also said there is no point in involving the U.S. before the presidential election in November .
The Bush administration has n't " done anything , to be honest , " he said .
" Now it 's too late .
We have to wait for the next administration , after the American election , to see what we can do . "
Al - Assad added that he would be happy to host whichever presidential candidate won the election but would not say if he thought Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama would be better for U.S. - Syrian relations .
Sarkozy is the highest - level French official to visit Syria since their good relations froze after the 2005 assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister , anti-Syrian Rafik Hariri .
A U.N. - appointed commission investigating Hariri's assassination has implicated top Syrian officials .
Syria has denied any involvement in Hariri 's murder .

Sarkozy said Wednesday the two countries were about to open a new page in their friendship , the official Syrian news agency , SANA , reported .
The French president said indirect talks between Syria and Israel were " excellent " for the two countries and for the region , and he expressed hope that they would lead to direct talks as soon as possible , SANA said .
The main issue in the Syria - Israel negotiations is the Golan Heights , which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war .
The senior official close to the negotiations said one prospect being discussed is a land - buyback plan to allow Syria to purchase the Golan Heights over a period of 99 years .
CNN 's Cal Perry and Jordana Miller contributed to this report .

In his 40 - some - year career , recovery agent Hank Leleu has witnessed enough economic downturns to know how they 'll play out .
Once people start missing payments on their " toys , " a storm starts brewing .
He knows that just from experience .
The country has fallen on hard times once during each of the decades of Leleu 's career , and he says it 's always the same story .
When times are good , people buy , often beyond their means .
When times are bad , as is now the case in the U.S. , debt collectors and recovery agents come calling .
In a sense , they 're profiting from other people 's misery , and there 's usually plenty to go around .
There 's something different about this one though , Leleu says , particularly about the people who are receiving these calls .
" It seems like no one is really exempt from this cycle , " says Leleu , who operates ARB Las Vegas .
From November 2006 to March 2007 , ARB was averaging a recovery of 43 high - line cars a month .
For the same period a year later , ARB averaged 55 high - line cars a month .
These figures include brand names such as Mercedes , Porsche and Bentley .
Leleu says that a year ago , approximately 75 % of the cars recovered were C - and E - class Mercedes Benz , carrying sticker prices of $ 35,000 to $ 80,000 .
A year later , the numbers are up by 28 % or so , but the true picture here is that now 75 % of the high - line cars ARB is recovering are valued in the range of $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 .
We 're pulling cars from mortgage bankers , real - estate firms , " Leleu says .
" We 're talking about upper - echelon people .
It 's like nobody seems to have that savings or extra borrowing ability to get them over the hump . "
There has been no clear forecast on the size of this hump .
Until we 're on the other side , people who profit from others ' financial losses , whether they operate pawnshops or run bankruptcy law firms , will thrive .
It 's nothing personal ; it 's just business , and a countercyclical one at that .
These are industries that see a spike in demand during the economic downside .

Door - to - door sales crews or indentured servants ?
SpinSpotter , a new start - up , could send shivers across many a newsroom .
The Web tool , which went live Monday at the DEMO technology conference in San Diego , scans news stories for signs of spin .
Users download Spinoculars , a toolbar that sits atop the browser and lets readers know if the story they are reading has any phrases or words that indicate bias .
( It works only in Firefox now and will work in Internet Explorer in a couple weeks . )
It highlights those phrases in a big red box , and readers can click to find out what exactly SpinSpotter found wrong with the phrase .
SpinSpotter founder and chief creative officer , Todd Herman , put it a different way : “ Our mission is to make news media transparent . ”
The Spinoculars find spin in three ways , said Mr. Herman .
First , it uses an algorithm to seek out phrases that violate six transgressions that the company ’s journalism advisory board came up with based on the Society of Professional Journalists ’
Code of Ethics .
They are personal voice , passive voice , a biased source , disregarded context , selective disclosure and lack of balance .
Soon SpinSpotter will add a feature that will alert readers if a story uses suspiciously similar language to a press release .
SpinSpotter ’s algorithm also uses a database of common phrases that are used when spinning a story .
Finally , readers can flag instances of spin .
Other SpinSpotter users can see these flags , and the reported phrases will enter the spin database .
Contributors are given trust ratings that are determined by the algorithm along with a group of journalism graduate school students .
Monday Mr. Herman flagged a story on CNNMoney.com .
His first problem was the headline : “ How plan protects taxpayers . ”
It assumed that the plan would protect taxpayers , a misuse of the reporter ’s voice , he thought .
The story cited a “ bond guru , ” which Mr. Herman thought also misused the reporter ’s voice by failing to provide evidence that the source was indeed a guru .
It also quoted a university lecturer without stating his affiliation with a Web site , which Mr. Herman thought was selective disclosure .
I decided to try out SpinSpotter , with the trepidation only a journalist would feel .
Searching for spin is one of the country ’s favorite pastimes , especially this political season , and The New York Times fields a fair amount of that criticism .
Would big red boxes cover the Web site ?
First , I clicked on a bunch of my recent stories .
All clear .
No spin .
I adjusted the spin level down to 1 ( 5 grants the highest tolerance for spin , 1 the lowest . )
Still no spin .
Relieved , I searched some other stories on NYTimes.com .
No spin .
I tried another news site .
Still no spin .
Desperately wanting to find spin , I went to the Silicon Valley gossip site , Valleywag , which makes no qualms about writing stories with its own snarky spin .
Yet calling PR people “ the most annoying people in our inbox ” did not raise any red flags on SpinSpotter .
Writing that Rupert Murdoch is “ not going to have any luck recruiting an outsider to fill the spot ” of MySpace China chief executive was n’t spin either .
That is partly because SpinSpotter has started out with very few phrases in its database of spin , said Mr. Herman .
“ Referring to something as spin is a pretty serious thing , ” he said .
“ We do n’t want to go through vandalizing properties .
We would like to do this responsibly . ”
The company will watch how users react to the red flags that its algorithm catches and and decide how vigilant to be , and as users report their own spin sightings , the spin database will gradually fill up with user entries .
SpinSpotter acknowledges at the top of its
Web site that it is “ very beta . ”
Still , there are limits to an algorithm .
It can spot phrases , but can not account for context or tone .
After more searching , I finally found a news story on NYTimes.com in which the Spinoculars discovered spin .
Right there in the lede of a story in the Washington section was a big red box highlighting the words “ politically difficult ” in this sentence :
Congressional Democrats have scrapped plans for another vote on expansion of the Children ’s Health Insurance Program , thus sparing Republicans from a politically difficult vote just weeks before elections this fall .
I clicked on the little S that showed up next to the red box to get SpinSpotter ’s verdict : the phrase “ politically difficult ” revealed too much of the reporter ’s voice .
“ Politically difficult in whose mind ?
By what standard ? ” SpinSpotter asked .
To be sure , the writer did not cite who exactly thinks the vote might be politically difficult .
Was it spin , or was the writer helpfully drawing upon his knowledge of current tensions between Congressional Democrats and Republicans and the sensitivity of a particular bill to give readers a fuller picture ?
If you play 2 sound waves that are very close in frequency ( but not quite exactly the same ) , you ’ll get a phenomenon that causes beat frequencies between the 2 sound waves .
As it turns out , if you play these 2 frequencies separately into your 2 different ears , your brain tries to resolve the difference between the 2 frequencies and “ hears ” the beat frequency even though it is n’t there .
Binaural Beats
The interesting thing is that these perceived beat frequencies cause your brain to do some strange things .
The imaginary beat frequency manages to somehow force your brain to start taking on the frequency of the beat frequency ( I guess based on some sort of resonance or interference concept ) and people are using this idea to actually modify their mood and mental state .
Some say that it works so well that you can recreate the effects of meditation , happiness , and even the effects of certain drugs , all without leaving the comfort of your own headphones .
There are a couple of companies that sell the software and the files for it ( usually for about $ 5 apiece ) , but I ’ve found a free version .
Free Binaural Beats
There is an open source piece of software called SbaGen that you can download that will play the binaural files through headphones and it comes with a number of presets .
If you look around , you ’ll find a number of sites where you can download other presets as well .
OK so you ’re too lazy to use the Google , so this one will get you started .
There are also a ton of them here .
You can also direct download a sample : ogg binaural file ( playable on Chrome browser ) .
Here ’s a site with an embedded player .
They even have a forum for binaural beat enthusiasts here – they have more files for download here .
Note : you HAVE to use headphones for bianural beats to work , preferably good quality headphones .

The names of some of the files are very compelling out there .

Do Binaural Beats Work ?
So , the 10 million dollar question : Does it work ?
Well , I ’ve tried a “ meditation ” preset and a “ coffee break ” preset and I have to say , I was stunned .
It worked surprisingly well for me .
It ’s very interesting because at first you just hear these tones , and after a while ( if you relax ) , they start to disappear and you slip into what I can only describe as a very “ open ” state where you just let the tones sort of take control .
Of course the blogosphere is abuzz with people who think it ’s bunk ( especially because the companies who sell these files make such extravagant claims ) , but I have to say that I ’m convinced – it definitely altered my mood and state , and even lasted for the rest of the day .
Maybe next time I want to take a break , I ’ll slip on my headphones and drop some binaural beats !
The world was stunned this week to learn of a secretive eco-village existing in the heart of modern civilization .
Years ago , a pilot spied the middle - class development in Wales and aerial photographs prove the existence of this village .
The villagers behind “ The Round House ” were drawn into a decade - long battle for the right to live peacefully in their self - sustaining development , where people lived in Hobbit - like huts and grew their own food .
Images courtesy Wales News
Set up in 1993 in the Preseli hills of Wales , the group of eco-minded individuals lived successfully – and sustainably – for five years before civil officials caught on .
Julian and Emma Orbach founded the hidden village , which relied on reused glass , straw bales and mud construction for the huts and solar panels for power .
Their battle for residence was victorious after a drawn - out battle in which officials cited their lack of permits and proper zoning as cause for expulsion .
The 22 people living in 8 grass - covered dwellings were able to persuade an increasingly progressive government that sustainable development should not be obstructed .

But this offbeat eco village is n’t the first in humans ’ attempt to live sustainably despite prevailing urban and suburban development trends .
According to Ecoble , a pseudo - eco utopia ( or perhaps just floating home ) was created by one persistent and enterprising man named Richie Sowa .
A decade ago , Sowa built a two - story exotic “ beach ” home complete with all the amenities atop an “ island ” of over 250,000 plastic bottles .
How ’s that for recycling !
A hurricane destroyed his first floating home , dubbed Spiral Island , but he set to work immediately on another , this one complete with heart - shaped pool and palm trees .
While ingenious and determined individuals have undertaken these off - the - grid eco housing projects , other eco dwellings and developments remain squarely in the category of “ theoretical ” – at least for now .
From urban skyscraper farms to floating cities like the Lilypad project , the future of urban planning is increasingly the stuff of sci - fi imaginings .
From our sister site , WebUrbanist : “ The so - called Lilypad Project is perhaps the most fantastical of these green wonders and certainly the farthest from being built but is too amazing a concept not to mention .
The idea is to create a series of floating self - sufficient ocean - going eco-city islands .
Each one would be able to house 50,000 residents and would support a great deal of biodiversity .
Collecting pools located in their centers would gather and filter water for use on board .
These would be places for adventurers and refugees alike as water levels rise around the world and threaten many , particularly island , habitats . ”

Move over , mad scientists : China - based MAD Architects have conceived of the Superstar , a self - sustaining high - tech mobile star shaped city .
This amazing mobile city will be completely energy independent , fueling itself with its own waste .
It will be able to house 15,000 people and come complete with gyms , digital graveyards , clean lakes , health facilities and more .
A blend of the past and the future , low - tech green and high - tech science , this fantastical city will reportedly make its first stop in Rome .
Ken Lay and Jack Abramoff must be green with envy over the all the mischief that has been accomplished by Jamie Gorelick , with scarcely any demonization in the press .
Imagine playing a central role in the biggest national defense disaster in 50 years .
Imagine playing a central role in one of the biggest economic disasters in your country 's history .
Imagine doing both as an un-elected official .
Imagine getting filthy rich in the process , and even being allowed to sit self - righteously on a commission appointed to get to the bottom of the first disaster , which of course did not get to the bottom of that disaster or anything else for that matter .
Imagine ending , ruining or at least causing signficant quality deterioration in the lives of millions of people , most of whom will never know your name .
Imagine counting your millions of dollars while people who tried to stop you from causing all this mayhem were getting blamed for most of the ills you actually contributed to .
Well , as un-imagineable as this is , there is one American who does n't have to imagine it .
One Jamie Gorelick is this American .
And without pretending that she caused the loss of countless thousands of lives and countless billions of dollars of wealth by herself , she certainly did push some of the early domino 's in catastrophic chain events that are a major factors in life in America today .
This is not a bad millineums 's work , when you think about it .
Gorelick , an appointee of Bill Clinton , is the one who constructed the wall of separation that kept the CIA and the FBI from comparing notes and therefore invading the privacy of nice young men like , say , Muhammed Atta and Zacarius Moussaoui .
While countless problems were uncovered in our intelligence operations in the wake of 9 - 11 , no single factor comes close to in importance to Jamie Gorelick 's wall .
In fact , it was Gorelick 's wall , perhaps more than any other single factor , that induces some people to blame Clinton himself for 9 - 11 since he appointed her and she acted consistent with his philosophy of " crime fighting . "
She put the wall into place as Deputy Attorney General in 1995 .
And for good measure , she was appointed by Tom Daschle to serve on the " non partisan " 9 - 11 Commission .
And we thought the fox in the henhouse was simply a metaphor .
Of course , in a splendid example of " reaching across the aisle , " feckless Republican Slade Gorton of Washington did all he could to exonerate Gorelick in the commission .
Thanks ,
Slade .
God forbid the nation actually knows the truth .
But for Ms. Gorelick , one earth shaking catastrophe is just not enough .
You might think that she caused enough carnage to us infidels on 9 - 11 as to qualify her for the 72 virgins upon her death .
( this would also keep her consistent with several of Clinton 's philosophies ) .
Alas , that 's only part of her resume .
Her fingerprints are all over the Fannie Mae -Freddie Mac mess , which is to say the mess that is central in the entire mortgage - housing crisis .
Without so much as one scintilla of real estate or finance experience , she was appointed as Vice Chairman of Fannie Mae in 1997 and served in that role through 2003 , which is when most of the systemic cancers that came home to roost today happened .
She was instrumental in covering up problems with Fannie Mae while employed there and took multiple millions in bonuses as she helped construct this house of cards .
From Wikipedia :
One example of falsified financial transactions that helped the company meet earnings targets for 1998 , a " manipulation " that triggered multimillion - dollar bonuses for top executives .
On March 25 , 2002 , Business Week Gorelick is quoted as saying , " We believe we are managed safely .
Fannie Mae is among the handful of top- quality institutions . "
One year later , Government Regulators " accused Fannie Mae of improper accounting to the tune of $ 9 billion in unrecorded losses "
As we know , the financial damage done by the housing related problems in this country are still incalculable .
Ms. Gorelick 's evil tab is still growing .
But it does n't stop there .
She managed to be on the wrong side of the Duke LaCrosse case , working for Duke University to protect that school from it 's damaging knee jerk reactions to the spectacularly unbelievable charges filed by a stripper .
( excuse me , exotic dancer ) .
So , even on a smaller scale , she continues to make money while working to ruin the lives of innocent Americans in defense of liberal dogma .
At the Department of Defense , when she served as legal counsel there in 1993 , she drafted the " Do n't ask / do n't tell " policy .
Against Intellectual Monopoly is a relentless , pounding , take no prisoners attack on patent and copyright law .
It joins Lessig ’s Free Culture and Heller ’s The Gridlock Economy as an instant classic and a must - read on these issues .
Many people argue that the patent system has gone wrong in recent years , Boldrin and Levine argue that the patent system was rotten from the start .
James
Watt they say was a " scoundrel " who with his politically - connected partner Matthew Boulton used the patent system to crush their innovative opposition and delay the industrial revolution .
During the period of Watt ’s patents , the United Kingdom added about 750 horsepower of steam engines per year .
In the thirty years following Watt ’s patents , additional horsepower was added at a rate of more than 4,000 per year .
Moreover , the fuel efficiency of steam engines changed little during the period of Watt ’s patent ; however between 1810 and 1835 it is estimated to have increased by a factor of five .
Will books be published without copyright ?
Boldrin and Levine point out that the 9 - 11 Commission Report was profitably published by Norton despite being available free for download .
Not to mention the fact that most of the great works of literature were published without copyright .
Boldrin and Levine are top - notch theorists but AIM is widely accessible and it succeeds best with its many historical discussions and contemporary anecdotes .
AIM does suffer in places from a lack of a lack of nuance and a surprising ability to ignore trade - offs .
Boldrin and Levine argue , for example , that among the reasons we do n’t need patents are a ) because ideas are n’t copied immediately , they take time to diffuse , b ) first movers have significant advantages and c ) trade secrecy is often a more effective " means of appropriating returns " than patents .
Quite right on all three counts but each of these reasons also explains why patents are less costly than one might at first imagine .
After all , what Boldrin and Levine are really saying is that intellectual monopoly would exist even without intellectual property law .
A standard model used to explain why patents might be useful implicitly
assumes that ideas are transmitted instantly at zero cost .
Boldrin
and Levine smash the premise of this argument but the premise is sufficient for the conclusion not
necessary .
Indeed , once you acknowledge that the slow diffusion of ideas helps entrepreneurs to appropriate the returns to their innovations it becomes an open question of how slow is best ?
When is the appropriability of returns strong and when is it weak ?
Does n’t it differ for different goods ?
Should n’t intellectual property law recognize these differences ?
It ’s clear , for example , that ideas are diffusing more quickly than ever before .
On Boldrin and Levine ’s argument , faster diffusion of ideas implies lower appropriability and thus a stronger argument for intellectual property law .
Needless to say Boldrin and Levine are too busy using
a " mallet to smash shiny myths " to make this argument .
( To be fair , they are more nuanced in
the conclusion . ) .
Similarly , Boldrin and Levine argue that the larger the market the less patent protection is needed , hence globalization implies less patent protection .
Again , quite right ( see also my paper , Patent Theory versus Patent Law , on this point ) .
But you wo n’t see Boldrin and Levine drawing the corollary conclusion that more intellectual property rights are optimal the smaller the market , despite the fact that we have a very successful example where increased patent rights for smaller markets generated considerably more innovation , namely the Orphan Drug Act .
For economists , it ’s also surprising how little marginal analysis you find in AIM .
For example , Boldrin and Levine ask , Did Rowling really need a billion dollars to write Harry Potter ?
Surely , a few million would have been enough .
But that ’s like saying that taxing lottery winnings wo n’t reduce the number of buyers because the winner will still get a huge return on her dollar of investment .
The bottom line is that that there is a Laffer curve for innovation – more appropriability increases innovation at first but innovation declines when appropriability extends too far .
I agree with Boldrin and Levine that rent - seeking has put us on the wrong side of the Laffer curve for innovation .
We need to reduce intellectual monopoly with patent reform , less copyright protection , and a greater use of patent substitutes like prizes .
But unfortunately , when it comes to innovation there is no invisible hand theorem which moves us automatically to the top of the curve .
The row over the American photojournalist Zoriah Miller should put the media 's narcissistic warbling about the right to know about Max Mosley 's kinky affair in the shade .
I doubt if it will , however .
Miller , a freelance photographer , was embedded with a US marine unit at Fallujah two years ago .
On July 26 2006 , he was due to go with the marines to a town council meeting at Garma .
He decided instead to accompany a marine troop on a routine patrol .
As they were out on the streets they heard an explosion .
A suicide bomber had struck the council meeting .
Arriving on the scene , Miller was left to photograph the devastation .
More than 20 people had been dismembered by the blast and a number were severely injured .
" As I ran I saw human pieces ... a skullcap with hair , bone shards , " he told a blog news wire in San Francisco .
" Of the marines I jogged in with , someone started to vomit .
Others were standing around , not knowing what to do .
It was completely surreal . "
Some of the bodies he photographed wore the shredded uniforms of the marines .
He edited the pictures back at the camp , checking that none of the other marines objected , and later put them on his own website , including the images of the American corpses .
For this , his embed was terminated .
He was told by letter that he had violated paragraphs 14 ( h ) and 14 ( o ) of his signed agreement with the American authorities .
By these he had agreed , apparently , not to divulge " any tactics , techniques , and procedures witnessed during operations " , and not to provide " information on the effectiveness of enemy techniques " .
The US marine commander in Iraq , Major General John Kelly has insisted that Miller is banned from access to all US military units in Iraq .
The case has brought into sharp focus the whole business of accrediting war correspondents and embedding journalists with operational units .
His transgression – for no one could be daft enough to call this a crime – was that he showed images of dead Americans killed in the service of their country .
Though more than 4,000 American service personnel have been killed in Iraq , there have been surprisingly few photos of the dead , and the flag - draped coffins have often been kept away from the public gaze in hangars on air bases .
Despite the pervasive nature of images of war and the ease with which they can be transmitted , our authorities are squeamish about showing that war kills .
Dead foreigners are one thing , but showing the images of dead British , American or French allied soldiers are off limits on the grounds that they are an unwarranted intrusion on grief for the relatives , dismay the community at home , and encourage the enemy .
The broadcast by Arabic satellite television of pictures of two dead Royal Engineers seized outside Az Zubayr during the initial British incursion in Iraq outraged the British command .
Similarly the display of the bodies of two US Rangers killed in the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu in 1993 caused similar ire among the American command .
The display of the gory images of war is yet another part of war , as all sides recognise .
Like Miller , Stefan Zaklin , formerly of the European Press photo agency , was dis-embedded when he published a photograph of a dead US Army captain lying in a pool of blood in Fallujah in 2004 .
Last year , Lt Gen Ray Odierno , now the senior American commander in Iraq , introduced a new rule which said pictures could only be taken of the wounded with their written consent .
That must be the ultimate Catch - 22 of the world of embed regulations .
Many wounded are incapable of signing anything , or even thinking about it .
British forces increasingly use their own ' combat media teams ' , which provide suitably approved footage and interview material for mainstream media organisations like the BBC , ITN and Sky .
Tactically , for military training and operational purposes , this is understandable .
But the adoption of such material without question raises some interesting questions about sources in modern journalism .
The problem of the graphic portrayal of death in war , and above all war in Iraq , is brilliantly illustrated in the Scottish National Theatre 's Black Watch , just ending its London run .
It shows – in graphic and gory detail – the death of three members of the regiment during the forward deployment to Fallujah two and half years ago in a suicide bombing .
Each of the three is well known by name , and easily identifiable , Generals Kelly and Odierno might care to note .
The show has played to huge acclaim .
Hundreds have been turned away , among them several serving generals .
The soldiers , including those from the regiment itself , love the play because it shows them for real .
Of the numerous memorials commemorating the dead of the first and second world wars , the Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner , sculpted by Charles Sergeant Jagger and unveiled in 1925 , stands out .
( During the war the graphic portrayal of the dead by official artists and writers was discouraged . )
On the plinth of Jagger 's memorial lies the bronze figure of a dead gunner shrouded by his gas cape and helmet .
The bold depiction of a dead Tommy caused outrage even then .
But the meticulous detail of the piece – down to the unravelling puttees , the broken bootlace knotted up – is the masterstroke .
It is a fitting testament to the dead of that war – as Miller 's pictures are of his war in Iraq .

Politicians , in general , are in it for themselves .
These self - proclaimed ' public servants ' want cash , and lots of it , because with cash comes expensive hookers ( even the band at one of the parties for politicians at the Republican Convention has the name ' Hookers and Blow , ' not to mention Mr. Law and Order himself , Eliot Spitzer , who has n't even been charged yet for using an expensive call girl ) , mansions and the satisfaction of every other type of material / carnal desire .
In addition , lots of cash keeps the scam going as it provides a war chest for reelection .
It seems this type of politician makes up the bulk of the politicians infecting the world today .
The other type of politician bringing bloodshed and misery to the world are the true believers .
Currently the most powerful of this class of politician are the neoconservatives .
Schooled in the thinking and teachings of the father of the neocon movement , Leo Strauss , the politicians in the neocon camp want a world based on the teachings of the Hebrew Bible .
Sarah Palin , the Republican candidate for vice president , appears to be in this camp .
Palin belongs to the Pentecostal Assemblies of God .
The Assemblies of God believe in baptism of the Holy Spirit , which enables those baptized , they claim , to speak in tongues and to heal the sick .
Most importantly for the world , they believe in the return of Jesus , which will bring about Armageddon and the end of the world .
Her church is even going to host John Hagee 's ' A Night to Honor Israel ' !
The first of the 16 Fundamental Truths of the Assemblies of God is what should be a problem to Palin and McCain , the belief that the Bible is the Word of God .
They believe ' The Scriptures , both the Old and New Testaments , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct . '
If Palin believes that the Bible is the authoritative rule for her conduct , then she needs to immediately withdraw her acceptance of the Republican vice presidential candidacy .
This must be done because Sarah Palin is a woman , and the Bible is painfully clear that women are second class creatures worth about half as much as men and that ' the head of the woman is the man . '
1 Corinthians 11:7 states that men are ' the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man . '
To make things worse for Palin , her Holy Scriptures , at 1 Timothy 2:11 - 12 , says , ' Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . '
If Sarah Palin becomes Vice President of the United States , she will be second in the chain of command of the US military .
I 'm sure there are many men in the military who would n't want a woman in that position of authority over them .
This violation of Biblical teaching should have been caught by John McCain .
After all , McCain not only believes the Bible to be the Word of God , he believes the US Constitution established the US as a Christian nation .
As a Christian nation , the US needs to follow the laws of Christianity , which are found in the Bible .
And as pointed out above , the Bible teaches that women should be subject to men , not the leaders of men .
Of course , the US was NOT established as a Christian nation .
Neither the Declaration of Independence , nor the US Constitution ever mention Christianity , Jesus , or the Bible .
Also , standing in direct opposition to McCain 's lie is Article 11 of the US Treaty of Tripoli ( pictured above left ) which clearly states ' the government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion . '
The treaty was ratified by the US Senate and signed by President John Adams .
Based on the friendly language of the treaty towards Muslims , I 'm sure McCain and others in the neocon camp would call John Adams an appeaser .
Palin is right at home with McCain 's incorrect belief that the US Constitution established America as a Christian nation .
She even believes that the unnecessary war in Iraq is a ' task from God ' !
This will put her in good stead with the neoconservative war pigs as they continue on with their efforts to start a war with Iran and then with Syria .

MOUNTAIN VIEWS : CORPORATE CROOKS SKATE WHILE WE PAY
By John Hanchette
OLEAN -- Sometimes
I think I 'm dreaming , and keep trying to wake myself up to escape the subtle nightmare of what is happening to this once - beautiful country .
Then my heart falls , because I realize I really am awake , and it 's no dream .
When I tell people this , they look at me like I 'm crazy .
When I tell them I expect eventual blood in the streets if things keep going the way they are , they shrug and mumble some version of " So what , we can't do anything about it . "
I think about that , and realize they are probably right .
That 's part of the nightmare .
The latest destroyer of peaceful sleep arrived last week in the form of an Associated Press story by alert business reporter Jennifer C. Kerr , who got her hands on a study by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) showing that , as of 2005 , fully two - thirds of American corporations -- some 1.2 million companies -- had paid no federal income taxes since 1998 .
Zippo . Nada .
What is up with that ?
The same GAO figures showed a slightly higher percentage of foreign firms doing business in the United States -- more than 38,000 companies -- also avoided corporate taxes over the same period .
With corporate greed multiplying exponentially these days , it is safe to assume those percentages have increased at warp speed over the last three years .
When I read the story , the outrage welled so fast my head almost exploded .
The GAO said these companies had combined sales of about $ 2.5 trillion .
With a T .
If these corporations had been forking over federal income taxes at the same rate you and I have as individual Americans over the past decade , they could have reduced our national debt by more than $ 300 billion .
Who knows ?
We could have invaded several small countries with that .
Further , these were not just penny - ante firms .
The GAO bombshell showed that about a quarter of these companies averaged at least $ 250 million in assets and $ 50 million in annual receipts -- measurements that make them " big " companies in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service , where the GAO dug up the numbers .
No names were made available to the public , of course .
Behavior like this must remain anonymous , lest we all lose faith in the unassailable correctness of our system .
What a festering pile of crap .
The GAO is a separate federal division used by Congress as a research watchdog whenever a rare right - thinking member gets suspicious that things are n't just peachy - keen in America , or going as smoothly as the White House tells us .
In this case , the two right - thinking congressmen were Democrat senators Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Carl Levin of Michigan , both fairly constant critics of the way things are going in this nation .
In the days following the article , I looked in vain for public outrage , or even mild protests from the political sector .
Oh , there was some tsk- tsking from the requesters of the study .
Dorgan called the corporate avoidance of taxes " shameful . "
He and Levin both complained about the arcane maneuver of big multinational firms manipulating " transfer prices " by using subsidiaries to shift income and assets from higher to lower tax jurisdictions .
But a general outcry ?
Not a whimper .
That surprised me .
This is , after all , a presidential election year , with many seats in the House and Senate also open .
I mean , if I were running for national office , or even city council , for that matter , I would seek to impress potential voters with the promise to introduce , as my first act after swearing in , legislation making all corporate tax records -- national , state and local -- matters of public record .
You want to do business here ?
Fine .
Then tell us how you 're conducting that business .
Maybe I 'm not paying close enough attention , but I have n't heard a peep out of Obama or McCain on this subject .
Understandable , I guess , when you do n't want to offend powerful business lobbyists or the bundlers of corporate campaign contributions -- the mother 's milk of modern politics .
Might be a good question for debate moderators , or even your local congressman and aspiring opponents .
Since when did income taxes -- individual or corporate -- become the third rail of American electoral politics ?
Everyone seems afraid to even discuss it .
Oh , Dubya got some praise when his operatives succeeded in getting the capital gains rates reduced to some sane figures -- good news for big players of the stocks and bonds markets , but not on the radar screen of millions of Americans who rely solely on stretching an hourly paycheck .
Back in the Clinton administration , when 85 percent of Social Security benefits questionably got taxed -- a real and unfair hit on the elderly -- it produced much compliant shoulder - shrugging and scant public outcry .
I have noticed massive public ignorance on the subject of income tax , despite its presence in all of our lives .
Most Americans
I 've conversed with seem to think it 's been around since George Washington , that it automatically came with the Constitution .
Not true .
The eminently surviving quote from the American Revolution , you will remember , was " No taxation without representation . "
If George Washington had tried to institute a federal income tax , however meager , there would be three guys on Mount Rushmore .
He got in trouble just trying to enforce a tax on whisky .
The concept is relatively new .
My grandfather did n't have to pay federal income tax until he was 36 years old .
There was a levy during the Civil War to support the Union military costs , but the 16th Amendment was n't ushered in and approved until 1913 .
Ultimately , it gave the federal government dominance over almost every aspect of our lives .
It states :
" Congress shall have the power to lay and collect income taxes from whatever source derived , without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration . "
In the 95 years since , of course , this has spawned -- literally -- a truckload of justifiable and unjustifiable revisions and exemptions and variances and loopholes and givebacks and add-ons and deductions and impossibly confusing algebra and a whole new business sector of specialists and fiscal priests who interpret the omnipresent babble for us .
As if the big business tax avoidance story was not galling enough , another piece around the same time period by Wall Street Journal writers Ellen Schultz and Theo Francis rubbed financial salt in the wound by revealing something we already knew at heart -- that corporate greed , especially for keeping executives happy , knows no bounds .
At a time when companies are freezing worker pensions all over the place , or finagling them into reduced lump - sum payments upon departure , many firms " are quietly converting their pension plans into resources to finance their executives ' retirement benefits and pay . "
It 's confusing , but clever .
The financial wizards at big firms are moving hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of obligations for executive benefits into the rank - and - file pension funds .
This lets the companies take advantage of substantial tax breaks the government intended to encourage pension set - asides for regular workers .
Instead , the money is being diverted to supplemental pension benefits and increased compensation for top executives .
This is intricate money - shuffling , but a simple headline could be :
Good News for CEO , But For Worker : See You Later
The Wall Street Journal says the maneuver , " besides being a dubious use of tax law , risks harming regular workers .
It can drain assets from pension plans and make them more likely to fail .
Now , with the current bear market in stocks weakening many pension plans , this practice could put more in jeopardy . "
If the corporate - worshipping Wall Street Journal is blowing the whistle on CEOs , you know something is up in the field of business ethics .
Federal law seeks to encourage employers to offer generous pensions by giving businesses a tax deduction for cash contributed to plans , and by allowing the money in the plan to grow tax free .
Executives can legally participate in pension plans , but their benefits cannot be " disproportionately " large , nor " discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees . "
The corporate numbers jugglers have found a way to get around that seemingly clear language .
Increases in executive pensions , under tax law , are not supposed to carry any tax advantages for the companies .
Taxes on paying the deferred compensation to executives are normally due when the firms actually pay it , which is usually many years after the obligation is incurred on the company books .
But conniving consultants and hotshot accountants are quietly moving the big money intended for CEOs and their executive toadies into the worker pension plans as , in essence , deferred compensation IOUs -- then taking the deductible immediately as if they had made a real contribution to the rank - and - file pension .
According to Jonathan Tasini on the Huffington Post site , the big computer chip maker Intel boasted a tax savings of $ 65 million the first year it did this .
In other words , Intel avoids having to pay retiring executives out of a cash fund from which such payments are taxable .
The retired big wigs instead get paid out of the regular untaxed " worker " pension fund .
Plain and simple , this is a tax dodge , and a working federal government would prosecute .
Plain and simple , you and I -- as individual taxpayers -- are unwillingly and unwittingly helping finance the egregious corporate executive compensation we 're always bitching about .
The big corporations , the Huffington Post site correctly notes , have finally found a way to fleece both their workers and the taxpayers in one act of tricky bookkeeping .
I keep thinking there must be a tipping point to all this -- at which juncture American society will rebel in some fashion to being treated by both government and business as submissive turkeys dumb enough to stare up at all this financial rain until they drown .
But I 'll be damned if I know where that tipping point is .
Frankly , I thought it would have occurred years ago .

Here ’s the recipe for saving sea turtles from drowning in the longline fishery .
Switch out the classic J hooks for circular hooks .
Add a little training and the tools to release turtles accidentally hooked .
A new report by the World Wildlife Fund and the Inter - American Tropical Tuna Commission ( IATTC ) finds the new hooks dramatically reduce the bycatch of marine turtles without impacting fishing activity .
They analyzed 4 years of data from 8 Eastern Pacific countries : Mexico , Panama , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru .
They found up to 89 % reductions in the marine turtle bycatch per thousand hooks , and that 95 % of all turtles caught in longline fishing were recovered alive .
Circle hooks performed as well as J hooks in the catch rates of tuna , billfishes and sharks fishery .
Okay , well the tuna , billfishes , and sharks fisheries compose a whole other thorny issue .
One as deserving of solutions as the sea turtles .
The big fish of the sea are in superserious trouble and also need a reprieve from the hooks , like , right this second .
. .
But in terms of this sea turtle story .
. .
“ Our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long - line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities , ” explained Martin Hall , Principal Researcher for the IATTC .
So , thumbs up on the turtle hooks .
Thumbs up on helping local communities with food and income issues .
Big thumbs down on continuing to overfish the big fish .

An apparent raid into Pakistani territory by US forces stationed in Afghanistan has prompted angry denunciations from Pakistani officials and renewed questions about the future of the war against the Taliban in the region .
The raid , which took place Wednesday morning in the turbulent Waziristan region , may have killed as many as 20 civilians , according to witnesses and Pakistani officials .
After months in which US military officials have expressed concerns about the Pakistani government ’s willingness to crack down on Taliban militants operating in its tribal areas , news of the raid has caused speculation about whether the US is planning to take on a more aggressive role in targeting militants in Pakistani territory , and worries about what such a step would mean for the volatile US - Pakistan relationship .
According to sources in the Pakistani military and civilian government , the raid began around 3 a.m. Wednesday morning , when three helicopters carrying US and Afghan troops flew into the Waziristan village of Jala Khel .
Some troops then disembarked , witnesses say , and opened fire upon villagers .
The New York Times reported that the soldiers involved were US Special Operations forces operating outside of the normal NATO chain of command .
According to Owais Ahmed Ghani , the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province , over 20 people were killed in the raid .
Ghani condemned the action as a " direct assault on Pakistan ’s sovereignty " and called for retaliation .
Other Pakistani officials were also quick to condemn the raid .
Nadeem Kiani , spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington , told Reuters that the US forces were acting on faulty intelligence that had not been shared with Pakistan , and that those killed were unarmed civilians rather than militants .
US and NATO spokesmen in Afghanistan , as well as a spokesman at US Central Command ( CENTCOM ) in Florida , declined to comment .
But US officials did anonymously confirm that the raid had occurred , with one official telling the New York Times that at least one child had been killed .
The raid came after a long period of friction between US military officials and their Pakistani counterparts , as the US has chafed at Pakistan ’s apparent reluctance to rein in the Taliban .
Since the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 overthrew that country ’s Taliban government , the Taliban , al - Qaeda , and other militants have found sanctuary in Pakistan ’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) bordering Afghanistan , in which the central government exercises little control .
A September 2006 agreement legitimized Taliban power in the Waziristan region of the FATA , and militants have used the region as a staging post for attacks into Afghanistan .
US worries only increased following the resignation in August of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , considered by Washington to be a key ally in the war on terror .
Elections to choose Musharraf ’s successor will be held Sep. 6 , but US officials appear to have considerably less confidence in Asif Ali Zardari of the Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) , who is the heavy favorite in the elections .
Questions also swirl about whether Pakistan ’s incoming civilian government will be able to exert control over the military , which has traditionally been highly autonomous , and the country ’s powerful Inter - Services Intelligence Directorate ( ISI ) .
In a move that appeared designed to win US confidence , the Pakistani military launched an airpower offensive against the Taliban in the Bajaur region of the tribal areas in August .
The campaign has been credited with killing hundreds of Taliban , but has also displaced an estimated 200,000 civilians , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross .
This past week , the government declared that it would halt the campaign during the month of Ramadan .
The Taliban retaliated for the government offensive with an Aug. 21 suicide bombing at an arms factory outside Islamabad that killed over 60 people .
This past summer , US officials have begun to confront Pakistan more openly over the militants issue .
In July , a CIA official traveled to Islamabad with evidence linking the ISI to the Jul. 7 bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul .
In late August , Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , met with Gen. Ashfaq Kayani , chief of staff of the Pakistani Army , aboard an aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean to discuss strategies for reining in militants in the tribal areas .
Several other prominent US and NATO military officials were present at the meeting , including Gen. David Petraeus , currently the top US commander in Iraq and soon to become head of CENTCOM  the military command overseeing Pakistan and Afghanistan .
US officials told the New York Times that potential unilateral US operations within the tribal areas were not discussed at the meeting .
But other officials suggested to the Times that Wednesday ’s raid was not a mistake or aberration , but rather the product of a concerted decision within the US military hierarchy .
" There ’s potential to see more [ such operations ] , " one official told the Times .
On Aug. 23 , the Los Angeles Times reported that top US military officials have been resistant to the idea of direct military operations in Pakistan , preferring to send trainers to work with the Pakistani military .
CIA counterterrorism officials , on the other hand , have been the primary advocates of direct operations .
Wednesday ’s raid , however , may signal that that dynamic has shifted , and that the military brass has been convinced of the necessity of direct military intervention .
If the raid does in fact mark the beginning of a new US policy in the tribal areas , it is expected to considerably complicate US relations with the Pakistani government .
C. Christine Fair , a South Asia specialist at the RAND Corporation , suggested that the raid did mark a policy shift , and cautioned about the potential consequences of the new strategy .
" Without integrating these attacks within a wider Pakistan strategy  which the US government does not have  we risk a serious blowback which could make things worse , not better , " Fair told IPS .
" Ninety percent of our logistics still move through Karachi port , so attacking Pakistani targets when we are still dependent on them makes little sense . "
Bruce Riedel , a former CIA officer now at the Brookings Institution , argued last month that the US should be willing to use force against " very high value targets " in Pakistan , but cautioned against " loose talk about larger military options . "
" The notion of moving NATO forces into the FATA is crazy , " Riedel said at a Brookings panel .
" We will only spread the cancer deeper into Pakistan … Talk about these issues is extraordinarily counterproductive .
It only feeds the paranoia and conspiracy theories of the Pakistani political milieu . "
Germany , under Hitler , defined fascism with its attendant brutality , and brought its ugly face to the world ’s attention .
Like the right wing everywhere , it sought to present a contrived rational for its existence , while trying to hide its crimes against humanity .
When the truth won out , all it had left was the horror , the scorn , the disgust that humanity reserves for the monstrous .
The smoking remnants of a nation lay broken , and its people were hesitantly recognized as human .
Americans should take careful note .
Germany celebrated its heyday over the bones of the dead , and few Germans were aware enough to understand the contradiction of their imagined superiority over the weak , the dispossessed .
They still bear the burden of that pain over 60 years later .
Even the most casual student of history knows that nations bury themselves over the prospect of change .
They realize that Germans saw in Hitler salvation , even though nothing threatened them .
Hitler made Germans feel entitled to whatever it was they could claim as their own , and to hell with anyone who stood in their way .
The U.S , under Bush , would seem to bend to the same , aimless ambitions as Germany at war .
Americans keep confirming the same themes the republicans insist are vital .
Fiscal responsibility !
They rave .
As they run up the national debt to unprecedented heights .
Freedom !
They shout .
As bombs are dropped on foreign lands and innocent people are murdered while the Constitution is diminished , subverted , disrespected , and why ?
Personal responsibility !
They cry .
As U.S. corporations need another taxpayer funded handout to correct their unregulated greed .
Conservatives dread the light of day .
They know that if their true motives are revealed , they ’ll be lucky to get away with their lives .
If they did n’t have an iron grip on media , they ’d be banished , like any monster would , and preferably tarred and feathered on the way out .
The right wing ’s history is in acting as corporate shill .
Corporate has no motive to understand morality so it must have a defense , an explanation for its lack .
It is the right wing ’s job to provide it .
The care that human beings demonstrate for each other is a threat to the corporate bottom line .
Compassion is a concept outside the province and interest of corporate law .
The motives that drive a man or women to challenge the impossible are unwelcome , and even threatening , in a plutocratic , corporate society .
Art is reduced to advertising , for in the corporate world imagination is not welcome .
It does n’t fall within the boundaries of strict definition .
It ’s not something that can be held , weighed , and measured so what possible use could it have to the corporate mentality ?
Art is the medium , the window , through which humanity may catch a fleeting glimpse of itself .
It allows , for an instant , that humanity may take an objective view of where it ’s been and where it ’s going .
It ’s a huge threat to the corporate function .
That ’s why advertisement is the public art .
For advertisement celebrates the material , and art attempts to examine the intangible depths of the human soul .
It asks that humanity look inward to its true nature - to the motives for its existence .
The corporate world ca n’t recognize humanity , nor the moral tenants that guide it .
It ca n’t concern itself with ordinary care outside of profit .
It must restrict itself to its only function - bottom line profit , no matter the expense in human terms .
Art , and the human imagination , threatens its existence .
Millions of Americans are ready and anxious to vote for Bush ll , the senile version .
Why so many voters would do such a thing is entirely outside the province of rational explanation .
Bush , one man , has visited fiscal disaster upon the nation .
He has also presented the U.S. as an imperialist nation , willing to invade sovereign states for corporate opportunity , thinly disguised as freedom .
If one such man may decide the fate of so many , then some assessment of their character , honor , and intelligence , seems vital .
Americans failed to hold Bush to any qualifier , and their reward is richly deserved .
The ones who saw it coming and had to watch it unfold , like an automobile accident in slow motion , will be dragged down right along with the rest of the herd , which , it seems , is poised again to abandon all caution in their support of McCain , a mere codification of the previous eight years .
Even a dumb animal learns that after it ’s been burned a few times it does n’t revisit the source of its injury .
Americans remain largely ignorant of the right wing ’s historical role in concentrating wealth among a comparative few .
The robber barons of the late 19th century , and the grand opulence of the roaring twenties , were republican high points before Americans shook themselves awake and recoiled in horror at conservative excess .
Upton Sinclair’s , The Jungle , helped Americans understand the forces that would undermine democracy .
Certain men , driven by unfettered greed , will casually abandon all consideration of moral allowance in their driven pursuit of more , more , more .
This is a form of mental illness .
Conservatism ’s chief interest is in enriching themselves at other ’s expense .
This does n’t tie to the democratic principle of governance by the majority , where the individual does matter , and the desires and needs of the minority are recognized , and if possible , addressed .
Conservatives , on the other hand , deliberately disqualify minorities as drags on economy , or even insurrectionists , who would bring harm to the nation .
This scare tactic dovetails nicely into the public ’s installed fear of minority groups .
Divide and conquer .
As much as they try to disguise their hatred of anyone unlike themselves , they reveal their ambition to destroy .
If only they would tell the truth , that ignorance is bliss , but only until the bill comes due .
War is their forte ’ , and peace is only a convenient pause while dividing up the loot before their next target is selected , whether it be foreign or domestic .
The world is growing more finite daily , and the corporate struggle is in grabbing as much claim to material as possible .
Those who fight wars do so knowing that sacrifice is their burden , and the resultant world should be a new , and better place .
Those dead soldiers , who stormed the beaches against the stuttering German machine guns , summoned their impossible bravery from the realization that without their charge at certain death the world would be a darker place .
The American soldiers , fighting in Iraq , are given to understand that their war is unending , that it can't be won .
The aftermath of WWlI saw the collective efforts of the victors devoting every resource to bring the humiliated losers , the murderous outlaws of the world ’s community , back into the human fold .
The victors did this in gratitude to their dead , who kept the wolf , the ever creeping , relentless tide of fascism , away from their doors .
Conservatism would protest against helping the vanquished .
Let them eat cake , it would say .
No matter its disguise , conservatism always concerns itself with the condemnation of human spirit .
It insists on mass conformity to realize its ends .
It must punish human transcendence to realize its own , narrow boundaries .
Its material infatuation is unshakeable , and it has no tolerance for any view but its own .
It sees the human struggle in terms of possible advantage for itself .
It ca n’t grasp the salient truth that humanity is its causation , and any diminishment of humanity is its own .
Any disposition of human spirit is an affront to its aim .
It demands of humanity precisely what humanity can’t give - its collective surrender to sameness .
Conservatism asks that equality be universal , without character or form .
Conservatism is a colorless world , without the spontaneity of human inspiration .
It does n’t recognize humanities long history of overcoming impossible odds .
It does n’t welcome humanity with its incredible diversity of thought .
It can only understand its own narrow aim , that like mules , human beings must be presented a carrot on a stick .
Conservatism is constantly threatened by its black and white perception of the world , while humanity is intuitively unwilling to deny its collective dream of individual determination , that is only restricted by imagination .

Medellin's execution was the fifth this year in Texas A Mexican man whose case drew international attention has been executed in Texas for the rape and murder of a 16 - year - old girl in 1993 .
Jose Medellin , 33 , was put to death by lethal injection after the US Supreme Court rejected a last - minute appeal .
The International Court of Justice had urged Texas not to execute Medellin , as he had not been told of his right to consular help when he was arrested .
Texas argued that its courts were not bound by the rulings of the ICJ .
Medellin was pronounced dead at 2157 on Tuesday ( 0257 GMT ) , the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement .
The Mexican government has sent a note of protest to the US state department , expressing " its concern for the precedent that ( the execution ) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country . "
The ICJ had ordered that his case and those of 50 other Mexicans on death row be reviewed because they had not been informed of their right to consular assistance at the time of their arrest - a right under the 1963 Vienna Convention .
The state department said it was powerless to delay the execution , noting that the US Supreme Court had ruled in March that President George W Bush lacked the authority to intervene in the case .
" We have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law , " said state department spokesman Kurtis Cooper .
" The Supreme Court ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules . "
' Forfeited right '
Medellin's case dates back to 1993 when two girls , Jennifer Ertman , 14 , and Elizabeth Pena , 16 , were raped and murdered by six gang members in Houston .
Set up in 1946 , the ICJ is the highest United Nations court Medellin , who was born in Mexico but moved to the US as a child , was convicted of Miss Pena 's murder and did not deny that he killed her .
But at the time of his arrest , police did not tell him that he could request assistance from the Mexican consulate .
In 2003 , Mexico , which does not have the death penalty , filed a lawsuit at the ICJ on behalf of Medellin and 50 other Mexican nationals on death row in the US , saying they had not been informed of their right to consular assistance .
The court ruled in Mexico 's favour , and ordered that their cases be reviewed .
Earlier this year , President Bush directed Texas to comply with the ICJ but the Supreme Court justices decided 6 - 3 that he had overstepped his authority .
Texas acknowledged that Medellin had not been told he could ask for help from Mexican diplomats , but argued that he had forfeited the right because he never raised the issue at trial or sentencing .
State officials also argued that it would not have made any difference to the outcome of the case .
Last month , in response to an urgent request from Mexico , the ICJ ordered the US to " take all measures necessary " to halt Medellin 's execution .
But Texas judicial authorities said in response that the law in Medellin 's case was " clear " .
" Texas is not bound by the World Court but by the US Supreme Court , which reviewed this matter and determined that the convicted murderer 's execution shall proceed , " a statement from the attorney general 's office said .

Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has never been shy about bucking his Republican Party .
And Wednesday he did it again by endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
Riordan said the Illinois senator was by far the best choice for the White House and the only one with the intellect to shepherd the country through troubled economic times .
“ He ’s extremely bright and energetic , and he ’s a guy who gets things done , ” said Riordan , who was a successful venture capitalist before he was elected mayor in 1993 , serving two terms .
Riordan criticized GOP presidential nominee John McCain ’s past support for financial deregulation , saying it helped trigger the mortgage crisis and subsequent economic downturn .
“ There ’s nothing in his background that shows he ’s a person who can understand these complicated economic issues , or shows that he is entrepreneurial enough to bring about change . ”
It ’s not the first time Riordan has backed a Democrat ; he endorsed Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor in 2001 and 2005 .
While he was mayor , Riordan enjoyed a tight political allegiance with President Clinton , though he said he never officially endorsed him .

“ I ’m still a Republican , but I still will always vote for the person who I think will do the best job , ” Riordan said .
Currently a lecturer at UCLA ’s Anderson School of Management , Riordan has never been fully embraced by his party ’s right wing in California .
In his bid for governor in 2002 , he lost the Republican primary to conservative businessman Bill Simon , who failed to unseat Democratic incumbent Gray Davis in the general election .

Under pressure from political parties wanting a diminishing American role , Mr. Maliki began demanding something in the agreement that would make it clear that American troops were on the way out .
Iraq ’s statement on Friday , reflecting those internal sensitivities , referred more specifically than the American version to “ a time frame for the complete transfer of the security responsibilities to the hands of the Iraqi security as preface to decrease the number of the American forces and withdraw them later from Iraq . ”
In Baghdad , a member of Mr. Maliki ’s Dawa Party , Ali al - Adeeb , said the withdrawal of American and other foreign forces was fundamental to an accord .
“ The Iraqi government considers the determination of a specific date for the withdrawal of foreign forces an important issue to deal with , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know what the American side thinks , but we consider it the core of the subject . ”
Mr. Adeeb suggested that a final agreement was not imminent , but White House aides said they were confident one would be reached by the end of the month .
“ We ’re converging on an agreement , ” an administration official said , noting that negotiators continued to hammer out provisions involving security matters .
Those include command of military operations , legal immunities for civilian contractors and the authority to detain prisoners .
On the prospect of dates for American withdrawals , Mr. Johndroe , the White House spokesman , said that the agreement would not prescribe American troop levels over time , but rather reflect a transition to Iraqi command .
“ The agreement will look at goal dates for transition of responsibilities and missions , ” Mr. Johndroe said in an e-mail message .
“ The focus is on the Iraqi assumption of missions , not on what troop levels will be . ”
The agreement that American and Iraqi negotiators are now completing is more modest than the long - term strategic pact that Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki pledged last November to negotiate to replace the United Nations mandate at the end of this year .
The administration dropped a promise in that initial agreement to provide long - term security for Iraq , something that would require a treaty and Congressional approval .
It has also backed off other demands for sweeping powers to continue military operations there indefinitely .
The negotiations have been bogged down by issues involving the laws governing American troops , diplomats and civilian contractors , as well as details like customs duties and drivers ’ licenses for American soldiers .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australia ’s vast coastline is increasingly being battered by destructive “ extreme waves ” driven in part by climate change , scientists said on Wednesday .

Research into wave size changes over the past 45 years showed waves of 3 meters ( 9.8 feet ) in height or more were increasing , hitting Australia ’s southern coasts as severe storms become more frequent and intense , government experts said .
“ Extreme wave conditions are greatest south of the Australian continent , associated with the passage of extra-tropical storms along Australia ’s southern margin , ” they said in a report .
Australia , the world ’s driest inhabited continent , is feeling an accelerated version of global warming , climate scientists say , leading to extreme droughts and sudden severe storms .
The country is vulnerable to shifts in temperature and rainfall because it already has many arid and semi-arid areas , and was recently included by the United Nations in a list of vulnerable climate shift “ hotspots ” .
Average yearly temperatures are projected to increase by as much as 6 degrees Celsius by 2070 .
Most Australians live in large coastal cities and towns in the continent ’s southeast , meaning storm surges and extreme waves will increasingly threaten communities with flooding and severe coastal erosion caused by pounding surf .
Ocean wave measuring buoys off the island state of Tasmania showed “ increased wave heights and anticlockwise rotation of wave direction ” in response to a shifting south of storms due to climate shift , the report said .
Climate Change Minister Penny
Wong said while more active surf could help Australia harness the power of waves to generate electricity and produce less pollution , it also posed risks .
“ Large waves can also be destructive , leading to coastal inundation , erosion and the disturbance of marine habitats , ” Wong said .
The research found strong correlations between wave power and changes in climate drivers such as the length and strength of the northern tropical monsoon season .
Prepared by Australia ’s national science agency , the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization , the report said the country must prepare a network of long - term coastal observation sites to improve large wave understanding .

RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Israel on Tuesday not to undermine peace talks with the Palestinians after a report found it had nearly doubled Jewish settlement construction .
On her seventh visit this year in a long - shot push for a peace deal by January , Rice said the two sides were “ somewhat closer ” in their talks despite deep public skepticism about the chances of ending the six - decade conflict .
Rice offered no further details , but said : “ God willing , and with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties , we have a good chance to succeed . ”
At a joint news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas described the Bush administration as “ determined ” to reach a peace deal this year and said he hoped the next U.S. president would “ continue what we have started ” .
Israel ’s Peace Now group , citing data from the Central Bureau of Statistics , said construction had begun on more than 443 structures in settlements in the occupied West Bank since January compared with 240 starts in the same period in 2007 .
“ The settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations , ” Rice said .
“ Yet negotiations go on . ”
Earlier in Jerusalem , after talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , Rice said in reference to settlements that “ anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided ” .
Abbas described settlements as “ the main obstacle ” in the peace process .
ROAD MAP
Palestinians say settlement building denies them land they want for a contiguous state .
A U.S. - backed peace “ road map ” calls on Israel to halt all settlement activity in the West Bank and for Palestinians to rein in militants .
Israel plans to keep building in settlement blocs that it wants to keep in any future peace deal with the Palestinians .
During her 25 - hour visit , Rice made clear she still aims to reach a peace accord before U.S. President George W. Bush leaves office .
But she played down chances of striking any partial accord in time for the September U.N. General Assembly .
“ If this had been easy , somebody would have solved it a long time ago and it has fallen to us to try again to find a solution to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict , ” Rice said .
Slideshow ( 14 images )
Few analysts believe Rice , who saw Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before meeting Livni , can secure a major breakthrough .
Progress towards a peace deal has been hampered by violence , Israeli settlement expansion and political uncertainty in Israel stemming from a corruption scandal that has forced Olmert to announce plans to step down .
Under a recent Olmert proposal , Israel would withdraw from some 92.7 percent of the occupied West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip , according to Western and Palestinian officials briefed on the negotiations .

Olmert proposed a 5.3 percent land swap , giving the Palestinians a desert territory adjacent to the Gaza Strip in exchange for West Bank land that Israel would keep .
Abbas rejected that because it would not provide for a contiguous Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital , a spokesman said .
At her news conference with Rice , Livni said Israeli settlement activity had been reduced “ in the most dramatic way , ” especially in areas east of the barrier Israel is constructing in the West Bank .

By a vote of 293 - 129 , Democrats in the House today sold out the civil liberties of all Americans when they gave in to the Republicans and the telecom industry , by including blanket immunity for all the telecoms who participated in President Bush ’s illegal warrantless wiretapping program .
Here is the immunity clause , “ No cause of action shall lie in any court against any electronic communication service provider for providing any information , facilities , or assistance in accordance with a directive issued pursuant to paragraph . ”
In layman ’s terms , this means that the people who had their rights violated by Bush ’s secret program have no right to sue the telecoms .
Unless someone inside the administration comes forward with details , we will probably now never know the scope and the depth of the illegal spying .
The telecommunications companies clearly broke the law , but House Democrats were more worried about the November election than protecting our civil liberties .
This is a gigantic win for President Bush and the Republicans , and most importantly , this bill codifies secret spying .
Since the precedent has now been set , there is nothing to stop a future president from expanding executive authority even more than Bush has .

The narrow minded Congress people on the Hill do n’t care that every time a bill such as this one or the Patriot Act is passed , it fundamentally alters the checks and balances in our system .
This is truly a sad day for people of all parties who believe in the protection of civil liberties .
Obama 's camp is content for now to attack McCain for attacking , in an email from spokesman Tommy Vietor .
On a day when major news organizations across the country are taking Senator McCain to task for a steady stream of false , negative attacks , his campaign has launched yet another .
Or , as some might say , ‘ Oops !
He did it again . ’
Our dependence on foreign oil is one of the greatest challenges we face .
In this election the American people have a real choice -- between Obama ’s plan to provide tax rebates to American families while creating a renewable energy economy in America that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil , and Senator McCain ’s plan to continue the same failed energy policies by handing out nearly $ 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies while investing almost nothing in the new energy sources that represent our future .
This is a column condemning cowardice – including my own .
It begins with the story of a novel you cannot read .
The Jewel of Medina was written by a journalist called Sherry Jones .
It recounts the life of Aisha , a girl who was married off at the age of six to a 50 - year - old man called Mohamed ibn Abdallah .
On her wedding day , Aisha was playing on a see - saw outside her home .
Inside , she was being betrothed .
The first she knew of it was when she was banned from playing out in the street with the other children .
When she was nine , she was taken to live with her husband , now 53 .
He had sex with her .
When she was 14 , she was accused of adultery with a man closer to her own age .
Not long after , Mohamed decreed that his wives must cover their faces and bodies , even though no other women in Arabia did .
You cannot read this story today – except in the Koran and the Hadith .
The man Mohamed ibn Abdallah became known to Muslims as " the Prophet Mohamed " , so our ability to explore this story is stunted .
The Jewel of Medina was bought by Random House and primed to be a best - seller – before a University of Texas teacher saw proofs and declared it " a national security issue " .
Random House had visions of a re-run of the Rushdie or the Danish cartoons affairs .
Sherry Jones 's publisher has pulped the book .
It 's gone .
In Europe , we are finally abolishing the lingering blasphemy laws that hinder criticism of Christianity .
But they are being succeeded by a new blasphemy law preventing criticism of Islam – enforced not by the state , but by jihadis .
I seriously considered not writing this column , but the right to criticise religion is as precious – and hard - won – as the right to criticise government .
We have to use it or lose it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some people will instantly ask : why bother criticising religion if it causes so much hassle ?
The answer is : look back at our history .
How did Christianity lose its ability to terrorise people with phantasms of sin and Hell ?
How did it stop spreading shame about natural urges – pre-marital sex , masturbation or homosexuality ?
Because critics pored over the religion 's stories and found gaping holes of logic or morality in them .
They asked questions .
How could an angel inseminate a virgin ?
Why does the Old Testament God command his followers to commit genocide ?
How can a man survive inside a whale ?
Reinterpretation and ridicule crow - barred Christianity open .
Ask enough tough questions and faith is inevitably pushed farther and farther back into the misty realm of metaphor – where it is less likely to inspire people to kill and die for it .
But doubtful Muslims , and the atheists who support them , are being prevented from following this path .
They cannot ask : what does it reveal about Mohamed that he married a young girl , or that he massacred a village of Jews who refused to follow him ?
You do n't have to murder many Theo Van Goghs or pulp many Sherry Joneses to intimidate the rest .
The greatest censorship is internal : it is in all the books that will never be written and all the films that will never be shot , because we are afraid .
We need to acknowledge the double - standard – and that it will cost Muslims in the end .
Insulating a religion from criticism – surrounding it with an electric fence called " respect " – keeps it stunted at its most infantile and fundamentalist stage .
The smart , questioning and instinctively moral Muslims – the majority – learn to be silent , or are shunned ( at best ) .
What would Christianity be like today if George Eliot , Mark Twain and Bertrand Russell had all been pulped ?
Take the most revolting rural Alabama church , and metastasise it .
Since Jones has brought it up , let us look at Mohamed 's marriage to Aisha as a model for how we can conduct this conversation .
It is true those were different times , and it may have been normal for grown men to have sex with prepubescent girls .
The sources are not clear on this point .
But whatever culture you live in , having sex when your body is not physically developed can be an excruciatingly painful experience .
Among Vikings , it was more normal than today to have your arm chopped off , but that did n't mean it was n't agony .
If anything , Jones 's book whitewashes this , suggesting that Mohamed 's " gentleness " meant Aisha enjoyed it .
The story of Aisha also prompts another fundamentalist - busting discussion .
You cannot say that Mohamed 's decision to marry a young girl has to be judged by the standards of his time , and then demand that we follow his moral standards to the letter .
Either we should follow his example literally , or we should critically evaluate it and choose for ourselves .
Discussing this contradiction inevitably injects doubt – the mortal enemy of fanaticism ( on The Independent 's Open House blog later today , I 'll be discussing how Aisha has become the central issue in a debate in Yemen about children and forced marriage ) .
So why do many people who cheer The Life Of Brian and Jerry Springer : The Opera turn into clucking Mary Whitehouses when it comes to Islam ?
If a book about Christ was being dumped because fanatics in Mississippi might object , we would be enraged .
I feel this too .
I am ashamed to say I would be more scathing if I was discussing Christianity .
One reason is fear : the image of Theo Van Gogh lying on a pavement crying " Ca n't we just talk about this ? "
Of course we rationalise it , by asking : does one joke , one column , one novel make much difference ?
No .
But cumulatively ?
Absolutely .
The other reason is more honourable , if flawed .
There is very real and rising prejudice against Muslims across the West .
The BBC recently sent out identically - qualified CVs to hundreds of employers .
Those with Muslim names were 50 per cent less likely to get interviews .
Criticisms of Islamic texts are sometimes used to justify US or Israeli military atrocities .
Some critics of Muslims – Geert Wilders or Martin Amis – moot mass human rights abuses here in Europe .
So some secularists reason : I have plenty of criticisms of Judaism , but I would n't choose to articulate them in Germany in 1933 .
Why try to question Islam now , when Muslims are being attacked by bigots ?
But I live in the Muslim majority East End of London , and this is n't Weimar Germany .
Muslims are secure enough to deal with some tough questions .
It is condescending to treat Muslims like excitable children who cannot cope with the probing , mocking treatment we hand out to Christianity , Judaism and Buddhism .
It is perfectly consistent to protect Muslims from bigotry while challenging the bigotries and absurdities within their holy texts .
There is now a pincer movement trying to silence critical discussion of Islam .
To one side , fanatics threaten to kill you ; to the other , critics call you " Islamophobic " .
But consistent atheism is not racism .
On the contrary : it treats all people as mature adults who can cope with rational questions .
When we pulp books out of fear of fundamentalism , we are decapitating the most precious freedom we have .

Continuing the series of portrayals of technology from the VHS era , here ’s another contribution from Martin Brewer , who brought us the first episode of The Net .
This is another BBC Two show , an episode of Horizon from 1993 on “ The Electronic Frontier . ”
The broad theme of the episode is the information economy , and it ’s a whirlwind tour of influential people and tech in the pre-Web 1990s .
They focus heavily on Microsoft , Apple , and General Magic , with interviews from key players from each .
( Plus , great footage of their headquarters and workspaces . )
There ’s plenty of footage of vintage ’90s tech in here , including giant cell phones , Windows NT 3.1 , the Newton , General Magic ’s Magic Cap , Corbis , Encarta on CD - ROM , interactive TV and software agents .
Some of the highlights , with screenshots , after the video below .
Note : Like all the other materials I post here , this video is completely out - of - print and unavailable commercially , digitized from an old VHS tape .
If it ever comes back into print , or the copyright holders contact me , I ’ll take it down immediately .
“ We ’re the kind of animal that consumes information .
It ’s a language we move through wherever we go , often unconsciously .
Now , information is starting to redefine our world — its geography and its economy .
What would the world look like with information as money ?
And who would be running it ? ”
The 50 - minute documentary is narrated by writer / producer Sheila Hayman and hosted by Robert X. Cringely , credited as a columnist for Infoworld .
Here are all the interviewees and their titles , as listed on the show :
Microsoft – Bill Gates ( Chairman / Chief Executive ) , Mike Murray ( Vice President , Human Resources ) , Nathan Myhrvold ( Advanced Technology ) , Stephen D. Arnold ( President / CEO , Continuum Productions / Corbis ) , Therese Stowell ( Software Goddess ) , Mark McPhee ( Graphics ) Apple – Don Norman ( Fellow ) , Joy Mountford ( Human Interface Group ) , Michael Tchao ( Manager , Newton ) , Neil Selvin ( Director of Marketing , Portable Computing ) General Magic – Marc Porat ( President / CEO ) , Andy Hertzfeld ( Software Wizard ) , James E.

Greenberg ( President , R. Greenberg Associates ) .
Highlights
The show starts at Comdex 1993 , with a bizarre presentation by a Borg - like spokesperson for Microsoft .
With that apron , Bill Gates looks like he was cooking barbeque .
( 1:20 )
Apple press demo for a telephony application from Applied Engineering which “ integrates data and fax and voice into a single communications structure in the Powerbook . ”
Love the shot of the “ small , lightweight cellular phone . ”
I think he was being sarcastic . ( 3:10 )
Off to the Microsoft campus , with some great shots of the offices and workspaces from that time .
Several huge CRTs on every desk .
Interview with Bill Gates , talking about email .
( 5:20 )
Don Norman explains the design of everyday things at Apple headquarters , with the now - familiar discussion of door handles , elevator buttons , and light switches .
Joy Mountford takes over to talk about designing for humans , instead of computers .
( 8:15 )
Michael Tchao , a Newton manager at Apple , shows off the device , the handwriting recognition , and sending a note and sketch by fax .
( 12:20 )
General Magic ’s Marc Porat and Andy Hertzfeld give an in - depth demo of Magic Cap .
For some reason , they interview James White about Telescript in the front seat of his car .
( 15:00 )
John Evans from News Electronic Data , a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. , shows off an early ’90s agent called Oliver for the Mac , a golden retriever designed to retrieve personalized news and travel information .
I especially liked the “ virtual reality ” preview of driving your route on the map , which reminds me of Desert Bus . ( 23:45 )
Andy Hertzfeld shows off Magic Cap ’s virtual pets and talks about object - oriented programming .
I love the footage of the General Magic offices and their individual desks .
That , along with Hertzfeld ’s Cosby Show sweater , nicely capture the era . ( 27:00 )
Howard Rheingold talks about technology as a communications tool , in the context of the WELL and Usenet .
Great shots of dialing into the WELL at 2400 baud , and a WELL office party from March 1993 . ( 29:55 )
“ Yuppie hobo ” Steve Roberts shows off BEHEMOTH , the networked recumbent bicycle complete with “ brain interface unit with a heads - up display which is a 720×280 computer screen called a Private Eye connected to a DOS system , ” cellular modem , and a chordal keyboard for typing emails while he rides .
This makes texting - while - driving look pretty safe .
( 31:30 )
Bill Gates demos the CD - ROM version of Encarta in what looks like his own office .
This leads to a nice segue into Corbis , then called Continuum . ( 36:40 )
Nathan Myhrvold demonstrates Microsoft ’s interactive television prototypes , viewing the lyrics from an En Vogue video and buying concert tickets from his TV .
While some of the features he talks about were tackled by DVRs , most of the promise of interactive TV was instead fulfilled by the PC and high - bandwidth Internet connections .
( 41:45 )
The final scene discusses digital manipulation of video imagery .
They start with the classic Diet Coke ad pairing Paula Abdul with vintage film of Gene Kelly , Cary Grant , and Groucho Marx , then launch into a discussion of the potential misuse of the technology for nefarious purposes .
Where are they now ?
Here ’s where everybody is 15 years later , in order of appearance .
I could n’t find any information about General Magic ’s James E. White or Microsoft ’s Mark McPhee .
Drop a line if you know what they ’re up to .
The War on Drugs vs. The War on Terror :
Josh Strawn has an interesting post on how the War on Drugs is undermining the War on Terror , citing data showing that the misguided US poppy eradication campaign in Afghanistan has enabled the Taliban to earn enormous profits from the illegal drug trade .
Most of these profits are only possible because the US and its allies have prevented competition from legal suppliers by targeting their poppy fields .
I have often blogged on the same subject myself see e.g. here and here .
As I explained in earlier posts , the poppy eradication campaign not only increases the Taliban 's profits from the drug trade , but also antagonizes the numerous Afghan peasants who depend on poppy cultivation for their livelihood .
As a result , some of these people have been driven into the arms of the Taliban , and others are at least unwilling to provide information and other aid to the US and the Afghan government .
It is long past time that we prioritized the war against the enemies who want to kill us over the war against those who merely want to us sell us opium .
UPDATE : It 's worth nothing that Christopher Hitchens made a similar argument back in 2004 - at a time when the negative consequences of the drug war in Afghanistan were not as clear as they are now .
His warning was certainly prescient ( HT : VC reader Joe Bingham ) .
It is important that the government bail out Fannie and Freddie .
The free enterprise system , with its private property rights , profit and loss system of incentives , and market prices that allow individuals to rationally plan , works just fine for all other goods and services : food , clothing , health care , etc .
The one exception is housing .
Here , greed and rampant capitalism reign supreme , causing vast harm to the populace .
The only hope for the average person is government .
They are there to help us .
No , wait , that ’s all wrong .
That is nonsense on stilts .
Yet , this sort of mischievous thinking is argued on behalf of government involvement in the housing market .
But , there is no difference between housing and any other good or service .
The free enterprise system is the last best hope that society has for keeping the wolf from the door .
ALL government interference with the housing market has been an utter and total disaster .
And this includes , in addition to Fannie and Freddie , rent control , housing subsidies , zoning legislation , urban renewal , housing codes .
Have we learned nothing from the fall of the USSR ?
Socialism does n’t work .
It does n’t work in ANY country , and it does n’t work in ANY sector of any nation ’s economy .
Housing is no exception .
( CNN ) --
Few people read labels as closely as Sara Bongiorni .
For a year , Bongiorni and her young family tried to go without buying anything produced in China .
No shoes , no toys , not even mousetraps .
Sara Bongiorni says finding food products that do n't contain an ingredient from China is nearly impossible .
The Baton Rouge , Louisiana , mother of three was n't trying to make a political statement .
She just wanted to see if it was possible to remove " Made in China " products from her home .
" It was a way to try to understand in a very real and personal way my own family 's connections to this big fuzzy concept of the global economy , and specifically to China , " she told CNN .
The experiment started soon after Christmas 2004 as she sorted through gifts and wrapping paper .
Looking around the heap of goods , she realized almost all of it came from China .
" I thought , you know , it would be fun just to see if we could go a whole year ... without China , " she said .
" It certainly took over our whole life .
It became an all - consuming project . "
It was tough at times .
Like when 10 months into the project , she caved into her 4 - year - old son who " fell head over heels in love with a Chinese - made electric pumpkin . "
But the one area that posed an unexpected challenge was grocery shopping .
She says it 's almost impossible to tell which foods have ingredients from China .
Watch grocery shopping with Bongiorni »
" As much label reading as I did , there 's no way I could know whether or not I was buying something with ingredients from China , " says Bongiorni , who documented her experience in a book , " A Year Without ' Made in China . ' "
Across the nation , Americans have begun taking a more critical look at where their food comes from , especially food from China .
A recent USA Today / Gallup poll found 46 percent of those polled are " very concerned " about the safety of food imported from China ; another 28 percent said they were " somewhat concerned " about Chinese food products .
The amount of food imported from China has grown dramatically in the past decade .
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the United States imported $ 4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006 .
In 1995 , it was $ 800 million .
In June , the United States banned five types of fish and shrimp from China because inspectors found traces of cancer - causing chemicals and antibiotics in the products .
See products that have been affected »
' Made in China ' products
The following are among the top food products from China brought into the United States :
 Apple juice
 Mandarin oranges
 Confections / candy
 Dried garlic
 Cocoa butter
 Hog guts , bladders , stomachs for sausage casings
 Dry berries
Source : USDA
The United States requires labels on seafood to mark where it came from .
However , that 's the exception .
With most foods , companies are not required to label where ingredients come from , only where the food was packaged or processed .
That means it is possible a frozen dinner , for example , could have 20 different ingredients from 20 different countries , food analysts say .
Michael Doyle , the director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia , says the pet food recall earlier this year from a tainted Chinese ingredient , followed by the seafood ban , has brought renewed attention to " our potential issues with our food safety regarding Chinese imported foods . "
Watch strapped FDA only inspects 1 percent of incoming goods
" The Chinese have a long way to go to bring their standards up to ours , " he says .
Doyle says it 's incumbent upon food companies in the United States that bring food from China to be more vigilant about inspecting the products they bring in to " ensure that their foods are safe . "
Some of the food products that come from China may surprise you .
Take an American staple like apple juice .
The USDA says 50 percent of the apple juice imported in the United States today comes from China .
That 's an estimated 161,000 tons of apple juice compared to the 110,000 tons produced in the United States , according to the USDA .
Garlic and pine nuts are also big exports .
So are instant coffee and dried berries like the ones found in breakfast cereal .
Test your knowledge on Chinese goods in the U.S. »
So , can you avoid eating foods with products from China ?
Experts say that is pretty much impossible .
You can lower your chances of eating foods with Chinese products by staying away from all processed foods and eating fresh " whole foods , " such as fruits and vegetables .
Many grocery stores are beginning to label where their fruits and vegetables are grown .
Eden Foods , a provider of organic food in the United States , says the number of calls from customers asking for country of origin information has doubled in the past few months .
Tonya Martin , a spokeswoman for Eden Foods , says the company foresees a day when it will change labels to indicate where each ingredient in a product comes from .
As for the Bongiorni household , there no longer is apple juice in the refrigerator , but she does buy cereal with freeze - dried strawberries -- potentially from China -- for her children .
" It 's interesting , " she says , " you know the source of your tennis shoes , but you do n't know the source of your processed foods . "
She adds , " You are really at a loss to make an informed decision . "

In America and England , citizens are being urged to report people taking pictures as potential terrorists .
Do you assume that that is an innocent attempt to stop would - be terrorists from casing out high - value targets , and for planning terror attacks ?
Sorry , but the arrest of well - known journalists outside the Republican convention destroys that belief .
The only thing the journalists was doing were filming peaceful protesters and their brutal treatment by the police .
See this and this .
In Iraq , journalists are targeted and killed when they show what the military does n't want shown .
America and England are themselves now being treated like war zones .
Anyone with a camera is being treated like a " foreign enemy combatant " and a terrorist .
Is n't that the core characteristic of a fascist police state . . . war zone rules being used inside the home country against its citizens ?
Moreover , the protesters who were targeted in Minnesota were mainly those who were peacefully filming the protests .
Indeed , a 2003 FBI memo describes protesters ' use of videotaping as an " intimidation " technique , even though - as the ACLU points out - " Most mainstream demonstrators often use videotape during protests to document law enforcement activity and , more importantly , deter police from acting outside the law . "
Clearly , what the FBI is objecting to is the use of cameras to document unlawful behavior by law enforcement .
So what should we do : leave our cameras at home ?
No .
If we all bring our videocameras , cellphone cameras , and other photographic equipment with us wherever we go , we 'll be able to document tyrannical behavior , and the police wo n't have the manpower to hassle all of us .
Erlang String Issue 9 September 2008
Posted by Oliver Mason in erlang
I could never really understand people complaining about Erlang ’s lack of a string data structure ; having them represented as lists seemed fine , especially as there is no problem with representing unicode characters that go beyond 255 .
The increased size did n’t bother me : people worried about that when unicode first arrived and it did n’t really turn out as a big issue .
And I do a lot of processing of large texts .
However , working on a basic YAML library for Erlang ( see code repository ) I ran into a problem where I least exected to be one : generating a YAML representation of a data structure .
Parsing basic YAML ( just lists and mappings ) was a piece of cake in the end ( ignoring the more , erm , arcane bits of the YAML spec ) , and writing it seemed to be trivial .
However , when it comes to writing out a list the problems start .
I cannot differenciate between a list of numbers and a string .
Hence , I cannot decide which way to represent it in YAML , as a string or a list of numbers .
This is only a human - factor issue : writing it as a list of numbers and then reading it in again obviously gives identical results , so for serialisation purposes it ’s fine .
But when editing the file I do n’t really fancy looking up the ASCII codes for all the letters I want to change .
A purely ‘ presentational ’ issue , but a tricky one .
Solutions ?
I could check any list if all the elements are in the range of readable characters , which I assume is what the Erlang VM does when printing something .
But that ’s a hack , really .
Another solution is to go the whole hog and introduce a string type , presumably something like ‘ {string , [ 45,64 , …]} ’.
Then I can easily make the decision how to write it out .
And parsing would be easy as well .
Now , that looks like a good idea , but it would interfere with the way most other programs use strings .
And the string library would n’t work .
So I guess I have to write my own .
My current plan is to allow various representations of strings , so that the data structure will actually be ‘ {string , TYPE , DATA} ’ , where TYPE could be ‘ list ’ ( the current way ) , ‘ binary ’ ( a binary in UTF - 8 format ) , ‘ rope ’ ( a different approach to strings , see description with Java code ) .
Other representations could be added at a later stage .
There would be a function estring : to_list ( string ) , which would convert the string into a list for use with the string library , and estring : to_string ( list ) would create a string from the given list .
The default representation would probably be a binary , as that can in turn be used as a component of a rope easily once something gets added to it .
Another alternative would be to use Starling , but I ’m not too keen on it as it ’s not pure Erlang , using a C / C++ library under the hood .
How do you deal with strings ?
UPDATE : Here ’s a discussion about the same problem in the context of JSON : http://www.lshift.net/blog/2007/09/13/how-should-json-strings-be-represented-in-erlang

Summary
INDOCHINA IN U.S. WARTIME POLICY , 1941 -1945
Significant misunderstanding has developed concerning U.S. policy towards Indochina in the decade of World War II and its aftermath .
A number of historians have held that anti-colonialism governed U.S. policy and actions up until 1950 , when containment of communism supervened .
For example , Bernard Fall ( e.g. in his 1967 postmortem book , Last Reflections on a War ) categorized American policy toward Indochina in six periods : " (1 ) Anti-Vichy , 1940 - 1945 ; ( 2 ) Pro-Viet Minh , 1945 - 1946 ; ( 3 ) Non-involvement , 1946 - June 1950 ; ( 4 ) Pro-French , 1950 - July 1954 ; ( 5 ) Non-military involvement , 1954 - November 1961 ; ( 6 ) Direct and full involvement , 1961 - . "
Commenting that the first four periods are those " least known even to the specialist , " Fall developed the thesis that President Roosevelt was determined " to eliminate the French from Indochina at all costs , " and had pressured the Allies to establish an international trusteeship to administer Indochina until the nations there were ready to assume full independence .
This obdurate anti-colonialism , in Fall 's view , led to cold refusal of American aid for French resistance fighters , and to a policy of promoting Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh as the alternative to restoring the French bonds .
But , the argument goes , Roosevelt died , and principle faded ; by late 1946 , anti-colonialism mutated into neutrality .
According to Fall : " Whether this was due to a deliberate policy in Washington or , conversely , to an absence of policy , is not quite clear .
. . .
The United States , preoccupied in Europe , ceased to be a diplomatic factor in Indochina until the outbreak of the Korean War . "
In 1950 , anti-communism asserted itself , and in a remarkable volte - face , the United States threw its economic and military resources behind France in its war against the Viet Minh .
Other commentators , conversely - prominent among them , the historians of the Viet Minh - have described U.S. policy as consistently condoning and assisting the reimposition of French colonial power in Indochina , with a concomitant disregard for the nationalist aspirations of the Vietnamese .
Neither interpretation squares with the record ; the United States was less concerned over Indochina , and less purposeful than either assumes .
Ambivalence characterized U.S. policy during World War 11 , and was the root of much subsequent misunderstanding .
On the one hand , the U.S. repeatedly reassured the French that its colonial possessions would be returned to it after the war .
On the other band , the U.S. broadly committed itself in the Atlantic Charter to support national self - determination , and President Roosevelt personally and vehemently advocated independence for Indochina .
F.D.R. regarded Indochina as a flagrant example of onerous colonialism which should be turned over to a trusteeship rather than returned to France .
The President discussed this proposal with the Allies at the Cairo , Teheran , and Yalta Conferences and received the endorsement of Chiang Kai-shek and Stalin ; Prime Minister Churchill demurred .
At one point , Fall reports , the President offered General de Gaulle Filipino advisers to help France establish a " more progressive policy in Indochina " -- which offer the General received in " Pensive Silence . "
Ultimately , U.S. Policy was governed neither by the principle s of the Atlantic Charter , nor by the President 's anti-colonialism but by the dictates of military strategy and by British intransigence on the colonial issue .
The United States , concentrating its forces against Japan , accepted British military primacy in Southeast Asia , and divided Indochina at 16th parallel between the British and the Chinese for the purposes of occupation . .
U.S. commanders serving with the British and Chinese , while instructed to avoid ostensible alignment with the French , were permitted to conduct operations in Indochina which did not detract from the campaign against Japan .
Consistent with F.D.R.'s guidance , U.S. did provide modest aid to French - - and Viet Minh - - resistance forces in Vietnam after March , 1945 , but refused to provide shipping to move Free French troops there .
Pressed by both the British and the French for clarification U.S. intentions regarding the political status of Indochina , F.D.R- maintained that " it is a matter for postwar . "
The President 's trusteeship concept foundered as early as March 1943 , when the U.S. discovered that the British , concerned over possible prejudice to Commonwealth policy , proved to be unwilling to join in any declaration on trusteeships , and indeed any statement endorsing national independence which went beyond the Atlantic Charter 's vague " respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live . "
So sensitive were the British on this point that the Dumbarton Oaks Conference of 1944 , at which the blueprint for the postwar international system was negotiated , skirted the colonial issue , and avoided trusteeships altogether .
At each key decisional point at which the President could have influenced the course of events toward trusteeship -- in relations with the U.K. , in casting the United Nations Charter , in instructions to allied commanders -- he declined to do so ; hence , despite his lip service to trusteeship and anti-colonialism , F.D.R. in fact assigned to Indochina a status correlative to Burma , Malaya , Singapore and Indonesia : free territory to be reconquered and returned to its former owners .
Non-intervention by the U.S. on behalf of the Vietnamese was tantamount to acceptance of the French return .
On April 3 , 1945 , with President Roosevelt 's approval , Secretary of State Stettinius issued a statement that , as a result of the Yalta talks , the U.S. would look to trusteeship as a postwar arrangement only for " territories taken from the enemy , " and for " territories as might voluntarily be placed under trusteeship . "
By context , and by the Secretary of State 's subsequent interpretation , Indochina fell into the latter category .
Trusteeship status for Indochina became , then , a matter for French determination .
Shortly following President Truman 's entry into office , the U.S. assured France that it had never questioned , " even by implication , French sovereignty over Indo - China . "
The U.S. policy was to press France for progressive measures in Indochina , but to expect France to decide when its peoples would be ready for independence ; " such decisions would preclude the establishment of a trusteeship in Indochina except with the consent of the French Government . "
These guidelines , established by June , 1945 - - before the end of the war remained fundamental to U.S. policy .
With British cooperation , French military forces were reestablished in South Vietnam in September , 1945 .
The U.S. expressed dismay at the outbreak of guerrilla warfare which followed , and pointed out that while it had no intention of opposing the reestablishment of French control , " it is not the policy of this government to assist the French to reestablish their control over Indochina by force , and the willingness of the U.S. to see French control reestablished assumes that [ the ]
French claim to have the support of the population in Indochina is borne out by future events . "
Through the fall and winter of 1945 - 1946 , the U.S. received a series of requests from Ho Chi Minh for intervention in Vietnam ; these were , on the record , unanswered .
However , the U.S. steadfastly refused to assist the French military effort , e.g. , forbidding American flag vessels to carry troops or war materiel to Vietnam .
On March 6 , 1946 , the French and Ho signed an Accord in which Ho acceded to French reentry into North Vietnam in return for recognition of the DRV as a " Free State , " part of the French Union .
As of April 1946 , allied occupation of Indochina was officially terminated , and the U.S. acknowledged to France that all of Indochina had reverted to French control .
Thereafter , the problems of U.S. policy toward Vietnam were dealt with in the context of the U.S. relationship with France .
U.S. NEUTRALITY IN THE FRANCO -VIET MINH WAR , 1946 -1949
In late 1946 , the Franco - Viet Minh War began in earnest .
A chart ( pp. 37 ff ) summarizes the principal events in the relations between France and Vietnam , 1946 - 1949 , describing the milestones along the route by which France , on the one hand , failed to reach any lasting accommodation with Ho Chi Minh , and , on the other hand , erected the " Bao Dai solution " in its stead .
The U.S. during these years continued to regard the conflict as fundamentally a matter for French resolution .
The U.S. in its representations to France deplored the prospect of protracted war , and urged meaningful concessions to Vietnamese nationalism .
However , the U.S. , deterred by the history of Ho 's communist affiliation , always stopped short of endorsing Ho Chi Minh or the Viet Minh .
Accordingly , U.S. policy gravitated with that of France toward the Bao Dai solution .
At no point was the U.S. prepared to adopt an openly interventionist course .
To have done so would have clashed with the expressed British view that Indochina was an exclusively French concern , and played into the hands of France 's extremist political parties of both the Right and the Left .
The U.S. was particularly apprehensive lest by intervening it strengthen the political position of French Communists .
Beginning in 1946 and 1947 , France and Britain were moving toward an anti-Soviet alliance in Europe and the U.S. was reluctant to press a potentially divisive policy .
The U.S. [ words illegible ]
Vietnamese nationalism relatively insignificant compared with European economic recovery and collective security from communist domination .
It is not as though the U.S. was not prepared to act in circumstances such as these .
For example , in the 1945 - 1946 dispute over Dutch possessions in Indonesia , the U.S. actively intervened against its Dutch ally .
In this case , however , the intervention was in concert with the U.K. ( which steadfastly refused similar action in Indochina ) and against the Netherlands , a much less significant ally in Europe than France .
In wider company and at projected lower cost , the U.S. could and did show a determination to act against colonialism .
The resultant U.S. policy has most often been termed " neutrality . "
It was , however , also consistent with the policy of deferring to French volition announced by President Roosevelt 's Secretary of State on 3 April 1945 .
It was a policy characterized by the same indecision that had marked U.S. wartime policy .
Moreover , at the time , Indochina appeared to many to be one region in the troubled postwar world in which the U.S. might enjoy the luxury of abstention .
In February , 1947 , early in the war , the U.S. Ambassador in Paris was instructed to reassure Premier Ramadier of the " very friendliest feelings " of the U.S. toward France and its interest in supporting France in recovering its economic , political and military strength :
In spite any misunderstanding which might have arisen in minds French in regard to our position concerning Indochina they must appreciate that we have fully recognized France 's sovereign position in that area and we do not wish to have it appear that we are in any way endeavoring undermine that position , and French should know it is our desire to be helpful and we stand ready assist any appropriate way we can to find solution for Indochinese problem .
At same time we can not shut our eyes to fact that there are two sides this problem and that our reports indicate both a lack French understanding of other side ( more in Saigon than in Paris ) and continued existence dangerously Outmoded colonial outlook and methods in area .
Furthermore , there is no escape from fact that trend of times is to effect that colonial empires in XIX Century sense are rapidly becoming thing of past .
Action Brit in India and Burma and Dutch in Indonesia are outstanding examples this trend , and French themselves took cognizance of it both in new Constitution and in their agreements with Vietnam .
On other hand we do not lose sight fact that Ho Chi Minh has direct Communist connections and it should be obvious that we are not interested in seeing colonial empire administrations supplanted by philosophy and political organizations emanating from and controlled by Kremlin .
. . .
Frankly we have no solution of problem to suggest .
It is basically matter for two parties to work out themselves and from your reports and those from Indochina we are led to feel that both parties have endeavored to keep door open to some sort of settlement .
We appreciate fact that Vietnam started present fighting in Indochina on December 19 and that this action has made it more difficult for French to adopt a position of generosity and conciliation .
Nevertheless we hope that French will find it possible to be more than generous in trying to find a solution .
The U.S. anxiously followed the vacillations of France 's policy toward Bao Dai , exhorting the French to translate the successive " agreements " they contracted with him into an effective nationalist alternative to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh .
Increasingly , the U.S. sensed that French unwillingness to concede political power to Vietnamese heightened the possibility of the Franco - Viet Minh conflict being transformed into a struggle with Soviet imperialism .
U.S. diplomats were instructed to " apply such persuasion and / or pressure as is best calculated [ to ] produce desired result [ of France 's ] unequivocally and promptly approving the principle of Viet independence . "
France was notified that the U.S. was willing to extend financial aid to a Vietnamese government not a French puppet , " but could not give consideration of altering its present policy in this regard unless real progress [ is ] made in reaching non-Communist solution in Indochina based on cooperation of true nationalists of that country . "
As of 1948 , however , the U.S. remained uncertain that Ho and the Viet Minh were in league with the Kremlin .
A State Department appraisal of Ho Chi Minh in July 1948 , indicated that :
1. Depts info indicates that Ho Chi Minh is Communist .
His long and well - known record in Comintern during twenties and thirties , continuous support by French Communist newspaper Humanite since 1945 , praise given him by Radio Moscow ( which for past six months has been devoting increasing attention to Indochina ) and fact he has been called " leading communist " by recent Russian publications as well as Daily Worker makes any other conclusion appear to be wishful thinking .
2 . Dept has no evidence of direct link between Ho and Moscow but assumes it exists , nor is it able evaluate amount pressure or guidance Moscow exerting .
We have impression Ho must be given or is retaining large degree latitude .
Dept considers that USSR accomplishing its immediate aims in Indochina by ( a ) pinning down large numbers of French troops , ( b ) causing steady drain upon French economy thereby tending retard recovery and dissipate ECA assistance to France , and ( c ) denying to world generally surpluses which Indochina normally has available thus perpetuating conditions of disorder and shortages which favorable to growth cornmunism .
Furthermore ,
Ho seems quite capable of retaining and even strengthening his grip on Indochina with no outside assistance other than continuing procession of French puppet govts .
In the fall of 1948 , the Office of Intelligence Research in the Department of State conducted a survey of communist influence in Southeast Asia .
Evidence of Kremlin - directed conspiracy was found in virtually all countries except Vietnam :
Since December 19 , 1946 , there have been continuous conflicts between French forces and the nationalist government of Vietnam .
This government is a coalition in which avowed communists hold influential positions .
Although the French admit the influence of this government , they have consistently refused to deal with its leader , Ho Chi Minh , on the grounds that he is a communist .
To date the Vietnam press and radio have not adopted an anti-American position .
It is rather the French colonial press that has been strongly anti-American and has freely accused the U.S. of imperialism in Indochina to the point of approximating the official Moscow position .
Although the Vietnam radio has been closely watched for a new position toward the U.S. , no change has appeared so far .
Nor does there seem to have been any split within the coalition government of Vietnam .
. . . Evaluation .
If there is a Moscow directed conspiracy in Southeast Asia , Indochina is an anomaly so far .
Possible explanations are :
1 . No rigid directives have been issued by Moscow 2 .
The Vietnam government considers that it has no rightist elements that must be purged .
3 . The Vietnam Communists are not subservient to the foreign policies pursued by Moscow .
4 . A special dispensation for the Vietnam government has been arranged in Moscow .
Of these possibilities , the first and fourth seem most likely .
ORIGINS OF U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM
The collapse of the Chinese Nationalist government in 1949 sharpened American apprehensions over communist expansion in the Far East , and hastened U.S. measures to counter the threat posed by Mao's China .
The U.S. sought to create and employ policy instruments similar to those it was bringing into play against the Soviets in Europe : collective security organizations , economic aid , and military assistance .
For example , Congress , in the opening paragraphs of the law it passed in 1949 to establish the first comprehensive military assistance program , expressed itself " as favoring the creation by the free countries and the free peoples of the Far East of a joint organization , consistent with the Charter of the United Nations , to establish a program of self - help and mutual cooperation designed to develop their economic and social well - being , to safeguard basic rights and liberties , and to protect their security and independence .. "
But , the negotiating of such an organization among the disparate powers and political entities of the Far East was inherently more complex a matter than the North Atlantic Treaty nations had successfully faced .
The U.S. decided that the impetus for collective security in Asia should come from the Asians , but by late 1949 , it also recognized that action was necessary in Indochina .
Thus , in the closing months of 1949 , the course of U.S. policy was set to block further communist expansion in Asia : by collective security if the Asians were forthcoming ; by collaboration with major European allies and commonwealth nations , if possible ; but bilaterally if necessary .
On that policy course lay the Korean War of 1950 - 1953 , the forming of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization of 1954 , and the progressively deepening U.S. involvement in Vietnam .
January and February , 1950 , were pivotal months .
The French took the first concrete steps toward transferring public administration to Bao Dai's State of Vietnam .
Ho Chi Minh denied the legitimacy of the latter , proclaiming the DRV as the " only legal government of the Vietnam people , " and was formally recognized by Peking and Moscow .
On 29 January 1950 , the French Nation , Assembly approved legislation granting autonomy to the State of Vietnam .
0n February 1 , 1950 , Secretary of State Acheson made the following public statement :
The recognition by the Kremlin of Ho Chi Minh 's communist movement in Indochina comes as a surprise .
The Soviet acknowledgment of this movement should remove any illusions as to the " nationalist " nature of Ho Chi Minh 's aims and reveals
Ho in his true colors as the mortal enemy of native independence in Indochina .
Although timed in an effort to cloud the transfer of sovereignty France to the legal Governments of Laos , Cambodia and Vietnam , we have every reason to believe that those legal governments will proceed in their development toward stable governments representing the true nationalist sentiments of more than 20 million peoples of Indochina .
French action in transferring sovereignty to Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia has been in process for some time .
Following French ratification , which is expected within a few days , the way will be open for recognition of these local governments by the countries of the world whose policies support the development of genuine national independence in former colonial areas .
. . .
Formal French ratification of Vietnamese independence was announced 4 February 1950 ; on the same date , President Truman approved U.S. recognition for Bao Dai .
French requests for aid in Indochina followed within a few weeks .
On May 8 , 1950 , the Secretary of State announced that :
The United States Government convinced that neither national independence nor democratic evolution exist in any area dominated by Soviet imperialism , considers the situation to be such as to warrant its according economic aid and military equipment to the Associated State of Indochina and to France in order to assist them in restoring stability and permitting these states to pursue their peaceful and democratic development .
The U.S. thereafter was deeply involved in the developing war .
But it cannot be said that the extension of aid was a volte - face of U.S. policy precipitated solely by the events of 1950 .
It appears rather as the denouement of a cohesive progression of U.S. policy decisions stemming from the 1945 determination that France should decide the political future of Vietnamese nationalism .
Neither the modest O.S.S. aid to the Viet Minh in 1945 , nor the U.S. refusal to abet French recourse to arms the same year , signaled U.S. backing of Ho Chi Minh .
To the contrary , the U.S. was very wary of Ho , apprehensive lest Paris ' imperialism be succeeded by control from Moscow .
Uncertainty characterized the U.S. attitude toward
Ho through 1948 , but the U.S. incessantly pressured France to accommodate " genuine " Vietnamese nationalism and independence .
In early 1950 , both the apparent fruition of the Bao Dai solution , and the patent alignment of the DRV with the USSR and Communist China , impelled the U.S. to more direct intervention in Vietnam .
( End of Summary )
1. INDOCHINA IN U.S. WARTIME POLICY , 1941 -1945
In the interval between the fall of France in 1940 , and the Pearl Harbor attack in December , 1941 , the United States watched with increasing apprehension the flux of Japanese military power into Indochina .
At first the United States urged Vichy to refuse Japanese requests for authorization to use bases there , but was unable to offer more than vague assurances of assistance , such as a State Department statement to the French Ambassador on 6 August 1940 that :
We have been doing and are doing everything possible within the framework of our established policies to keep the situation in the Far East stabilized ; that we have been progressively taking various steps , the effect of which has been to exert economic pressure on Japan ; that our Fleet is now based on Hawaii , and that the course which we have been following , as indicated above , gives a clear indication of our intentions and activities for the future .
The French Ambassador replied that :
In his opinion the phrase " within the framework of our established policies . " when associated with the apparent reluctance of the American Government to consider the use of military force in the Far East at this particular time , to mean that the United States would not use military or naval force in support of any position which might be taken to resist the Japanese attempted aggression on Indochina .
The Ambassador [ feared ] that the French Government would , under the indicated pressure of the Japanese Government , be forced to accede . . .
The fears of the French Ambassador were realized .
In 1941 , however , Japan went beyond the use of bases to demands for a presence in Indochina tantamount to occupation .
President Roosevelt himself expressed the heightening U.S. alarm to the Japanese Ambassador , in a conversation recorded by Acting Secretary of State Welles as follows :
The President then went on to say that this new move by Japan in Indochina created an exceedingly serious problem for the United States . . . the cost of any military occupation is tremendous and the occupation itself is not conducive to the production by civilians in occupied countries of food supplies and new materials of the character required by Japan .
Had Japan undertaken to obtain the supplies she required from Indochina in a peaceful way , she not only would have obtained larger quantities of such supplies , but would have obtained them with complete security and without the draining expense of a military occupation .
Furthermore , from the military standpoint , the President said , surely the Japanese Government could not have in reality the slightest belief that China , Great Britain , the Netherlands or the United States had any territorial designs on Indochina nor were in the slightest degree providing any real threats of aggression against Japan .
This Government , consequently , could only assume that the occupation of Indochina was being undertaken by Japan for the purpose of further offense and this created a situation which necessarily must give the United States the most serious disquiet . . .
. . .
The President stated that if the Japanese Government would refrain from occupying Indochina with its military and naval forces , or , had such steps actually been commenced , if the Japanese Government would withdraw such forces , the President could assure the Japanese Government that he would do everything within his power to obtain from the Governments of China , Great Britain , the Netherlands , and of course the United States itself a binding and solemn declaration , provided Japan would undertake the same commitment , to regard Indochina as a neutralized country in the same way in which Switzerland had up to now been regarded by the powers as a neutralized country .
He stated that this would imply that none of the powers concerned would undertake any military act of aggression against Indochina and would remain in control of the territory and would not be confronted with attempts to dislodge them on the part of de Gaullist or Free French agents or forces .
The same date , Secretary of State Cordell Hull instructed Sumner Welles to see the Japanese Ambassador , and
Make clear the fact that the occupation of Indochina by Japan possibly means one further important step to seizing control of the South Sea area , including trade routes of supreme importance to the United States controlling such products as rubber , tin and other commodities .
This was of vital concern to the United States .
The Secretary said that if we did not bring out this point our people will not understand the significance of this movement into Indochina .
The Secretary mentioned another point to be stressed : there is no theory on which Indochina could be flooded with armed forces , aircraft , et cetera , for the defense of Japan .
The only alternative is that this venture into Indochina has a close relation to the South Sea area and its value for offense against that area .
In a press statement of 2 August 1941 , Acting Secretary of State Welles deplored Japan's " expansionist aims " and impugned Vichy :
Under these circumstances , this Government is impelled to question whether the French Government at Vichy in fact proposes to maintain its declared policy to preserve for the French people the territories both at home and abroad which have long been under French sovereignty .
This Government , mindful of its traditional friendship for France , has deeply sympathized with the desire of the French people to maintain their territories and to preserve them intact .
In its relations with the French Government at Vichy and with - the local French authorities in French territories , the United States will be governed by the manifest effectiveness with which those authorities endeavor to protect these territories from domination and control by those powers which are seeking to extend their rule by force and conquest , or by the threat thereof .
On the eve of Pearl Harbor , as part of the U.S. attempt to obtain Japanese consent to a non-aggression pact , the U.S. again proposed neutralization of Indochina in return for Japanese withdrawal .
The events of 7 December 1941 put the question of the future of Indochina in the wholly different context of U.S. strategy for fighting World War 11 .
A. ROOSEVELT'S TRUSTEESHIP CONCEPT
U.S. policy toward Indochina during World War 11 was ambivalent .
On the one hand , the U.S. appeared to support Free French claims to all of France 's overseas dominions .
The U.S. early in the war repeatedly expressed or implied to the French an intention to restore to France its overseas empire after the war .
These U.S. commitments included the August 2 , 1941 , official statement on the Franco - Japanese agreement ; a December , 1941 , Presidential letter to P6tain ; a March 2 , 1942 , statement on New Caledonia ; a note to the French Ambassador of April 13 , 1942 ; Presidential statements and messages at the time of the North Africa invasion ; the Clark - Darlan Agreement of November 22 , 1942 ; and a letter of the same month from the President 's Personal Representative to General Henri Giraud , which included the following reassurance :
. . .
The restoration of France to full independence , in all the greatness and vastness which it possessed before the war in Europe as well as overseas , is one of the war aims of the United Nations .
It is thoroughly understood that French sovereignty will be re-established as soon as possible throughout all the territory , metropolitan or colonial , over which flew the French flag in 1939 .
On the other hand , in the Atlantic Charter and other pronouncements the U.S. proclaimed support for national self - determination and independence .
Moreover , the President of the United States , especially distressed at the Vichy " sell - out " to Japan in Indochina , often cited French rule there as a flagrant example of onerous and exploitative colonialism , and talked of his determination to turn Indochina over to an international trusteeship after the war .
In early 1944 , Lord Halifax , the British Ambassador in Washin - ton , called on Secretary of State Hull to inquire whether the President 's " rather definite " statements " that Indochina should be taken away from the French and put under an international trusteeship " - made to " Turks , Egyptians and perhaps others " during his trip to Cairo and Teheran - represented " final conclusions in view of the fact that they would soon get back to the French ( The French marked well the President 's views - in fact as France withdrew from Vietnam in 1956 , its Foreign Minister recalled Roosevelt 's assuring the Sultan of Morocco that his sympathies lay with colonial peoples struggling for independence .
Lord Halifax later recorded that :
The President was one of the people who used conversation as others of us use a first draft on paper . . . a method of trying out an idea .
If it does not go well , you can modify it or drop it as you will .
Nobody thinks anything of it if you do this with a paper draft ; but if you do it with conversation , people say that you have changed your mind , that " you never knew where you have him , " and so on .
But in response to a memorandum from Secretary of State Hull putting the question of Indochina to F.D.R. , and reminding the President of the numerous U.S. commitments to restoration of the French empire , Roosevelt replied ( on January 24 , 1944 ) , that :
I saw Halifax last week and told him quite frankly that it was perfectly true that I had , for over a year , expressed the opinion that Indo - China should not go back to France but that it should be administered by an international trusteeship .
France has had the country - thirty million inhabitants for nearly one hundred years , and the people are worse off than they were at the beginning .
As a matter of interest , I am wholeheartedly supported in this view by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and by Marshal Stalin .
I see no reason to play in with the British Foreign Office in this matter .
The only reason they seem to oppose it is that they fear the effect it would have on their own possessions and those of the Dutch .
They have never liked the idea of trusteeship because it is , in some instances , aimed at future independence .
This is true in the case of Indo - China .
Each case must , of course , stand on its own feet , but the case of IndoChina is perfectly clear .
France has milked it for one hundred years .
The people of Indo - China are entitled to something better than that .
1. Military Strategy Pre-eminent
Throughout the year 1944 , the President held to his views , and consistent with them , proscribed U.S. aid to resistance groups - including French groups - in Indochina .
But the war in the Asian theaters moved rapidly , and the center of gravity of the American effort began to shift northward toward Japan .
The question of U.S. strategy in Southeast Asia then came to the fore .
At the Second Quebec Conference ( September , 1944 ) , the U.S. refused British offers of naval assistance against Japan because Admiral King believed " the best occupation for any available British forces would be to re-take Singapore , and to assist the Dutch in recovering the East Indies , " and because he suspected that the offer 11 was perhaps not unconnected with a desire for United States help in clearing the Japanese out of the Malay States and Netherlands East Indies . "
Admiral King 's suspicions were not well - founded , at least insofar as Churchill 's strategic thought was concerned .
The Prime Minister was evidently as unwilling to invite an active American role in the liberation of Southeast Asia as the U.S. was to undertake same ; as early as February , 1944 , Churchill wrote that :
A decision to act as a subsidiary force under the Americans in the Pacific raises difficult political questions about the future of our Malayan possessions .
If the Japanese should withdraw from them or make peace as the result of the main American thrust , the United States Government would after the victory feel greatly strengthened in its view that all possessions in the East Indian Archipelago should be placed under some international body upon which the United States would exercise a decisive concern .
The future of Commonwealth territories in Southeast Asia stimulated intense British interest in American intentions for French colonies there .
In November and December of 1944 , the British expressed to the United States , both in London and in Washington , their concern " that the United States apparently has not yet determined upon its policy toward Indochina . "
The head of the Far Eastern Department in the British Foreign Office told the U.S. Ambassador that :
It would be difficult to deny French participation in the liberation of Indochina in light of the increasing strength of the French Government in world affairs , and that , unless a policy to be followed toward Indochina is mutually agreed between our two governments , circumstances may arise at any moment which will place our two governments in a very awkward situation .
President Roosevelt , however , refused to define his position further , notifying Secretary of State Stettinius on January 1 , 1945 :
I still do not want to get mixed up in any Indo - China decision .
It is a matter for postwar .-- . . .
I do not want to get mixed up in any military effort toward the liberation of Indo - China from the Japanese .
-- You can tell Halifax that I made this very clear to Mr. Churchill .
From both the military and civil point of view , action at this time is premature .
However , the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were concurrently planning the removal of American armed forces from Southeast Asia .
In response to approaches from French and Dutch officials requesting aid in expelling Japan from their former colonial territories , the U.S. informed them that :
All our available forces were committed to fighting the Japanese elsewhere in the Pacific , and Indochina and the East Indies were therefore not included within the sphere of interest of the American Chiefs of Staff .
American willingness to forego further operations in Southeast Asia led to a directive to Admiral Lord Mountbatten , Supreme Commander in that theater , to liberate Malaya without U.S. assistance .
After the Yalta Conference ( February , 1945 ) , U.S. commanders in the Pacific were informed that the U.S. planned to turn over to the British responsibility for operations in the Netherlands East Indies and New Guinea .
The President , however , agreed to permit such U.S. military operations in Indochina as avoided " alignments with the French , " and detraction from the U.S. military campaign against Japan .
The latter stricture precluded , in the U.S. view , the U.S. cooperation with the French at Mountbatten 's headquarters , or the furnishing of ships to carry Free French forces to Indochina to undertake its liberation .
This U.S. position came under particularly severe French criticism after 11 March 1945 , when the Japanese overturned the Vichy regime in Vietnam , and prompted the Emperor Bao Dai to declare Vietnam unified and independent of France under Japanese protection .
On 16 March 1945 , a protest from General de Gaulle led to the following exchange between the Secretary of State and the President :
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Washington
March 16 , 1945
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject : Indo -China .
Communications have been received from the Provisional Government of the French Republic asking for :
( 1) Assistance for the resistance groups now fighting the Japanese in Indo - China .
(2) Conclusion of a civil affairs agreement covering possible future operations in Indo - China .
These memoranda have been referred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in order to obtain their views concerning the military aspects of the problems , and I shall communicate with you further on the subject upon receipt of the Joint Chiefs ' reply .
Attached herewith is the text of a recent telegram from Ambassador Caffery describing his conversation with General de Gaulle on the subject of Indo - China .
From this telegram and de Gaulle 's speech of March 14 , it appears that this Government may be made to appear responsible for the weakness of the resistance to Japan in Indo - China .
The British may likewise be expected to encourage this view .
It seems to me that without prejudicing in any way our position regarding the future of Indo - China we can combat this trend by making public [ material illegible ] a suggested statement , subject to your approval , by the State Department .
/s/ E. R. Stettinius , Jr.
