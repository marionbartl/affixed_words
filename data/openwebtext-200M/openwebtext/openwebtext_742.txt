A former British champion ice skater who collapsed and died from a brain haemorrhage gave birth to a baby girl two days later .
Jayne Soliman , 41 , was declared brain - dead at Oxford 's John Radcliffe hospital but doctors managed to keep her heart beating long enough to deliver Aya Jayne by caesarean section .
Ms Soliman was 25 weeks ' pregnant when she collapsed in her bedroom last Wednesday after suffering a headache .
She was airlifted to the hospital but was pronounced dead at 8 pm .
Doctors said she had suffered a brain haemorrhage caused by an aggressive tumour which had struck a major blood vessel .
She was given large doses of steroids to help the child 's lungs develop and within 48 hours gave birth to the baby , who weighed 0.95 kg ( 2lb 1.5 oz ) .
Her husband , Mahmoud , was with her when the child was born .
He said they had been overjoyed when his wife became pregnant after suffering an earlier miscarriage .
" I can remember the first scan , " he told the Daily Mail .
" We just hugged each other and kept crying when we saw the heartbeat .
It was this tiny speck beating . "
He recalled his wife 's last hours : " The doctors told me there was nothing they could do for Jayne but they needed her to stay strong for 48 hours to help our unborn child . "
In 1989 , Ms Soliman was British champion and No 7 in the world for professional free skating .
She also spent some time in Dubai , where she taught figure skating and met Mahmoud .
On returning to England two years ago , the newly married couple set up home in Bracknell and Jayne began working for the Bracknell Ice Skating Club .
David Phillips , a friend and fellow skater , said Ms Soliman had shown no signs that anything was wrong earlier in the day and did not know she had a tumour .
" Jayne and I had both been at the ice rink in Bracknell that day and she was absolutely fine ; nothing seemed wrong .
She was as happy as she could be because she was pregnant - it was her dream . "
Phillips said her husband " has had the best and the worst day of his life within such a short space of time - turning off your wife 's life support machine and then going to see your newborn daughter " .
Phillips ' wife , Lucine , 38 , who was present at the birth of Aya , described the mixture of joy and sadness at seeing the birth .
" A midwife picked tiny Aya up and put her little face up to Jayne 's - if Jayne had been awake she would have had eye contact with her daughter .
It was just like welcoming any new baby into the world and everyone in the room was so elated , it was a celebratory feeling .
But we also had to say goodbye to Jayne ; Mahmoud said goodbye on his own because he wanted to be the last person to see her .
" He sat with her for a while and then he was told he could go and see his daughter .
Mahmoud could n't hold Aya straight away because she was taken into intensive care .
He was given a photo of her and I could just tell from his face that he was overcome with emotion , it was just welling up inside him .
He took one look at his daughter and was overjoyed to see her .
He said , ' That 's my Jayney ' . "
More than 300 mourners attended Ms Soliman 's funeral last weekend , which was held at the Jamia mosque in Reading .
Post ' F - bomb ' Scarborough placed on seven - second delay Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday November 11 , 2008
Print This Email This " These are good decent steady men who do n't go around flipping people off or screaming ' fuck you ' at the top of their lungs , " MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said on a live Monday broadcast of Morning Joe , reminiscent of his slip in 2006 when he called an introduction from Tucker Carlson " pretty fucking awesome . "
Monday 's gaffe came about as Scarborough praised President - elect Obama 's campaign advisers while criticizing a contrary , heavy - handed approach by Rep. Rahm Emanuel , who will serve as Chief of Staff in the Obama cabinet .
MSNBC , as spokesman Jeremy Gaines told the Associated Press , came to the " mutual decision " to add a seven - second delay to the network 's Morning Joe .
No other shows will be similarly delayed .

Picture this : an accurate map of a large underground oil reservoir that can guide engineers ' efforts to coax the oil from the vast rocky subsurface into wells where it can be pumped out for storage or transport .
Researchers in MIT 's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering have developed technology that can generate such a map , which has the potential to significantly increase the amount of oil extracted from reservoirs .
The new technology uses the digital image compression technique of JPEG to create realistic - looking , comprehensive maps of underground oil reservoirs using measurements from scattered oil wells .
These maps would be the first to provide enough detail about an oil reservoir to guide oil recovery in the field in real time .
" Our simulation studies indicate that this innovative approach has the potential to improve current reservoir characterization techniques and to provide better predictions of oil - reservoir production .
The hope is that better predictions ultimately lead to more efficient operations and increased oil production , " said Behnam Jafarpour , a recent MIT graduate who is now an assistant professor in petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University .
Jafarpour and Dennis McLaughlin , the H.M. King Bhumibol Professor of Water Resource Management at MIT , published a pair of papers describing the technique that will appear in an upcoming issue of the Society of Petroleum Engineering Journal , as well as a third paper that appeared in the June 2008 issue of Computational Geosciences .
The spatial structure in geologic formations makes it possible to compress rock property maps .
But JPEG compresses the many pixels in a detailed image down to a few essential pieces of information that require only a small amount of storage .
In the oil reservoir characterization application developed by MIT researchers , a similar mechanism is used to provide concise descriptions of reservoir rock properties .
The new technique uses oil flow rates and pressure data from oilfield wells to create a realistic image of the subsurface reservoir .
Petroleum extraction is expensive and relatively inefficient -- sometimes as little as one - third of the oil in a reservoir is actually recovered through pumping .
So engineers rely on enhanced recovery techniques such as water flooding to mobilize the oil .
To guide this work , they make real - time predictions of subsurface variables , including oil saturation and pressure , but they 're essentially working blindly .
The rock properties needed to make these predictions ( for instance fluid conductivity of rock at a particular depth ) can't be seen or measured .
Instead , engineers infer geologic properties indirectly from seismic data and measurements taken at scattered wells .
" In a typical reservoir , millions of pixels are needed to adequately describe the complex subsurface pathways that convey the oil to wells .
Unfortunately , the number of seismic and well observations available for estimating these pixel values is typically very limited .
The methods we 've developed extract more information from those limited measurements to provide better descriptions of subsurface pathways and the oil moving through them , " said McLaughlin , lead researcher on the project .
In a 36 - month simulated oil - recovery process , McLaughlin and Jarfarpour 's estimation approach accurately captured the main features and trends in fluid conductivity of a reservoir formation , demonstrating that the new technique is robust , accurate and efficient .
" Our next step -- already in progress -- is to test our idea in real oil reservoirs and evaluate its impact on oil recovery under realistic field settings , " Jafarpour said .
This research was funded by the Shell International Petroleum Co .

Go Board Game on Hexagonal and Triangular Grids
Honeycomb ( hexagonal ) grid
I have been thinking about the go board game played on various regular tilings .
First experiment is the honeycomb grid ( which has 3 connections per intersection ) , then i'm going to try triangular grid ( 6 connections ) , then i'll try some regular or semi- regular tiling with , many of which has 4 connections just like the rectangular grid but different topology .
In designing a honeycomb board , there are few issues to consider :
Whether the board center should be a intersection .
What should be the overall board shape ?
( hexagonal , triangular , or rhombus )
How the edges should be like ?
( and can it be played on ? ) ( for example , in the regular board , the corner can be played on even though it 's not a intersection )
How large should the board be ?
Illustration that shows different board design .
The left two shows two different types of board edge layout .
Also note that the overall shape can be hexagonal or triangular .
And , some board have a vertex / intersection at the center .
I played with my brother two games , and it is quite interesting .
The game is overly tactical , because every stone has only 3 connections ( liberties ) .
It 's extremely easy to kill .
One game in progress .
White to move .
game in progress .
Black to move .
The edge points have strong advantage , because it takes 5 moves to capture in practice , while it takes 3 in center positions .
If one tries to capture the edge point , he can be captured before he succeed .
So , the edge points are somewhat invincible until endgame .
It is most easy to make two eyes based on the edge .
A good strategy seems to play on the edge first , then snake in .
Perhaps the board should be modified so that the angular edge cannot be played .
This can be done by either cutting the edge flat or allow only stones on intersections .
This way , all points has 3 liberties .
In drawing these boards , some math questions came up .
Look at the triangular boards , which has sides from 2 hexagons to 7 .
Some of these has a intersection at the center , others a hexagon .
What sizes will have a central intersection ?
It turns out , for overal triangular boards , when the side of the board can be expressed as 2+n * 3 or 3+n * 3 , then the board has a intersection at center .
Overall triangular shaped board with n hexagon sides has 1 + 4*n + n ^2 number of intersections , counting the bent points on the sides .
number of intersections , counting the bent points on the sides .
Overall triangular shaped board with n hexagon sides has - 2+n+ n ^ 2 number of intersections , NOT counting the bent points on the sides .
Overall hexagonal shaped boards with n hexagon sides has 6 * n ^ 2 number of intersections , counting the bent points on the sides .
number of intersections , counting the bent points on the sides .
Overall hexagonal shaped boards with n hexagon sides has - 6*n + 6 * n^ 2 number of intersections , NOT counting the bent points on the sides .
( Derivation : Math : Counting Intersections in Honeycomb )
Triangular Grid
Triangular grid .
The right is topogically equivalent , laid - out in a rectangular way .
Triangular grid has six liberties .
My hexagonal grid study shows that best overall shape is probably as round as possible , so that edge - special play is minimized .
So , we can just think about boards with a hexagonal border .
The triangular grid can be deformed to a rectangular shape , equivalent to a rectangular grid with diagonals in one direction .
In contrast to the honeycomb grid , the triangular grid has 6 liberties , which makes it hard to capture .
One game in progress .
( black moves first )
Left : white 's turn .
The two white stones on the left probably cannot be saved .
Right : game ended .
Black 's turn .
In sharp contrast to the honeycomb grid , game on triangular grid is slow .
In the honeycomb grid , life - and - death situation comes up frequently , and one has to think a lot .
In triangular grid , this is not so .
A good strategy in the honeycomb grid seems to be spreading pieces all over the board , while a good strategy on the triangular grid seems to be playing in just one connected group ( snaking ) .
A game in sequence .
Left , white to move .
Middle : black to move and black wins .
Right : the game ends .
It seems that whoever builds a wall enclosing larger area wins .
So , on a small board , playing center seems advantageous .
The board should be increased in sized to increase its strategic appeal .
The center spot might also be removed .
One might also try to remove several spots on the board , like punching in holes .
This however , is basically changing the topology of the board , which a systematic exploration can be taken .
( That is , using regular tiling as grids . )
This board with edge size n triangles has - 3 n + 3 n^2 + 1 points .
( Derivation : Math : Counting Intersections in Honeycomb )
triangular lattice and the hexagonal lattice are duals of each other .
Also note the star shaped lattice , formed by the mid-points of the triangular grid , or the mid-points of the hexagonal grid .
The star - lattice makes a grid where each intersection has 4 degrees .
Other Grids
Here is a game on a grid called 33344 tiling that has 5 liberties per intersection .
( game played using the freedgo program , highly recommended . )
Black to play .
c2.5 or d3 seems to be good moves .
In this game , black just played b9.5 .
What should white do ?
Note the life - and - death situation on the right side .
Both the upper right and lower right white groups could be in danger .
White can either play b3.5 to gain massive territory , or lose that and play h9 to be on the safe side .
Which is the better move ?
( See : answer here )
Playing go on 33344 tiling feels more similar to traditional go , at least in local fight .
Note the board above is a 9x9 board with a total of 81 points .
This grid is equivalent to the square grid plus diagonal links on every other row .

Thoughts On Go Board Variation
As we know , many games are played on various regular grids , such as checker , Chinese checker , gomoku ( tic - tac - toe , connect four ) , go .
The cellular automata Game of Life is also played on a rectangular grid .
Many variations has been experimented , such as triangular grid and torus board .
We can think about a systematical exploration of variations by changing the grid topology .
The grid can be any of periodic or semi-periodic tiling , and we can change the global topology from a plane to sphere , torus , and all the possible 2 dimensional surfaces including non-orientable ones like Cross - Cap Surface ( projective plane ) .
The grid ( connection ) topology can be abstractly defined , to give us more variation and systematic exploration .
In writing a program that play these games , one may also make it modularized so that different boards , rules , topology , and AI can be written as a plug -in .
generalization of grids
In B Grunbaum and G C Shephard 's Tilings and Patterns book Buy at amazon , it was proven that if we consider the topology of Archimedean tilings , there are 13 types only .
( i may be off in terminology , see the book for detail )
One should note that these are planar graphs .
That is , when we consider only the topology aspects of a tilling , we are essentially regarding it as a graph , and a planar one .
When we explore different boards of go or cellular automata , we are interested in the topological properties of the grid .
So , for a abstract systematic exploration of possible ( regular ) grids , we have to consider not just ( regular ) planar graphs , but also non-planar ones .
For example , consider the standard rectangular grid of the go game ; if suppose each point are connected to its 4 diagonal neighbors as well .
Now we have a ( regular ) graph where each vertex has 8 degrees .
This grid can not be drawn on a plane without crossings .
So , here we are dealing with non-planar graphs that are “ regular ” in some sense .
I think this is totally unexplored field .

Go Board Game as Cellular Automata
Go Board Game as Cellular Automata
The mysterious case of The Penistrator — an unidentified " snowfitti " vandal who 's been drawing phallic symbols on snowy cars parked in the East Village this winter — has taken a shocking , unexpected turn .
EV Grieve , who regrets that he lacks the " resources to properly track this fiend , " has learned that the perpetrator may be none other than Sixth Sense star and NYU student Haley Joel Osment .
TMZ posted this photo of a snow - fingered Osment earlier this month , with the headline " I See D*** , People . "
Guess we can close the file on that one !

While economists almost universally support running large deficits to combat the kind of steep recession the country is grappling with now , they are increasingly expressing alarm at the prospect of sustained fiscal imbalances heading into a period in which the aging of the population will create huge budgetary strains because of the growing costs of the Medicare and Social Security programs .
Still , the deficit now seems likely to be so large that it will inevitably constrain Mr. Obama ’s administration to some degree .
At a minimum , it seems sure to force him to walk a line between maintaining the confidence of the financial markets , which could drive interest rates up sharply if they doubt his will or ability to improve the government ’s financial condition in the long run , and various constituencies that will be pressing him to make good on his campaign promises .
Mr. Obama has so far not backed away from any of the big initiatives he ran on , including his plan to expand health insurance .
On that issue , as on others , he has begun making a case that the economically prudent course is to invest now in addressing the nation ’s big challenges rather than avoiding them in the name of saving money in the short run .
Mr. Obama was not specific about the size of the deficit he expects , beyond his reference to “ a trillion - dollar deficit or close to a trillion - dollar deficit ” for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 .
Aides said later that the estimate — in line with what economists have been anticipating given the economy ’s rapid deterioration — did not include the costs of the proposed stimulus package , which could add hundreds of billions of dollars more to the red ink .
At $ 1 trillion , the deficit would not only shatter the largest previous shortfall in dollar terms — $ 455 billion last year — but it could also exceed the post - World War II - era record by the measure more meaningful in economic terms , the deficit as a percentage of total economic activity .
Diane Rogers , chief economist at the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan organization that supports fiscal discipline , estimated that the deficit this year would hit 7 percent of the gross domestic product .
The largest previous record in those terms was in 1983 , when it hit 6 percent .
Mr. Obama declined to say on Tuesday whether the budget that his administration submits to Congress in February would be larger than the $ 3.1 trillion budget that President Bush submitted for the current fiscal year .
He also did not offer any specific examples of how spending could be controlled , saying only that his advisers had been scouring the budget looking for programs that could be eliminated .

GCC Runtime Library Exception Rationale and FAQ
Introduction
On June 29th , 2007 the Free Software Foundation released GPLv3 .
It was immediately adopted by fifteen GNU projects , and more made the switch in the following months .
Most of the GCC codebase migrated to the new license in the 4.2.2 release , and now we are preparing to finish that process .
The licenses for some libraries that accompany GCC have not been changed yet .
These libraries are automatically used by the object code that GCC produces .
Because of that , if these libraries were simply distributed only under the terms of the GPL , all the object code that GCC produces would have to be distributed under the same terms .
However , the FSF decided long ago to allow developers to use GCC 's libraries to compile any program , regardless of its license .
Developing nonfree software is not good for society , and we have no obligation to make it easier .
We decided to permit this because forbidding it seemed likely to backfire , and because using small libraries to limit the use of GCC seemed like the tail wagging the dog .
Therefore , these libraries have always had license exceptions that allow people to distribute the object code GCC produces under any license .
We are now moving these libraries to GPLv3 and updating their exceptions .
Our fundamental policy has not changed ; the new license is meant to permit all the uses of GCC that were permitted before .
However , we have decided to use this opportunity to update the exception to accomplish three goals :
Take advantage of GPLv3's new provisions .
GPLv3 features a number of new terms which benefit all software .
These include section 7 , which establishes a framework for providing license exceptions .
In order for GCC to get the most benefit from GPLv3 , we need to update the exception to take these new terms into account , and work within the parameters of section 7 .
Lay the groundwork for a plugin infrastructure in GCC .
For a while now , the GCC developers have considered adding a plugin framework to the compiler .
This would make it easier for others to contribute to the project , and accelerate the development of new compilation techniques for GCC .
However , there have also been concerns that unscrupulous developers could write plugins that called out to proprietary software to transform the compiled code — effectively creating proprietary extensions to GCC and defeating the purpose of the GPL .
The updated exception prevents such abuse , enabling the GCC team to look forward to plugin developments .
Make exceptions throughout the GCC code base consistent .
Over the years , as new files were added to GCC that needed to carry this license exception , we reviewed and updated the language to help clarify it and address new concerns .
As a result , there are now many different exception texts in GCC that provide the same basic permissions .
Now all of those files will be able to use the single new exception text that we 've prepared , making it easier to perform legal reviews on the code .
As with GPLv3 , we worked hard to listen to various users ' concerns while we drafted this , and address them appropriately .
All told , we have spent more than a year on this process .
The Free Software Foundation and the GCC Steering Committee would like to thank Richard Fontana , Bradley Kuhn , and Karen Sandler at the Software Freedom Law Center for all their hard work and assistance with the exception .
The changes here will strengthen the GCC community , and we look forward to the compiler developments it will enable .
Because GCC is such a crucial part of developers ' lives , we 're expecting lots of questions about these changes , and we want to make sure that they 're addressed .
Below we 've addressed specific concerns that we expect users will have .
If you have questions about the new exception that are n't mentioned here , please feel free to contact us at < licensing@fsf.org > .
How the Exception Works
The permission you need — to convey the object code from these GCC libraries under your own project 's license — is primarily contained in section 1 :
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules , even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3 , provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes .
You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice , consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules .
This section uses many defined terms , and their specific meanings are integral to how the exception works .
This section looks at how these terms relate to common scenarios .
When you write your software , it consists of a set of source code files .
Each file is an “ Independent Module , ” as long as it does n't contain any source from the GCC libraries .
When you compile those source code files , they usually go through a series of steps : source code generation , preprocessing , compilation to low - level code , assembling , and linking .
Not all projects follow all these steps , depending on what language you 're using and how it 's written , but they 'll always go in this order , and everyone using GCC will go through the process of compiling high - level code into some low - level language such as assembly code or Java bytecode .
This phase is when GCC combines or links your own code with code from the GCC libraries .
We call it the “ Compilation Process . ”
The output you get from it is called “ Target Code , ” as long as that output is not used as compiler intermediate representation , or to create such an intermediate representation .
In order to take advantage of this permission , the Compilation Process that you use to create Target Code has to be “ Eligible , ” which means that it does not involve both GCC and GPL - incompatible software .
It 's important to remember that the Compilation Process starts when you feed any high - level code to GCC , and ends as soon as it generates anything that can be considered Target Code .
Because of that , as long as GCC is n't writing out intermediate representation , your Compilation Process can still be Eligible even if you use GCC in conjunction with GPL - incompatible assemblers , linkers , or high - level source generators : those programs are n't involved in the Compilation Process as it's defined here .
The only place you can't use GPL - incompatible software with GCC is when it 's performing the core compilation work .
So , if you use GCC , with or without GPL - compatible enhancements , that would be an Eligible Compilation Process .
If you only use GPL - incompatible compiler tools , that would be an Eligible Compilation Process as well .
( It 's not uncommon for people who build software for GNU / Linux to link against the GCC libraries even if they 're using a different compiler . )
However , if you used GCC in conjunction with GPL - incompatible software during the process of transforming high - level code to low - level code , that would not be an Eligible Compilation Process .
This would happen if , for example , you used GCC with a proprietary plugin .
As long as you use an Eligible Compilation Process , then you have permission to take the Target Code that GCC generates and propagate it “ under terms of your choice . ”
If you did use GPL - incompatible software in conjunction with GCC during the Compilation Process , you would not be able to take advantage of this permission .
Since all of the object code that GCC generates is derived from these GPLed libraries , that means you would be required to follow the terms of the GPL when propagating any of that object code .
You could not use GCC to develop your own GPL - incompatible software .
Frequently Asked Questions
In some ways , we really like candy message hearts .
They make good ammo , you can stamp them with your own messages , they make halfway decent sidewalk chalk , and they do bizarre things if you cook them .
On the other hand , you may or may not like the way that these things taste .
( To us , many years ago , they compared very favorably to the other varieties of sidewalk chalk that we had tried . )
In either case there is certainly some room for culinary alternatives .
Read on and learn how to make your own highly edible custom cookie message hearts .
Our shortbread message hearts are a slightly grown - up version of the classic .
They are much larger , but keep a lot of the fun .
We started with a basic recipe for shortbread cookies .
You can use your favorite , but it ’s good to pick a simple version because candy hearts come in an assortment of colors .
That means that we ’ll be making several small batches , each in a different color .
Do n’t add food coloring to the dough , but instead plan ahead a bit and add the food coloring when you cream the butter and sugar .
Our first set of hearts is in pink , for which we added some red food coloring .
We had a selection of different heart - shaped cookie cutters in different sizes , and opted for one that ’s palm size .
It ’s important to get the area / thickness aspect ratio right so that they end up looking like thick pieces of candy .
Roll out the dough to the appropriate size , dusted in powdered sugar , and cut out the hearts .
Carefully remove them from the cutter ; try to keep the edges nice and vertical .
The next few batches of dough here are orange , green , blue and yellow , which are usual colors that you ’ll find in a box of message hearts .
We opted not to go for white– we have white food coloring , but the idea of dyed - white shortbread was a little bit much for us .
( Is n’t it bad enough to use bleached flour ? )
And here they are .
( The colors will become more muted when they cook , of course . )
The next step is to start adding messages to the hearts .
We tried a few things that did not work first .
Stamping or painting the cookies with regular food coloring or food coloring markers ( before or after baking ) was rather ineffective , presumably because of the buttery nature of the cookies .
However , spray color ( like we used in the circuitry snacks project ) turned out to be effective , either before or after baking .
To apply it where we wanted , we cut out some stencils , doing our best to mimic the visual style of the text on message hearts .
We used 1/8 ″ plastic sheet for the stencils , but the thickness proved to be a distraction– card stock would have been a better choice .
We used both green and red color spray ; the red generally seemed more appropriate .
And finally , after baking .
… I can has cookie ?
“ It is not too much to say that governments are now superseded by financial institutions ... the efforts of those in control of financial policy are , primarily , if not entirely , concerned with making the world safe for bankers , rather than making the world safe .... the world cannot be made safe without removing the banker , painlessly or otherwise , from the commanding position which he now occupies . ”
C.H. Douglas , The Monopoly Of Credit , 1932
The overlooked reason for today ’s bailout mess and the economic - financial crisis stems from the private control of credit and money creation , as well as the recent creation of unregulated , unbacked , quasi- money instruments called derivatives and credit swaps also created by the big bank owners of the Federal Reserve .
The private “ Federal ” Reserve and its big bank owners are the main culprits and root cause in the creation of inflation and depression via the expansion and contraction of money .
The business cycle , and its magnified boom - bust periods , is largely a creature of monetary policies geared to private interests , with little or no public interest imput .
Who lends , to whom , for what , at what cost , and who has a say ?
In short , we are abjectly dependent on our " independent " central bank .
Independent of whom ?
The People , of course ... and this in direct contravention of the founders intent .
Private banks are in the business of creating debt - money and interest and fee income .
There is no real public interest per se in this process .
In any case , for years before securitization emerged loans were more local and held by community - based lending institutions .
As a consequence , more oversight and concern for these loans and their security were in play .
With the advent of securitization of bank loans , and their sale to pension funds and foreign investors , a process was created whereby the banks could continually exceed their traditional capital and fractional reserve requirements by selling loans to Wall Street .
As long as loan could be sold , this meant there was no end to debt - money creation and fee and interest profit .
For this reason , banks became less concerned with the quality of loans given that they could be packaged and sold – often with bogus credit ratings provided by Wall Street .
This process was exacerbated by the commission and fee driven structure of mortgage lending in which any deal is put thru in order to generate a commission .
This would not happen with a system of Treasury - Direct home loans via local banks , with people on salary , funded not by “ fed ” debt - money but by treasury dollars created for home loans , and with loans held over term by our Treasury and public central bank .
Under the current corrupt system lending expanded beyond reason and the quality of loans and their security continued to drop .
Again , this applied in spades to the home loan market where securitization and implicit taxpayer guarantees made it possible for banks to get loans off their books and continue to make loans , fees , and interest beyond reasonable limits .
What else could one expect in a thoroughly privatized process in an era of deregulation ?
The process of debt - money involves the “ magic ” creation of loan money credit “ out of thin air . ”
At the same time , the total sum of interest which will become due is not created .
For this reason , private debt - money creation and interest - rate setting powers mean , eventually , our assets flow to the big banks ( owners of the Fed ) as the economy cannot generate enough profit to pay the interests costs .
Private central bank debt piles up , and is either refinanced and loans extended ( in perpetuity as with our goverment debt ) or defaults begin to multiply and assets go back to the banks – in particular , those money center banks who not only own the federal reserve but access its money at will .
In addition , ruinous inflation for the people is then the answer to " reflate " the economy and save the big bank owners of the Fed .
Whither the public ?
Why , given the utter corruption and calamitous mismanagement , are we only pursuing a selective , half - baked , nationalization process ?
The absence of public interest in private money creation power means , in a profit - seeking system , that lending and debt money creation continue until no more loans can be sold and banks retrench and a collapse follows .
Then we give them more money and they still do n't lend !
Exactly this dismal boom - bust , rob the public , depression dynamic - serving to greatly exacerbate normal business cycles - is built - in to the system as we know it .
We can safely say , its the structure , stupid !
“ This boom - bust economic cycle is totally unnecessary and is the fundamental cause of the inherent instability in our economy .
It is due to too - rapid increases in the money supply due to deficit spending and then the multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking ( described above ) and to lenders greedy to take advantage of such a system that rewards lending with more and more interest revenue ; followed by a too - rapid contraction of the money supply ( such as we are experiencing now ) , necessary to combat the inflationary effects of the former phase , both the direct result of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
We urgently need to reform this system that rewards greed and results in ever - increasing swings from boom - to - bust - destroying ordinary businesses and farms in the process .
We need to repeal or fundamentally reform the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , and to replace it with a system that eliminates the ability of private banks to " create " and multiply money as loans . ”
Patrick Carmack , The Money Masters
The real question is when , in these awful episodes in which the public is so badly fleeced and made destitute amidst horrendous social carnage , does the power of monetary policy shift to the public ?
When will the people regain the ownership of their central bank and monetary policy – if for nothing else then that being the price of today ’s taxpayer bailout ?
Despite the seriousness of today ’s financial chaos , our own representatives are still not even broaching this question of taking back the Fed stock - and this despite the fact taxpayers are bailing out the owners of the Federal Reserve , and taking all their “ toxic waste ” debt which was created and multiplied to the chaos point by the very fact of a lack of any real public interest and oversight in the debt - money creation system !
Even today , Congress ca n’t even proceed to audit the “ Fed ” - much less require the real owners of “ our ” central bank stock to appear before the American people .
Shame on Congress !
The Founders of this country well understood the banker problem , as they had seen the chaos , predation , and perfidy of the private ‘ Bank Of England . ’
They warned us time and time again about this corrupt system .
But the American public has been kept in the dark about the real owners of “ our ” economy and society .
The corporate media is a handmaiden of the big bankers today , and only the internet has served to educate people about their past and a banking history effectively buried in “ our ” educational institutions .
Like everything else in our society , including an undemocratic " free trade " policy , the bailout process is top - down and utterly plutocratic .
Wall Street Oligarchs create the mess and then they bring the rescue plan .
Driven by a Goldman - Sachs owned Treasury department , the White House then fronts it and tells Congress it has no choice .
Except for phone calls to legislators the public is left out despite the fact we must pay the bill – and the only way the bill can be paid is with our tax money or more borrowed debt - money from this same crisis - causing private central bank !
Regardless of any bailout legislation passed , the Congress should proceed to nationalize the Fed and return the “ purse powers ” to the public , as the Constituion intended .
They should join with other lower chambers - the people 's representatives - around the world and put an end to private central banking in order to avoid gangs of foreign private banks attacking those seeking the public interest .
Otherwise , the dismal dynamic and debt slavery we are witnessing today , and have seen so many times in the past , will continue to be repeated ... to our everlasting indebtedness .
Kent Welton ,
Crow and ravens are alot smarter than people think .
Very hardy birds .
Flip open any biology textbook and you 're bound to see a complicated diagram of the inner workings of a cell , with its internal scaffolding , the cytoskeleton , and how it maintains a cell ’s shape .
Yet the fundamental question remains , which came first : the shape , or the skeleton ?
Now a research team led by Phong Tran , PhD , Assistant Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , has the answer : both .
The findings , published online this week in the journal Current Biology by co-senior authors Tran and Matthieu Piel of the Institut Curie , Paris , combine genetics , live - cell imaging , and microfluidics technology .
They were able to force normally rod-shaped yeast cells to grow within tiny curved channels .
Using the channels , they made rod-shaped cells deform into curved - shaped mutant cells and conversely , curved - shaped cells straighten out into a rod .
The surprising finding : as the cells bend , they reorganize their cytoskeleton , and as they reorganize their internal skeletons , the cells further adjust their shape .
Cell shape gone awry has been implicated in some forms of cancer .
In the future , one potential implication of Tran 's findings is that it might be possible to rescue certain disease states via squeezing or otherwise applying mechanical pressure to tissues or organs .
But that , he concedes , is “ completely science fiction on my part . ”
Instead , he says at this point this study is pure , basic research .
“ It was just a cool experiment . ”
The findings point to a type of feedback loop .
“ The cytoskeleton changes the shape of the cell and the shape of the cell also changes the organization of the cytoskeleton , ” he says .
“ In fact they feed back on each other , so any perturbation on one system will change the other , and visa versa . ”
The results validate a common belief among cell biologists , says Tran – that to cause a cell to form a branching projection , such as filopodia or dendrite , or new shape , simply adjust the cytoskeleton accordingly , and the shape will follow suit .

" Our demonstration is a conclusive and direct demonstration of that theory because we used normally rod-shaped cells , as opposed to indirect proof of the concept using mutant cell shapes , ” he says .
At least five cellular components are required for making changes to the organization of the cytoskeleton and therefore the shape of a cell : microtubules , actin filaments , the cell membrane , and two protein complexes .
Microtubules are hollow protein pipes that arrange themselves in bundles down the long axis of the cell .
As they extend from the cell center towards the periphery , they carry with them one of the protein complexes , so that when they finally dock with a protein receptor at the cell membrane , the effect is to deliver the complex to the desired growth point .
What follows is a cascade of events :
This complex recruits the second protein complex , which in turn recruits the protein actin .
Filaments of actin from this site bring the transport machinery necessary for new cell membrane to extend in the intended direction – generally , further along the long axis of the cell .
Essentially , what Tran 's team , led by technician Courtney Terenna , found was that if normal yeast cells are forced to bend , their microtubules can no longer reach the old tip of the cell and so form new growth tips .
Conversely , they also found that mutant yeast cells normally grow bent or round , if forced to grow in straight channels , will adopt cytoskeletal structures that are the normal rod-shape .
This , says Tran , could in theory partially explain why some cells from mouse knock - outs , when grown in two - dimensional tissue culture , have more severe problems than when grown in a three - dimensional animal .
The researchers surmise that the three - dimensional architecture of a tissue inside a living organ rescues cytoskeletal abnormalities that otherwise arise in an artificial two - dimensional construct .
The study stems from an international collaboration between the microfluidics experts in Piel 's group and the biology experts in Tran's .
Co-first authors Terenna and Tatyana Makushok , a graduate student in Piel 's group , funded by a Human Frontier Science Program ( HFSP ) , an international organization funded by various countries , traveled to Paris and Philadelphia , respectively , to learn their counterpart 's secrets so they could then proceed independently .
Now Tran 's group is working to address several questions that arise from this research .
First , how long can mutant cells maintain their wild - type phenotype once they are removed from the physical constraints of the microfluidic channel ?
How do the two protein complexes work together to affect cell shape ?
And , what effects do other environmental variables , such as temperature , have on cytoskeletal dynamics ?
Tran ’s lab is funded by the National Institutes of Health , the American Cancer Society , and the HFSP .
Evidence suggests that Bernard Madoff , the “ prominent ” Wall Street operator and former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , had ties to the Russian Mafia , Moscow - based oligarchs , and the Genovese organized crime family .
And , as reported by Deep Capture and Reuters , Madoff did not just orchestrate a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
He was also the principal architect of SEC rules that made it easier for “ naked ” short sellers to manufacture phantom stock and destroy public companies – a factor in the near total collapse of the American financial system .
* * * * * * * *
I do n’t know why , but this seems like a good time to tell you a little about my personal history .
Along the way , I ’ll mention a murder , two suicides ( or “ suicides ” ) , a punch in the face , a generous bribe , three Armani suits in bar , and a “ prominent ” billionaire who might know something about a death threat and a Russian matryoshka doll .
But actually , this story is n’t about me .
It ’s about Patrick Byrne , the fellow who got me into this mess .
* * * * * * * *
The story , like so many others , begins on August 12 , 2005 – the day that Patrick Byrne , the CEO of Overstock.com and future reporter for Deep Capture ( a leading investigative news outfit ) , delivered a famous conference call presentation entitled , “ The Miscreants Ball . ”
To the 500 Wall Street honchos who listened in to this conference call , Patrick said that a network of miscreants was using a variety of tactics – including naked short selling ( phantom stock ) – to destroy public companies for profit .
He said this scheme had the potential to crash the financial markets , but that the SEC did nothing because the SEC had been compromised – or “ captured ” – by unsavory operators on Wall Street .
Patrick added that he believed the scheme ’s mastermind — “ just call him the Sith Lord ” — was a “ famous criminal from the 1980s . ”
In January 2006 , I was working as an editor for the Columbia Journalism Review , a well - respected ( if somewhat dowdy ) magazine devoted to media criticism .
Patrick had claimed that some prominent journalists were “ corrupt ” and were working with prominent hedge funds to cover up the naked short selling scandal , so I called to discuss .
Patrick picked up the phone and said : “ Chasing this story will take you down a rabbit hole with no end . ”
He said that the story had it all – diabolical billionaires , phantom stock , dishonest journalists , crooked lawyers , black box organizations on Wall Street , and a crime that could very well cause a meltdown of our financial system .
Not only that , Patrick said , but “ the Mafia is involved , too . ”
Well , Patrick seemed basically sane .
I decided to write a story about the basically sane CEO who was fighting the media on an important financial issue while harboring some eccentric notions about the Mafia .
I figured it would take a week .
* * * * * * * *
Months later , my desk was buried under evidence of short seller miscreancy , I had done nothing but investigate this story since the day I first called Patrick , and I had just gone to a topless club to meet a self - professed mobster who told me all about a stockbroker who had peddled phantom shares for the Russian Mafia and the Genovese organized crime family .
The stockbroker had taken a bullet to the head – execution - style .
And the mobster said he knew who did it .
* * * * * * * *
By this time , Patrick had long - since amended his “ Sith Lord ” analogy to say that the short selling schemes probably had multiple masterminds with a shared ideology – “ like Al Queda . ”
Be that as it may , my investigation now had two areas of focus .
The first was the Mafia .
The second was a network of crooked journalists , investors , short sellers , and scoundrels – a great many of whom were connected in important ways to two famous criminals or their associates .
The famous criminals were Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky .
In the 1980s , Milken and Boesky were among the most “ prominent ” investors in America .
They were also the main protagonists in what James B. Stewart , a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for The Wall Street Journal , later called “ the greatest criminal conspiracy the financial world has ever known . ”
In 1989 , Milken was indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud and racketeering .
He did some time in prison .
Upon his release , he revved up a public relations machine that was as effective as it was ruthless ( Milken ’s detractors had their reputations torn to shreds ) .
Nowadays , the press generally refers to Milken as a “ prominent philanthropist . ”
Often , he is hailed as the “ junk bond king ” – a financial “ genius ” who “ fueled economic growth ” and “ built great companies ” by “ revolutionizing ” the market for high - yield debt ( junk bonds ) .
Boesky , who helped Milken destroy great companies , was indicted on several counts of securities fraud and stock manipulation .
After his release from prison , in the early 1990s , he reportedly went to Moscow to build relationships with the Russian oligarchs who were then looting the former Soviet Union .
After that , nobody heard much from Boesky .
* * * * * * * *
In the spring of 2006 , I doubted that Milken or Boesky had committed any wrong - doing since the 1980s .
But it was clear that many of the people in their network were up to their same old tricks – destroying public companies for profit .
I did not think that Milken or Boesky worked for the Mafia – that would be crazy .
But it was clear that the Mafia was destroying public companies for profit .
And it was clear that a surprising number of people in the Milken - Boesky network did have ties to the Mafia .
At any rate , the “ prominent investors ” in this network seemed to have many schemes .
Sometimes they seized a public company , fattened it with debt , stripped out its assets , pocketed its cash , and then killed the company off .
This is what mobsters used to call a “ bust - out . ”
In the old days , it was neighborhood wiseguys taking over local restaurants .
In the 1980s , Milken and his crowd introduced the technique to the world of high - finance .
Other times , the “ prominent investor ” thugs acquired large stakes in a company .
Then the thugs suggested to the company that they would go away only if the company were to buy back its shares at a hefty premium .
In the 1980s , the Milken crowd referred to this as “ greenmail . ”
Mobsters called it “ blackmail ” or “ protection money . ”
In still other cases , the “ prominent investors ” attacked the companies from the outside , employing tactics – threats , harassment , extortion – that seem straight from the Mafia playbook .
Whatever the specifics of the scheme , it was often the case that “ prominent ” short sellers who were tied to the “ prominent investors ” would eventually converged on the target companies and use a variety of equally abusive tactics either to destroy the companies or put them on the defensive .
While I do not have SEC data going back to the 1980s , the data for more recent years shows that most of the companies attacked by this network were also victimized by abusive naked short selling .
That is , somebody sold massive amounts of the companies ’ stock and “ failed to deliver ” it for days , weeks , months – or even years – at a time .

So back in 2006 , I had begun to ask a lot of questions .
That ’s when I had a strange encounter with three dudes in Armani suits .
The encounter occurred on a Thursday evening in a quiet , neighborhood dive bar , around the corner from my apartment , near Columbia University in New York – a neighborhood that does not often attract men in Armani suits .
I was alone , having a beer and reading a book about Wall Street .
The Armani suits entered the bar and sat down next to me .
“ Whatcha reading ? ” one said .
When I told him , he asked : “ Anything in there about Ivan Boesky ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said , “ he ’s mentioned ”
“ Have n’t read it , ” the man said .
He was silent for a few minutes .
Then he laughed and announced that , by the way , he used to work for Ivan Boesky ’s family .
He said Boesky “ is a real asshole – thinks he has so much money he can do what he wants .
Hell , he might have killed people , for all I know … Heh . ”
Armani shook his head .
Then he said , “ Hey , I got to tell you a funny story . ”
This turned out to be a long and convoluted tale , the gist being that a fellow had wandered into the ladies underwear department at Saks Fifth Avenue .
Apparently , this fellow thought it would be a good idea to peek into a dressing room where a lady was trying on a new pair of panties .
But the lady ’s husband caught the fellow and the husband happened to be packing some high - caliber weaponry , so he blew the fellow ’s brains out , and now there was a big mess in the ladies underwear department .
“ The guy was a pervert , ” said Armani .
“ You know what I mean ?
There are some things you keep your nose out of .
I would have killed the guy , too . ”
With that , Armani stood up and said he was pleased to have met me .
I asked for his name .
He said , “ It ’s John — John from Saks Fifth Avenue . ”
And then he and his friends were out the door .
The other two guys had n’t said a word .
None of them had bought drinks or shown any other reason for having entered the bar .
This occurred shortly after I began asking my first serious questions about Boesky .
I had just met with a CNBC public relations man and I had told him that I was conducting a full - scale investigation of Boesky , and was interested in knowing more about Boesky ’s ties to CNBC reporter Jim Cramer .
I had determined that most of the journalists who were deliberately blowing smoke over the naked short selling issue were connected to Cramer .
These included four of the five founding editors of TheStreet.com , Cramer ’s online financial news publication .
Cramer , a former hedge fund manager , had planned to work out of Boesky ’s offices in the 1980s .
When Boesky was indicted , Cramer worked instead with Michael Steinhardt , whose biggest initial investors were Boesky , Marc Rich ( later charged with tax evasion and illegal trading with Iran ) , Marty Peretz ( co- founder , with Cramer , of TheStreet.com ) and the Genovese organized crime family .
Steinhardt ’s father , Sol “ Red ” Steinhardt , spent several years in Sing - Sing prison after he was a convicted by a New York prosecutor who described him as “ the biggest Mafia fence in America . ”
Also at this time , a central target of my investigation was a hedge fund called SAC Capital , colloquially known as “ Sak . ”
That , of course , is somewhat different from “ Saks Fifth Avenue . ”
It seemed doubtful to me that either Boesky or SAC Capital had sent the Armani - suits to threaten me .
Possibly , I thought , Armani had misrepresented his relationship with Boesky and Saks Fifth Avenue .
Perhaps Armani worked for people who were concerned that I had begun investigating that execution - style murder .
Either that , or this was just one of those weird coincidences and there really was a former Boesky employee who ’d found work in the brain - splattered ladies underwear department at Saks Fifth Avenue .
* * * * * * * *
My investigation continued and sometime later – on Halloween , 2006 – a guy sat down next to me at a book store .
He said he ’d seen me with one of my closest relatives ( he was specific , but I ’d rather not name the relative ) and he thought I needed to be more concerned about the safety of this relative .
He said he did n’t mean to be intrusive , but he knew how hard it was to take care of relatives and he just wanted everyone to be safe .
Then another guy sat down at a nearby table , and slammed down a book .
On the front cover of this book , in big bold letters , it said : “ MAFIA . ”
I became paranoid enough to retreat to the back of the book store .
I told one of the clerks about the two guys , and I called some colleagues , who offered to send the police .
As soon as I hung up , one of the guys came up to me , smiled , and said he hoped that he had n’t upset me .
Then he left .
I told my friends not to call the police .
It was probably just a strange coincidence .
Two years later , as my investigation deepened , I began receiving Internet messages from Sam Antar , a convicted felon who orchestrated the famous fraud at Crazy Eddie , the electronics retailer .
In an upcoming story , I will describe Antar ’s relationship with Michael Milken .
I will also tell you more about the $ 250,000 in cash that Antar delivered to a Milken - funded entrepreneur who orchestrated a massive fraud with the Genovese organized crime family .
For now , though , I ’ll just say that Antar ’s messages to me have not been friendly .
In one , he wrote , “ Mitchell : Do you remember what happened last Halloween ? ”
I had spent the previous Halloween interviewing Rotarians in Oklahoma about their Halloween canned food drive .
The Halloween before that , I was in a book store where there was either a strange coincidence or a veiled death threat .
I sent Antar an email , asking what he meant .
He did not reply .
* * * * * * * *
In November 2006 , one of the hedge fund managers I was investigating appeared in my office and announced that he had become the primary financial backer of my department at the Columbia Journalism Review .
Traditionally , the Columbia Journalism Review ( a not - for - profit magazine ) had been funded by large philanthropic foundations – not by hedge fund managers who were under investigation by the Columbia Journalism Review .
But now my salary would depend entirely on the beneficence of this hedge fund .
The hedge fund was called Kingsford Capital , and in upcoming stories , I will tell you more about this hedge fund .
I ’ll tell you about Kingsford ’s ties to naked short sellers .
I will tell you about the large sums of money that were offered to other journalists who had been working the naked short selling story .
I will tell you why it is significant that one of Kingsford Capital ’s managers was Cory Johnson – a founding editor , along with Jim Cramer and the other dishonest journalists I was investigating , of TheStreet.com .
I will publish emails that shed light on Kingsford ’s relationship with hedge funds that are tied to both SAC Capital and Michael Steinhardt , Cramer ’s former office - mate .
In still other stories , I ’ll tell you more about Steinhardt and his partners ’ ties to the Genovese Mafia , Ivan Boesky , an angry Russian hooker , and a man who wanted the world to believe that he was dead .
I will also tell you about the former Genovese Mafia soldier who told a former manager of SAC Capital that he could make one of the manager ’s business associates disappear in the Nevada desert .
And I ’ll tell you that the man who volunteered to commit this murder had once been hired to put a dead fish and a bullet hole in the car of a journalist who was investigating one of Michael Milken ’s closest friends .
I ’ll tell you all about it in upcoming stories .
But let me stress that I have no idea who was responsible for the strange things that occurred in 2006 .
That is to say , I know that Kingsford bribed the Columbia Journalism Review .
But as for the other strange occurrences – all I can say is that they were strange .
* * * * * * * *
Two days after I learned that Kingsford Capital and its cronies would be paying my salary while I finished my exposé on Kingsford Capital and its cronies , I had dinner with an economist who was exploring the naked short selling problem .
On my way home , I stopped in a café around the corner from my apartment .
As I was putting on my coat to leave the cafe , a man grabbed me from behind and forcefully escorted me to the sidewalk .
Outside , there were two more guys – not big guys , just regular looking fellows .
They grabbed me , and the first guy delivered a single powerful punch to my eye .
I was stunned .
When I finally held up my fists , the three men laughed and embraced me in a bear hug .
Then they virtually carried me to the front stoop of my apartment , which was a block away .
It seemed as if they knew that I lived there .
After brushing off my lapel , they said they were very sorry .
They said they hoped I was n’t offended , it would n’t happen again , but they were there for my own good – and , please , just “ stay away from your Irish Mafia friend . ”
Then they were gone .
It all happened in about three minutes .
It occurred to me that this might have been just a random act of violence .
It also occurred to me that the thugs might have bungled the message – that they had meant to say , “ Just stay away from the Mafia and your Irish friend . ”
Patrick Byrne ( full name : Patrick Michael Xavier Byrne ) , with whom I was working extensively on the naked short selling story , is Irish .
In interviews I had conducted for the story , many people had commented on Patrick ’s Irishness .
( In some Wall Street circles , it seems to be common for people to refer to others ’ ethnicity – “ Byrne , he ’s an Irish guy , right ? ” or “ The stock loan business , that ’s the Italians . ” )
In any case , I went to work the next day with a black eye .
I said it was “ just a bar fight . ”
A woman in my office told me she thought it was “ really cool ” that I had been in a bar fight .
Later , Sam Antar , the convicted felon , posted an Internet message asking whether I “ had ever been forcefully escorted out of a public building . ”
As this had happened only once , I sent Antar an email asking if he was referring to the thugs who ’d ambushed me in a café .
Antar did not answer my question .
Instead , he quickly proceeded to write a blog saying that he had just received information that I had been “ forcefully escorted out of the Columbia Journalism Review . ”
* * * * * * * *
During the fall of 2006 , Patrick Byrne had some strange experiences as well .
Somebody broke into Patrick ’s home , and soon after , somebody broke into the home of a woman who was Patrick ’s girlfriend at the time .
Then somebody threw a pair of metal gardening shears through the window of the girlfriend ’s restaurant .
Around the same time , Patrick ’s then - girlfriend discovered that for some mysterious reason , her phone records were being sent to the home of a Russian man working for Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing ( formerly Spear , Leeds , and Kellogg – in its day , one of the most egregious naked short selling outfits on the Street ) .
I asked Goldman Sachs about this .
I was told that the bank had investigated thoroughly and found no reason to believe that the Russian man , Elliot Faivinov , had obtained the phone records .
( For anyone interested , the phone company can confirm that he did receive the phone records . )
At any rate , I have since learned that Goldman Sachs became a large donor to the Columbia Journalism Review sometime not long after Kingsford Capital announced that it would be paying my salary .
Wall Street has never been so devoted to the dowdy world of media criticism .
As if all of this were not enough , one day in the fall of 2006 , U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch invited Patrick to his home .
As soon as Patrick entered the lobby of the apartment building , the Senator pulled him aside and said that he had credible information that Patrick ’s life was in danger .
“ You are up against some really nasty , vicious people , ” the Senator said , “ They will not hesitate to kill you . ”
* * * * * * * *
Patrick kept on fighting .
As for me , I ’d been investigating the Mafia , there ’d been an execution - style murder , now there were these strange incidents , which might have been nothing , but getting beat up kind of freaked me out , and now I was staying up all night , squinting at my computer through my punched - in eye ( which was black and blue , full of puss and swollen shut ) , trying to finish a story about a scandal involving the people who would now be directly paying my salary .
And so , maybe it is n’t all that surprising what happened next , which is that I snapped .
I could n’t work anymore .
I checked - out .
In the middle of November , a week or so after getting the Kingsford news , but still on perfectly good terms with my editors , I quit my job , and walked out the door .
Within a few days , I had shut down my New York apartment , and was on a plane to Chicago , where I planned to take some time off .
I had told my editor that I thought I might be killed .
But I never specified , and I did n’t make an issue of the Kingsford Capital bribe until later .
So I am hopeful that the good people at the Columbia Journalism Review never really knew that they were taking tainted money .
That said , my questions about this have gone unanswered .
* * * * * * * *
A few weeks later , Patrick accepted an invitation to meet an offshore investor in a greasy spoon diner in Long Island .
They had never met , but over the previous year the man had fed Patrick bits and pieces of information about the workings of the phantom stock scam .
The hope was that the man might have something more to say in person .
But that day at the diner , all he had was a message .
“ I ’ll make this quick , ” the businessman said , with two other witnesses present .
“ I have a message for you from Russia .
The message is , ‘ We are about to kill you .
We are about to kill you . ’
Patrick , they are going to kill you .
If you do not stop this crusade , they will kill you .
Normally they ’d have already hurt someone close to you as a warning , but you ’re so weird , they do n’t know how you ’d react . ”
In a later phone conversation with an associate of Patrick ’s the man described how he received this message .
He said he returned home one night and his wife told him there was a package on his desk .
“ And there was a beautiful little box , and inside was a matryoshka . ”
Matryoshkas are those lacquered Russian dolls – the kind with multiple dolls of decreasing size inside of them .
“ And I opened up the last matryoshka , ” said the man , “ and inside is an ` F ’ with a cross on it — which is from Felix … ”
* * * * * * * *
A year later , I was working for a charitable service organization .
Patrick called me to catch up .
Pretty quickly , he was suggesting to me that I quit my job and return to the naked short selling story .
I thought about shopping the story around to magazines , but I never did .
There was no way that the story could be told in a few magazine pages .
Moreover , the story represented the joint efforts of myself , Patrick , reporter Judd Bagley and many independent , volunteer researchers .
This was an unprecedented collaboration , and it occurred to me that if this collaboration were to continue — as Deep Capture , the website — it could put the major news organizations to shame .
So I wrote the story – our story , filled with hard facts about a scandal .
The story that I wrote was not a magazine story .
It was not a news story .
It was 69 pages long , and it was “ The Story of Deep Capture . ”
But that was only half the story .
There is much more .
For example , you do not yet know the name of the famous billionaire who might be able to tell us more about Felix , his matryoshka doll , the Russian Mafia , and the Genovese organized crime family .

Lead is one of the most dangerous heavy metals and is especially toxic to children .
Safe and effective detoxification processes are needed .
As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie , a Korean team led by Won Seok Han and Jong Hwa Jung has developed a new , highly promising approach .
It is based on a fluorescence receptor that selectively and strongly binds to lead ions .
The trick : the receptor is bound to magnetic nanoparticles and can be removed , along with their lead cargo , in a simple hemodialysis procedure using magnets .
By using these magnetic particles , the researchers were able to remove 96 % of the lead ions from blood samples mixed with lead in vitro .
Lead and lead salts are mainly ingested in foods or drinking water .
Lead pipes and lead - containing glazes on ceramic vessels are often a source of lead .
Usually , it is not acute lead poisoning that occurs , but rather gradual lead poisoning , in which smaller amounts of the metal are accumulated over a long period of time .
Symptoms such as muscle weakness , disorientation , memory loss , and anemia are the result .
Currently , lead poisoning is treated with chelation therapy , which has serious side effects : the chelates bind to other minerals and trace elements as well as lead , removing these vital materials from the body as well .
Now an alternative is on the horizon .
The researchers ’ idea starts with special probes used for the detection of various specific metal ions , including lead .
When a lead ion binds to such a “ lead receptor ” , the receptor ’s fluorescence is “ switched on ” , causing it to glow .
The receptor binds to no other metal ions , only lead .
Perhaps a selective lead detector could be used for detoxification , as well as detection .
The scientists synthesized a derivative of such a lead detector and also equipped the molecule with a special chemical “ anchor ” .
They used this anchor to attach the receptor molecules to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles made of silicon - dioxide - coated nickel .
Detoxification could theoretically work like hemodialysis : the blood is diverted out of the body and into a special chamber containing the biocompatible magnetic particles .
By using magnetic fields , the charged magnetic particles could be fished out .
The purified blood is then reintroduced to the patient .
In contrast to chelation therapy , no vital minerals or trace elements would be removed from the body in this process .
John Atta Mills attended a church service to give thanks for his victory United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has praised the presidential election in Ghana as a democratic achievement and an example to others .
He congratulated the people and government for the orderly outcome of the vote which saw a narrow victory for opposition candidate John Atta Mills .
But losing candidate Nana Akufo - Addo is considering whether to challenge the result in the courts .
He told the BBC that results from some areas were questionable .
I want to congratulate all of them especially honourable Nana Akufo - Addo for giving us a good fight
John Atta Mills
Wind of change for Ghana Ghana voters ' views
He said that intimidation had stopped his party , the ruling New Patriotic Party , from campaigning freely .
Mr Atta Mills has said he will be " a president for all " .
Officials say there was no evidence of vote - rigging .
Analysts says Ghana 's poll could help salvage the tarnished image of constitutional democracy in Africa after last year 's flawed elections in Kenya and Zimbabwe and military coups in Mauritania and Guinea .
' No evidence of fraud '
Electoral officials announced the result after the last constituency to vote , Tain , showed him extending his lead over Mr Akufo - Addo .

The ruling party had boycotted the Tain constituency vote .
The electoral commission said the results of the run-off showed Mr Atta Mills had won narrowly with 50.23 % of the votes , against 49.77 % for Mr Akufo - Addo .
" On the basis of the official results given , it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the president - elect of the Republic of Ghana , " the commission 's head , Kwado Afari - Gyan , said in the capital Accra .
He said the commission had considered allegations of vote - rigging by both sides but " did not find the evidence provided sufficient to invalidate the result " .
Outgoing President John Kufuor earlier urged both candidates to respect the final result .
He appealed for calm and said any complaints of vote - rigging should be dealt with by the courts after the new president is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday .
' Good fight '
Addressing jubilant supporters on the streets of Accra around the NDC headquarters , Mr Atta Mills , who had failed twice before to become president , said : " The time has come to work together to build a better Ghana .
" I assure Ghanaians that I will be president for all . "
He also congratulated " all other contestants , especially Nana Akufo - Addo , for giving us a good fight " .
Although Ghana remains a very divided nation when it comes to choosing a president , it has proved that democracy can work , BBC correspondent Will Ross in Accra says .
Mr Atta Mills , aged 64 , is a former vice - president .
He lost two previous elections to President Kufuor .
Mr Akufo - Addo , also 64 , from the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) won the first round of the presidential election but not by enough to avoid the run-off .
On Saturday , he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying : " I acknowledge the electoral commissioner 's declaration and congratulate Professor Mills . "
A spokesman later told the BBC that , contrary to earlier reports , he had not conceded defeat , and that the ruling party would go to court to contest the result .
The stakes have been raised in these elections because Ghana has just found oil , which is expected to start generating revenue in 2010 .

Some Facebook users are reporting that when they hover their cursors over the cover images of pages , they are seeing some of the about information for those pages .
Reader Evyatar Shpilman of VisualCommU shared the screenshot above with AllFacebook .
Readers :
Have you seen anything similar ?
Julia Fenwick became close with “ lovely uncle Bernie ” and his niece Shana in the eight years she worked as the office manager of the Madoff Securities London office .
But in the wake of her old boss ’s confession he was running a giant Ponzi scheme , their friendship has , it seems , unraveled :
Not only did Berns neglect to pay her any severance with other people ’s money , not one person from America has even called to find out how she ’s doing ( she ’s pregnant , poor , and pissed off , thank you very much ) .
So Julia did the only thing she could :
She sold the family down the river by giving a long , detailed interview to Britain ’s Daily Mail , one that presents as clear a picture of Madoff ’s personal spending habits as we ’ve seen so far .
After the jump , we break down how he spent his ill - gotten gains .
Foodstuffs : Madoff was a teetotaler , Fenwick says ; he only ever drank Diet Coke ( £ 3.60 a pint , or $ 5.23 ) .
But he had other vices .
“ Even though he is Jewish , he loves pork sausages … one of Madoff ’s favourite pastimes when visiting London was tucking into a fry - up ” ( £ 27 , or $ 39 at Brown ’s on Abermarle Street ) .
For lunch , he “ always ate the same sandwiches — cream cheese , smoked salmon and cucumber on brown bread ” ( Marks & Spencer , £ 2.20 , or $ 3.19 ) .
Clothing and Accessories : Madoff collected vintage watches ( $ 2,900 to $ 72,000 ) mainly through vintage specialist George Somlo .
He also bought wedding bands to match the color and design of each watch ( $ 525 - $ 1950 , Tiffany & Co. ) .
During his two or three visits a year , Madoff would often take advantage of his office ’s proximity to Savile Row by asking his tailors , Kilgour , to see him in the boardroom ( average of $ 6,000 per suit ) .
Business Expenses : Madoff traveled in style .
According to Fenwick , he purchased a black and gray Brazilian - built Embraer Regional Jet 145 last year , at a cost of £ 20 million ( $ 29 million ) .
“ There were sofas and beds behind curtains at the back of the plane , ” she said .
“ He ’d installed a cappuccino machine [ $ 1650 ] and under all the seats were pockets full of biscuits and sweets .
Bernie ’s initials were on the front of all the crockery . ”
Once in London , Madoff liked to stay at the Lanesborough Hotel ( up to $ 11,600 a night ) .
The office was nice , too .
According to Fenwick , Madoff refurbished it last year to the tune of £ 500,000 ( $ 726,000 ) , including handmade desks and a new IT system , for £ 80,000 ( $ 116,000 ) .
In New York , she says , he also insisted on squaring off the interior of the elliptical Lipstick Building , “ which is mad ” ( cost unknown ) .
Miscellany : Madoff enjoyed Davidoff cigars ( around $ 160 a box ) .
His wife was apparently low - maintenance and enjoyed Boots No7 Protect and Perfect Beauty Serum , which retails around £ 17 in London ( $ 24 , plus shipping and handling ) .
“ It was a key part of her beauty regime , ” Fenwick says .
Partying : Last year , Fenwick attended a barbecue at Madoff ’s home in Montauk , an intimate affair with about 400 guests .
“ There was an oyster bar .
And you ’d dine on either lobster or fillet steak , ” she said .
( At least $ 1 million , or the cost of Donald Trump ’s wedding . )
Fenwick also went on a golfing trip with Madoff and a dozen of his friends for his 70th birthday , in Mexico , this past May .
“ We were all given hooded sweatshirts to mark the occasion .
His initials and the year of his birth — ‘ BLM 1938 ’ — were stitched on to them ” ( custom hoodies , from $ 39.99 , Café Press . )
According to Fenwick , he “ showed no sign of being under pressure as he lounged on the beach , singing along to his favorite Neil Diamond songs . ”
But do n’t let your blood boil over all this , investors .
The Best of Neil Diamond is only $ 8.49 on Amazon , so at least they were frugal about that .
And Fenwick says she saw Bernie and Ruth haggling over the price of silver bangles with a street vendor .
See , there ’s hope for recovery yet !
I just ca n’t live with that camera - it ’s not square …

It ’s 2009 , and although website usability practices have gotten overwhelmingly better over the past decade , there are a few slip - ups that I still see far more often than I should , even on sites designed by professional agencies .
I ’m certainly not proclaiming to be a usability guru like Jakob Nielsen , but these usability issues are easily avoided ( and wo n’t sacrifice your design ) using a little forethought , usually in the design - phase of development .
Like so many other usability issues , I suspect that many of these issues may be a result of graphic designers without extensive web experience , as the problems I ’m still seeing are problems that are specific to the online medium .
I ’m certain they are not intentional decisions , but they simply must stop .
When I started in web development , there were n’t many resources ( books , classes , etc ) for people who wanted to learn , so we sort of had to guess , and make it up as we went along .
That is no longer the case , with millions of web development usability articles and websites available online , and there just is n’t any excuse for these same problems to continue emerging .
These are just the ones I ’ve run into today , and there ’s a good chance I ’ll be adding to the list , as I tend to be easily pissed off ( as anyone who follows me on Twitter can attest to ) .
Link colors MUST be a different color than ANY other text
The fastest way to confuse a user is to obfuscate what text on the page is clickable and what is n’t .
I get it – you want to keep the same color scheme on a website .
Excellent advice .
But when you ’re designing the layout in Photoshop , you should reserve at least two colors that no other text on the site gets to use – one for unvisited link colors , and one for visited link colors .
They can ( and should ) be colors that work well with the color scheme , but they must be unique to links , period .
NO exceptions .
They can not be the same color as your headlines , they can not be the same color as your emphasis text .
They must be unique so that the user can quickly and easily recognize what text is linked .
If Link Colors Are Similar to Body Text , Leave Underlines ON
While monitors have gotten better , and graphics cards are incredible these days , people ’s eyesight and monitor configuration are two factors you simply cannot control .
On a low - contrast monitor , your users may not be able to visually pick out what text is # 000000 ( black ) and what text is # 4e1802 ( the dark brown link color on snipe.net ) .
If the colors used in your body text and the colors used in your link text are even remotely similar , leave the underlining effect on your links .
If a user is n’t sure whether the text in question is actually a link , that underline makes a difference .
If you do n’t want underlines on your links , pick a different link color .
Period .
STOP underlining text that is n’t a LINK
I do n’t see this one as often anymore , thankfully , but I still come across it at least once a week , which is once a week too damned often .
Again , this is likely a throwback from print designers , where underlining is an accepted and effective way to draw emphasis to text .
Users have been conditioned to understand that underlined text = hyperlink .
Online , the only reason text should ever be underlined is if it ’s a link .
Period .
Do n’t use initial icons as the only way to indicate section content
I still see this one a lot – on a website , there is a toolbar with icon-only navigation : a picture of an envelope to indicate “ contact ” or “ email ” , a picture of a newspaper to indicate “ news ” , and an information - booth - style letter “ i ” to indicate “ information . ”
At first glance , this makes perfect sense – except for the fact that not everyone visiting your website will be English - speaking , and the word for “ information ” does n’t start with an “ i ” in every language .
If you ’re going to use an “ i ” , at least pair it with the word “ information . ”
Unless you provide versions of your site in other languages , it can be assumed that your site visitor understands at least a little English ( and I ’m targeting this at English websites , but the same rules apply for sites written in other languages ) , so the word “ information ” will make sense to them .
People who speak multiple languages can handle seeing the word , but their brain is going to default to their own language when looking at initials .
Keep outside navigation elements far away from form elements
At my previous job in the web development department of a major newspaper , we had a back - end interface that allowed writers to publish their articles to the website .
I wish I had taken a screenshot before I left .
In the left - column of the page , there was an interface that allowed you to select a section title so that you could administer the articles within that section .
The section names were all in a dropdown menu ( which makes sense ) , with a “ go ” button to the right .
Directly below that dropdown menu was a link that brought the user back to the admin home .
I cannot tell you how many times I accidentally clicked on that link while working with the admin .
Absolutely aggravating , and completely avoidable if the developer had put just an iota of thought into it .
If your site has a login for members or customers , do n’t hide the link
In most cases , members or customers are a website ’s bread and butter .
They are content contributors or paying customers who return to your site regularly – and they pay your bills , whether it ’s through ad revenue or a paid service .
Two websites I use often , Constant Contact and Paytrust , used to have large login / register boxes on their homepage that was easy for returning visitors to find .
For some reason that is completely beyond me , they have since moved things around , so that the only way to login is to locate the tiny link in the top - right of the screen .
For a returning user , this was maddening .
I had to actually search around on the page just to find the option to login for services I am paying for !
As a returning visitor , the only reason I have to be at that site is to use the services that I can only access after logging in .
Their non -login content is useless to me – its not like a news site that offers some content to unregistered users and premium content to registered users or customers .
I ’d like to find the designers responsible for that move and kick them in the ass .
Do n’t make people hunt down the one part of your website that pays your bills .
I still really hate dynamic dropdown menus .
A lot .
I know they ’ve become more universally accepted over the years , but I really , really hate them .
They are almost always poorly implemented , and very often interfere with forms or flash elements on the page if the developer did not use the proper z - index .
They are hard to control , and require me to really pay attention to where I ’m putting the mouse , especially if they ( god forbid ) have subcategory options .
I find them clumsy , and a cop-out , and refuse to believe that a better design with a little more thought could not have solved the navigation problem .
( My philosophy was a major point of contention between myself and the powers that be at the aforementioned major newspaper , who uses dynamic dropdowns . )
Stop changing the size of my freaking browser window
If your website relies on a specific browser window size , you are made of fail .
If you resize my browser window without my permission , I will leave your site before your 900 meg flash movie has even finished loading .
I will wish bad things for you and your family , and you will certainly never , ever , ever have me as a customer .
Enough with the no-right - click javascript
Again , I state – it ’s 2009 .
If I want to steal your content , I will , and you will not be able to stop me .
I will use a website ripping application and download it directly to my hard drive , I will disable javascript in Firefox ( rendering your pathetic script useless ) , I will use cmd+c to bypass the right - click , I will screenshot your images , or one of any other additional ways to get around it .
One thing you can be guaranteed – I will leave your website angry and never come back .
The funny thing is , I was n’t even trying to steal your content .
I was trying to right + click to open another page of your site in a new tab , so I could come back to it after I was finished with the page I was on .
Stop linking to the same place using different navigation
This is yet another one that comes from my former place of business .
In their dynamic dropdown menu ( kill me now , seriously ) , in the Contact section , they had a link to “ about us ” , a link to “ contact us ” , and a link to “ submit an editorial ” – all going to the exact same place .
This issue does n’t stick in my craw as much as many of the other ones on this list , but it does still piss me off .
Navigation elements should always be very clear as to where they go .
A returning visitor who clicks on one of the links within the Contact Us section already knows they cannot ultimately trust what the labels say , and they know they are going to have to search further on the page they get to in order to find exactly what they want .
Lame .
Stop playing audio when I load your website
Is it 1998 again ?
For the love of all that is holy , do not auto - play video with audio when I load the page , and stay the hell away from those abhorrent “ talking avatars ” and “ talking video ads ” that pop up in the lower part of many news websites .
Maybe I ’m browsing your website at work , or in the library , or maybe I have my speakers waaay up because I was listening to a four - hour marathon of 80 ’s hair metal .
Whatever my situation , you ’ve now pissed me off and I ’m closing the browser tab and your site with it .
* click *
Now I will never even know what you were trying to sell me .
Do we really need “ reset ” form buttons anymore ?
On short forms , I guess I can understand – but on long , involved forms ?
What user suddenly realizes that they accidentally filled in every single form field incorrectly and they need to start over ?
What will happen for more often is that because you out the “ reset ” button too close to the “ submit ” button , a user intending to submit your form has just wiped all of their data .
Congrats .
I KNOW that ’s not all of them , but those are the ones that pissed me off today .
What pisses you off ?
Leave your peeves in the comments .
If you ’re a developer or designer , you may want to check out webpagesthatsuck.com – these guys have been around forever , and while many of their top picks are painfully obvious ( to the point of probably not needing to be mentioned ) , they do show great examples of a few of the more nuanced usability issues .
Also check out Usability Post for common mistakes , and practical solutions .
These guys really tackle the nuance stuff , and give clear examples of how it could have been done better .
On the other end of this spectrum , it can be easy to get caught up in obsessing about usability , and lamenting the fact that your company cannot afford formal usability testing for every ( or any ) websites you produce .
The thing is , you can .
One trick I ’ve used in the past is to park myself and a laptop at a local Starbucks .
I would approach customers , asking them if they would take 5 minutes to look at the site and tell me what they thought , in return for a 5 - dollar Starbucks giftcard .
You should , of course , clear this with Starbucks before trying it , but since you ’re buying giftcards , they usually wo n’t say no .
I ’ve found that watching the user ’s reactions can often be as valuable as what comes out of their mouth .
If you ’ve got a little more dough , but not enough for formal usability testing , check out Morae , which lets you use cheap webcams to set up a complete usability lab in your office without fancy equipment or one - way glass .
For about $ 3,000 , you can purchase their entire suite ( base software runs $ 1,500 ) and you can use it again and again .
An application that allows iPhone users to wobble a pair of breasts has been rejected by Apple 's application store , denying iPhone geeks the nearest thing to sex they 'll get this holiday season .
The application was rejected on the grounds of " objectionable content " , though with the caveat : " If you believe that you can make the necessary changes so that iBoobs does not violate the iPhone SDK Agreement we encourage you to do so . "
Though it 's hard to see how that would n't detract from the core proposition :
The app was developed by Mystic Game Development , and we have to accept the possibility that it was done just to demonstrate their character animation middleware - in which case we can only congratulate them on a job well done .
Apple is , of course , missing a trick here : a small tweak ( ahem ) would allow the most enthusiastic vibration to cause the Bulgarian airbags to burst their restraints .
Even the rumour of such a feature would no doubt sell a lot of replacement iPhones - in fact , a rumour might work better .
Some of the more seasoned Reg hacks reckon this is a rip off of an early DOS application that offered much the same functionality , only using mouse prods rather than tilt functions , so perhaps Apple was more worried about copyright infringement than upsetting the masses . ®
In the bowels of BFI Southbank , the National Film Theatre as was , I am sitting in a viewing cubicle in a whole corridor - full of viewing cubicles , wading through a pile of video cassettes and DVDs .
Some are of appalling quality , the picture flaring up at the edges and with almost inaudible sound , but most are exactly as they would have appeared when first broadcast on the nation 's black - and - white television sets in the Fifties and Sixties .
Welcome to this year 's harvest of rediscovered TV in the British Film Institute 's Missing Believed Wiped initiative , which , introduced by expert speakers , will receive a public showcasing on the South Bank this Sunday , 14 December .
" Missing Believed Wiped has been running for 15 years now , " says the BFI 's TV programmer Dick Fiddy .
" It began with an earlier BFI initiative called ' Missing Believed Lost ' , which helped to find British films from the silent era and the early talkies .
I thought that we should extend this to television . "
And the first two decades of British television are in dire need of preservation for , as Fiddy explains : " Either it went out live and was n't recorded in the first place , or the video tapes it was shot on were simply re-used .
This capacity for being recycled was ironically the great selling point to broadcasters at the time , " says Fiddy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Other programmes disappeared into skips , warehouses and private homes .
" I knew that a lot of television had survived in odd places , " says Fiddy .
" It had been in the wrong archives , or in the hands of private collectors , or in the hands of people who used to work in television and who had taken copies home with them , never realising the rarity of what they had .
Now , year after year , we get enough material coming out of the woodwork to hold an annual review . "
This year 's Missing Believed Wiped review contains tapes presented to the BFI by TV presenter David Hamilton , aka David " Diddy " Hamilton " , and from the late Bob Monkhouse .
Hamilton 's offering was a recording of the valedictory final night 's broadcast by ABC , the ITV regional franchise holder from 1956 to 1968 that was not only responsible for beauty pageants from Prestatyn and " the first live pictures from the Isle of Man " , but also for such television gold as The Avengers and Armchair Theatre .
There 's a fascinating glimpse on Hamilton 's ABC retrospective of an Emmy - winning Armchair Theatre production called Call Me Daddy , with Donald Pleasence and Judy Cornwell .
Most Armchair
Theatres have however been lost .
" Probably the most fabled missing drama is Philip Saville 's Madhouse on Castle Street , which starred Bob Dylan in 1963 – very early in his career , " says Dick Fiddy .
Music shows are also particularly vulnerable , with whole swathes of Juke Box Juries , Thank Your Lucky Stars and Top of the Pops from the Sixties seemingly consigned to oblivion .
Fortunately , the BFI has found that a lot of the programmes have survived abroad , where their origins are n't initially recognised .
" Some performances were sold internationally to other shows and we 've managed to get those back , " says Fiddy .
" Twenty - five or 30 years down the line a German or a Swedish broadcaster might realise that a three - minute pop song they thought was produced earlier was actually from Top of the Pops .
There are researchers who can look at a performance and know instantly that it 's Top of the Pops or Ready Steady Go , or Oh Boy ! . "
The estate of Bob Monkhouse has provided two of the programmes in this year 's Missing Believed Wiped review : The Flipside , a BBC Thirty - Minute Theatre from 1966 , with Monkhouse in a rare straight role and an American accent , and a risqué episode from his 1957 sitcom My Pal Bob , in which Monkhouse and writing partner Denis Goodwin tried to emulate the style of the long - running Lucille Ball hit I Love Lucy on British TV .
" Monkhouse was a supporter of Missing Believed Wiped and even introduced the event one year , " says Fiddy .
" During conversations afterwards he intimated that he had some missing TV within his collection – missing Sunday Nights at the London Palladium , and this play The Flipside , which he said he'd give to us .
Unfortunately , he died before handing them over .
Obviously , there 's a hiatus when somebody passes on – you can't go knocking on the widow 's door the next day .
But you can't leave it too long in case they start throwing stuff away .
I once tried to get the BFI to come up with a donor card for people with huge collections ... "
The family of the late Alistair Sim also approached the BFI , with a 15 - minute gem dating back to 1952 in which Sim , sitting increasingly uncomfortably in a wing - backed leather armchair , delivers a monologue to camera about the difficulties of delivering a monologue to camera .
Unlike the rather cheesy Monkhouse sitcom , this is genuinely funny stuff , decades before Alan Bennett 's TV monologues or Ronnie Corbett asked us whether we were sitting comfortably .
And it wittily goes to the heart of the relationship between TV performer and the viewers " staring at me like a multitude of expectant ghosts " .
Also eye - catching is a rediscovered series called Chelsea at Eight , found by an archivist among a collection of travelogues .
This 1950s Granada precursor to Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was filmed in the then bohemian London neighbourhood of Chelsea , in which anybody passing through was dragged into a makeshift studio .
Among the finds are Billie Holiday singing " Strange Fruit " and John Osborne reading from one of his plays .
The same archivist also discovered a pile of " admags " – a part of television history thought to have become extinct .
" Advertising magazines , or ' admags ' , were outlawed in the early Sixties , " explains the BFI 's Dick Fiddy .
" They were a 15 - minute semi- soap opera in which stars – Katie Boyle was omnipresent – soft - sell goods .
They were believed to be rather too insidious .
They were well done and popular and very few existed until recently . "
Also unearthed were a whole collection – from someone who used to make them – of BBC trailers from the 1960s .
" That sort of nitty gritty of television – the continuity shorts , the flotsam and jetsam between the programmes – are the sort of thing that do n't usually survive , " says Fiddy .
" It gives you a much better idea of what Sixties television actually looked like . "
But this year 's Missing Believed Wiped is going beyond the usual remit of showing freshly rediscovered television – it is also getting into the business of restoration .
More particularly it is showcasing a new process whereby old TV programmes filmed in colour but shown in black and white , like some early episodes of Doctor Who , Dad 's Army and Top of the Pops , can be now be shown in colour .
" The black - and - white tele - recordings actually carry colour information in the form of dots and BBC boffins have worked out a way of reversing the process , " explains Fiddy .
" This is the first public demonstration . "
Actually , the BFI is being pre-empted by BBC2 , which on Saturday night will be screening a remastered episode of Dad's Army that has n't been seen in colour for almost 40 years .
" This initiative could become commercially important , if you look at some of the early Doctor Whos that only exist in black and white .
It could also become culturally important if you look at something like Nigel Kneale 's 1968 drama The Year of the Sex Olympics , which was made in glorious colour and whose colourful sets and costumes are part of the plot .
" It 's not a gimmick .
This is not colourisation .
Colourisation was always naff because if something was shot in black - and - white , it was lit for black - and - white , it was costumed for black - and - white .
If something was made for colour and you are just putting the colour back then you 're retrieving it .
Meanwhile , the BFI 's annual event is encouraging more and more hitherto presumed lost television footage back into the open .
" We 've had to cull heavily all the available new material , " says Fiddy , who adds that the BFI also now runs impromptu events during the rest of the year .
" We had a hugely successful screening of something called The Complete and Utter History of Britain , which was Palin and Jones 's last sketch show before Python , and which was very Pythonesque – three episodes now survive of that .
We showed that to a packed house at NFT1 .
" Our audiences are a mix of enthusiastic amateurs , professionals from the business , archivists and collectors – it's almost like a convention . "
But private collectors can be a paranoid bunch , he says , who sometimes need " handling with kid gloves " .
Fiddy is as anxious to reassure them .
" At one time , people were reluctant to come forward because they thought they'd be prosecuted , for whatever reason .
But the BBC and ITV over the past 15 or 20 years have been much more enlightened about that – they are just anxious to get the stuff back . "
' Dad 's Army in Colour ' is on BBC2 on 13 December at 8.25 pm ; Missing Believed Wiped is at the BFI Southbank ( www.bfi.org.uk ) on 14 December

Ex-con robbed bank again , police say SAN FRANCISCO
A woman recently released after serving time in federal prison for a series of San Francisco bank robberies held up one of the same banks she targeted the first time around , authorities said .
Elisa Monique Lipkins , 42 , will appear in U.S. District Court in San Francisco this week on a complaint charging her with robbing the Bank of America at 3565 California St. of $ 7,020 last month .
Lipkins tried to rob the same bank during a 2004 robbery spree that led to a 70 - month federal prison sentence and an order to pay nearly $ 16,000 in restitution .
She served part of that sentence and was released to a halfway house on MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland , court records show .
On Dec. 23 , Lipkins checked out of the halfway house shortly after 8 a.m. and showed up at the bank three hours later , FBI Special Agent Brian Guy wrote in an affidavit .
She handed a teller a deposit slip on which was written , " All the money " and told her , " Do n't touch the alarm , do not press the alarm ! "
Guy wrote .
The robber kept her right hand in her jacket pocket , apparently simulating a weapon , and then said , " Give me the big bills , do it now , " according to the affidavit .
The teller began counting out the bills very slowly , prompting the robber to grab the money , Guy wrote .
Another FBI agent and a halfway - house employee recognized Lipkins on a bank - surveillance photo , and she was arrested at the halfway house , Guy said .
Lipkins is being held without bail at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin .

Rod Blagojevich has been ousted as Illinois governor after being convicted of abusing his powers .
Mr Blagojevich said he was " saddened and disappointed " by the verdict but " not at all surprised " and would fight to clear his name .
He was charged with trying to sell the seat vacated by Barack Obama when he was elected president .
In a second vote , Mr Blagojevich was banned from holding public office in Illinois for life .
He had been arrested in December and faces a criminal trial over bribes allegedly taken during his two terms .
No other Illinois governor has been impeached , let alone convicted in a Senate trial .
Mr Blagojevich has now been replaced as governor by Patrick Quinn , a fellow Democrat and the state 's lieutenant governor .
' Blago show ' goes on Senators voted 59 - 0 against him after an impeachment hearing , despite his claim that he had " done nothing wrong " and there was no evidence of a crime .
After being sworn in , Mr Quinn told the senate " the ordeal is over " .
He said the elected representatives had " reflected the will of the people " .
" Now it 's our job to call upon the people of Illinois to make the sacrifices necessary to address the serious challenges we have before us , " Mr Quinn said .
' No evidence ' Speaking outside his home after the senate hearing , Mr Blagojevich said he " obviously saddened and disappointed , but not at all surprised by what the state senate did today " .
He told reporters he was grateful for having had the opportunity to " get up every day to fight for average , ordinary people " .
" I love the people of Illinois today more than I ever have before , " he said , to which a person in the crowd shouted back : " We love you too ! "
Mr Blagojevich had addressed his trial on Thursday in a last - minute bid to save his position , having earlier said he would not take any part .
He told senators : " There is no evidence that shows there was any wrongdoing by me as governor . "
He expressed annoyance that he was not able to bring his own witnesses .
The new Governor , Patrick Quinn , foresees " serious challenges "
He said President Barack Obama 's chief - of - staff Rahm Emanuel was one witness he would have liked to question , but rules prevented him from doing so .
He appealed to senators , at the end of the four - day trial , to consider his position , saying : " Think if you were innocent and rushed out of office .
" A crime has not been proven .
How can you throw a governor out of office with incomplete evidence ? "
But his speech appeared to have little effect on the senators .
" I sort of looked at him as a magician and we 've all been wowed .
But all the magic is gone , " one senator told the Chicago Tribune .
" I am immune to his speech giving , because we 've seen those tricks before .
He can look sincere , he gives a good speech and he 's a good performer .
Perhaps he can get a job in the arts , " she said .
FBI evidence Since Mr Blagojevich was arrested last month , he has persistently denied the charges against him and has refused to resign .
CHARGES AGAINST BLAGOJEVICH
Federal agents say Mr Blagojevich
Tried to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official actions
Tried to use state funds for the private purpose of inducing the Tribune Company to fire Chicago Tribune editorial board members critical of him Tried to obtain personal financial benefits for himself in return for his appointment of a US senator
Profile : Rod Blagojevich Q&A : The Blagojevich scandal
There is no trial date set in the criminal case .
" If I thought I had done something wrong I would have resigned in December , " he told senators .
" I did n't resign then and I 'm not resigning now because I have done nothing wrong . "
He says he is the victim of a political vendetta .
Impeachment prosecutor David Ellis , in his rebuttal , emphasised that Mr Blagojevich had refused to appear under oath to answer questions , opting instead to make a closing speech .
In his closing remarks , Mr Ellis said : " The evidence showed that throughout his tenure as governor , the governor has abused the power of his office and put his own interest above the interest of the people . "
The impeachment followed an investigation by a 21 - member committee of Illinois legislators , which looked at testimony from FBI agents who wiretapped phone calls to and from the governor 's office about who should fill President Obama 's seat .
It is alleged the conversations show that Mr Blagojevich was trying to use the seat to get himself or his wife a job .
Mr Blagojevich is the first US governor to be impeached in more than 20 years , after Arizona 's Governor Evan Mecham was removed from office in 1988 .
Four of Illinois ' past eight governors have faced criminal charges and Mr Blagojevich 's predecessor , George Ryan , is currently serving a jail sentence for corruption .

Paradox of Plenty
While Africa is blessed with much natural wealth — gold , diamonds , ores from tin to uranium , oil and ivory — it has also long been a target for plunder .
Listen to Ian Fisher recount how some , mostly outsiders , built great fortunes off of Africa 's material riches — and for centuries its people as well — while it remained the poorest continent in the world .
Mr Grieve said people could even be arrested in Britain for something which is not a criminal offence , or be whisked away to face punishment abroad after being tried in their absence ,
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N has agreed to transfer $ 28.1 million from an account of confessed swindler Bernard Madoff 's investment firm to pay for liquidation costs , according to court papers .
Irving Picard , the trustee of the Securities Investor Protection Corp overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , “ is in urgent need of funding for immediate costs of administration , ” the December 26 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said .
It said the agreement called for $ 29 million held in the bank ’s account , minus $ 883,978 already transferred for employee pay and healthcare coverage , to be wired to the trustee .
A Bank of New York Mellon Corp representative said the bank was not exposed to Madoff but the investment adviser held an account with the bank .
A hearing was scheduled for Tuesday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland to approve the agreement .
Two weeks ago , another judge ordered liquidation of the firm under the Securities Investor Protection Corp , a nonprofit group created by Congress in 1970 .
A lawyer for the trustee was not available to comment .
Madoff ’s lawyer was not available to comment .
In another move in bankruptcy court , the trustee is taking steps to sell the market - maker business run by Madoff , who was arrested and charged with securities fraud on December 11 after authorities said Madoff told them he had been operating a “ Ponzi ” scheme for years with estimated losses of $ 50 billion .
The court gave approval to the trustee this week to share confidential information with potential buyers of the firm .
A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients .
Madoff ’s dealings ensnared rich people , banks and charities all over the world .
The exact amount of money lost by Madoff is not yet known , but investigators may have a better idea of his firm ’s worth by Wednesday .
On December 18 , a U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan ordered Madoff to provide a verified written accounting of his firm ’s records to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by December 31 .
These include “ all assets , liabilities and property , bank accounts , brokerage accounts , investments , business interests , loans and lines of credit ” according to the order in the civil case brought by the SEC .
Madoff , 70 , who has not appeared in court to answer the criminal complaint , is confined to his Manhattan apartment 24 hours a day with security cameras trained on the doors “ to prevent harm or flight ” according to a court order .
The cases :
USA v. Madoff 08-02735 , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan )
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Madoff et al 08-10791 , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan )
Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , 08-01789 , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
Is your subway system a platform ?
Monday , December 08 , 2008 by Dave Winer .
Does it have an API ?
Funny thought perhaps , or maybe only in the Bay Area -- but our subway system -- BART , has an API .
And it 's kind of fun .
I spent a couple of hours today hacking together an application , it 's not all that useful , but one of these days something else will get an API that plugs in nicely and something interesting will happen .
Here are the docs for the BART API .
And the docs for the real - time ETA feed .
And the ETA feed itself .
Clearly it 's a straight dump of the database of the BART trains that are running right now , and the time of their expected arrival at the various stations on the network .
I wrote an app that loads the XML into a database on my server once a minute , it 's quite quick -- and then it looks for trains that are arriving right now , and sends a tweet saying something like : " The train to Richmond is arriving at the Downtown Berkeley BART station . "
This would generate far too many tweets to be humane , no one in their right mind would want to follow a user that was announcing the arrivals of every train in every station on the BART network , which is n't even that big a network .
You can imagine what a PITA that app would be for a subway system like NY or London .
Not cool .
So instead I had it only report on trains arriving from any direction at the three Berkeley BART stations , Ashby , Downtown and North Berkeley .
That 's a manageable number of tweets .
And that suggested a name for the feed : Berkeley Bart .
Which sounds like something from a cowboy cartoon or a Henry Fonda western starring Jimmy Stewart and Raquel Welch with Buddy Hackett as the kooky sidekick .
Okay enough of that .
It 's a cute little thing , nothing earth - shaking , but I wonder if it 's correct .
Next time I 'm at a Berkeley BART station I 'll check it out and see if it correctly calls the arrivals of trains .
Also it seems like just the thing Scoble will like .
He 's into trains and Twitter and really strange things .
I 've also set it up so it works with FriendFeed .

My most recent trivia on Twitter .
By Phil Mercer
BBC News , Perth
As the United States celebrates its first African - American president , the people of another former British colony , Australia , are wondering whether they will ever have their own home - grown head of state .
The issue of a republic is brewing again amid mounting pressure on the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to say when Australians can vote on constitutional reform .
The idea that Queen Elizabeth II should be replaced by an Australian president was enthusiastically endorsed by delegates at Mr Rudd 's recent 2020 Summit , which invited 1,000 of the nation 's brightest minds to Canberra to debate pressing public concerns .
The prime minister is expected to respond within weeks to their suggestions and those agitating for change believe that the Labor leader must set out a timetable for a referendum .
Six models " It 's really about identity and dignity , " explained Grant Jordan , Western Australian convenor of the Australian Republican Movement .
I love the Queen , I love what she stands for
Steve Amphlett
" It is a bit debasing when you have a situation where a British child born into a particular family can one day become the head of state of your country yet no Australian child can ever become head of state of Australia no matter what he or she achieves in life . "
Australia is a constitutional monarchy and it is a decade since the country rejected wholesale reform at the last referendum , thanks in large part to the type of republic on offer , which would have seen a president appointed by parliament and not by the people .
Republicans believe that up to six different models should be put to the popular vote in a plebiscite , with the most favoured then subjected to a referendum .
Hot topic
On a sweltering evening in the northern Perth suburb of Joondalup , home to legions of British migrants , opinion on the issue at the local soccer club was as fierce as some of the tackles at the start of pre-season training .
It 's nice she 's a titular head of state but I 'm not so sure in today 's world it 's really necessary
Alan Vest " I love the Queen , I love what she stands for , " declared club president Steve Amphlett , a salesman originally from Stoke - on - Trent .
" I do n't see Australia as a republic . "
Neither did John Higgins , a bricklayer from Birmingham who emigrated to Perth 18 years ago .
" The monarchy should stay in Australia , " he told the BBC .
" If you speak to the majority of the English here , they really want it to stay as it is . "
Joondalup 's soccer coach , Alan Vest , a Yorkshire - born former New Zealand international - whose name may be familiar to older supporters of Barnsley and Rochdale - believes though that constitutional change in Australia is inevitable .
" My mother 's a monarchist .
She 's mad about the Queen .
It 's nice she 's a titular head of state but I 'm not so sure in today 's world it 's really necessary . "
Asian orientation Republicans have estimated that up to 85 % of Australians support their cause , among them both the Prime Minister and leader of the conservative opposition .
The driver of this Perth car makes his royal allegiance clear Joondalup club veteran Adrian Kenny , 46 , who moved from Stafford when he was seven , said that although his adopted home should treasure its rich British history , it was time to move on .
" I think the Queen 's for England , " he told BBC News .
" I just think Australia is an old enough country to be the master of its own destiny .
We are becoming more Asian - orientated and there are more Asian people in Australia and they have no affiliation with the UK . "
The republic debate in Australia is always passionate and both sides are promising a forceful campaign when the next referendum eventually comes around .
Neil Gilmore , the Australian Monarchists League representative in Western Australia , remains adamant that voters will favour the status quo .
" The notable thing about Mr Rudd 's enthusiasm for a republic is the fact that the people of Australia do n't share it , " he insisted .
" We do n't want a republic .
We 've had stability and prosperity .
Everything that we could want we get from our wonderful system of government . "

More news today from the turbulent world of medical debt .
Minnesota 's attorney general is suing the biggest hospital system in the Twin Cities , alleging that Allina Hospitals & Clinics is violating a state law by charging patients excessive interest on unpaid bills .
" Allina has dug a deeper financial hole for patients facing tough economic times by charging usurious interest rates of up to 18 percent on medical bills , " AG Lori Swanson said in a statement .
The ...
It was not precisely lip - synching , but pretty close .
The somber , elegiac tones before President Obama ’s oath of office at the inauguration on Tuesday came from the instruments of Yo - Yo Ma , Itzhak Perlman and two colleagues .
But what the millions on the Mall and watching on television heard was in fact a recording , made two days earlier by the quartet and matched tone for tone by the musicians playing along .
The players and the inauguration organizing committee said the arrangement was necessary because of the extreme cold and wind during Tuesday ’s ceremony .
The conditions raised the possibility of broken piano strings , cracked instruments and wacky intonation minutes before the president ’s swearing in ( which had problems of its own ) .
“ Truly , weather just made it impossible , ” Carole Florman , a spokeswoman for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies , said on Thursday .
“ No one ’s trying to fool anybody .
This is n’t a matter of Milli Vanilli , ” Ms. Florman added , referring to the pop band that was stripped of a 1989 Grammy because the duo did not sing on their album and lip - synched in concerts .
Ms. Florman said that the use of a recording was not disclosed beforehand but that the NBC producers handling the television pool were told of its likelihood the day before .

The biggest chunk of the industry - video sales and rentals - accounts for almost 30 % of the pie , or $ 3.62 billion , according to AVN .
And it 's a business that , like it or not , influences other businesses .
Remember the format wars between VHS and Betamax or , more recently , Blu - Ray and HD DVD ?

Advertisement Thousands of demonstrators have marched through London to call for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza .
The protest started peacefully but there were confrontations as police tried to move demonstrators away from the gates of the Israeli embassy .
The windows of a Starbucks was smashed and three police officers were injured as a minority of people threw missiles .
The Metropolitan Police says 20,000 people marched but the BBC estimates the figure could be as high as 50,000 .
It is estimated there were several hundred police officers dealing with around 200 protesters outside the embassy .
This group were being allowed to leave the cordon one at a time , some were being identified by police and are being taken away for questioning .
BBC correspondent Robert Hall said given the number of people involved , the protest had been peaceful .
" But as darkness fell a small number of people , several hundred , have begun confronting police and missiles have been thrown , " he said .
" Although these are ugly and unwelcome scenes , they do not represent what has happened for most of the afternoon . "
' Irresponsible actions ' Metropolitan Police Commander Bob Broadhurst said : " We are very disappointed by the irresponsible actions of those who have challenged police by ripping apart security barriers and throwing objects at them .
" A hard core of demonstrators are undermining the cause of the vast majority of people on this demonstration , who are law - abiding citizens wishing to protest peacefully . "
Approximately 15 people have been arrested , 12 for violent disorder ; one for aggravated trespass ; and two for assaulting a police officer .
' Half hearted '
The march was organised by groups including Stop the War Coalition , the British Muslim Initiative and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign .
Protests have also taken place in Edinburgh , Aberdeen , Belfast , Newcastle and Southampton .
There would have been outrage from governments around the world if this had happened anywhere else - the condemnation has been at best half - hearted

Stop the War

In Edinburgh around 300 shoes were thrown towards the US consulate by protesters and three police officers suffered minor injuries .
Celebrities including musicians Brian Eno and Annie Lennox joined the march .
Rallies were addressed by speakers including Eno , former London mayor Ken Livingstone and Cherie Blair 's half - sister Lauren Booth .
Lindsey German , Stop the War 's convenor , said : " We are calling for an end to the massacre and for Israel to get out of Gaza and Palestine .
" We want the British government to take a much stronger position .
There would have been outrage from governments around the world if this had happened anywhere else - the condemnation has been at best half - hearted . "
Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said in a statement : " The British government and European Union have the economic leverage to stop this carnage .
" They must take decisive action to force Israel to end the slaughter . "
On Sunday , the Board of Deputies of British Jews will also hold a rally calling for peace in Israel and Gaza in Trafalgar Square .
The conflict in Gaza is entering its third week , despite international calls for a ceasefire .
Israel said it launched 40 overnight air strikes , while Hamas militants fired several rockets at Israeli towns .
Senior Palestinian officials are in Egypt for talks on how to end the conflict .
Health officials in Gaza say more than 800 Palestinians have died .
Israel says 13 Israelis have been killed .

THE Israel Defence Forces are investigating claims that a soldier shot dead two Palestinian sisters without provocation and critically injured a third during the three - week military offensive in Gaza .
The girls ' father , Khalid Abed Rabbo , told The Age that on January 7 , three Israeli tanks approached his home on the outskirts of the Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City .

He said a soldier in one of the tanks used a megaphone to order everyone to evacuate the house .
" There were 25 of us in the house , so we started to come outside as we were instructed , " Mr Abed Rabbo said .
The past decade has seen a huge wave of pension closures A quarter of major private sector firms expect to close their final salary pension schemes to existing members in the next few years , a survey suggests .
Many companies have already closed their schemes to new members , saying they are too expensive to finance .
But barring current contributors will become more common , says the National Association of Pension Funds , which is pressing for more government help .
It found 25 of the 100 firms which replied to its study expected to do so .
' Death knell '
Final salary schemes , which offer guaranteed benefits to members , are facing pressure from plunging stock markets , falling interest rates and growing life expectancy .
The latest estimate of total company pension deficits is nearly £ 200 bn .
Over the next few years the onus will be on personal responsibility rather than the company taking responsibility
Mark Wood , ex-Prudential UK chief

Many final salary schemes have already closed to new recruits - not much more than a quarter of private sector employers still hold them open .
But the NAPF 's finding that some of Britain 's biggest private companies , employing tens of thousands of workers , are planning to close them to existing members points to a new trend .
Ros Altmann , a former government adviser , said the " death knell " had been sounded for the final salary pension system .
" Employees cannot afford to fund these long term , open - ended commitments anymore , " she said .
Closing schemes open to new members will be more likely because of the credit crunch , according to the NAPF survey .
The most recent official figures showed that 2,240 of the 8,490 private sector final salary schemes ( 26 % ) in the UK were open to new members .

So far , only a small minority of final salary pension schemes have been closed to existing members , with Rentokil being among the most high profile firms to do so .
When such a scheme is closed , members are generally told they can no longer contribute and must pay into another scheme instead - which is cheaper for the firm .
Pension savings which have already been accrued are protected , but contributions made to the new fund tend to be more risky as they are tied to financial markets , rather than salary .
There is also the potential for people to save less , because when taken out of a final salary scheme , workers have discretion over how much they put aside .
Shut out Former UK chief executive of the Prudential , Mark Wood , who now runs the Paternoster pensions business , told the BBC that more people being shut out of their final salary pension scheme was " almost inevitable in the current economic crisis " .
If we are serious about giving everyone a decent income in retirement , we must end the over - reliance on private occupational pension schemes which are governed by a volatile stock market
Joe Harris , NPC
" The impact could be very dramatic depending on someone 's age and where they are in the career , " he said .
" Over the next few years , the onus will be on personal responsibility rather than the company taking responsibility .
" People will have to take guidance on how much money to set aside .
With low interest rates , the amount of money you need to pay into a pension is far greater than it was a year ago . "
Joe Harris , general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention , said a " living state pension " was the best security in old age .
" If we are serious about giving everyone a decent income in retirement , we must end the over - reliance on private occupational pension schemes which are governed by a volatile stock market , " he said .
Collective deficit
In 2007 , open and closed , private sector final salary schemes had 2.7 million members - and 47 % of those people were in schemes open to new members .
The collective deficit of the UK 's final salary pension schemes hit £ 195bn in December , according to the official pension scheme safety net .
The Pension Protection Fund ( PPF ) said the deficit rose by 43 % from the £ 136bn recorded at the end of November .
The deterioration in their finances since then has been largely due to the international credit crunch , the worldwide economic slowdown and the accompanying slump in share prices .
This has gone alongside poorer returns on bonds , which are used to calculate the value of the assets that pension schemes need to be able to pay pensions in the future .
Last month , both the PPF and the Pensions Regulator warned that final salary schemes were becoming riskier .
They pointed to both the declining value of scheme assets and the increasing possibility that more firms will go bust in the next year or so , leaving a hole in their pension funds .
But despite the huge wave of pension scheme closures seen in the UK in the past decade or so , nearly 29,000 schemes of all types were still open to new members last year .

I 've been cooking up an end - of - year blog post , feeling like my 35th year was one of the best so far .
I 've been unbelievably fortunate to spend quite a lot of it traveling the world to tell people about The Commons on Flickr .
I 've spoken in front of hundreds of people , sat in meetings in the bowels of museums , pored over a photographic archive in person , sent a ton of emails that I enjoyed writing ( wtf ? ) , met too many fascinating people to list , made lots of new friends , and been honestly excited about what I 'm doing .
After giving the opening keynote at the National Digital Forum in Auckland on November 27 , then presenting at the Powerhouse Museum and the National Library of Australia , visiting with Commons members the State Library of New South Wales and the Australian War Memorial , I headed to Taipei for an exciting Culturemondo Roundtable event I was invited to attend .
This Wednesday , I shook the hand of the Vice President of Taiwan , who was at the opening .
The next day I presented with Seb Chan , about our take on " Search & Find . "
That evening we all went to a lovely dinner at one of the best Taiwanese joints in Taipei .
( Thanks to Tien Sing , Shadiral , Christina and Aleksandra for being such entertaining dinner conversation . )
Then off for a wander in one of the massive night markets .
I decided to jump in a cab back to the hotel with Jackie from NZ Live and Jock from Te Ara .
It took a slightly long way home , we suspected .
When I got up to my room , I saw a text message from my manager , asking if he could call me on Friday at 9 am .
I wrote back to say I was going to be on a bus full of people at that time , and that I was awake now if he wanted to call .
The phone rang .
" I 'll just get straight to the point .
You 've been affected by the layoffs .
" He told me he was reading from a script he was required to follow , and that he needed an address to send some sort of " Agreement " to me in Australia , and needed it sent back by December 19 .
Before I 'd even finished the call , I twittered ( to my private account ) : " Wow .
I just got fired . "
I was immediately distressed .
I stayed up until about 2:30 am that night , chain smoking and talking to friends who saw my tweet and had responded - THANK YOU .
I sent a formal request for time to transition The Commons program to whoever is to take it over : " A week should do it , " I said .
It was denied .
( It would be unfair to give anyone affected by the lay - offs special treatment . )
It 's not just my treatment I worry about here .
Such a sudden movement makes it especially hard to continue the program effectively , at least for a while .
So silly .
I sent a few tersely helpful emails before my email account was closed .
Could n't resist .
Finally needed sleep .
I woke up fairly early Friday and was immediately awake and tired .
I got up and jumped on my laptop .
I was very upset .
The speed of the lay - off began to sting .
I asked Seb to cover for me at the conference .
I could n't find my brave face - Sent a quick , unsatisfying goodbye to the team .
I watched as my access to various parts of the guts of Flickr fell away .
I noticed how naturally I searched for any and all bits I could think of , just in the hope that it still existed .
But no .
I was shut out entirely within about 14 hours of the phone call .
Support from friends kept coming -. I spoke with my mum and dad .
Very upset .
Watched The Net .
It is that bad , but I did n't care .
Ate some odd Taiwanese baked goods .
Run out of smokes .
I declined Seb 's kind nudges to head out with the conference peeps for dinner .
I just could n't face the idea of being cheered up .
I was beginning to feel humiliated , particularly given what I was up to .
You know , being in Taiwan at an international conference to talk about my work .
Stayed in .
All day .
Plus , I 'd cried so much I looked like a boxer who'd just woken up the day after a fight .
Not exactly game face .
Realised I had n't made it out of Denial yet .
Packed to leave .
Had to wake up at 3:00 am to get to the airport .
Woke up on time .
Was given some fruit by the people at the front desk - what a nice gesture !
Drove for an hour through the empty Taipei streets .
Got on the flight to Hong Kong .
Now on Hong Kong to Sydney , where I sit now , annoyed by everyone .
Still shocked .
So fucking brutal .
Not what I had in mind at all .
New CleanBoard Drywall is Made From Coal Power Plant Residue
January 16th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Earlier this week , CleanBoard started talking publicly about what it calls “ the most environmentally friendly drywall on earth . ”
That ’s quite a claim , but there might be something to it : the drywall will be produced in a solar - powered factory and made from coal - fired power plant residue .
CleanBoard has developed a system that uses mirrors to collect the sun ’s rays on a heat collector which heats a transfer fluid .
The transfer fluid heats drywall ovens up to 200 degrees Celsius , and leftover fluid is stored in pressurized chambers to make drywall on cloudy days .
The Mojave Desert - based solar thermal plant will be up and running soon , but the company is currently doing limited manufacturing at another site and purchasing carbon offsets to counteract pollution .
And while all drywall uses gypsum , CleanBoard sources its product from coal - fired power plants and unused wall board from construction sites .
The company estimates that it will produce 2 million square feet of drywall in 2010 , 10 million square feet in 2011 , and 100 million square feet at top volume .

Angry Teacher Rips Student ’s Cheek Off
On December 18th , 2008 , a 10 year - old 5th grader named Chao Qun Zheng went to his elementary school in HeNan , China .
When his teacher , Guo , found out that young Zheng had not completed his homework , she flipped out .
“ She was very angry at the time , ” he said .
“ She ripped and twisted my cheeks with both her hands and then she lifted me off the ground . ”
The teacher held the boy up until one of his cheeks actually ripped off and the boy was bleeding profusely .
Without hesitation the teacher reached down and picked up Zheng ’s cheek skin , put it on his face , and instructed the boy go home immediately .
When the parents saw Zheng , they immediately took him to the hospital where it took 52 stitches to have his cheek sewn back on .
Zheng ’s father has reported the case to the police and is expected to press for damages .

Here you have President Obama boarding the Air Force
One for the first time ever , with some really awesome insider footage .
I love when the Commander - In - Chief meets the Presidential airplane 's Commander for the first time :
" You 're exactly what I want the pilot of Air Force One to look like .
You look like Sam Shepard [ the actor who played Chuck Yeager ] in The Right Stuff , " the President says .
Indeed he does .
And he could have been Yeager himself , as only the finest pilots - with more than 2,000 hours in the cockpit throughout the world and a perfect record - can be on command of this plane .

The pilot has to be really good because he has to be able to dodge every single bullet for the President .
Since Air Force
One rarely has fighter escort , the plane depends on its own in case of an attack until the cavalry arrives ( I do n't know why it does n't have escort , but hey , I guess the Secret Service knows better ) .
Back in 1974 , for example , the pilot had to execute some extreme evasive actions when four combat airplanes intercepted Air Force One in Syria 's airspace .
They were n't in danger , however :
They were just unannounced escorts sent by the always - friendly Syrian government .
The habitual Air Force
One is an specially - prepared Boeing 747 , a 231 - feet long 400 - ton airplane with a cabin area of 4,000 square feet .
Two of them were ordered during the Reagan administration - Nancy decorated them personally - and since then they have been going through plenty of retrofitting , including the addition of attack countermeasures ( which are classified ) , encoded digital communications ( 28 lines in case of wiretapping , plus 59 non-encrypted ) , and electromagnetic impulse ( EMP ) shielding , in case the United States suffers a nuclear attack .

And apparently , they also do great burgers with cheddar cheese and dijon mustard .
[ National Geographic ]
The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when we choose to go on it we think it 's real , because thats 's how powerful our minds are .
And it goes up and down and round and round , it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and very loud , and it 's fun - for a while .
Some people have been on the ride for a long time and after a while they begin to question :
Is this real , or is it just a ride ?
But some people have remembered , and they come back to us and they say .
" Hey , do n't worry and do n't be afraid ever , because this is just a ride " - and we kill those people ...
" Shut him up !
Ive got a lot invested in this ride ...
Look at my furrows of worry ...
Look at my big bank account ...
Look at my family ...
This has to be real "
But it 's just a ride .
But we always kill those good guys who try to tell us that and we let the demons run amok .
But it doesnt matter , because it 's just a ride - and we can change it any time we want .
All we need is the choice .
No effort , no work , no job , no savings or money - just a choice - right now - between fear & love .
The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors , buy guns and and close yourself off , the eyes of love instead , see all of us as one .
Here 's what we can do to change the world to a better ride right now .
Take all the money we spend on weapons and defence each year and instead spend it feeding , clothing and educating the poor of the world , which it would many times over , not one human being excluded and we can explore space ... together ... both inner and outer ... forever ... ... in peace .

I apologize to you
On behalf of those in my time
For the things we did n't do
We did n't stop the tyrants
So your fate could be prevented
We watched them steal our freedom
By our silence we consented
We did n't choose to circumvent
The doom you 've not escaped
While the Bill of Rights was murdered
And the Constitution raped
Some of us were lazy
Others too afraid
To think about our children
The ones we have betrayed
I guess we were too busy
To be concerned or care
To try to ease the burden
Of the chains we made you wear
We could have been good shepherds
When the wolf got in the fold
But we watched the flame of freedom die instead
And left you cold I 'm sorry we were timid
My selfish generation
We left you but a remnant
Of a free and prosperous nation
I 'm sorry for our actions
Like cowards we behaved
We could have left you freedom
Instead you are enslaved
Children of tomorrow
Descendants of our land
I 'm sorry we allowed this

These are days of quick trips , disposable diapers , throwaway morality , one night stands , overweight bodies , and pills that do everything from cheer , to quiet , to kill .
It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom .
A time when technology can bring this letter to you , and a time when you can choose either to share this insight , or to just hit delete .
Remember to spend some time with your loved ones , because they are not going to be around forever .
Remember , say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe , because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side .
Remember , to give a warm hug to the one next to you , because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it does n't cost a cent .
Remember , to say , ' I love you ' to your partner and your loved ones , but most of all mean it .
A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you .
Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again .
Give time to love , give time to speak !
And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind .
And always remember , life is not measured by the number of breaths we take , but by those moments that take our breath away .

Socialism vs. the government bailout of capitalism
By Tom Eley
15 October 2008
The breakdown of the US financial system and the government bailout of Wall Street have seriously discredited the ideological justifications of capitalism .
Worship of the " free market " has long been something of a secular religion in the US .
Capitalist ideology has proclaimed that the market 's " invisible hand " will best advance the interests of historical progress , that taxes on the rich and regulations on big businesses must be reduced because only the " risk - takers " know where resources can best be allocated , that any sort of government intervention to improve the living conditions of workers , the poor , the elderly and jobless youth creates a " climate of dependency , " that government cannot simply " throw money " at problems , etc. , etc .
All these shibboleths now stand exposed as rank hypocrisy , as the biggest financial institutions belly up to the public trough .
Yet amidst this historic crisis of the capitalist system , some of those opposed to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's Wall Street bailout have claimed that the measures employed are " socialist . "
Suddenly - - 17 years after the Soviet Union 's collapse and the supposed " death of socialism " -- the " S " word is being bandied about by American politicians and media pundits .
Charges that the Wall Street bailout is socialism have come most frequently from the far right wing of the Republican Party .
To note a few examples , Congressman Jeb Hensarling , a Texas Republican , claimed that Paulson 's plan may put the US on , " the slippery slope to socialism . "
Representative Sam Johnson , also of Texas , warned , " As a relentless supporter of free enterprise , I fear we are rushing headlong into socialism . "
Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky called Paulson 's measures , " financial socialism " and " un-American . "
Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan even compared the bailout to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 .
The claim that the Wall Street bailout is a socialist measure is absurd on its face .
Paulson , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs , who has an estimated personal fortune of $ 700 million and is a member of the most right - wing administration in US history , has authored a bill that will ultimately divert trillions of dollars to the coffers of the biggest banks in the land .
This is socialist ?
Such claims display a combination of stupidity and deceit .
Those who make them rely on the low level of historical knowledge and political understanding among the American people , for which the population is not to blame .
It is the product of the decades - long promotion of political reaction and celebration of the most backward ideologies and conceptions - including hostility toward science - along with the gutting of public education .
A central component of this debasement of political and intellectual life has been the promotion of anti-communism , based largely on the false identification of socialism and Marxism with their political opposite , Stalinism .
The Socialist Equality Party , at its recent founding congress , explained concisely what socialism is in its Statement of Principles .
" Socialism portends the greatest and most progressive transformation of the form of man 's social organization in world history - the ending of society based on classes and , therefore , of the exploitation of human beings by other human beings . "
" The key industrial , financial , technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership , transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class .
The organization of economic life , on the basis of the capitalist law of value , must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning , whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs .
" New forms and structures of genuine participatory democracy - arising in the course of revolutionary mass struggles and representative of the working class majority of the population - must be developed as the foundations of a workers ' government ; that is , a government of the workers , for the workers , and by the workers .
The policy of such a government , as it introduces those measures essential for the socialist transformation of economic life , would be to encourage and actively promote a vast expansion of the democratic working class ' participation in , and control over , decision - making processes . "
The bailout measures are being enacted not by the working people , but are being imposed behind the backs of the people by the most powerful bankers , through their political representatives in both parties .
Ownership and control of the financial levers of economic life remain entirely in the private hands of the richest people in the country .
Those who have presided over the failure of private firms are dictating the terms of their own rescue at the expense of the people .
The social interests that are being defended are determined by the class nature of the state power that is formulating and enacting the measures .
The events of the past month have demonstrated as never before that the American government and the US two - party system are political instruments not of the people , but rather of a financial oligarchy .
For their part , the right - wing Republicans initially opposed the bailout from the standpoint of " free market " capitalism .
They are not against government intervention into the market per se .
Rather , they oppose government action that in any way constrains the activities of the most powerful sections of finance capital .
They label as " socialism " any government measure that limits the ability of the major banks and corporations to maximize their profits , including such things as the minimum wage , restrictions on hours of work , health and safety regulations , environmental regulations , etc .
They oppose tax increases for the wealthy and denounce as " big government " any and all government - run social programs .
Because the Democrats , along with their presidential candidate , Barack Obama , served as the bailout 's most enthusiastic supporters and its principal legislative midwives , Republicans were able to make a demagogic pretense of opposing Wall Street .
What this shows is not that the Republicans have converted themselves into the unlikely defenders of the common man , but how far to the right the US political establishment as a whole has moved .
The Democratic Party , having long since repudiated any policy of social reform , has openly identified itself with the financial aristocracy .
What would a socialist approach to the financial crisis look like ?
Emergency measures would be taken to transform the great banks , hedge funds , insurance companies and financial houses into public utilities .
They would be placed under the democratic control of the working class , with safeguards for the savings of small depositors .
Their resources would be used for productive and socially useful purposes and to alleviate the suffering of the population .
Trillions of dollars would be allocated to rebuild the infrastructure , provide new and high - quality housing , improve education , provide universal health care and access to higher education , and clean up the environment .
Everyone would be guaranteed a job and a decent wage .
The workweek would be reduced , with no loss in pay , and wages would be fully indexed to account for inflation .
The tax burden would be shifted from the working class to the richest 10 percent of the population .
There would be a full and public investigation into the activities of the banks and financial firms and the books of all major corporations would be opened to public inspection .
The wealth of financial industry executives and large stockholders would be appropriated , and they , along with their servants among the political elite , would face criminal investigation for the plundering of the economy that has led to the current crisis .
In order to fight for this socialist perspective , working people must break with the two parties of big business and build an independent political party that has , as its primary aim , the reorganization of the economy to meet social needs , rather than the profit interests of the financial elite .
In the November election , only the Socialist Equality Party and its presidential and vice presidential candidates , Jerry White and Bill Van Auken , are advancing this socialist alternative .
We urge readers of the World Socialist Web Site to support our campaign , vote for Jerry White and Bill Van Auken , and join the SEP .

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
The Zimbabwean government has announced restrictive licensing fees for foreign journalists working in the country , demanding they pay an annual fee of $ 4,000 to practice journalism .
Journalists Barry Bearak and Beven Stephen were charged last year with violating Zimbabwe 's media rules .
In addition foreign media groups must pay $ 10,000 for the application and $ 20,000 for accreditation , payable only in foreign currency , the government - controlled Media and Information Commission said Wednesday .
An administration fee of $ 2,000 is necessary for the permit .
Zimbabwe has some of the harshest conditions for journalists in the world .
Several foreign and local journalists have been arrested in Zimbabwe for lack of accreditation since a media law was passed in 2002 .
Last month a spokesman for President Robert Mugabe threatened to ban foreign news bureaus in Zimbabwe , saying they quoted his boss out of context when reporting on the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe .
Most Western media organizations including CNN are banned from Zimbabwe .
Those that do still operate there including Reuters , The Associated Press , Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) and Al Jazeera would have to pay the fee if they wanted to report from the country .
Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba said the fee was being introduced because foreign media organizations were " reducing local reporters to mere runners . "
The new fees do not apply to journalists working for Zimbabwean organizations .
Foreign journalists who want to work temporarily in Zimbabwe must pay $ 500 and $ 1,000 for application and accreditation under the new rules .
Dzimbabwe Chimbga , a lawyer from the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights , told journalists in Harare that the commission had no legal basis to charge the fees .
" I do n't see how you [ journalists ] should comply with a law that is non-existent .
On the face of it , it is null and void .
MIC is non-existent , " Chimbga said .
Another lawyer , Selby Hwacha , said journalists may be able to seek an order entitling them to work in Zimbabwe for the time being .
The Media Institute of Southern Africa [ MISA ] called on parliament to review the situation immediately .
It said the new fees for foreign media organizations and local journalists working for them " smack of machinations to frustrate and make it difficult to operate in Zimbabwe . "
Airliner hell as 40 passengers - many drunk - ' run amok ' on flight from Gatwick to Cuba
More than 40 passengers ran riot on a Thomas Cook flight from London Gatwick to Cuba , with one trying to open the emergency exit in mid-flight .
On the return flight on December 30 , the same group were again drunk and 17 were stopped from reboarding for the second leg of their trip at Cuba 's Varadero airport .
Police met their flight at Gatwick and Thomas Cook is investigating events with a view to a possible complaint to police .
Up 40 passengers run amok on the Thomas Cook flight from Gatwick to Cuba
The passengers , thought to be from Ireland , are said to have ' run amok ' on the flight to Holguin in Cuba on December 16 .
They are alleged to have caused more drunken mayhem at their all - inclusive hotel in the resort of Playa Pesquero .
Dozens of fellow holidaymakers complained about their behaviour on the outward flight and at the resort .
Fellow passenger Sue Brown , of Worcester Park , Surrey , said : ' On the outward flight , they were smoking , allowing children to run up and down and ignoring all instructions from the crew . '
She added : ' One of the children thumped a passenger for no reason .
I was so scared that I left my seat and sat in the galley with the crew for five hours . '
An American surgeon found a tiny foot and other partially formed body parts inside a tumour he removed from an infant 's brain .
Dr Paul Grabb , a paediatric neurosurgeon , said he operated on Sam Esquibel at Memorial Hospital for Children , Colorado Springs , after an MRI scan showed a microscopic tumour on the newborn 's brain .
Sam was three days old and otherwise healthy .
Grabb said that while removing the growth he discovered it contained a nearly perfect foot and the formation of another foot , a hand and a thigh .
" It looked like the breach delivery of a baby coming out of the brain , " Grabb said .
" To find a perfectly formed structure ( like this ) is extremely unique , unusual , borderline unheard of . "
Grabb was not sure what caused the growth but said it may have been a type of congenital brain tumour .
However , such tumours were usually less complex , he said .
The growth may also have been a case of " fetus in fetu " in which a fetal twin begins to form within another .
But such cases very rarely occurred in the brain , Grabb said .
Sam 's parents , Tiffnie and Manuel Esquibel , said their son was at home now but faced monthly blood tests to check for signs of cancer or regrowth , along with physical therapy to improve the use of his neck .
They said he had mostly recovered from the surgery .
" You 'd never know if he did n't have a scar there , " his mother said .
Seems like rockets are in the news a lot recently , and now South Korea has joined in by unveiling its first space launch vehicle , cunningly named the KSLV - 1 .
Looking pretty much like rockets do , it 'll be capable of putting Korea 's first satellite — a " Science and Technology " one — into orbit , and the 7.7 m - long upper stage has just been completed by Korea 's own Aerospace Research Institute .
Sure , the 25.8 m main stage is actually Russian , but it 'll still represent quite an achievement when it goes aloft .
Sadly this wo n't be until April - June next year due to technical cooperation problems with Russia .

BART rider belly - down when shot , lawyer says Oakland Citing witnesses , attorney for mother of dead man 's child says he was waiting to be cuffed
The 22 - year - old man killed by a BART police officer early New Year 's Day was lying face - down on the train platform , his hands behind him waiting to be cuffed , when he was shot in the back , a lawyer newly hired by the man 's family said Saturday .
Attorney John Burris said in an interview that a number of witnesses to the shooting at the Fruitvale Station in Oakland have told him Oscar Grant was posing no threat to the officer or anyone else when he was fatally wounded .
The shooting occurred around 2:15 a.m. after police responded to a report of a fight on a train bound for Dublin / Pleasanton .
" If it happened the way the ( witnesses ) said it happened , he 's on his stomach , his hands pulled up behind his back , he 's compliant , the officer is standing over him and all of a sudden he shoots , " Burris said .
" The bullet went through his lower back , hit the ground and ricocheted through the upper part of his body . "
The witnesses told him police handcuffed Grant after he was shot , but removed the cuffs just before news reporters arrived , Burris said .
No weapons were found on Grant or anyone else involved in the altercation on the train .
Grant , of Hayward , died at Highland Hospital in Oakland several hours later .
BART officials say the officer who shot him , a BART police officer for almost two years , has been placed on administrative leave during an investigation .
He has not been publicly identified .
Burris , who has filed numerous suits against police , said he has been hired by the mother of Grant 's 4 - year - old daughter and would discuss their plans at a news conference today .
BART spokesman Jim Allison said the transit system has not yet received the results of an autopsy performed Friday by the Alameda County coroner 's office .
He said investigators have not reached any conclusions yet on questions surrounding the incident , including why the officer drew his gun and whether the shooting was deliberate or accidental .
" Officers are trained to unholster that weapon only when there is a perceived possibility that there is a need for deadly force , " Allison said .
" They 're also trained to keep their finger off the trigger until the very moment they would be required to shoot for their own or another 's safety . "
Burris said he does n't see how the shooting could be considered accidental .
" He had the gun out , had the finger on the trigger , " Burris said .
" In order for the gun to go off , he had to pull the trigger .
It looks like an intentional act .
The gun was not defective , as far as I know . "
The incident " has all the earmarks of manslaughter or a second - degree murder case , " the lawyer said .
BART officials said earlier that the case is already under investigation by the Alameda County district attorney 's office .
Burris also said witnesses told him that the fight on the train was apparently between Grant and an older man he had n't previously met .
For unknown reasons , he said , the two men shouted at each other , then grabbed and wrestled with one another , and continued grappling when the train reached Fruitvale .
Burris said BART police stopped the fight and took Grant and several others into custody .
Officers were armed with stun guns as well as pistols , Burris said , and a witness said Grant cried out , as he lay on the platform , " Please do n't Tase me , I have a 4 - year - old daughter . "
BART spokesmen have said several people were detained for questioning but no one was arrested .
But Burris said five people who were with Grant have told him they were held in handcuffs for five hours before being released without charges .
" That 's a long time to be detained " and should be considered an arrest , he said .
FOR many years , the sea has provided man with a rich and plentiful bounty .
But overfishing has caused stocks to fall into decline pretty much everywhere , not just in the once - teeming waters of the Grand Banks but also in warmer climes such as the Gulf of Thailand .
Some , however , remain sceptical over long - term scarcity .
The global catch increased to over 93 m tonnes in 2006 , according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , compared with just 19 m in 1950 .
Much of this can be attributed to better technology , which enabled fishermen to catch more , smaller fish when the big ones run out .
And research by Scripps , a marine - science research organisation , suggests that fish species may have declined by up to 80 % from their pristine state .
Other marine creatures such as oysters and whales have fared even worse .

Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Sit in a comfortable chair -- reclining arm chairs are ideal .
Bed is okay too .
Get as comfortable as possible -- no tight clothes , no shoes , do n't cross your legs .
Take a deep breath ; let it out slowly .
Again .
What you 'll be doing is alternately tensing and relaxing specific groups of muscles .
After tension , a muscle will be more relaxed than prior to the tensing .
Concentrate on the feel of the muscles , specifically the contrast between tension and relaxation .
In time , you will recognize tension in any specific muscle and be able to reduce that tension .
Do n't tense muscles other than the specific group at each step .
Do n't hold your breath , grit your teeth , or squint !
Breath slowly and evenly and think only about the tension - relaxation contrast .
Each tensing is for 10 seconds ; each relaxing is for 10 or 15 seconds .
Count " 1,000 2,000 ... " until you have a feel for the time span .
Note that each step is really two steps -- one cycle of tension - relaxation for each set of opposing muscles .
Do the entire sequence once a day if you can , until you feel you are able to control your muscle tensions .
Be careful :
If you have problems with pulled muscles , broken bones , or any medical contraindication for physical activities , consult your doctor first .
1. Hands .
The fists are tensed ; relaxed .
The fingers are extended ; relaxed .
2. Biceps and triceps .
The biceps are tensed ( make a muscle -- but shake your hands to make sure not tensing them into a fist ) ; relaxed ( drop your arm to the chair - - really drop them ) .
The triceps are tensed ( try to bend your arms the wrong way ) ; relaxed ( drop them ) .
3. Shoulders .
Pull them back ( careful with this one ) ; relax them .
Push the shoulders forward ( hunch ) ; relax .
4. Neck ( lateral ) .
With the shoulders straight and relaxed , the head is turned slowly to the right , as far as you can ; relax .
Turn to the left ; relax .
5. Neck ( forward ) .
Dig your chin into your chest ; relax .
( bringing the head back is not recommended - - you could break your neck ) .
6. Mouth .
The mouth is opened as far as possible ; relaxed .
The lips are brought together or pursed as tightly as possible ; relaxed .
7. Tongue ( extended and retracted ) .
With mouth open , extend the tongue as far as possible ; relax ( let it sit in the bottom of your mouth ) .
Bring it back in your throat as far as possible ; relax .
8. Tongue ( roof and floor ) .
Dig your tongue into the roof of your mouth ; relax .
Dig it into the bottom of your mouth ; relax .
9. Eyes .
Open them as wide as possible ( furrow your brow ) ; relax .
Close your eyes tightly ( squint ) ; relax .
Make sure you completely relax the eyes , forehead , and nose after each of the tensings -- this is actually a toughy .
10 . Breathing .
Take as deep a breath as possible -- and then take a little more ; let it out and breathe normally for 15 seconds .
Let all the breath in your lungs out -- and then a little more ; inhale and breathe normally for 15 seconds .
11 . Back .
With shoulders resting on the back of the chair , push your body forward so that your back is arched ; relax .
Be very careful with this one , or do n't do it at all .
12 . Butt .
Tense the butt tightly and raise pelvis slightly off chair ; relax .
Dig buttocks into chair ; relax .
13 .
Thighs .
Extend legs and raise them about 6 " off the floor or the foot rest -- but do n't tense the stomach ' relax .
Dig your feet ( heels ) into the floor or foot rest ; relax .
14 . Stomach .
Pull in the stomach as far as possible ; relax completely .
Push out the stomach or tense it as if you were preparing for a punch in the gut ; relax .
15 . Calves and feet .
Point the toes ( without raising the legs ) ; relax .
Point the feet up as far as possible ( beware of cramps - if you get them or feel them coming on , shake them loose ) ; relax .
16 . Toes .
With legs relaxed , dig your toes into the floor ; relax .
Bend the toes up as far as possible ; relax .
Now just relax for a while .
As your days of practice progress , you may wish to skip the steps that do not appear to be a problem for you .
After you 've become an expert on your tension areas ( after a few weeks ) , you can concern yourself only with those .
These exercises will not eliminate tension , but when it arises , you will know it immediately , and you will be able to " tense - relax " it away or even simply wish it away .
Please note that an exercise program of any sort that stresses and stretches a full range of muscles can be used in this fashion if only you pay attention to the differences between tensions and relaxations of the muscles .
Yoga is particularly good , but is very demanding at first .
Tai chi is highly recommended .

In a case being investigated as a hate crime , two men and two teenagers have been arrested in connection with the alleged gang rape in December of a 28 - year - old lesbian , Richmond police said Thursday .
Three suspects were taken into custody on Wednesday , and the fourth suspect , 21 - year - old Josue Gonzalez , known by the nickname " Pato , " turned himself in Thursday after authorities issued a $ 1 million arrest warrant , describing him as armed and dangerous , police said .
Gonzalez walked into the Richmond police headquarters with his mother , stepfather and girlfriend just 10 minutes after police finished a midday news conference about their pursuit of Gonzalez , authorities said .
Apparently , the widespread publicity about the case was a factor in Gonzalez 's surrender .
The family " saw all the coverage on the news and got so many calls from the family , they came down to the station , " said Richmond police Lt. Mark Gagan .
Gonzalez , who immediately told police he wanted a lawyer , was being held on a $ 1 million arrest warrant on suspicion of his involvement in the alleged rape and kidnapping .
On Wednesday , Richmond police arrested a 15 - year - old boy and 31 - year - old Humberto Hernandez Salvador at their Richmond homes .
The 15 - year - old was booked on suspicion of felony counts of sexual assault , kidnapping and robbery , Gagan said .
Salvador , who authorities described as the ringleader in the incident , was arrested on suspicion of felony kidnapping to commit a sex crime , carjacking , rape , gang rape , as well as on suspicion of violating probation and committing felonies while on probation .
The teenager is being held with no bail at a juvenile facility in Martinez ; Salvador is being held in Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez with no bail .
A 16 - year - old from Hercules turned himself in around midnight Wednesday .
He is also suspected of felonies related to the alleged rape and kidnapping and was also being held in a juvenile detention center .
The teenager , nicknamed " Blue , " was accompanied by his family , Gagan said .
Salvador " had the most involvement and gave orders and directions to the other individuals , " Gagan said .
" But they 're all responsible for the crimes that were committed against the victim . "
Police allege that on Dec. 13 , the 45 - minute assault began at 9:30 p.m. in the 1500 block of Visalia Avenue in Richmond 's Belding - Wood neighborhood .
After the woman was struck with a blunt object and robbed , the suspects then told her to disrobe , police said .
She was sexually assaulted in that location and then forced back into her car after the suspects saw someone approaching .
She was driven seven blocks away to the 1300 block of Burbeck Avenue , where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted in her car , police said .
She was left naked near a burned - out apartment complex , police said .
After the attack , the men drove off in her car .
She sought help from a nearby resident , who called authorities .
Investigators are pursuing the case as a hate crime because of comments the suspects made about the victim 's sexual orientation .
The woman is openly lesbian and had a rainbow sticker on her car , a symbol of gay pride .
The case has already drawn national attention .
Authorities offered $ 10,000 for tips leading to the attackers ' arrest .
So far the police have not distributed any money , Gagan said , but the community did provide helpful information in the case .
In the wake of the incident , the community held vigils , distributed leaflets and made announcements at local churches , he added .
" The crime had an immediate effect on our community , " Gagan said .
" Locally people were very afraid to know that these people were out there . "
Gagan said the woman is recovering .
Community Violence Solutions , a nonprofit rape crisis center , has opened a fund in the name of Richmond Jane Doe to help the woman pay for relocation expenses , police said .
" We know that being the victim of this crime has changed her for life .
I can only imagine that knowing these people are in custody is a relief . "

Abortion has no effect on long - term mental health ; Clinton 's likely priorities as Secretary of State ; allergic reactions to Gardasil uncommon ; what effect would HHS conscience regulations have ?
Abortion Has No Effect on Long - Term
Mental Health
A New Zealand study claiming to link poor mental health outcomes with
abortion has made the rounds on anti-choice blogs and websites over the past
few weeks ( stay tuned for a more complete debunking in the coming days ) , but in
the mean time , Reuters
reminds us that " No high - quality study done to date can document that
having an abortion causes psychological distress , or a ‘ post- abortion
syndrome , ’ and efforts to show it does occur appear to be politically
motivated , U.S. researchers said on Thursday . "
How do they know ?
A team at Johns
Hopkins University
in Baltimore
reviewed 21 studies involving more than 150,000 women and found the
high - quality studies showed no significant differences in long - term mental
health between women who choose to abort a pregnancy and others .
Guttmacher Institute has also produced an advisory following the thorough American Psychological Association report that concluded that there was no link between mental health outcomes and abortion .

Clinton ’s Likely Priorities as
Secretary of State
On WorldChanging ,
leaders of international family planning organizations express their expectations
for Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s priorities as Secretary of State .
Writes Ben Block , " Although
Clinton ’s agenda will likely be dominated by the diplomatic challenges of a
global war on terror , she is expected to restore U.S. leadership on issues of
population , human rights , and environmental enforcement if the Congress
approves her nomination . "
Allergic Reactions to Gardasil
Uncommon
A study published in the British Medical Journal concludes that " Allergic
reactions to Gardasil , the humanpapilloma virus …are uncommon and most
schoolgirls can tolerate further doses , " CNN
Money reports .
" Researchers at the
Royal Children ’s Hospital in Melbourne , Australia , tested
25 schoolgirls with suspected allergic reactions to Gardasil after more than
380,000 vaccine doses were administered in schools " but " [t ] he researchers found
that only three of the 25 schoolgirls had probable hypersensitivity to Gardasil
and concluded that true hypersensitivity is uncommon . "

Postdocs Feel Job Crunch
As recession deepens , postdocs find themselves caught in a difficult academic job market
WITH AN ECONOMIC recession firmly in place , academic institutions are suffering the pinch of declining endowments and state revenue shortfalls .
In turn , postdoctoral researchers pursuing academic careers are in a particularly vulnerable situation .
Those reaching the end of their two - to three - year positions are feeling increased competition for jobs , and they 're pessimistic about future possibilities .
Meanwhile , faculty members are concerned that the problems may trickle down to graduate students .
Data on academic job availability are difficult to find .
A December 2008 survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education and Moody 's Investors Service found that 5 % of academic institutions have imposed total freezes on faculty hiring , while another 43 % have a partial freeze .
Anecdotally , chemistry postdocs and their advisers say that , after universities started announcing budget cuts and hiring freezes late last year ( C&EN , Dec. 15 , 2008 , page 7 ) , roughly half of the faculty positions that were originally advertised in the fall seemed to disappear .
Linda Wang/ C&EN
On Hold Johns Hopkins University advertised two chemistry faculty positions in the fall , then had to postpone hiring for the jobs because of the worsening financial climate .
" It 's been incredibly stressful , " says a postdoctoral researcher , " Michael , " who , like all of the postdocs interviewed by C&EN for this story , did not want to publish his real name for fear of jeopardizing his job prospects .
Michael applied for 75 academic jobs this season , in chemistry , chemical engineering , and materials science departments ; had eight site interviews ; and has one job offer in hand .
The economic meltdown in October happened at the worst possible time , Michael says .
Schools advertised open positions in late August and September .
Then , as postdocs were submitting their applications , " the bottom fell out .
Not only were departments left scrambling but also the applicants , " he says .
The uncertainty and variability of the job market through the fall definitely increased the sense of competition , Michael says .
" Everyone on the market knows the economy is bad , and everyone is feeling the same pressure to get an offer and not take any chances , " he adds .
As stressful as it's been , Michael does have a job offer .
Others are n't so lucky .
Brandeis University chemistry and biochemistry professor Dagmar Ringe has four postdocs looking for jobs right now .
Two have offers and two do n't .
Ringe has funding to continue to support the latter two for at least another year , but she notes that there is always some uncertainty about whether grants will come through .
Keeping on current postdocs will also hinder Ringe 's ability to bring new talent into the lab .
" There is a ripple effect , no question about it , " she says .
" I 'm in that position right now .
There is someone I did want to take , but there 's no way I can because someone else would have to leave in order to make room . "
Ringe and other faculty are concerned that , if the recession and hiring freezes last , graduating Ph.D. students may in turn have difficulty finding postdoctoral positions , especially in what has been a difficult research - funding climate .
W. E. Moerner , a chemistry professor at Stanford University , says he has a couple of Ph.D. students aiming to graduate later this year , and he is worried about their ability to find positions .
" This is only a concern right now , as they have most of the year to finish , " he says .
Current postdocs are also cognizant of trickle - down concerns .
Another postdoc , " Sarah , " applied for 35 academic jobs this year , had two site interviews , and is waiting to hear about offers .
She 's already on her second postdoctoral appointment , and her current contract was supposed to end in June .
Although her adviser has offered to support her for longer , she has mixed feelings about taking him up on the offer .
More time as a postdoc is unlikely to help her land an academic position , Sarah says .
" It 's not fair to new Ph.D.s if people like me are keeping postdoc positions tied up , " she adds .
Sarah is considering turning to a career in industry .
Psychologically , however , that 's a difficult transition .
Her advisers had always pushed her toward an academic position and that was always her goal .
" When you work toward something for a long time and realize it may not happen for you , it 's demoralizing , " she says .
For postdocs reconsidering their academic dreams , however , the industrial job market currently does n't look any rosier than the academic track .
The U.S. chemical industry saw jobs decline by 1.8 % in 2008 compared with 2007 , and economists are predicting additional losses in 2009 ( C&EN , Jan. 19 , page 8 ) .
The pharmaceutical industry , considered a subset of the chemical industry , lost about 4,700 jobs , or 1.6 % , between last January and November .
Classified advertisements printed in C&EN for open industrial positions were down about two - thirds in December 2008 , compared with the same month in 2007 and 2006 .
Industry and government ads posted at the ACS Careers website were down about 20 % in December 2008 , compared with 2007 .
Another postdoc , " Hiro , " is searching for an industrial job and had several interviews at a small company .
He was on the verge of getting an offer when the company instituted a hiring freeze .
The job may now come through in March , or it may not at all .
His adviser can continue to support him , Hiro says , adding that " I 'm very fortunate in that regard . "
He 's concerned that other postdocs in less well - funded groups may find themselves without jobs or health insurance .
NO ONE IS OPTIMISTIC that postdocs will have an easier time finding academic positions anytime soon .
Many of the faculty positions that stayed open this season had funds committed before the economic crash in October .
With hiring freezes now in place , people expect even fewer slots will be available next season .
And there will likely be more applicants for those jobs , as up - and - coming postdocs join anyone in the current pool who is able to extend their existing appointment to try again for an academic slot next year .
A fourth postdoc , " Maruf , " applied for 42 academic positions .
Although he 's still hopeful to interview at a few schools , he is also now starting to consider whether to investigate opportunities in industry .
He and his postdoctoral colleagues are all scrambling to revamp their plans for the next few months .
For his part , Maruf had planned to take some time off to visit relatives as well as to work on grant proposals he would submit after starting a faculty position .
His adviser has offered to extend his position , he says , but he also has a family to support and the uncertainty is stressful .
" I think a lot of us did not realize how bad the situation could be and has become , " Maruf says .
Sarah says that she hopes advisers will be realistic with their current students and postdocs about the realities of the academic job market .
She had always been told there were lots of positions and that she'd have no trouble pursuing an academic career .
" There are lots of things that go into getting an academic job that you can't control , " she says .
" Advisers should be more cautious and tell people it's very competitive . "
The trial exposed Rebecca 's tale of heroism as an invention
A German girl who won a " civic courage " award for allegedly defending an immigrant child from neo -Nazis has been found guilty of inventing the story .
The 18 - year - old - named as Rebecca K - had carved a swastika on her own thigh , the court concluded , rejecting her claim that neo -Nazis had done it .
In February she had received an award from a Berlin association campaigning against far - right violence .
She claimed four men had attacked her last November in the town of Mittweida .
In its ruling on Friday the court in Hainichen , eastern Germany , ordered her to do 40 hours of community service .
Doctors who examined her had testified that the swastika appeared to be a self - inflicted wound .
She was 17 - a minor - when she made her report to the police .
She claimed that she had gone to the aid of an immigrant child and that four neo -Nazis had thrown her to the ground and carved the swastika on her .
Investigators failed to find any witnesses to corroborate her story , German media report .
Her story made headlines across Germany at the time , prompting soul - searching about a rise in neo -Nazi violence .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- A Georgia judge threw the book at Brian Nichols on Saturday , giving him four consecutive sentences of life without parole for a 2005 shooting rampage that started in an Atlanta courthouse .
Brian Nichols tells the court Saturday in Atlanta , Georgia , " I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life . "
" I 'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you .
If I could give you more , I would , " Superior Court Judge James Bodiford told Nichols .
Nichols , 37 , was convicted last month of 54 counts for a deadly shooting rampage that began March 11 , 2005 , in the same courthouse where he stood trial .
Nichols , who was being tried for rape , shot three people to death as he escaped from the downtown courthouse that day and a federal agent the next day in Atlanta 's Buckhead district before being captured in neighboring Gwinnett County .
" I know that the things that I 've done caused a lot of pain , and I am sorry , " Nichols , who remained seated , told the court before sentence was pronounced .
" And I just wanted to say that I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life . "
Watch victims ' family members react to the sentence »
Nichols was spared a death sentence Friday after the jury deliberating his fate announced that it could not agree on a sentence .
Bodiford gave Nichols the maximum sentence on all the non-murder charges , and ordered them to be served consecutively .
Those terms ranged from five years for escape to life for armed robbery .
Other charges included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , robbery by force , theft by taking , hijacking a motor vehicle and false imprisonment .
" It 's a large number of years .
It 's many lifetimes , " Bodiford said .
Bodiford ordered that Nichols serve his time in the Georgia state penal system , forgoing the possibility of sending him to the federal maximum - security prison in Colorado .
Bodiford implored Nichols ' family and attorneys never to trust Nichols again .
" There 's ample evidence that trusting him will get you killed , " he said in concluding the sentencing hearing .
Jurors told Bodiford on Friday night that they were deadlocked , with nine in favor of death and three in favor of life without parole .
Under Georgia law , the jurors must reach a unanimous decision in order to impose a death sentence .
In the absence of a unanimous jury verdict , the decision fell in the hands of Bodiford .
Defense lawyers said Nichols , who confessed to the killings , suffers from a mental disorder .
The jurors unanimously found the necessary aggravating circumstances in the four murders , but they were split over the death penalty .
After nine weeks of testimony , the jury found Nichols guilty of 54 counts , which included the four murders plus numerous aggravated assaults , carjackings and kidnappings .
The shootings began in the Fulton County Courthouse , where Nichols was set to stand trial for rape .
He overpowered a sheriff 's deputy and took her gun before proceeding to the courtroom of Judge Rowland Barnes , killing him and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau .
Sgt. Hoyt Teasley chased Nichols to outside the courthouse , where Nichols fatally shot him .
Nichols killed off - duty U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm as he worked on a house in Buckhead the next day .
He was captured later that day after a standoff with police in the apartment of a woman he had taken hostage in Gwinnett County .
The case drew nationwide attention , in part because of the cost of Nichols ' representation : about $ 2 million at last accounting .
Nichols had attempted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence , but the Fulton County District Attorney 's Office would not take the death penalty off the table .

( Money Magazine ) --
Let 's say you bought two stocks last year .
One has tanked and looks likely to fall further .
One has gone up and you expect it to keep rising .
( Hey , it 's not completely impossible . )
Which are you more apt to sell ?
Behavioral economists used to think they knew the answer : neither .
Studies have shown that people tend to value things more - whether shirts , stereos or stocks - once they own them , no matter what has happened to their actual worth .
This phenomenon is called the endowment effect .
If it were the only psychological factor at work , you'd be reluctant to sell both losers and winners simply because they 're already tucked into your portfolio .
But economics professors Nicholas C. Barberis of the Yale School of Management and Wei Xiong of Princeton University argue that when it comes to stocks , the endowment effect may be trumped by another factor .
They call it realization utility .
Their hypothesis :
The realized gains you get by selling an appreciated stock give you more of a thrill than entering the ticker at CNNMoney.com and seeing that the stock price has gone up .
Why ?
The profit you lock in feels like proof that you made a good decision .
You can milk your enjoyment still more by bragging to your spouse of your triumph .
Conversely , realizing losses is a major drag .
Who wants to feel as if he or she made a huge mistake ( and maybe get berated by the spouse too ) ?
Realization utility explains a lot of foolish behavior by investors .
As several studies have shown , when the market is rising , people tend to trade more often than they do when the market is falling .
They 're trying to nab those feel - good gains .
But rapid trading is n't such a good idea since it inevitably increases your costs and lowers your long - term performance .
Realization utility can also hurt you when the market is sinking - like , say , now - by encouraging you to hang on to stocks or funds that do n't have a future .
Even buy - and - hold investors sometimes need to admit they should n't have bought the darned shares in the first place .
The longer you delay selling , the longer you can put off the pain of admitting your error .
The implications of all this are important to anyone who wants to make the smartest possible money decisions .
Because you have an unconscious bias to keep your dogs , you should push yourself to look at them more critically than you normally would .
And when you are tempted to sell a winner , ask yourself :
Am I really making a smart investment decision or simply pursuing a delicious feeling of triumph ?
And then ask your spouse to be extra-nice to you .
You need to feel good right around now .
Have you found a way to pay for your child 's college education without taking on too much debt ?
Did you choose a university based on its lower cost or loan programs , research scholarships , or just save up and pay in full ?
We want to hear from you .

While today nobody denies that massacres took place , some historians argue they cannot be called " genocide " as there were excesses on both sides in what was a civil war , and they do not fit the UN criteria of killings based on ethnic or religious identity .
" The Vendéeans were no more blameless than were the republicans .
The use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate , " said Timothy Tackett of the University of California .
Mr. Moynihan went out of his way last year to support Mr. Kerrey 's attempt to win the Democratic Presidential nomination , and the view among politicians is that Mr. Kerrey has a debt to pay .
An Administration official put it this way : " I can't believe that if at the darkest hour , Moynihan says , ' Bob , I 'm calling my chit , ' Kerrey wo n't go along .
That 's powerful . "
Most of the attention surrounding the budget bill has been on taxes .
The bill would raise the top tax rate , now 31 percent , to 36 percent for single taxpayers on taxable incomes ranging from $ 115,000 to $ 250,000 and for couples with taxable incomes from $ 140,000 to $ 250,000 .
The rate on taxable incomes above $ 250,000 would be 39.6 percent .
Workers with taxable income below those amounts would have no change in their income taxes .
But retired people with incomes as low as $ 34,000 could face an income tax increase because of the proposed treatment of taxes on Social Security benefits .
Taxable income is what is left after deductions and personal exemptions are subtracted from adjusted gross income .
But beyond the tax increases are some important spending cuts .
A freeze would be placed for the next five years on all Government programs financed by annual appropriations .
That means that if spending is increased , say , on education , it must be reduced for some other program .
All taxes and entitlement programs -- like Social Security , Medicare , welfare and farm price supports , which pay benefits to everyone who is eligible for them -- would be on a pay - as - you - go basis .
That means that if benefits are raised or taxes cut , they must be offset by raising another tax or cutting another benefit .

The explosions marked the second time in hours a U.N. school came under attack .
The Israeli Defense Force has shelled a UN school in the Gaza strip , killing 30 and injuring 55 .
Israel claims that Hamas militants were using the school as a base to mortar their troops , but the UN says that all the dead and injured were civilians .
Even if the IDF were correct , something the Right accepts unquestioningly because the IDF never , ever lies like their enemies do , then Israel would only be responding to Hamas ' war crime by committing another war crime .
You can't get to the moral high ground - let alone win a COIN operation - by allowing the rules of war to be set by barbarians , something that the intellectually and morally bankrupt Right never seems to acknowledge .
And there are good reasons to believe that the IDF is simply lying as part of a propaganda war it admits has been eight months in the planning : the use of indiscriminate white phosphorus airbursts , in contravention of international law as it is understood everywhere except the US and Israel ( the 1980 Protocol III to the Convention on Conventional Weapons containsa blanket restriction on dropping incendiary weapons from the air against military objectives " located within a concentration of civilians " ) ; the way in which the IDF is throwing explosives around so freely that almost as many of its people have been killed by its own " errant ' tank shells as by enemy action .
Of course they cannot acknowledge this - otherwise their only recourse for all the warmongering they 've cheerled in the last eight years would be to commit symbolic sepukku and fall on the swords of their own punditry before vanishing from our public discourse forever .

Not that I 'm thinking about theme food for a football game or anything , but what about this for an inspired Rust Belt / Sun Belt fusion dish ?
My family is from Pittsburgh , so I associate the foods I ate in my youth with the Iron City .
And I ate a lot of fried bologna and scrambled eggs .
My father , who grew up in the South Hills part of town , considered fried bologna a delicacy .
When he made us fried bologna sandwiches , he always made an incision on a radius from the center of the slice to the outer edge to allow the bologna to shrink .
As I recall , the bologna was usually black by the time he was done frying it .
For breakfast , he favored fried bologna and scrambled eggs .
I 've been in Texas for most of the rest of my life , and the Tex - Mex dish called migas has become as common breakfast at my house .
Robert Amaya of Amaya's Taco Village in Austin once told me that migas is n't really a breakfast dish among Tejanos .
When he was growing up in the Lower Rio Grande Valley , his family did n't ate eggs for breakfast .
They ate migas on Friday nights and during Lent when Catholics could n't eat meat .
I put ham , chorizo or bacon in my migas sometimes , so the idea of substituting fried bologna seemed like a natural .
Tasted great to me , but I can't say that anyone else at my house was interested in joining me for breakfast .

Well , that did n't take long .
Democrats are planning to kick off the legislative portion of the 111th Congress as early as today with two big donations to one of their most loyal retainers : the plaintiffs bar .
Higher labor costs will result from a pair of bills designed to create new lawsuit possibilities in cases of alleged wage discrimination .
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is an effort to overturn a 2007 Supreme Court decision , Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber .
Lilly Ledbetter had worked for Goodyear for almost 20 years before retiring .
Only in 1998 , after she took her pension , did she sue and allege wage discrimination stretching back to the early 1980s .
The Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 against her , noting the statute clearly said claims must be filed within 180 days , or sometimes 300 days , of the discrimination .
That ruling put to rest Ms. Ledbetter 's creative theory that decisions made decades ago by a former boss affected her pay all the way to retirement , so that each paycheck was a new discriminatory act and thus fell within the statute of limitations .
Yet that is exactly the theory Congress would now revive with the Ledbetter bill .
There would no longer be time limits on such discrimination claims .
They could be brought long after evidence had disappeared or witnesses had died -- as was the case with Ms. Ledbetter 's former boss .
For the tort bar , this is pure gold .
It would create a new legal business in digging up ancient workplace grievances .
This would also be made easier by the bill 's new definition of discrimination .
Companies could be sued not merely for outright discrimination but for unintentional acts that result in pay disparities .
Since these supposed wrongs could be compounded over decades , the potential awards would be huge .
Most companies would feel compelled to settle such claims rather than endure the expense and difficulty of defending allegations about long - ago behavior .
The recipe here is file a suit , get a payday .
And the losers would be current and future employees , whose raises would be smaller as companies allocate more earnings to settle claims that might pop up years after litigating employees had departed .
Addonics NAS adapter turns any USB storages into NAS drives

President Bush let it all out today during an interview with ABC News ’ Charlie Gibson .
Bush delivered a mea culpa on Iraq , the economic crisis and the 2008 election outcome for Republicans .
Below are three write - ups on different parts of the interview :
From ABC News : Bush on the Iraq War …
Looking back on his eight years in the White House , President George W. Bush said he was “ unprepared ” for war and pinpointed incorrect intelligence that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction as “ biggest regret of all the presidency . ”
“ I think I was unprepared for war , ” Bush told ABC News ’ Charlie Gibson in an interview airing today on “ World News . ”
“ In other words , I did n’t campaign and say , ‘ Please vote for me , I ’ll be able to handle an attack , ' ” he said .
“ In other words , I did n’t anticipate war .
Presidents — one of the things about the modern presidency is that the unexpected will happen . ”
From AP : Bush on the economic crisis …
President George W. Bush expressed remorse that the global financial crisis has cost jobs and harmed retirement accounts and said he ’ll back more government intervention if needed to ease the recession .
“ I ’m sorry it ’s happening , of course , ” Bush said in a wide - ranging interview with ABC ’s “ World News , ” which was airing Monday .
“ Obviously I do n’t like the idea of people losing jobs , or being worried about their 401 ( k ) s .
On the other hand , the American people got to know that we will safeguard the system .
I mean , we ’re in .
And if we need to be in more , we will . ”
From CNN : Bush on helping lose the election for McCain …
President Bush told an interviewer that his presidency may have helped Barack Obama win the White House .
“ I think it was a repudiation of Republicans , ” he told Charlie Gibson of ABC News , according to a transcript released by the network Monday .
“ And I ’m sure some people voted for Barack Obama because of me .
I think most people voted for Barack Obama because they decided they wanted him to be in their living room for the next four years explaining policy . ”

More than a week into Israel ’s invasion of Gaza , America is still alive and kicking and none of our citizens are dead , which is the way it should be , as this is their religious war and not ours .
If stubborn noninterventionism were our creed  as the Founders intended  the Gaza war could continue for two more days or two more months and we could simply shrug and mutter " Who cares ? "
America could simply go on its way , rebuilding its economy and marveling over the madness of two religions fighting to the death over a barren sandpit at the eastern end of the Mediterranean .
Unfortunately , America today is run by a political and media elite that is addicted to intervention .
This would be bad enough if these men and women had the brains to intervene and produce a result that benefits U.S. interests , but they are not .
They are instead  despite their Ivy League diplomas  uneducated and naïve people who still live in the Cold War , foolishly believing that America is the boss of a strong Western / NATO community ( which is now in its death throes on Afghanistan ’s plains ) ; that other nations are eager to do America ’s dirty work ; and , most fatally of all , that the national security interests of the United States and Israel are identical .
There should be no mistake among Americans about what is going on in Gaza .
Although Israel has billed its invasion as an attempt to destroy Hamas and thereby protect Israelis , its main goal is to ensure that Obama is tied as tight as Gulliver to the status quo of U.S. foreign policy in the Muslim world .
In addition to hurting Hamas , Israel ’s invasion of Gaza was designed to and has successfully underscored the salience of Osama bin Laden ’s now 12 - plus - year - old message to the Muslim world :
First , that the United States  under Republicans or Democrats  will allow Israel to do anything it pleases in regard to starving and bombing the Palestinians .
This has been underlined for Muslims by the words of President George W. Bush , the silence of President - elect Obama , and , according to the Jerusalem Post , by the blame - it - all - on - the - Palestinians visits of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , New York Congressman Gary Ackerman , and leaders of major U.S. Jewish organizations .
Second , that the ruling Muslim regimes in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , and elsewhere are impotent " agents " of the Zionists and Crusaders and will do nothing to protect Muslims when they are attacked by the U.S. - led West , be those attacks in Palestine , Pakistan , Iraq , or Afghanistan .
" [ The ] failure of the Arab foreign ministers at their meeting in Cairo to take any position to confront the continuing Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip , " explains the independent and influential UK - based Arabic daily Al - Quds al - Arabi , " confirms the theory that says the Israeli aggression has come as a result of coordination and the blessing of influential Arab states , especially Egypt and Saudi Arabia . "
Third , that Muslims are regarded by the West as subhumans , and their blood , lives , and children are  for America , Israel , and Europe  worthless and expendable .
The Gaza score to date will indelibly make this point across the Islamic world : to date , 500 dead and 2,300 wounded Palestinians and less than 10 dead Israelis .
As Pakistan ’s Frontier Post has said , the West silently watches as " Israel is set to starve the Palestinian Muslims into nonexistence .
No respect for Muslim life !
Muslim blood is cheaper than water ! "
After the Gaza invasion , Israel will have accomplished two vital goals .
It will have reenergized Hamas , which will in turn renew the suicide bombings inside Israel that allow America ’s Israel - firsters  including Obama ’s IDF - veteran chief of staff  to portray their country - of - first - allegiance as the poor , put -upon innocent .
It will also have produced the end of whatever slim hope there was of an Arab - Israeli peace settlement over the course of Obama ’s term .
What is likely to become known across the Islamic world as the " Gaza slaughter " will ensure the continued growth of the Sunni insurgency al - Qaeda leads and inspires .
All told , Israeli leaders at the conclusion of the Gaza invasion will be able to more credibly quote President Bush and say that their " mission " has been accomplished .
Now , there is no reason for Americans to be angry at Israel .
Hamas is a nagging military threat to Israel , and Israel ’s leaders can defend their citizens in the manner they deem appropriate .
Indeed , had various U.S. governments abstained from continuously intervening in the Arab - Israeli conflict over the past 30 years , it may well have been long since settled and over  one way or another .
The American people should be livid , though , with their bipartisan political elite and the Israel - firsters at Commentary , the New York Times , National Review , the Weekly Standard , and the Washington Post , as well as that hive of anti-American U.S. citizens that fund and lead AIPAC , for involving them in this barbarous mess .
At some point down the road , every U.S. - taxpayer - funded bomb , artillery shell , and bullet aimed at the Palestinians will yield Americans killed at the hands of al - Qaeda , its allies , or those it inspires in attacks launched in response to U.S. support for Israel .
Those Americans will be killed because their political and media leaders  corrupted to the bone by AIPAC  have involved them in a religious war that threatens nothing vital to their country ’s principles or national security , their personal economic well - being , or their children ’s lives .
And worse is yet to come .
Israel ’s Gaza invasion has produced an unusual number of public anti-Israel demonstrations by American Muslims around the United States .
The 2006 Israel - Hezbollah war produced similar events , but the current , Gaza - focused demonstrations are angrier and larger in number .
How long , one wonders , will it be before Israel ’s military actions lead to violent clashes in America ?
If this occurs , Israel and its American supporters will have the insurance policy they desire above any other , one they are desperate to obtain before Israel takes harsh action  by forced deportation or other means  against its rapidly growing and radicalizing Arab population .
Once the Arab - Israeli religious war has been brought into the United States and is producing blood in America ’s streets , the Israel - firsters will claim the carnage proves that secular America and theocratic Israel are in the same boat and facing the same enemies .
Flogging this plausible but palpable lie , AIPAC - owned American leaders will consign this country to an unending war against Islam , the same catastrophe that is Israel ’s lot .

Sometimes science fiction writers get it right ; other times they are way off the mark .
While it 's good that George Orwell was wrong in predicting what would happen in 1984 , it would have been cool if Arthur C. Clarke 's predictions for 2001 had come to pass .
Not only would interplanetary travel have been nice , but more importantly it would be great to deal with a single computer ( non-homicidal , of course ) rather than having to cobble together and manage thousands of separate pieces of hardware and software into something resembling a coherent enterprise computing structure .
With virtualization coming into the data center at warp speed , vendors are moving toward integrating all data center components into a single structure .
" In the past , one problem with data centers was that they are stovepiped , but actually it is more of a hodgepodge , " said Richard Villars , vice president storage systems for IDC in Framingham , Mass .
" I had an application so I put a server there because the rack was available .
Then , I needed to expand the application , so the other server is on another rack on the other side of the room , and the storage is somewhere else . "
Several vendors are now moving in the direction of bringing all data center components into a single structure .
Or perhaps " directions " would be more accurate , since each is taking a different approach to that problem .
Cisco Systems of Santa Clara , Calif. , as one might expect , is taking a network - oriented approach with its approach .
In 2007 it released the VFrame DC , an appliance with a Java - based application  VFrame Fabric Virtualization Software  to provision and reuse infrastructure components including processing , storage and networking .
The architecture calls for all the servers to be diskless , with the fabric assigning loads to the CPUs and memory as needed .
Administrators establish policies ahead of time , and the appliance then follows those policies in reconfiguring servers or add new applications on the fly .
Krish Ramakrishnan , vice president and general manager of Cisco's Virtualization Unit , said this will work particularly well for organizations that have wide swings in the type of traffic they need to handle , since resources can be reprovisioned in about a minute .
" If an official announces a new policy or service , IT administrators can easily monitor traffic , coordinate with load balancers and storages , and move the appropriate number of servers into that environment , " he said .
" You can never anticipate how the traffic flow will happen , but [ you ] need to cope with it when it does . "
Brocade Communications Systems ' solution is called the Brocade Data Center Fabric ( DCF ) architecture .
Rather than a single product like VFrame , it calls for adding a virtualization layer that encompasses data center and server connectivity , the storage fabric , file management , continuous data protection , data migration , and a centralized management framework .
Blade manufacturer Egenera of Marlboro , Mass . uses what it calls a Processing Area Network ( PAN ) .
The blades are diskless , booting from the SAN .
There are also separate blade providing switching and control .
These are then managed as a unit by the PAN Manager software .
Hewlett - Packard ( Palo Alto , Calif . ) also has software now .
The HP Virtual Connect Enterprise Manager allows up to 1,600 blade servers to be managed from a single console .
" With these new data center fabric environments the physical assets are managed very consistently , " said Villars .
" What I am doing is just moving workloads between different compute or storage resources on the fly , without disrupting the end user . "
HP and IBM are also developing software to manage the entire data center , including power , cooling and physical security , together with the computing assets .
The HP Insight Dynamics  VSE supports hypervisors from several other vendors , allowing managers to view all the physical and virtual assets as a pool .
In July , IBM announced integration between its Tivoli management software and Johnson Controls ' Metasys building management system .
Metasys uses XML , SOAP , SNMP and DHCP and operates over an IP interface , making it easy to integrate with the Tivoli Monitoring for Energy Management software .
With each of these changes , we are getting closer to being able to just issue a command to the computer , like on Star Trek , without having to specify which application , database , server or storage resource to use .
When we do , however , we just have to make sure we do n't name the system HAL or Skynet .
It 's Christmas , and we 're betting that at least some of you received new digital cameras ( be they point - and - shoots or DSLRs ) .
And if you 're a photography n00b , we 've got a few tips to help .

Turn On Burst Mode
It 's harder to capture candid shots on point - and - shoots ( let 's call em PASs ) than DSLRs , but in either format you should turn on " burst mode " or " continuous shooting . "
This allows you to keep the camera taking shots as fast as it can by holding down the shutter button .
Even the greatest photographers do n't predict magical moments down to the millisecond — they let their camera do it for them .
And with today 's cheap and gigantic SD cards , you can afford to waste plenty of shots to get the best .
Control the Color Temperature Yourself
Auto White Balance ( AWB ) does a good job on most cameras .
But you know who can do a better job ?
You .
Backing up for a moment , since every color has its own relative " temperature " that 's measured in degrees Kelvin , even the orangey glow of an incandescent bulb or the relatively bluish hue of the sun 's light can screw with your photos .
Your brain factors it out when you 're looking around , but it 's important to notice whether the light falling on your scene is more yellow or blue , and to compensate .

Your camera uses auto white balance to get around this cacophony of color , but it 's not always right .
On some cameras , you can actually use " manual white balance " ( MWB ) , shooting a white patch , such as a piece of paper , in order to say " THIS IS WHITE . "
That 's the most accurate way , though the simpler way found on most cameras is to manually select the best white balance by choosing the tiny icon that identifies your light source : a sun for direct sunlight , a cloud for cloudy , a round bulb for incandescent , a rectangular bulb for fluorescent , etc .

Keep ISO to 400 on PASs , 800 - 1600 on Low - End dSLRs
ISO , a carryover term from the days of film , essentially signals the sensitivity of the imaging sensor to light .
A higher number means grainier ( noisier ) but better defined shots in low light ; a lower number means smoother shots in decent light .
Most cameras will crank this number in medium to low light situations so that it can capture a shot without blurring , but you will get a grainy image .
This may just be a rule of thumb based on the cameras I 've used , but for optimally crisp shots , do n't let the ISO exceed 400 on your PAS or 1600 on your DSLR .
( In some older DSLR models , you probably should n't exceed 800 . )

Use Diffuse Flash , Or Just Turn it Off
Any way you cut it , flash is a problem .
When used instead of ambient light , it pulls the color and texture from skin , turns eyes red ( a phenomenon caused when the flash is too close to your lens , which it is in most cameras ) and often erases the background ambiance from your shot .
A few things you can do will help tame flash :
Advertisement
1. Check your manual for minimum and maximum flash distances — probably around 6 to 12 feet away — and stay in those constraints .
2. Diffuse the flash .
A classic trick for DSLR owners is to put a cigarette carton on large flash attachments , but in the absence of a large flash — and a cigarette carton — try taping some kind of translucent paper over your flash .
3 . Turn it off .
Even a grainier high - ISO shot is better than a washed - out flash explosion .
If you use a tripod , you can get nice low light shots without resorting to flash or upping the ISO .
Most cameras now have a flashless " night mode " to automate this process .
Carry a Pocket Tripod
Ultimately , if you want to take good shots in dark environments , you need to allow light to hit your camera 's imaging sensor for a longer period of time .
And the only way to keep your shots sharp in this scenarios is to stabilize your camera .
Though even cheap cameras boast image stabilizers of all kinds , a $ 7 pocket tripod trumps all that marketing speak , allowing you to use a solid surface to set up the camera and then angle it to your liking .
If you do n't have a tripod , try resting your camera on the side of a table , or up on a ( preferably empty ) water glass .

Protect Your Images From Lens Flare
In any situation where sunlight or some other bright light source is hitting your lens indirectly ( not associated with your subject ) , you may lose part of your image to stray light .
Sometimes this looks cool , of course , but not always .
The best and most common solution is a lens hood .
The second best solution ( and the one that works for PASs ) is your hand , a piece of paper , anything , between that light source and your lens .
Exhale , Then Shoot
ISOs and tripods aside , maybe the best tip I 've ever gotten to taking great shots was to exhale , then take the picture .
Right after you exhale , the tension is released from your body , and you 'll find yourself , for a brief moment , at your stillest and most relaxed .
In low light especially , it could be the difference between getting a clear shot and getting a blurry one .

Use Sepia Filter Whenever Humanly Possible
Sepia is well known for making your lousy photography " deep . "
Helllllooo precious moments !
( OK , I sort of despise sepia because it 's been so overused , but that 's just me .
It can be beautiful , of course . )

For DSLR Owners ... Shoot in RAW , Shoot in RAW , Shoot in RAW
There are many advantages to the average DSLR camera , but the best , by far , unequivocally , is RAW shooting .
If you save your pictures as JPEGs , they can be beautiful , but they 've been compressed and packaged into a product .
If you save in RAW , you have a picture , but you also have the cold clay that shaped it .
Advertisement
RAW is the data pulled right off the imaging sensor of your camera , before it gets run through a bunch of optimizer and compression algorithms .
This data allows for a complete do - over on many aspects of the picture , like color temperature .
In other cases , it allows a lot of room for fudging , as with exposure .
You 'll need software that can handle RAW images — most cameras come with something proprietary , but Photoshop can also manage RAW from the major camera brands .
Just do n't be scared by it .
It 's why you 're holding that shiny new DSLR you have no idea how to use .
And Your Own ...
I realize this list will seem too obvious to some , but the goal is to help those who did n't know much to start with .
Since we have more than our share of incredible photographers among our readership , I 'd encourage any of you with pro tips to please offer them up in comments .

A group of French research students is launching an online register to flag up scientific papers that have been tainted by fraud and other types of scientific misconduct .
Claire Ribrault , a PhD student in neurobiology at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris , unveiled the Scientific Red Cards project last month at a workshop on research integrity sponsored by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) .
The idea is to identify papers that have been shown to be fraudulent but are still in circulation .
Scientific journals are the primary means by which the results of research are made public .
Emma Campbell , of the European Association of Science Editors , told the meeting that editors were becoming more aware of their role as gatekeepers .
Most journals now have guides to best practice for authors and reviewers and many require authors to sign a declaration before a paper is accepted .
The most important line of defense is peer review , where the submitted paper is subject to critical reading by a scientist familiar with the field .
But by tradition reviewers are unpaid and may not be able to devote sufficient time and effort to detect signs of misconduct .
Once a paper has passed peer review it can be difficult for editors to spot problems by themselves .
" How do you know if someone 's fabricated their results if the reviewer did n't detect it ? "
Campbell asked .
" How do you know if someone has n't declared their conflict of interest ?
" Modern tools available to editors can help them detect plagiarism in submitted articles and even whether digital images have been manipulated , but such services come at a price and evidence of misconduct may not be found until after the paper is published .
Guidelines to help editors and publishers deal with suspected misconduct are published by the Committee on Publication Ethics ( COPE ) , as well as several other organisations .
" We retract a published paper if something has been found where perhaps the results have been fabricated , " Campbell said .
" Journals can ban submissions from someone in future if they decide that person is not someone they can trust to submit decent papers .
And they can contact the author 's employer or other authorities , for example the British Medical Association .
"
On the other hand , there is no formal system to prevent a paper discovered to be fraudulent from being resubmitted to a different journal , she said .
She called for a consensus amongst publishers on the guidelines to be used .
" Rather than having lots of different sets of guidelines in different professional groups , try and have one set of international guidelines for people to follow .
" But once a fraudulent paper has been published it is very difficult to remove it .
Journals can retract articles from their online databases but libraries all over the world are stocked with printed journals that cannot be recalled .
It was how to tackle this problem of fraudulent papers remaining in circulation that prompted Ribrault and her colleagues , all PhD students in life sciences , to set up their Scientific Red Cards website .
As a research student she was concerned that there was a lot of informal comment on which papers could not be trusted but little reliable information .
" There were lots of people saying do n't trust this paper because it has been falsified , do n't trust this guy because he has been hiding a conflict of interest , " she told the meeting .
She pointed out that even where a published paper is found to be tainted by fraud " sometimes the paper is not retracted , depending on the policy of the journal , and even if the paper is retracted sometimes it 's still cited after the retraction .
"
The database will contain the bibliographic reference of the paper , the type of misconduct , and a link to a published account of the misconduct .
Papers affected by falsification , fabrication and plagiarism will be included as well as cases where editorial policies and standards have not been respected or research subjects have been treated unethically .
Ribrault said they had listed 30 papers so far .
" We think better visibility of misconduct for scientists could promote scientific integrity , " she said .
" Making scientific misconduct known to the scientific community could act as a deterrent to other misbehaviour .
"
The meeting gave a cautious welcome to the proposals but pointed out that unless the students were careful they could expose themselves to legal problems .
There was also concern that the reputations of innocent co-authors might be tarnished .
Others said that the project was in the tradition of the self - policing of the scientific community and should be supported .
Ribrault stressed that access to reliable scientific information was essential for well - informed democratic decision - making .
" We are all interested in the relation between science and society and the impact science has on society .
" The meeting in Madrid on 17 - 18 November was organised by the newly formed Research Integrity Forum of the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) in collaboration with the Spanish National Research Council ( CSIC ) .
It continued work set in motion by the first world conference on research integrity held in Lisbon in September 2007 .
We ’ve already rewarded failure by bailing out the banking sector , because the alternative was worse .
If the same is true again , and it ’s cheaper to rescue the car companies than clean up the mess afterward , would n’t a rescue reflect a pragmatism that is precisely “ the philosophy of America ” ?
The solution is n’t a bailout , it ’s bankruptcy .
If the car companies enter Chapter 11 , they ’ll be able to rework burdensome contracts and actually make themselves competitive again .
That ’s how the airlines recovered , and auto companies should n’t be favored .
Bankruptcy would be a gamble because we just do n’t know whether cars from bankrupt companies will still sell .
I ’ll buy a $ 400 air ticket to fly on a bankrupt airline , because it ’ll still be honored in a month ’s time , but that does n’t mean I ’ll spend $ 30,000 on a car from a bankrupt company when I ’m counting on its resale value in 10 years ’ time .
While bankruptcy would help automakers extricate themselves from onerous contracts , the gap with foreign automakers is n’t as wide as some believe .
As my Times colleague David Leonhardt has noted , the reported $ 73 - an - hour wage in Detroit is a fiction .
Union workers at the Big Three get about $ 55 per hour in wages and benefits , compared with $ 45 per hour for nonunion workers at the American plants of Honda or Toyota .
One reason for the gap is that the Detroit labor force is older , and health and other benefits are always more expensive for a 50 - year - old worker than for one half that age .
A bailout is hopeless :
This is a bridge loan to nowhere .
Yes , the Obama administration will have to come back in January with a full rescue package .
The package should focus on saving jobs , not stockholders or bondholders .
Shareholders should lose most of their investments , bondholders should get a haircut , managers and board members should be ousted , autoworkers should have their pay and benefits trimmed to market levels , and taxpayers should get an equity stake that they could profit from .
But saving the auto sector is n’t hopeless .
Car companies have made progress in recent years , as underscored by the Chevy Volt , a plug - in hybrid that can go 40 miles without using a drop of gas .
( The catch is that if gas prices stay as low as they are now , consumers may instead be demanding gas - guzzling S.U.V.’s. )
Think of a bailout as part of the huge planned stimulus package .
It ’s much cheaper to keep people in their existing jobs than to create new jobs elsewhere .
I lived in Tokyo in the 1990s , as perfectly reasonable arguments for government restraint led to acquiescence in the face of escalating economic disasters .

More Kanjis In Games ?
's Kanji Tatsumi is one of the first video game personalities to confront his sexual identity in an engaging and meaningful manner .
His struggles and their outcome may not be politically progressive enough to dub him the Harvey Milk of gaming , but his unique existence inis a small and positive move forward toward a more socially diversified gaming universe .
First introduced as a rough - and - tumble teen with antisocial leanings , Kanji is feared by the locals and maintains a confrontational machismo toward the other characters throughout the game .
He is a loyal son and employee at his family 's textile shop , and it's not until the debut of his alter - ego Shadow Kanji that we are made aware of his inner sexual turmoil .
Shadow Kanji inhabits a steamy bathhouse dungeon inside The Midnight Channel , an alternate dimension inside the TV where the main characters must battle their alter - egos in order to save themselves and their friends .
The alter - egos manifest aspects of the main characters ' psyches that they are trying to hide from others and deny from themselves .
Once the alter - egos are defeated in The Midnight Channel , they are validated by the characters accepting them as necessary parts of their real personalities .
Shadow Kanji 's scanty attire , flamboyant lisp , and over - the - top homoerotic banter shed light upon Kanji 's hidden identity , but it is his remarks stating sexual preference for the male gender that directly support the notion that is Kanji is gay .
Once Shadow Kanji is defeated in the game , Kanji accepts that his gay alter - ego is an essential part of his personality , but he does not make any outward declaration or revelation that he is gay or remotely bisexual .
As the game progresses , Kanji must deal with jokes regarding his sexuality and un-manly artistic hobbies , in addition to his crush on a male character , who turns out to be a cross - dressing woman .
Intentionally and perhaps tellingly , especially when we examine homosexuality within a greater social context in Japan , there is no concrete conclusion provided by the game regarding his true orientation .
"
We would like everyone to play through the game and come up with their own answers to that question ; there is no official answer , " says Yu Namba , Atlus USA 'sProject Lead .
" What matters is that Kanji 's other self cries out , ' Accept me for who I am ! '
I think it 's a powerful message which many , if not all of us can relate to .
" Nich Maragos , Atlus USA 'sEditor , agrees with Namba that it is up to each individual player to draw their own conclusions , but his personal opinions sway toward a gay Kanji .
" At the end of Kanji 's Social Link , should you choose to advance it that far , he does say specifically in reference to his Shadow self , ' That ' other me ' is me .
'" Atlus Japan , the original developer of , was not available for comment .
" Most American gamers will assume he is gay , especially if they are not aware of Japan 's cultural differences and the subtleties of their interactions , " says Colette Bennett , Japanese RPG enthusiast and editor at consumer weblog Destructoid .
Brenda Brathwaite , game designer , professor , and author of Sex in Video Games has an altogether different perspective : " It would have been amazing if they would have made a concrete statement that he is gay .
That we could play as a gay main character in a video game would be a big deal .
" Says Brathwaite , " I can find twenty things that I did n't like about how Kanji was portrayed , such as the game 's juvenile nature in dealing with his sexuality , but there is a part of me that is thrilled there is a gay character in a game and that a game would portray how they are dealing with their inner struggles and interactions with friends .
" That Kanji 's character comes to American gamers through a Japanese game is not surprising .
Japanese attitudes toward sexuality and homosexuality are incredibly different than those of the West , even though the general assumption from Westerners is that the Japanese are a repressed people .
Because there is no legislation relating to homosexual sex , it 's not a hot - button social or moral issue in Japan like it is in America .
Many Japanese gay men resist the Western notion of " gay rights " because sexuality is not thought of in terms of what is right or wrong , but rather as play or something people may choose to engage in if they wish .
" The Japanese see homosexuality as a lifestyle choice , very different from the actual homosexual activity , " explains Dr. Antonia Levi , author of Samurai from Outer Space : Understanding Japanese Animation .
"
There is an understanding that you can play with fantasies that you might not want to live out in your normal life , " Levi says .
" Americans see things in very black and white -- you 're either gay , or you 're not .
The Japanese are more comfortable with the concept of being gay and not being gay at the same time .
In this case , it makes sense that , in the end , the game is not telling you what to think about Kanji or even if he is gay .
" Because outward unorthodox behavior is frowned upon in Japanese society , many people who engage in homosexual activity see it as a world separate from their day - to - day lives .
Upholding respectable outward behavior would mean being married , having children and having a respectable job , but what ones does in their sexual lives is not harshly judged .
For Kanji , working at his family 's textile shop was a very traditional and respectable job , one that could have been at risk had he made a lifestyle choice to have an openly gay relationship with another man .
Japan scholar Dr. Mark McLelland says , " Even though homosexual characters are very prevalent in the Japanese media , its visibility in comic books , women 's magazines , TV dramas and talk - shows , movies and popular fiction has not created the space for individuals expressing lesbian or gay ' identities ' to come out in actual life . " " Yet , as recent research has shown , the notion of ' coming out ' is seen as undesirable by many Japanese gay men and lesbians as it necessarily involves adopting a confrontational stance against mainstream lifestyles and values , which many still wish to endorse .
"
In Kanji 's case , remaining ambiguous and undeclared about his sexuality is not necessarily a rejection of its existence or the developers displaying homophobia , but rather as a comment on homosexuality in a greater Japanese social context .
In translating the game for a Western audience , Atlus USA 's goal was to retain as much of the original content as possible in order to accurately portray the Japanese culture .
Namba explains , " We did encounter a small number of sexually oriented instances which we decided to make more subtle , but the meaning of everything is still intact .
" For instance , keeping Shadow Kanji 's over - the - top flamboyance was important .
" That flamboyance was also what the viewers of the Midnight Channel wanted to see : a typical gay person on TV that people would laugh at .
The TV station broadcasts what the audience prefers to watch -- it 's a stark portrayal of modern society .
" The response to Kanji 's character has been generally neutral or positive among players of .
Google for any forums on threads about Kanji and you 'll see comments such as : " I really love how brave Atlus was with releasing a game with with stuff like this in North America . " and " Kanji .
I love Kanji .
He is all that is adorable .
However , it would have been nice if they 'd just gone ahead and made him gay .
" Whether more characters as complex and socially relevant as Kanji 's will appear in more games available in America is really up to American developers .
User - created characters aside , one can count on a single hand the number of playable LGBT characters that have entered into the gaming world .
" From a ratings standpoint , when you 're a game designer , you are so incredibly aware of the ramifications of the M rating .
Putting any sex in your game , would potentially limit the market , " explains Brathwaite .
( carries an M rating . ) " There is also double perception that games are for kids .
But eventually , we will want to tell more complex and mature stories .
For example , had an incredibly adult storyline , even though it did n't deal with sexuality .
" So far , not many developers have chosen to tackle topics such as a character 's sexual orientation in their titles .
ESRB ratings , a risk - averse market , and lack of diversity in the developer pool are all factors that contribute to the slow social evolution of games .
" I do n't think American developers have evolved to the point where they are comfortable with portraying characters like Kanji , " says Destructoid 's Bennett .
" For the most part , any characters that are bisexual , gay or transgendered are either horrible stereotypes or their sexuality is just referenced on occasion . "
" I would like to see more characters like Kanji in games , and what I mean is not just characters struggling to cope with their sexuality or inner demons , but characters who face more complex emotional , human struggles than just how to get the princess or fight some ultimate boss at the end of a game , " she adds .
" I feel that the closer games bring us to reality the closer they come to evolution , where we play games not just for fun and entertainment , but to have compelling , resonant experiences as memorable as those in our real lives . "
One of my favorite ways to save time on the command - line is to utilize the directory stack to jump between tasks .
Today ’s article will show you how to do this and provide some tips for effective use .
What is the directory stack ?
Most Linux environments have a way for you to put paths on a stack ( push ) and then take them off in reverse order ( pop ) .
This is useful when you have more than one directory that you need to switch between frequently .
Let ’s take a look at how to do this .
The pushd command
Suppose you need to switch between your project : ~/ src / myproject , your web - server : /opt/webserver7/logs and some code examples : ~/ examples / othercode often .
You add things to the directory stack with pushd like so :
# switch from project to web server and put on the stack pushd / opt/ webserver7/logs # Stack is now '/opt/webserver7/logs ~/src/myproject ' # show latest errors tail - 40 errors.log
Now your in your server logs and you want to go to the examples :
# switch from project to web server and put on the stack pushd ~/ examples / othercode # Stack is now '~/examples/othercode /opt/webserver7/logs ~/src/myproject ' # bring the 3rd directory on the stack to the front ( 0 - based ) and rotating the stack pushd +2 # Stack is now '~/src/myproject ~/examples/othercode /opt/webserver7/logs ' # copy Java example to myproject cp MyExample .
java ` dirs | awk '{print $ 1} ' `
The popd command
Now we want to go back to my project to deploy it to our web server .
Since we have our directory stack working we can do this quickly :
# go back to myproject popd # Stack is now '~ /examples/othercode /opt/webserver7/logs ' # deploy stuff ant dist
For the purposes of this example , let ’s pretend we do n’t care to go back to the examples .
Let ’s remove it from the stack :
# remove examples from the directory stack popd +0 # Stack is now '/opt/webserver7/logs '
One final pop will get me back to my server logs once I test it out in my browser .
Of course , we can keep using the stack continuously .
Alternatives and nifty tips
You might not always want to use the directory stack .
You can use these really fast shortcuts to navigate to home or back quickly :
# change to home directory quickly in bash cd # change to last directory in bash cd -
Now for some final examples that may help out just a little more :
# print directories on the stack dirs # hey just type less alias p = ' pushd ' alias o = ' popd '
Conclusion
Using pushd and popd effectively can help you get around your command - line environment quickly .

Take a bit of time to get the hang of it now and it ’ll pay off later .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 27 ( UPI ) -- A Bush administration spokeswoman said the invitations to this year 's White House Hanukkah reception bore images of Christmas trees due to a " staff mistake . "
Press Secretary Sally McDonough said staff members erred in failing to print separate cards for invitations to the different holiday events at the White House , CNN reported Thursday .

The cards , which were sent to U.S. Jewish leaders , are emblazoned with an image of the White House Christmas tree being pulled by a horse - drawn cart with a Christmas wreath tacked on to the White House in the background .
" Mrs. Bush is apologetic , It is just something that fell through the cracks , " McDonough said .
She said the intended Hanukkah invitations , which bear the image of a menorah given to the White House during the Harry Truman administration , would be sent out Thursday .
Clearly , Barack Obama can draw a crowd .
About 50,000 people in Orlando , Fla. ; 75,000 in Kansas City , Mo. ; 100,000 in St. Louis .
And on Tuesday , more than 30,000 on the Miami waterfront , where Obama used a sunset rally to target the truthfulness of Republican rival John McCain .
“ Apparently , Sen. McCain ’s decided that if he can’t beat our ideas , then he ’s just going to make up some ideas and run against those , ” Obama shouted into the balmy night air .
“ Well , what we need now is not straw men ; we do n’t need misleading charges .
What we need is honest leadership and real change . ”
But the rock - star scene has grown so familiar that it ’s no longer surprising -- or terribly newsworthy -- when the Democratic nominee attracts a super - sized audience .
So Obama dulled things down on the second day of a Florida swing , presiding over an economic round table so academic it could have been professor Obama teaching one of his constitutional law classes .

The afternoon event in Lake Worth was grand in ambition : a round table with several Democratic governors , a former head of the Federal Reserve , the chief executive of Google .
It was stately in execution , down to the 12 furled flags standing , sentry - like , against a blue - curtained backdrop .
It was also the rare Obama appearance that left his audience of 1,800 slumping into -- not leaping out of -- their seats .
“ It ’s not what I was expecting , ” said Victoria Pierre - Louis , 32 , a Haitian immigrant and campaign volunteer , who sped up her citizenship application so she could vote Nov. 4 .
“ I ’m already a supporter , so I kind of know everything he ’s doing .
I was just waiting for a chance to scream and holler . ”
But if the dozy headline from the seminar was “ Obama meets economic leaders , ” as opposed to “ Obama draws another humongous mob , ” that suited his strategy just fine .
Florida is suffering .
As Obama pointed out , the state has lost more jobs in recent months than economically strapped Michigan and Ohio .

“ We packed the schedule with rallies ; we ’re telling people to vote early , ” said Jennifer Psaki , an Obama spokeswoman .
“ We also want people . . . to know what the [ economic ] solutions are and what the steps are going to be if Sen. Obama becomes president . ”
So after the crowd exhausted chants of “ Yes , we can ! ” and “ We will rock you ! ” Obama begged their forbearance for “ a more serious discussion ” with “ some of the smartest people you ever care to meet . ”
He outlined his economic recovery proposal , including a tax cut for working families , a tax credit for companies creating domestic jobs and a public - works plan to put people back to work .
Google ’s Eric Schmidt chimed in with talk of futuristic technologies .
Ohio Gov.
Ted Strickland discussed his state ’s “ electricity restructuring bill , ” aimed at promoting alternative energy .
Paul Volcker , the former Fed chair , mumbled through a sometimes indiscernible discussion of market volatility and the recent upheaval on Wall Street .
Some welcomed the conversation .
“ I thought it was going to be a pep rally , and I see intelligent people having a discussion about lots of things .
How could it be a bad thing ? ” asked Fred Sklar , 56 , a water management scientist from West Palm Beach .
Advertisement
After 90 - odd minutes , Strickland finally roused the audience with a political rejoinder , a poke at Joe the Plumber , the Ohioan who has become an economic totem for McCain and fellow Republicans .
Strickland said he had just visited Joe Wurzelbacher ’s neighborhood , where he met “ Sean the Ironworker , ” who asked him to pass on a message to Obama : “ Tell him Sean the Ironworker is building a bridge for him to the White House . ”
That got them cheering .

The announcement that British troops are set to withdraw from Iraq has triggered further calls for an inquiry into the war .
The government has repeatedly cast aside demands for an inquiry with the reasoning it would be unhelpful while combat operations are ongoing .
" Now that Brown 's fig leaf of a major British operation is set to disappear , he has no excuse to delay any longer on holding a full public inquiry into how this foreign policy catastrophe happened , " said Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .
All but several hundred of British troops are expected to have left Iraq by June next year , defence sources have confirmed .
Just 4,100 of the 45,000 soldiers that the UK sent to Iraq in the 2003 invasion remain in the country - the vast majority in the south around Basra .
" Our whole country will breathe a sigh of relief that an end to this illegal war is now in sight , " Mr Clegg said .
According to officials speaking on condition of anonymity the withdrawal will begin next March , six years after the invasion .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said : " We continue to negotiate our own future legal arrangements for the UK military role with the government of Iraq .
" Our negotiations have made good progress to date and we expect to be able to agree a sound legal framework with the government of Iraq before the end of the year . "
About 300 troops are expected to remain in Basra to continue training and mentoring Iraqi security forces , with the rest being redeployed to Afghanistan .
The United Nations mandate for coalition troops in Iraq expires this year .
The US has committed itself to withdrawing troops from next year , with its military presence completely removed by the end of 2011 .
Friday 's PPI report for November 2008 again showed a significant price decline , as did Thursday 's import - and export price report .
Most likely , next week 's CPI report will also show a decline in prices ( though likely a lot less dramatic ) .
And it also seems likely that when the reports for December are published about a month from now , these price indexes will show another decline .
The most important reason for this was that money supply growth earlier this year had turned first stagnant and then directly negative .
That had an immediate impact on the most flexible prices , which is to prices traded in financial markets , including stocks and commodities , although in those cases the global economic downturn had a significant impact as well as it causes corporate earnings and demand for commodities to decline .
Yet we are now likely starting to see the beginning of the end of this brief deflationary period .
The reason for this is a reversal of the previous deflationary monetary trends .
After reaching a low in the week to October 6 , MZM has risen by a full 3.3 % in the following 8 weeks , which translates into an annual rate of 23.5 % .
M2 has risen somewhat less , " only " 2.3 % , yet that translates into 16 % .
And for those who prefer the extremely narrow M1 measure , that is up 5.1 % , which translates into an annual rate of 38 % .
The monetary base is up 49.2 % during this 8 week period , which in case you 're wondering translates into an annual rate of 1246 % .
Bernanke has n't just brought out the helicopters , he has brought out the B - 2 bombers too , so to speak .
Because of the extremely high risk aversion , and deteriorating fundamentals for other assets , this massive onslaught of liquidity had at first simply the effect of brining down the effective Fed funds rate ( now at just 0.14 % , despite the fact that the official target is 1 % ) and Treasury yields , which at all maturities are trading at all time lows despite the massive increase in the supply of Treasuries due to the dramatic increase in the budget deficit .
However , the recovery in stocks and commodities and the decline in the dollar in recent weeks could be a sign that the excess liquidity is spreading from the perceived safe havens to more risky assets , although it must be noted that the weak global economy will probably mean more setbacks for these assets .
Still , with Treasury yields so ridiculously low , particularly at the short end ( where they as I noted earlier had fallen to zero ) certainly creates a climate conducive for alternative assets , despite weak fundamentals .
And sooner or later , all the newly created money will spread to other assets and other parts of the economy , and bid up prices of more than just Treasuries .
Pleas from aid groups , the United Nations and the European Union for an immediate ceasefire to help deal with a humanitarian crisis faced by Gaza 's 1.5 million population have so far been frustrated by continuing rocket fire from the Strip .
Israel showed no willingness to let up on a campaign that it believes has pushed Hamas into a corner while Hamas militants continued to fire rockets into Israel in spite of the threat of immediate targeted reprisals by Israel .
A man wearing a black leather mask used a sex toy to belt a woman about the head before tying her pet dog to a tree until it choked to death , a north Queensland court has been told .
Mackay Magistrates Court heard Shaun Michael Burke , 38 , from Mount Pleasant near Mackay , and a 21 - year - old woman broke into a home at Andergrove at 3:00 am AEST on Monday .
Today the court was told Burke wore a black leather mask and was armed with a large rubber dildo wrapped in duct tape , which he used to assault the 49 - year - old female occupant of the house .
Burke then allegedly assaulted the woman about the face and head with the dildo , leaving her with bruising and small bumps to the face .
The mother , together with her 19 - year - old son who witnessed the event , then escaped the home .
Burke and his female co-accused then allegedly took the family dog , a lahasa apso , to a nearby park , where they taped the dog to a tree , causing it to asphyxiate and die .
Police have charged the pair with robbery with violence , wilful killing of an animal and entering a dwelling with intent .
Police prosecutor Sergeant Sabine Scott said the strength of evidence was strong , with witnesses and possible forensic evidence .
Sergeant Scott said police were investigating further charges against the man .
Burke was remanded in custody to reappear in Mackay Magistrates Court tomorrow , while his co-accused was released on bail to appear in the same court on January 29 .
The woman , who was not identified in court , is from Bucasia near Mackay .
Two of the charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , Sergeant Scott told the court .

With the lion ’s share of the 1,300 Palestinians killed in the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip innocent civilians , there remains considerable international disquiet over the nation ’s conduct during the war , particularly in light of its use of white phosphorus weapons in densely populated civilian neighborhoods .
But both the government and the military remain undaunted , defended every last killing as necessary .
“ I am at peace with the fact that we did it , ” insists Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who is in charge of the international effort to repair Israel ’s image in the wake of its latest war .
She dismissed concerns about the civilian toll as a “ product of circumstance , ” adding “ we seek out terrorists , and it can happen . ”
The Israeli military likewise defended its behavior during the war , pointing to the thousands of threatening phone calls it made to Gazan civilians before the attacks and the enormous number of pamphlets they dropped from planes ordering them to flee their homes before they were destroyed in air strikes .
They also repeated the accusations ( without any new evidence to back them up ) that Hamas was using civilians as human shields , and claimed that they also used ambulances for transportation .
Considering the number of Israeli attacks on ambulances during the three week assault , and the difficulty legitimate ambulances had with getting anywhere near wounded civilians , this would seem like a poor mode of transportation .
A Tully High School student and her parents are facing misdemeanor charges following the arrest Sunday morning of a 15 - year - old girl on charge of driving while intoxicated , state police said Thursday .
Jeffrey Keyes , 42 , Kandice Keyes , 43 , and Lauren Keyes , 17 , of 595 Long Road , Tully , were all charged with endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child , both misdemeanors .
Troopers were called at 3 a.m.
Sunday to a one - car crash on Gatehouse Road in Tully , state police Investigator Richard Dix said .
The vehicle , with four young people inside , had struck a telephone pole and rolled over , Dix said .
The 15 - year - old driver suffered a minor injury but the other three , who were all 15 , were n't harmed , Dix said .
The driver had taken her parents ' car without her parents ' knowledge , Dix said .
She was charged with DWI and , because the driver was under 16 , on the state 's Zero Tolerance Law , Dix said .
The investigation revealed that the driver drank alcohol that night at a party thrown by Lauren Keyes at her Long Road home , Dix said .
Keyes had sent out a text message a week earlier to several Tully High School students inviting them to her birthday party and informing them that alcohol would be served , Dix said .
The text message said the party goers were invited to stay over at her home , Dix said .
Keyes ' parents , Jeffrey and Kandice Keyes , were aware alcohol was going to be served at the party and were present at the party , Dix said .
All three are expected to appear at 7 p.m. Nov. 18 in Tully Town Court , Dix said .
The 15 - year - old driver , who troopers are not naming , could face a Department of Motor Vehicles hearing which could determine how long she may have to wait before she is able to get a driver 's license in the state , Dix said .

I was making coffee in my room each morning at the start of the semester before my loan money arrived .
I will admit that I was not always the cleanest person .
I usually left the whole pot alone until I cleaned it at night to set it up for the next morning .
When my loan money came in I started to drink the more expensive coffee offered on campus and ignored the coffee maker in my room .
After a couple of weeks I was down too much money on designer coffee and decided to make a pot of normal stuff .
I opened the basket and found that a ton of fire ants had made a home out of my filthy coffee maker .
Well , I cleaned the pot out as best I could .
Then I ran some water through it to clean out any ants that were left .
My mistake was assuming that all the ants were in the basket or flushed from the first pot .
I brewed a pot of coffee and started to drink it .
I failed to notice the little ant bodies floating in the pot .
After a cup and a half my whole face was tingling and felt numb in patches .
It did n't take me long to sort out what was going on .
The ant toxin was in the coffee .
I slowly drank some more just to see what the affects would be like .
They were pretty unpleasant .
Really tingly itching all over my face and I started to feel flush .
I stopped at this point and went and drank some water .
My roommate had a steroid injector so I was n't worried about having a real bad allergic reaction .
Having more did n't really add to the affect .
Once I had started to feel it the toxin was pretty much working in full force .
I have very mild reactions to bites from these ants .
If I had been more allergic it is likely I would have needed that steroid injection and a trip to the hospital .
I did not do this on purpose and I would not do it again .
But it was a unique experience with caffeine .
It was funny in a way to feel both of these interactions at the same time .
This is by far the strangest pot of coffee that I have ever had .
In the beginning , the band was a band .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The House on Wednesday evening passed an $ 819 billion economic stimulus package Wednesday on a party - line vote , despite President Obama 's efforts to achieve bipartisan support for the bill .
The final vote was 244 to 188 .
No Republicans voted for the bill , while 11 Democrats voted against it .
The Senate is likely to take up the bill next week .
" I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk , " Obama said in a statement after the vote .
" We must move swiftly and boldly to put Americans back to work , and that is exactly what this plan begins to do . "
In floor debate earlier , House Democrats offered near - unanimous support for the bill , touting the package 's ability to quickly create jobs and jumpstart economic growth .
" One week and one day ago , our new President delivered a great inaugural address ... which I believe is a great blueprint for the future , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
" With swift and bold action today , we are doing just that -- with this vote today , we are taking America in a new direction . "
But Republicans , who are outnumbered in the House , have pushed back , expressing concern about the large amount of spending in the bill , and have criticized the tax cut provisions for not going far enough .
" The underlying bill , while it has some good provisions , has a lot of wasteful provisions and slow - moving spending in it , " said House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" We have to act -- we have to heal the ailing economy .
The question is how to do it best ; we think that fast - acting tax relief is the way to get it done . "
The House voted down a Republican amendment , which would have cut a significant portion of the bill 's spending and greatly expanded the amount of tax cuts in the bill .
Obama spent much of his first week as president rallying support for the bill .
After meeting with congressional leadership of both parties on Friday , he met with Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday and a dozen CEOs on Wednesday .
Obama and House Democrats etched out plans for a stimulus package in the weeks leading up to the president 's inauguration .
Two House committees amended and added some provisions , resulting in $ 607 billion in direct pending and appropriations and $ 212 billion in tax cuts .
The fact that 11 Democrats voted against the House package is significant , said Dan Clifton , the head of policy research at Strategas Research Partners .
" First , it gives Republicans cover , " Clifton said .
" And it gives extreme leverage to the Senate . "
Next week , the full Senate will vote on its version , which differs in some significant ways from the House bill .
The two chambers will then need to reconcile their differences before each vote on the final version .
To pass the package in the Senate , Democrats will need 60 votes -- meaning at least two Republicans .
Senate passage is expected , Clifton said .
" But it 's a question of whether you get 60 votes or 80 votes . "
Congress has put the legislation on a fast track , as many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree that swift action is needed to help pull the economy out of a deep recession .
Both Democratic and Republican leaders have said they aim to get the bill to Obama 's desk for him to sign before lawmakers '
Presidents Day recess in mid-February .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Gertrude Baines , a 114 - year - old California resident , will likely be crowned the world 's oldest woman , according to the organization that keeps track of such honors .
Gertrude Baines told CNN two years ago that she has taken good care of herself , " the way ( God ) wanted me to . "
The previous oldest woman was Maria de Jesus , who died this week in Portugal at age 115 , Guinness World Records said .
Baines -- born to former slaves in a small town south of Atlanta , Georgia , in 1894 -- now lives in a Los Angeles nursing home .
Baines appeared cheerful and talkative when the Los Angeles Times interviewed her in November as she cast her vote for Barack Obama for president , whom she said she supported because " he 's for the colored people . "
" I 'm glad we 're getting a colored man in there , " she said .
Baines apparently prefers using the older term for her race .
She was well into her 70s when " African - American " became the common reference in the United States .
Watch Baines speak to CNN
She told the Times she spends most of her time " doing nothing but eating and sleeping . "
When CNN interviewed Baines two years ago , she was asked to explain why she thought she has lived so long .
" God .
Ask him .
I took good care of myself , the way he wanted me to , " Baines said .
Her only child , a daughter , died of typhoid fever at age 18 .
Much of her long life was lived in Ohio , where she worked as a " house mom " at a state university .
She eventually divorced and traveled to Los Angeles , where she retired .
Baines will not officially be given the title until after Guinness World Records completes an investigation , the organization said .
" Maria was crowned the world 's Oldest Living Woman by Guinness World Records on 28 December upon the death of Edna Parker , " the group said .
Parker -- an American -- was 115 years , 220 days old when she died November 26 , 2008 , in an Indiana nursing home , it said .

Abstract
We present solutions for enhancing the spatial and / or temporal resolution of videos .
Our algorithm targets the emerging consumer - level hybrid cameras that can simultaneously capture video and high - resolution stills .
Our technique produces a high spacetime resolution video using the high - resolution stills for rendering and the low - resolution video to guide the reconstruction and the rendering process .
Our framework integrates and extends two existing algorithms , namely a high - quality optical flow algorithm and a high - quality image - based - rendering algorithm .
The framework enables a variety of applications that were previously unavailable to the amateur user , such as the ability to ( 1 ) automatically create videos with high spatiotemporal resolution , and ( 2 ) shift a high - resolution still to nearby points in time to better capture a missed event .

Seagaia Ocean Dome
was
In Miyazaki , Miyazaki , Japan there lies an amazingly beautiful beach , where you can sunbathe , swim , and play in the sand .
It also sports a fake , flame blasting volcano .
Oh yeah , and it is Thethe world 's biggest indoor waterpark , featuring 300 meters in length of sheer , awesome beach , and 100 meters wide .
It has it's own entry listed in the Guinness World Records for being the biggest indoor waterpark .
It opened in 1993 , but it 's peak amount of visitors happened in 1995 , averaging 1.25 million visits a year .
The Ocean Dome was closed on October 1st , 2007 ( although I do n't know why ) .
The sand was warm and artificial , and the volcano gave the beach a powerful atmosphere .
Every hour , the volcano erupts , and the wave machines start up , which would give visitors a chance some sanitized surfing !
The dome 's roof was retractable , so that natural sunlight could also shed some rays to the visitors below , but whether it rained or not , the closed roof provided light and permant blue sky , with pillowy clouds .
The air temperature in the Ocean Dome was held constantly at 30 celcius , and the water at around 28 celcius .
The admission price was Â¥2600 per adult and Â ¥1600 for children , about $ 25 to $ 30 USD , depending on the season .

I am hesitant to compliment Tucker ’s A Book that Changes Everything , given that he generously over - praises me in it , but I ca n’t help it–it ’s really a great piece–just perfect .
And he has a tantalizing suggestion in it : “ As I ’ve thought more about their book , it seems that it might suggest a revision in classical - liberal theory .
We have traditionally thought that cooperation and competition were the two pillars of social order ; a third could be added : emulation .
In addition , there is surely work to do here that integrates Hayek ’s theory of knowledge with the problem of IP ”
Now , I ’ve long been critical of aspects of the Hayekian focus on “ knowledge problems ” ( see my post Knowledge vs. Calculation ) .
But Tucker has a good point .
Property rights are rights in scarce resources .
All actions employ means , including scarce resources in our bodies , and in appropriated scarce resources ( property ) .
All action employs these means to attain certain ends .
But all action is based on information or knowledge : beliefs by the actor about what causal laws are operative , what ends are possible , and so on .
People acquire knowledge as they develop and grow ; some by introspection and experience , but so much more is acquired dissemination from others , by those in one ’s community , and by the inherited body of knowledge passed down , and added to , over the centuries .
Emulation and the acquisition of knowledge play a key role–are essential to–society , and economy .
So Tucker has hit the nail on the head : one problem with IP is that by monopolizing information , knowledge–patterns–it restricts and locks up the flow of knowledge .
It thus impedes the operations of the free market and productivity , by reducting the scope of human action , impairing its efficiency by hampering the means at one ’s disposal .
Update : See also my Against Intellectual Property , p. 53 , noting that “ All action , including action which employs owned scarce means ( property ) , involves the use of technical knowledge .
Some of this knowledge may be gained from things we see , including the property of others . ”
Also , see my Knowledge , Calculation , Conflict , and Law , pp. 58 - 59 , arguing that it should be realized that “ knowledge ” is merely a “ technical problem that confronts any individual when choosing means to achieve certain ends , and when deciding which ends to pursue . …
The need to acquire knowledge faces even Crusoe alone on his island , who has no need for private - property rules because there are no other people and thus no possibility of interpersonal conflict . ”
And see Guido HuÌˆlsmann ’s Knowledge , Judgment , and the Use of Property :
However , there is still a more fundamental condition of action .
This is the fact that knowledge as such is never scarce .
Knowledge problems thus do have a place in economics only insofar as knowledge has to be selected for application .
Yet the selection of knowledge depends entirely on the property of the acting person .
At each moment we dispose of a myriad of information , and we often know of many ways to achieve any given end .
For example , if my apartment is cold , I could keep my body warm through gymnastics or additional sweaters .
I could also burn parts of my furniture or simply turn on the heating and pay higher bills .
I could also sit down in my armchair and invent a new technology permitting one to heat my apartment at half of the present cost .
To be sure , the latter alternative is the most elegant one .
In any case , as conditions do not cease to change , we constantly have to acquire new knowledge if only to conserve our present standard of living .
However , economic science does not have to deal with the factors conditioning the acquisition of knowledge . …
For the moment we are entirely unconcerned with the creation of knowledge , that is , of judgments that prove to be successful in action .
We do not bother about the way we reduce our sheer ignorance .
Rather we have to consider the principles that govern the selection of the judgments that we actually apply in our actions .
… In choosing the most important action we implicitly select some parts of our technological knowledge for application .
In other terms , our choices imply a judgment upon the importance of our technological knowledge under the expected conditions of our action .
This economic judgment is our only concern .
Technological knowledge as such is immaterial for economics .
Notice how Hülsmann here distinguishes between action , and the means one employes , and the “ technological knowledge ” ones uses to guide one ’s actions , to employ various causal means in the world to achieve certain ends–but that it is distinct from action and means .
AS TROUBLES in the banking industry have moved back into the limelight , the need for a broader , and more effective solution has again become clear .
While the use of the initial TARP allotment has prevented any immediate collapse , it seems clear that fears of insolvency ( and actual insolvency ) are going to remain a problem .
Some banks will be forced to return to the trough repeatedly , and lending , in general , will remain moribund .
Last week , Ben Bernanke gave his menu of options to the incoming Obama administration ( T - minus one day , and counting ) .
They had the look and the promise of warmed up leftovers .
The purchase of troubled assets was on there , as was loan guarantees and equity injections , and the creation of a massive government " bad bank " .
Not really on the list was nationalisation .
But it seems to me , based on an ongoingblogospheric discussion , that nationalisation is the only good option left .
The basic problem is this — some banks are likely insolvent .
Any option that solves the problem by buying bad assets will either fail ( if those assets are bought at face value — recall , the banks are insolvent ) or will succeed by buying those assets at well more than they 're worth .
The latter option is a large and generous gift to the bank 's shareholders .
The question is , why would one want to give a large and generous gift to bank shareholders , out of the taxpayer 's purse ?
And the answer most commonly given seems to be , " to avoid nationalisation " .
But why ?
One concern seems to be that the practice is n't particularly liberal or " American " .
But from a purist 's standpoint , neither is the cutting of billions of dollars in cheques to insolvent banks .
Another concern may be the problem of whether the government can manage banks effectively .
But of course , the current ownership has already failed miserably , to the point that taxpayer money is necessary to prevent a devastating collapse .
These banks grew so large that their faliure threatened the global financial system , and then proceeded to fail .
To simply hand over the money necessary to return them to solvency would abuse the taxpayer 's trust , reward bad behaviour , and send a terrible signal to other bad financial actors out there .
Time to quit mucking around and make with the nationalisations .
As the Israeli raids on Gaza and Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israel continue , BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen assesses why both Israel and Hamas seem likely to pursue the conflict .
After two weeks of war both sides have reasons to believe they can fight on .
Israel has suffered relatively light casualties , a fraction of the dead and wounded of Gaza .
Even though many reserve units have now been mobilised , which means a large number of husbands and fathers are in uniform and potentially in the line of fire , public support for the war is holding steady .
Israel has not won the arguments internationally over its methods
The government has managed the war of Israeli expectations far more effectively than it did in Lebanon in 2006 .
Victory has been defined in less sweeping terms , so that it will be harder for anyone to accuse the government of failure .
Even so , it has set objectives that need to be met if Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Defence Minister Ehud Barak are going to have any kind of political career when this is over .
Unlike Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who is leaving office because of allegations of corruption , Mr Barak and Ms Livni face a general election on 10 February .
They have set two main objectives , neither of which has been achieved yet .
First , damage the Hamas military wing so badly that they will either be unable to launch rockets into Israel , or be so intimidated that they will not dare .
Israel 's second demand is that the border between Gaza and Egypt is controlled so that Hamas will not be able to bring in weapons and money through tunnels .
The conflict has lasted the best part of a century , which suggests that this latest episode , bloody and brutal though it is , will not be decisive
Israel can feel the international pressure to stop .
It has persuaded many of its allies that it has the right to defend itself , but it has not won the argument over the methods it is using .
Israel 's international image is taking a severe beating because it is killing so many civilians and so many children .
But with the United States abstaining in the ceasefire vote at the UN Security Council , Israel feels comfortable enough to dismiss the resolution because it says it is " not practical and will not be implemented by the Palestinian terror organisations " .
Moment to fight Hamas has reasons to fight on too .
Like Israel , it has dismissed the ceasefire resolution .
It has demanded a ceasefire that opens all Gaza 's crossings to Egypt as well as Israel , and a halt to military action and complete pullout by the Israelis .
Israel 's aim is to stop Hamas rocket fire completely
While it can fire rockets into Israel and mortars and rifles at Israeli troops , Hamas will not consider itself beaten .
Hamas leaders in Gaza have gone underground .
But based on the few messages that they have sent out from their hiding places , and statements from Hamas leaders in exile , it is possible to make some reasonable guesses about their thinking .
They have an ideology of struggle , resistance and sacrifice .
They could have extended the ceasefire with Israel but chose not to do so .
Hamas believed they would have to fight Israel at some time ( the feeling was mutual ) and it seems that they have decided that the moment has come .
Civilian deaths in Gaza are most likely seen not as reasons to stop but as a reason to go on .
I can't say for sure , but if I was able to sit with Hamas leaders , as I have done quite a bit in the last year , I think this is how their logic would go .
They might say that Israel has shown its real agenda towards Palestinians - not peace , but war and death .
And they might go on to say that stopping now would betray the dead and encourage Israel to go in even harder .
Third phase
The template of the 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah is in the minds of both sides .
Hamas is intent on surviving its clash with the powerful Israeli army Hamas would like to do the same as Hezbollah , and take on the most powerful army in the Middle East , punish it , and live to tell the tale .
That is an experience Israel does not want to repeat .
It wants its enemies to be nervous , very nervous , about what it might do .
If Israel is going to fight on , the next stage will be for it to deploy the reservists who have been mobilised and equipped in the last 10 days or so be sent into Gaza .
Committing the reserves means the operation moves into a third phase , seizing more ground in Gaza , following the first week of air strikes , and the ground offensive of the second week .
The war in Gaza is the latest instalment in a very long conflict .
Foreign leaders and diplomats who are trying to create peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis should take a long perspective .
After all , the Palestinians and the Israelis do .
The conflict has lasted the best part of a century , which suggests that this latest episode , bloody and brutal though it is , will not be decisive .

Stevia Leaf Rescues the Soda Pop Industry
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
Long shunned by regulators and ignored by food and beverage processors in the U.S. , the natural non-calorie sweetener known as rebaudioside A , an extract derived from the green leaves of the stevia plant , is coming to the rescue of the soda pop industry .
The current widespread financial crisis has States searching for a way to generate new revenues ( New York wants an 18 % tax that would put an estimated $ 400 million in its coffers ) , and using the guise they are interested in taming the burgeoning diabesity epidemic , States aim to tax sweetened soft drinks , allegedly to reduce consumption .
Facing such a threat , major soft drink manufacturers have quickly ushered in stevia leaf and its extracts for approval by the Food & Drug Administration , and manufacturers have obtained self - affirmed GRAS status ( generally regarded as safe ) from a panel of independent experts , which gives assurance it is safe to use in the general population .
FDA foot - dragging on stevia
The U.S. is late in adopting Stevia as a sweetener .
Natural health advocates have grown wary of artificial sweeteners like aspartame , sucralose and saccharin .
Even after stevia gained entrance to the U.S. , it could not be labeled as a sweetener , only as a dietary supplement , which stunted its adoption by the public .
Foot - dragging by the FDA over stevia is just another issue that has not bode well with the public .
Up till now , tabletop sweeteners at restaurants have been limited to the artificial molecules , like aspartame and sucralose .
This is soon to change .
The U.S. is decades behind other countries in adoption of stevia leaf as a sweetener .
Stevia was first used in South America , and was introduced to Japan in the 1970s and by 1988 it comprised 41 % of the sweetener market there .
It has been used in soft drinks in Japan for a number of years .
Rebaudioside A and other Stevia products are approved for general food use in Australia , New Zealand , Switzerland , Russia , Israel ( as of October 2008 ) , Japan , South Korea , Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay and in a few other countries .
RebA has been approved for use in dietary supplements in the U.S. since 1995 .
Despite widespread use in foreign countries , with an apparent high safety profile , the Center for Science In The Public Interest has taken exception to the FDA ’s quick approval of stevia and its extracts .
A last - minute scientific stir has been created by FDA approval of stevia extract , with arguments from different quarters that stevia needs more testing or that one study showed it may cause DNA mutations .
But the FDA had been evaluating reams of data on stevia for years and only chose to approve stevia under recent pressure from the major soft drink makers .
It ’s obvious that none of the yellow flags being thrown by scientists have anything to do with public safety since these products have been used in human populations for years without apparent harm .
Just the 1983 increase in the federal tax on cigarettes saved 40,000 lives per year .
Just how many cases of diabetes and obesity will be averted with the introduction of stevia is beyond estimation at this point .
Some have heralded stevia as a " new drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 ( adult onset ) diabetes mellitus . "
[ Metabolism 2006 Dec ; 55 ( 12) :1674— 80 ]
Sadly , health promotion appears to be a secondary issue next to the commercial interests of beverage companies to maintain sales and State governments to raise revenues .
Taste still rules
Being forced to use stevia via economic pressure certainly does n’t give major carbonated beverage manufacturers an image as health advocates , but under the threat of a tax that will surely reduce consumption ( estimated 5 % reduction in sales ) , and result in removal of all soda pop from vending machines in public schools , fizzy drink makers are certainly going to let the public know about this healthier option on product labels .
Millions of consumers are likely to try the first brands that feature stevia and from there it will be up to the public ’s taste buds to judge whether stevia becomes a rage among American soft drink users .
Not every beverage tastes good with stevia .
Citrus drinks work best .
A Wall Street Journal article says formulators are still working to produce a desirable cola taste with stevia .
One thing is for sure , as consumers drink more stevia sweetened drinks , the nation will get a better picture of how much high - fructose corn syrup has contributed to diabetes and obesity .
The soft drink industry denies its products have contributed to burgeoning waistlines or high blood sugar .
Stevia suppliers vie for business
Recently companies like Blue California ( Santa Margarita , California ) have been able to extract a fraction of stevia leaf to produce an almost pure extract called rebaudioside A that is 400 times sweeter than table sugar .
Blue California ’s version of this natural sweetener , called Good & Sweet , is the first 97 % extract to achieve GRAS status , and the company is ready to supply 1200 metric tons a year to food and beverage makers .
Early on , insiders say Good & Sweet is the best - tasting stevia extract so far .
Good & Sweet will be offered as a tabletop sweetener under the brand name Bestevia to be distributed world - wide .
There are a lot of companies on Blue California ’s doorstep these days , with major announcements that Blue California ’s Good & Sweet has been selected by major food and beverage manufacturers anticipated soon .
The bidding for stevia is vigorous as companies seek to sign supply contracts before all the sources of stevia are depleted .
Other stevia manufacturers are jockeying for bragging rights .
This includes the giant agricultural supplier Cargill , and other smaller players .
Malaysia - based Pure Circle claims it can produce 1000 metric tons of stevia extract per year now , with larger amounts soon .
Pure Circle offers a 95 % stevia extract that has achieved GRAS status .
Cargill has developed Truvia for Coca Cola , but it is a blended sweetener that provides little stevia extract .
Merisant supplies its Whole Earth Sweetener under the trade name PureVia for Pepsi Cola .
China - based Sunwin Internatural Nutraceuticals already sells its OnlySweet product in 4000 grocery stores , as well as bulk 40 % stevia extract .
Consumers are certain to be confused when they see " stevia " emblazoned on soda pop bottles to attract consumers .
Some drinks , being blends , are not solely sweetened by stevia , and some include eryrithritol , which is a natural sugar alcohol .

ATLANTA  Saxby Chambliss , a first - term Republican senator , was re-elected by Georgia voters on Tuesday in a substantial victory , ending Democratic hopes for a 60 - vote majority in the Senate that would make it difficult for Republicans to filibuster the Obama administration ’s legislative agenda .
With 96 percent of the state ’s precincts reporting in the runoff election , Mr. Chambliss had 57.5 percent of the vote , and his Democratic challenger , Jim Martin , 42.5 percent .
The margin was far greater than the three percentage points that separated the two men in the Nov. 4 election , when neither won the required 50 percent .
Many of the Democrats who turned out last month in enthusiastic support of Barack Obama apparently did not show up at the polls on Tuesday .
“ For a lot of African - American voters , the real election was last month , ” said Merle Black , an expert in Southern politics at Emory University .
“ The importance of electing the first African - American president in history generated enormous enthusiasm .
Everything else was anticlimactic . ”
A little more than two million people voted in the runoff , compared with 3.7 million on Nov. 4 .
In heavily black Clayton County , just south of Atlanta , Mr. Martin ’s vote was less than half what it was in the earlier election .
Only 9.2 percent of registered Georgians cast early votes in the runoff , compared with 36 percent in the general election .
Trojan Horses
A Bomb Built in Hell
by Andrew Vachss " ... ticks with the inexorable deliberation of a bomb about to blow . "
— Publishers Weekly Author 's Notes In 1972 , I was represented by the John Schaffner Agency , largely on the strength of some short stories I published in minor magazines . *
My first full - length effort was , essentially , the journal I kept during my time in the infamous NYC Welfare Department between 1966 and 1969 , ending when I left to enter the warzone inside a country calling itself Biafra .**
That book was ( as was all my work prior to Flood ) considered unacceptable by the publishing establishment , on the grounds that there was no market for " this kind of material . "
Victor Chapin , my tireless agent , who never lost faith in me , thought my varied ground–zero experiences ( including , by that time , not only the genocidal madness in Africa , but a stint as a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases , working as an organizer in Lake County , Indiana , running a center for urban migrants in Chicago , a re–entry joint for ex–cons , and a maximum–security prison for violent youth ) would lend themselves perfectly to a " hardboiled " novel of the type that was so successful in the '50s .
A Bomb Built in Hell followed .
And ( again ) was unanimously rejected by publishers .
They professed to love the writing , but felt the events depicted were considered a " political horror story " and not remotely realistic .
The rejection letters make interesting reading today .
Included in the " lack of realism " category were such things as Chinese youth gangs and the fall of Haiti .
And , of course , the very idea of someone entering a high school with the intent of destroying every living person inside was just too ... ludicrous .
Naturally , the book was also " too " hardboiled , " too " extreme , " too " spare and violent .
I heard endlessly about how an anti–hero was acceptable , but Wesley was just " too " much .
Bomb was meant to be a Ph.D. thesis in criminology without the footnotes , exploring such areas as the connection between child abuse and crime , and the desperate need of unbonded , dangerous children to form " families of choice . "
Thus , the narrative is third person , and the tone is flat and detached .
Victor , ever–loyal , insisted that there was no dispute about my ability as a writer , but that I needed to add some intimacy to a book everyone called " dry ice . "
So ... Flood .
Same themes , but first–person narrative , interior monologues , fleshed –out backstory , ( some ) characters with which the reader could identify ( and even , presumably , like ) .
Some sense of human connection .
But the same themes .
Victor read the manuscript and told me I had finally done it ... we were winners .
And then he died .
Suddenly and unfairly .
Years later , after Flood came out , offers for Bomb magically appeared .
Some from the same publishers who had rejected it the first time .
I never took the offers , thinking of the original book as a " period piece . "
Later , at the suggestion of Knopf publisher ( and my editor ) Sonny Mehta , I cannibalized pieces of it — Bomb was Wesley 's story , Flood was Burke 's — for Hard Candy , and Wesley remained a character in the series ( despite being dead since Candy ) until its 2008 conclusion , Another Life .
Rumors of the original book 's existence were sparked by an excerpt published in the HBJ series A Matter of Crime in 1988 , edited by Richard Layman .
The rumors were true .
And how I wish some of the book 's predictions had not proven to be so .
I dedicated Flood to Victor Chapin .
And I dedicate this to him as well .
It 's been a long wait , old friend .
I hope it reads as well from where you are now .
Andrew Vachss
New York Notes *
One of which was later cannibalized into " Placebo , " which , still later , came to anchor the three–act play , Replay ; both were featured in my first short–story collection , Born Bad . **
Neither the country nor the name survived .
Nigeria won .
And the world has seen the result .

" History has caught up to Wesley 's bleak odyssey , repeatedly rejected for publication decades ago but now unnervingly prescient . "
— Kirkus ( click here to read the entire review ) " [ Phil ] Gigante uses his voice to paint Vachss ' dark portrait with such vivid detail that it makes the novel even that much more shocking .
Like a musician finally finding just the right song , Vachss ' world is the perfect fit for Gigante , and together they create something special . "
— The Guilded Earlobe ( click here to read the entire audiobook review ) " Andrew Vachss wrote his first novel based on professional experiences dealing with the children of abuse .
He could n't find a publisher because they all felt it was too unrealistic , despite the fact that it was all deeply rooted in the real world ; a world he had seen first ' hand .
But at the time , the collective mindset was that such things just did n't happen .
History has proven them wrong , and the book finally found a publisher . "
— Dagan Books ( click here to read the entire article ) Reviewed by Publishers Weekly , Sept 18 , 2000 Vachss introduces hardened hit man Wesley in this stinging , disturbing prelude , written in 1973 , to his popular Burke outlaw PI series .
Serving time for killing a fellow criminal , Wesley meets Carmine Trentoni , who , despite serving a life sentence , remains connected to the outside and who takes Wesley under his wing .
Upon leaving prison , Wesley locates Carmine 's ally , Mr. Petraglia ( " Pet " ) , and the pair soon are hired to " take out " whomever their clients choose .
Exquisite planning , professional technique and sharp intuition guide Wesley and Pet through the murders of an Asian mobster , a competing hit man and a Haitian leader .
Each death earns them hundreds of thousands of dollars , but the killers live in nearly complete obscurity in an old shirt factory in Brooklyn .
Wesley is n't wholly satisfied with his lot , though , and sets out to make his mark on the world in an unforgettably dire fashion .
In many ways , this novel provides a rough template for the Burke series , in which Wesley plays a major role .
Vachss 's prose , though not as stylized as the writing that would take the mystery world by storm in Flood , is as tight and succinct as Wesley 's meticulously planned murders .
Every Burke fan should read this novel , which ticks with the inexorable deliberation of a bomb about to blow .

It is crucial that one has her / his facts straight about Israel ‘s war on Gaza .
What events brought about this dreadful situation ?
What needs to be done to make it stop ?
These questions will be answered in the content of this article , using concrete facts from a variety of news sources .
Let ’s first investigate the recent cease - fire between Israel and Hamas .
The cease - fire began in June 2008 .
The terms were as follows :
Israel would drastically reduce its military blockade of Gaza .
Israel would halt all military incursions into Gaza .
Hamas would halt all rocket attacks into Israel .
From the outset of the cease - fire , Israel did little to ease its military blockade .
As a result , Gazans continued to suffer from a lack of food , fuel , financial aid , electricity , clean water , medical supplies , and more .
This has been , inarguably , an attack on innocent Palestinian civilians .
§ Gaza faces a humanitarian “ catastrophe ” if Israel continues to prevent aid reaching the territory by blocking crossing points , the head of the main UN aid agency for the Palestinians said on Friday …
Israel had restricted goods into Gaza despite the truce , which calls on militants to halt rocket attacks in return for Israel easing its embargo on the territory …
Israel also held up deliveries of European Union - funded fuel for the power plant , which generates about a third of the electricity consumed by Gazans …
Ailments associated with insufficient food were surfacing among the impoverished coastal strip ’s 1.5 million population , including growing malnutrition .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 21 , 2008 [ 1 ]
§ A former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , has told the BBC she was taken aback by the “ terrible ” conditions in Gaza on a recent visit .
Mrs Robinson said it was “ almost unbelievable ” that the world did not care about what she called “ a shocking violation of so many human rights ” …
Israel tightened a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control there in 2007 …
“ Their whole civilisation has been destroyed , I ’m not exaggerating , ” said Mrs Robinson … Israel says the blockade , under which it has allowed little more than basic humanitarian aid into Gaza , is needed to isolate the militant group and stop it and other militants from firing rockets into Israel .
Israel came to a truce with Palestinian groups in June this year , but Mrs Robinson said this had had little effect on people ’s lives and “ just brought a bitter taste in the mouth ” .
– BBC News , Nov. 4 , 2008 [ 2 ]
§ The UN in the Gaza Strip says it will run out of food aid in two days unless Israel ‘s blockade – which it describes as “ shameful and unacceptable ” – eases .
The UN refugee agency UNWRA , which distributes food to half of Gaza ‘s 1.5 m people , called the blockade “ a physical as well as a mental punishment ” .
Israel is now allowing a limited amount of fuel across the border , but it is still blocking food deliveries …
In a statement , UNWRA spokesman Christopher Gunness said food distribution operations would end on Thursday unless Israeli authorities allowed deliveries of wheat , luncheon meat , powdered milk and cooking oil without delay .
“ This is both a physical as well as a mental punishment of the population – of mothers and parents trying to feed their children – who are being forced to live hand to mouth , ” he said …
“ It is a further illustration of the barbarity of this inhuman blockade . ” …
“ It is also shameful and unacceptable that the largest humanitarian actor in Gaza is being forced into yet another cycle of crisis management , ” Mr Gunness added .
– BBC News , Nov. 11 , 2008 [ 3 ]
§ International aid agencies , including the International Committee of the Red Cross , have said virtually no medical supplies were reaching Gaza .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 9 , 2008 [ 14 ]
§ The UN has no more food to distribute in the Gaza Strip , the head of relief efforts in the area has warned .
John Ging said handouts for 750,000 Gazans would have to be suspended until Saturday at the earliest , and called Gaza ‘s economic situation “ a disaster ” .
Israel earlier denied entry to a convoy carrying humanitarian supplies …
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) distributes emergency aid to about half of Gaza ‘s 1.5 m population .
“ We have run out [ of food aid ] this evening , ” said Mr Ging , UNRWA ’s senior official in Gaza .
“ Unless the crossing points open … we wo n’t be able to get that food into Gaza , ” he told Reuters news agency …
Also on Thursday , Israel refused permission for a group of senior European diplomats to visit the coastal enclave .
It has also prevented journalists , including those from the BBC , from entering the territory .
– BBC News , Nov. 13 , 2008 [ 4 ]
§ Since June 2007 , Israel has allowed little more than basic humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip .
Many there hoped that policy would change , five months ago , when Hamas and Israel agreed to a truce .
But while there were some increases in the amount of aid allowed in , Israel ‘s strict restrictions on the movement of goods and people into and out of Gaza largely remained …
Serious fuel shortages have led to widespread power cuts across Gaza City .
That , in turn , has caused problems in pumping water to homes , and sewage to treatment plants .
Israel is preventing many aid workers , and all journalists from entering Gaza too …
“ I never thought we would see days like this , ” says Monther Shublak , head of Gaza ‘s water authority .
“ The water system was severely stretched even before this crisis , but now , things are much worse .
For the last four days , around 40 % of people in Gaza City have had no access to running water in their homes at all . ” …
“ But we are putting all of our resources into sewage pumping .
The health consequences of that system totally failing are too worrying to think about , but it could happen unless things change . ”
– BBC News , Nov. 20 , 2008 [ 5 ]
§ Israel has refused to allow cash to enter Gaza in recent weeks to ratchet up pressure on the ruling Hamas militant group .
With the supply of currency dwindling , banks have limited withdrawals over the past two weeks , and some have posted signs telling customers they cannot take out any more money …
The United Nations halted cash handouts to 98,000 of Gaza ‘s poorest residents last week , and economists and bank officials warn that tens of thousands of civil servants wo n’t be able to cash their paychecks next month …
“ No society can operate without money , but that ’s the situation we are reaching in Gaza , ” said Gaza economist Omar Shaban … Israel and Egypt have restricted movement through Gaza ‘s border crossings since the Islamic militants of Hamas violently seized control of the coastal territory in June 2007 .
Since then , closures have been eased or tightened , depending on the security situation .
But even in quiet times , when Gaza militants refrained from firing rockets at Israeli border towns , only limited shipments of food , medicine and commercial goods were allowed in …
Shlomo Dror , an Israel Defense Ministry spokesman , questioned the seriousness of the currency shortage .
“ We are used to the Palestinians inventing things and we are looking into their claim , ” he said .
— Washington Post , Nov. 24 , 2008 [ 6 ]
Despite the intense blockade against Gazan civilians , the cease - fire held until November 4 , 2008 .
On that date , the Israeli military made an incursion into Gaza and killed six Palestinians .
The Israeli government sought to justify these actions , saying that they suspected these Palestinians of plotting to kidnap Israeli soldiers .
Palestinian fighters responded to the attack by launching rockets into Israel .
Thus began the unraveling of the cease - fire .
§ At least six Hamas militants have been killed after Israel ‘s first incursion into the Gaza Strip since June ’s truce .
Israel said its troops had uncovered a tunnel along central Gaza ‘s frontier which had been dug by militants intending to abduct Israeli soldiers .
Clashes ensued when troops were sent to thwart the threat , Israel said .
One militant died , Palestinian reports say .
A subsequent Israeli air strike on Hamas positions in southern Gaza killed at least five fighters , medics said .
An Israeli army spokeswoman said the air strike targeted militants who had fired mortars at Israeli forces …
Tuesday evening ’s fighting broke out after Israeli tanks and a bulldozer moved 250 m into the central part of the coastal enclave , backed by military aircraft , says the BBC ’s Aleem Maqbool in Ramallah .
Residents of central Gaza ‘s el - Bureij refugee camp said a missile fired from an unmanned Israeli drone flying over the area injured another three Hamas gunmen .
A truce between the two sides had held since it was declared on 19 June .
Israel said the raid was not a violation of the ceasefire , but rather a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat .
– BBC News , Nov. 5 , 2008 [ 7 ]
§ An Israel Air Force air strike in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least five militants and wounded several others on Tuesday , Palestinians said .
Earlier , Israel Defense Forces soldiers killed a Hamas gunman and wounded two others on Tuesday in the first armed clash in the Gaza Strip since a ceasefire was declared in the territory in June , Palestinian medics said …
An Egypt - brokered cease - fire agreement between Israel and the Gaza Strip was signed earlier this year , and went into effect on June 19 .
The IDF argued that the raid did not constitute a violation of the cease fire , but instead was a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat to Israel from Gaza , which is controlled by the Islamic militant group Hamas .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 5 , 2008 [ 8 ]
§ Two weeks ago , an already fragile humanitarian situation resulting from the mounting effects of months of shortages , saw a dramatic downturn .
The fighting resumed , with an Israeli army incursion into Gaza and a retaliatory barrage of militant rocket fire .
– BBC News , Nov. 20 , 2008 [ 5 ]
As the cease - fire began to crumble , the violence from both sides intensified .
Efforts to redeem the cease - fire ultimately failed .
§ Palestinian armed groups in Gaza remain committed to a truce with Israel if Jerusalem reciprocates , Hamas ’s Gaza leader said on Friday , even as militants launched more attacks from the coastal territory …
“ I have met with armed factions over the past two days and they stated their position clearly : they are committed to calm as long as ( Israel ) abides by it , ” said Ismail Haniyeh , Hamas ’s most senior representative in Gaza .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 21 , 2008 [ 9 ]
§ Hamas announced on Sunday that militant groups in Gaza have agreed to cease cross - border attacks if Israel opens crossings into the coastal territory , Ma’an news reported .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 24 , 2008 [ 10 ]
§ After expressing contradictory positions on Sunday , Hamas ’ leadership on Monday adopted a united stance :
The cease - fire with Israel , which expires this Friday , will not be extended …
Hamas ’ spokesman in the Gaza Strip , Ayman Taha , said the movement had concluded that there was no point in extending the truce “ as long as Israel is n’t abiding by its terms ” – though he added that talks on continuing the cease - fire were still taking place .
Specifically , Taha said , Israel was supposed to have expanded the truce to the West Bank – something Hamas demanded but Israel in fact never promised – and opened the Gaza border crossings , and “ this has n’t happened . ”
– Haaretz Israel News , Dec. 16 , 2008 [ 11 ]
Following the end of the cease - fire , Israel moved closer to an invasion of the territory .
The Israeli government claimed that this was the only remaining option to eliminate rocket attacks from Gaza .
However , as cited in the sources above , this was clearly not the case .
Israel had failed to abide by the terms of the cease - fire .
For the overwhelming majority of the six - month truce , Israel had refused to ease its military blockade of Gaza to any significant degree .
In addition , it was the initial violator of the cease - fire when it sent tanks and aircraft into Gaza and killed six Palestinians on November 4 , 2008 .
In fact , there is evidence that Israel was planning to strike Gaza even while the cease - fire was still in effect .
§ Barak told the assembled lawmakers that the defense establishment spent months preparing for the Gaza operation .
– Haaretz Israel News , Dec. 29 , 2008 [ 16 ]
In the interest of peace , Hamas , and especially Fatah , have firmly established that they are willing to participate in negotiations that are based on internationally recognized borders and rights .
§ On June 6 , 2006 , Haniyeh met Dr. Jerome Segal of the University of Maryland in the Gaza Strip …
At the end of the meeting , Haniyeh dictated a short message he asked Segal to transmit to President Bush …
In the second paragraph , Haniyeh laid out the political platform he maintains to this day .
“ We are so concerned about stability and security in the area that we do n’t mind having a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders and offering a truce for many years , ” he wrote …
Haniyeh called on Bush to launch a dialogue with the Hamas government .
“ We are not warmongers , we are peace makers and we call on the American government to have direct negotiations with the elected government , ” he wrote …
In his own letter , Segal emphasized that a state within the 1967 borders and a truce for many years could be considered Hamas ’ de facto recognition of Israel .
He noted that in a separate meeting , Youssuf suggested that the Palestinian Authority and Israel might exchange ambassadors during that truce period .
This was not the only covert message from Hamas to senior Bush administration officials .
However , Washington did not reply to these messages and maintained its boycott of the Hamas government .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 14 , 2008 [ 12 ]
§ The Hamas leader in Gaza , Ismail Haniyeh , said on Saturday his government was willing to accept a Palestinian state alongside Israel within the 1967 borders …
Haniyeh told his guests Israel rejected his initiative …
He said the Hamas government had agreed to accept a Palestinian state that followed the 1967 borders and to offer Israel a long - term hudna , or truce , if Israel recognized the Palestinians ’ national rights …
In response to a question about the international community ’s impression that there are two Palestinian states , Haniyeh said : “ We do n’t have a state , neither in Gaza nor in the West Bank .
Gaza is under siege and the West Bank is occupied .
What we have in the Gaza Strip is not a state , but rather a regime of an elected government .
A Palestinian state will not be created at this time except in the territories of 1967 . ” …
“ Our conflict is not with the Jews , our problem is with the occupation , ” Haniyeh said .
– Haaretz Israel News , Nov. 9 , 2008 [ 14 ]
§ The Palestinian Authority has placed a full - page advert in Israel ‘s Hebrew newspapers to promote an Arab peace plan first proposed in 2002 .
The Saudi - backed initiative offers Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for an end to Israel ‘s occupation of land captured in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
It also proposes what it calls a just solution for Palestinian refugees .
The Israeli government has noted “ positive aspects ” in the plan but has not formally accepted it …
Peace Now , and Israeli campaign group , welcomed the publication of the adverts .
“ On behalf of a majority of Israeli citizens who support peace with the Palestinian people on the basis of a two state solution – we embrace the Arab Peace Initiative and urge both governments to endorse it and negotiate the final status agreement in its spirit , ” a statement from the group said …
The text reads : “ Fifty - seven Arab and Muslim countries will establish diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for a full peace accord and the end of the occupation . ”

§ U.S. President - elect Barack Obama proclaimed himself “ very impressed ” with the Arab League ’s peace plan when he discussed it with President Shimon Peres during a brief visit to Israel four months ago , Peres said Tuesday …
The plan , originally proposed by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in 2002 and later adopted by the Arab League , states that Israel would receive full relations with the entire Arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from all the territory it captured in 1967 , including East Jerusalem , plus a solution to the refugee problem .
The Bush Administration has said it views the plan positively , but its own road map peace plan and the understandings reached at last year ’s Annapolis summit have served as the basis of its diplomatic program .

Since Israel began its strike on Gaza , 4 Israelis and 391 Palestinians have been killed [ 18 ] .
The White House said that Israel will cease its attack when Hamas has agreed to a truce .
Hamas said they are open to any cease - fire propositions .
A cease - fire has been proposed , but Israel rejected this offer .
§ “ In order for the violence to stop , Hamas must stop firing rockets into Israel and agree to respect a sustainable and durable ceasefire , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
– BBC News , Dec. 29 , 2008 [ 17 ]
§ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has rejected international calls for a 48 - hour truce in the Gaza Strip to allow in more humanitarian aid …
The 48 - hour ceasefire plan to allow more aid into Gaza , was proposed by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha told AFP news agency that his group was open to any ceasefire propositions as long as they meant an end to the air strikes and a lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
– BBC News , Dec. 31 , 2008 [ 18 ]
The international community must continue to demand that a cease - fire be implemented .
In order to be successful , any agreement must call for 1 ) an end to Israel ‘s blockade of Gaza , 2 ) an end to the Israeli invasion of Gaza , and 3 ) an end to all rocket attacks into Israel .

The heavy metal community is uniting to help save one of its own .
Death metal forefather Chuck Schuldiner , of the band Death , has been battling a malignant brain tumor for two years , and is currently undergoing expensive experimental treatments in an effort to save his life .
So , various artists  including Korn , the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Kid Rock and Slipknot  are auctioning off memorabilia on Allbeat.com to help Schuldiner 's family pay his medical bills ( see " Benefit Auction To Aid Death Frontman Battling Tumor " ) .
Since the auction began on June 1 , Allbeat.com has received total bids of over $ 1,000 .
Among the items for which bids have been placed are a Fear Factory Obsolete gold record , which is currently bidding at $ 600 , and various items from Chimaira , including a package of signed merchandise and a working laminate pass , which is going for over $ 300 .
On their upcoming tour with Spineshank , Chimaira will encourage fans to place contributions to Schuldiner in a metal box by the band 's merchandise booth .
Other items being auctioned to benefit Schuldiner include a Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) CD autographed by Marilyn Manson ; autographed photos and rare vinyl LPs from Pantera ; autographed photos and CDs from Spineshank and Godhead ; hockey jerseys from Godsmack , Kid Rock and Disturbed ; baseball jerseys from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Korn ; and the microphone Rob Halford used to record Resurrection .
Allbeat.com has also received commitments for yet - unnamed contributions from Papa Roach , Crazy Town and Slipknot .
" I 'm gonna try to find something from my personal collection that maybe nobody can find , " Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor said .
" When I found out Chuck had cancer I was freaking .
Chuck 's music was really important to me growing up .
It was really intricate and interesting .
So I wanna auction something that 's really cool that can hopefully bring in top dollar . "
The money could n't come at a better time .
Schuldiner 's tumor continues to grow and it's pressing against his cerebellum , a condition which is
frequently fatal .
Last week , surgeons in New York decided it was too risky to operate .
Instead , they 're treating the tumor with an experimental drug called Zin Cristine , which will hopefully attack the cancer without killing healthy brain cells , Schuldiner 's publicist said .
If the drug shrinks the tumor enough so that it's no longer pressing against his cerebellum , doctors will later attempt laser surgery .
The brain scans Schuldiner had to undergo before doctors would even begin the treatment cost $ 11,000 , and the Zin Cristine sessions are $ 10,000 each month .
Having already paid over $ 200,000 in the past two years , his family has run out of cash , and since his condition is pre-existing , his medical insurance company refuses to cover him .
" There is something terribly wrong when a country as great as America will let their citizens die for lack of insurance or money , " Schuldiner 's family said in a statement .
" [ We are ] aware every time [ he needs treatment ] that if we do not get the money , he will die . "
For now , it looks like Allbeat.com is helping to give Schuldiner a fighting chance .
" It 's amazing to watch people go beyond the call of duty to help out a fellow musician , " co-founder Thom Hazaert said .
" I 've really put everything else in my life on hold to focus on this , and it 's great to see that it 's starting to really make an impact . "
In a post I made in June of last year , a reader , Todd and I have been debating creation myths and scientific proofs .
https://howgoodisthat.wordpress.com/2008/06/29/greg-koukl-christian-workshops-on-new-atheist-fallacies/#comment-2251
In the chat thread , Todd posted a link to www.dawkinslennoxdebate.com, which is worth watching both as a primer to this topic as it is in follow - up to much of what ’s been discussed here many times before .
I thought Lennox was a thoroughly entertaining person who certainly made Dawkins work for his answers — but I ’m amazed to find that , yet again , he was allowed to make factual statements against unfalsifiable suppositions , such as “ we know that God is .. ” , or “ the bible tells us that .. ” and so on — and without any obvious embarrassment , which is curious for someone who is clearly , otherwise , very well read and well versed in the scientific method .
Lennox , while I would n’t put him in the same league as many creationist I ’ve heard , is nevertheless very firmly in denial about compelling , though incomplete , emerging anthropological evidence which suggests , not least because of the findings within the dead sea scrolls , that the bible simply can not be considered reliable as a historical document , having had so much of the original text destroyed or ruthlessly altered , hundreds of years after the death of its original architects .
Overall , though , it was nice to finally see a creationist who understands the problem of superimposing irrational blind faith upon logical analyses — even though he has n’t yet realised he ’s on the wrong side of the fallacy .
This is no - doubt thanks in large part to what he has seen in his work in communist countries , which has clouded his judgement ; that atheism of one form is atheism of all kinds .
The atheism I have arrived upon at my own free will , is rather different to the dogmatic evils forced upon a people by megalomaniacal despotism .
Richard Dawkins does n’t need me to defend him .
I thought his retort on the bible just so happening to get a 50 / 50 question about point zero origins right , in its opening pages , was a brilliant reminder of why he is who he is — and an observation which even Lennox seemed forced to admit was one he ’d been rather cheeky in trying to get away with — although I did want to leap into the debate at this point and remind both of them of the “ is was and always will be ” childishly obvious contradiction of later chapters in that same “ infallible ” book , is a greater reason still to question it ’s authenticity , much less its worth as a launch - pad into any serious scientific discovery .
1/17/2009 :
Hoboken411 reader David Dessel had some trouble at the Hoboken Public Library recently :
Young borrowers to have neat handwriting , or no card
“ Earlier this week my wife and four and a half year old son went to the Hoboken Library to sign him up for his first card .
The little guy was excited , as he loves books and could n’t wait for the opportunity to start borrowing materials under his own name .
Who would have thought that a public library , the bedrock institution that helps foster reading and passion for literature would turn down a new eager customer ?
Well they did , not because of his age , but because of the quality and size of his handwriting .
It seems that in order for a child , to be granted a library card from the Hoboken Public Library , that child must be able to print a first and last name on the tiny application .
Well our son has been able to write his full name for quite some time , it just was n’t neat enough for the high standards of the Hoboken Public Library .
As he eagerly filled out the paperwork , the children ’s librarian looked over his shoulder and said : “ My boss in never going to accept that . ”
Needless to say , my child was devastated .
Thanks Hoboken .
My wife called several libraries in the area , including Millburn , Maplewood , Summit and Ridgewood , to find out what their policies are .
Every librarian she spoke with was appalled by HPL ’s policy .
One went so far as to say that the story was heartbreaking , and the policy archaic , the kind of thing that was done away with forty years ago .
I wonder if the library administration has changed much since On the Waterfront ?
This is just another great reason to appreciate the incredible quality of life that your increased tax dollars provide .
PS , the next day my wife spoke to Rosalie Brereton , the supervising children ’s librarian .
After discussing the issue , her response was :
“ Those are the rules .
I do n’t make them , I just enforce them .
If you want to try to get the rules you have to take it up with the Hoboken Library Board of Trustees . ”

Disagreeable and closed to new ideas – that ’s the picture that emerges of contributors to community - curated encyclopaedia Wikipedia from a survey of their psychological attributes .
Led by Yair Amichai - Hamburger of the Sammy Ofer School of Communication in Herzliya , Israel , a team of psychologists surveyed 69 Israeli contributors to the popular online encyclopedia , comparing them with a sample of 70 students matched for age and intensity of internet use .
All were given a short questionnaire called Real - Me , which tries to determine whether people prefer to express themselves in the real world or online , and a personality survey that gave ratings for five traits : openness to experience and ideas , conscientiousness , extroversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism .
Internet living
As Amichai - Hamburger expected , the Wikipedians were more comfortable online .
“ They feel the internet is a more meaningful place to them , ” he says .
But to his surprise , although Wikipedia is founded on the notion of openly sharing and collecting knowledge as a community , they scored low on agreeableness and openness .

“ Wikipedia in a way demonstrates the spirit of the internet , ” Amichai - Hamburger says .
“ People contribute without any financial reward . ”
Amichai - Hamburger speculates that rather than contributing altruistically , Wikipedians take part because they struggle to express themselves in real - world social situations .
“ They are compensating , ” he suggests .
“ It is their way to have a voice in this world . ”
This is consistent with previous research on online communication , says Scott Caplan of the University of Delaware in Newark , who suspects that heavy users of sites such as Digg and Twitter may have similar characteristics .
“ People who prefer online social behaviour tend to have higher levels of social anxiety and lower social skills , ” he says .
A recent study of YouTube users also suggested that contributors – people that upload videos – have egocentric rather than altruistic motives .
Users whose postings received more hits were more likely to continue uploading videos .
Amichai - Hamburger is now surveying users of social network Facebook to see if sites based solely on friendly social interaction attract a different , more agreeable , type of person .
“ That would be interesting , ” says Caplan .

Jaber Abu Hweij , residnet of Tufah neighborhood
I lived with my parents and brothers and sisters in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City .
Our house is between the police building and the al - Mahata mosque .
On Saturday , 27.12.08 , while I was at work , one of my neighbors called me and told me to come home quickly .
I got home and was shocked by what I saw .
The house had been hit by an explosion and was a pile of rubble .
Where the house had been there was a big hole .
There were dozens of people trying to get my family out of the ruins , but they only managed to get some of them out alive .
My father , Jaber Abu Hweij , 52 , my sister , Fadia , 22 , and my brother Muhammad , 18 , were killed in the bombing .
Many other family members were injured .
The neighbors told me the house had been hit three times , one right after the other .
Some of my family was hurt in the first strike and while others tried to help them , the house was hit again and others were injured .
It happened so quickly there was no time to flee .
I keep seeing my sister Fadia in my mind .
She was the last one I saw that morning when I left for work ..
She is the one who woke me for morning prayers and to go to work .
Her voice still echoes in my ears .
Some of my family is still hospitalized and some has already been released .
We do n't have a house to return to .
We are scattered among neighbors ' houses and we do n't know where we will go after that .
The people here took us into their homes but this situation cannot continue for long .
I do n't know what to do .
/>
Our family has fallen apart .
Some of been killed and others are hospitalized .
We lost our home and all our possessions : all our mementos , our dreams , our stories , our furniture , everything is under the ruins .
The important thing now is for me to take care of my family that is still alive .
I am particularly taking care of my brother Ahmad , who is still in intensive care .
Jaber Abu Abu Hweij is a resident of Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City .
His testimony was taken by telephone by Atef Abu Rub on 29 Dec. ' 08 .

Funding continues to pour into green - technology research and development despite low oil prices and a stubborn recession , but whether that will continue long enough to help the economy recover may be up to the government .
Venture capitalists invested $ 8.4 billion in green tech last year , according to a new report from the analysts at Cleantech Group , but there are signs of trouble on the horizon .
Investments in the fourth quarter were down 35 percent to $ 1.7 billion from the third quarter 's record high , which looks like a sign that lower energy prices are scrambling the economics that green tech companies were banking on .
If that 's true , it raises a major question for advocates of clean energy :
Who is going to pay for all the research and development that most say is necessary to create an economy that uses less fossil fuel , which currently meets 87 percent of our energy needs ?
The answer , analysts say , is government funding — and taxing the carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuel is burned , to make renewable energy more competitive .
" We have to find a way not to do what we did in the 1980s , when we all cheerfully forgot about energy as a society , " said Lynn Orr , director of the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University , which announced a $ 100 million endowment gift Monday .
" And we now realize that we have to do something about carbon . "
While $ 8 billion in venture capital and hundreds of millions of dollars of university research money would be enough to launch a large number of internet startups , the amount of money that could be required to drive green technology forward are staggering .
Backers , like Barack Obama and his Energy Secretary - designate Steven Chu , argue that government investment will spur American innovation , leading to major export opportunities for clean energy technologies and helping mitigate climate change .
Government and big companies can be key to creating demand for new scientific innovations , said
Ira Ehrenpreis , a long - time clean - tech investor with Technology Partners .
" They are creating a stimulus and a market for the breakthrough technologies that we 're investing in . "
One group , the Center for American Progress , a left leaning think - tank headed by the leader of Barack Obama 's transition team , is recommending that the government invest $ 100 billion in green technologies and energy - efficiency building retrofits .
" Investing funds in a green economic recovery program that is capable in the short run of creating jobs , dampening upward pressure on oil prices , and moving our economy significantly toward a clean - energy economy is a responsible investment of taxpayer money in our present circumstances , " the group wrote in a recent report on a " Green Recovery " .
To make that sort of investment in the face of grinding economic pain will require a large amount of political will , said Kent Hughes , director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars program on Science , Technology , America and the Global Economy .
But he thinks that a new coalition could drive the program forward .
" The interest cluster around this has changed , " Hughes said .
" For a number of initiatives you have national security interests coming together with environmental interests .
It 's not a usual coalition but one that could be pretty influential . "
Environmentalists argue that the cost of doing nothing about climate change will eventually be higher than the short - term costs of
" greening " our infrastructure .
" If you think carbon pricing is too expensive , just wait until you see the bill for failing to put a price on carbon , " Eric De Place wrote on the well - known sustainability site Worldchanging .
If the Obama administration does push a lot of federal money into green technology , there will still be the issue of how those funds get distributed .
Local and state governments are also trying to respond to the demands of their constituents by pushing renewable - energy portfolios for utilities operating within their borders .
There is a danger that in the rush to put new technologies out into the market , the wind and solar energy industries could become overextended .
Back in the 1980s , California gave generous tax incentives to wind power , generating what became known as the " wind rush . "
The companies and technologies that were installed did not improve quickly enough ; their costs did n't come down quite fast enough .
When the incentives went away , the companies went belly - up and it has taken decades for the wind industry to recover .
Despite the focus on creating new green technologies , limited attention has been put into how to actually provide access to green funds , say the authors of a new essay in Environment magazine .
" Thus far much of the effort has been focused on technology and policy solutions , with very little attention given to how this change can be enabled through creative financing , " writes an interdisciplinary group of authors from the University of California at Berkeley and a venture capital firm .
In financing the sort of energy - efficiency building retrofits recommended by the Center for Climate Progress , the Berkeley authors argue that the key is reducing the upfront cost that consumers have to pay to better their insulation or install cleaner technologies like solar panels .
Though it might end up costing less in the long run to install better windows , it 's cheaper in the short term to just keep what you have .
So some locales , like Berkeley , make financing available to their constituents .
Like many of the details of any green - stimulus package , the details of making the loan arrangements work are complex , particularly with local governments increasingly strapped for cash , too .
But , as Stanford 's Orr put it , " If this were not hard , someone would have done it already . "

Even ontsnappen aan de sollicitatiestress : duik het online casino in !
5 Tips Die Tot Een Sollicitatiesucces
Leiden
Solliciteren is voor veel mensen een zware taak .
Telkens opnieuw vacatures zoeken , sollicitatiebrieven schrijven , de stress bij een interview ...
Het schrikt velen zo af , dat ze genoegen nemen met de eerste de beste baan die ze aangeboden krijgen .
Waardoor ze eigenlijk ontevreden zijn met hun huidige werk .
Toch valt solliciteren heel goed mee , mits men enkele belangrijke tips in het achterhoofd houdt .
1. Solliciteren Onder De Knie Krijgen
Het klassieke sollicitatie - scenario is wanneer mensen op zoek gaan naar ander werk omdat ze hun huidige job beu zijn .
Als ze een vacature zien die hen aanspreekt , solliciteren ze .
Maar vaak zijn ze erg zenuwachtig waardoor ze minder zelfverzekerd overkomen .
Als men van solliciteren een gewoonte maakt en het dus zoveel mogelijk doet , is men voorbereid op de vragen die komen .
Men staat veel sterker in de schoenen .
Tevens kan er werk geselecteerd worden door de sollicitant zelf .
2. Eerlijkheid Duurt Het Langst
Het heeft weinig zin om te liegen over vaardigheden , want vroeg of laat zakt men door de mand .
Sommige mensen durven niet uit te komen voor de vereisten waar ze niet aan voldoen .
De meeste werkgevers appreciëren echter eerlijkheid .
Indien men - ondanks een goede indruk - niet aan bepaalde vereisten voldoet , kan dat besproken worden .
Het heeft ook weinig zin om bij een gesprek met clichés aan te komen als " het is altijd een droom geweest om hier te werken " , of te doen alsof men alles opoffert om in die specifieke firma te werken .
Dit komt erg wanhopig over .
Werkgevers krijgen veel sollicitanten te zien en herkennen dit gedrag onmiddellijk .
3. Interesse Tonen
Een kandidaat die op zijn sollicitatie geen flauw idee heeft wat het bedrijf doet , maakt weinig kans .
Eens kijken op de website van de firma vóór het gesprek kost niet zoveel moeite .
Maar blijk van interesse is een groot pluspunt en bewijst betrokkenheid en motivatie .
4. Uitdaging Zoeken
Meestal wordt het grootste deel van de actieve tijd gespendeerd aan werken .
Sommige mensen kiezen werk waar ze niet bij hoeven na te denken .
Anderen hebben juist een prikkel nodig .
Het wordt aangeraden om werk te zoeken met een zekere uitdaging .
Op die manier zal men op verschillende vlakken blijven groeien .
5. Wat Is De Meerwaarde ?
Waarom zou een firma een sollicitant aanwerven ?
Er zijn werknemers die alleen hun werk uitvoeren .
Daarnaast zijn er ook werknemers die een grote toegevoegde waarde betekenen .
Het verschil is dat de eerste geeft om zijn loonstrookje aan het eind van de maand en de tweede om de firma waar hij / zij werkt .
Werknemers met een proactieve instelling kunnen een bedrijf doen groeien .
Betrokken werkgevers zien dit potentieel snel als alle bovenstaande tips ten volste worden ingezet .

WASHINGTON --
The stimulus bill 's tax breaks for individuals will put money in the hands of people likely to spend it quickly , proponents believe -- and fulfill a major campaign promise by President Barack Obama .
One big question :
How many of these largely temporary breaks will be allowed to expire in a year or two , and how many will survive and become permanent parts of the tax code ?

Iran ’s leaders are leery of siding publicly with Hamas because of the potential consequences of an Israeli victory .
A Hamas defeat by Israel would deprive Iran not only of a valuable proxy force on the border with Israel but of a trump card to play with Washington , and it would further alienate it from the leadership of Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
“ Iran wants to sit at the negotiating table with Obama with all the cards of the region in hand : Palestine , Lebanon , Iraq , the relationship with Syria , ” said Mustafa el - Labbad , an Iranian expert based in Cairo .
“ They are also being smart .
They ’re trying not to antagonize the U.S. very much , but with the Arabs they are going at it very hard , very roughly . ”
For months , even before Israel invaded Gaza to stop rocket fire , Iranian officials and their proxies had been viciously attacking Egyptian and Saudi leaders for not doing enough to end the Israeli - imposed blockade of Gaza .
But Iran does not function as a purely ideological state , and it does not operate from one center of power .
When events started growing too hot , Ayatollah Khamenei stepped in and cooled talk of thousands of martyrs streaming to Gaza .
Commentators in Iran said that Ayatollah Khamenei decided it was time to act as a pragmatic brake on the ideologically radical president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The president and his allies had stoked rage across Iran over what they said was the failure of Arab leaders to do more to end the Israeli fighting .
But there was a big difference between rhetorical support , even encouragement , and direct involvement .
“ Hamas is a very practical and useful tool for Iran , not an ideological one at all , ” said Saeed Leylaz , an economist and political commentator in Tehran .
“ It is a very good tool for Iran , especially in its dealings with the U.S.
What is happening right now in Gaza has made it easier for Iran to promote anti-U.S. feelings among Muslims . ”
Watch the bottom of the screen of this AMAZING VIDEO carefully and you 'll see that he is paid a visit - mid LIVE forecast - by a curious cat .
The feline friend walks along the camera shot , brushes up against the forecaster 's leg and then leaps into his arms .
The leading German meteorologist does n't bat an eyelid though .
He appears unfazed as he calmly continues his broadcast while holding the furry fella who is seen nuzzling up to him .
Well we 've heard that it can rain cats and dogs but this is surely a turnout for any weather forecaster 's books .
Sony Pictures has released a new flash poster for Terminator Salvation that is internet exclusive .
You can view the poster below :
This explosive BBC documentary , unlike anything you ’ll see on American MSM , shows how bad the healthcare situation is in America .
You ’ll see a charity originally set up to deliver healthcare to third world countries , drawing hundreds of clients in Kentucky .
The clip effectively shows the enormous chasm between rich and poor in America .
You ’ll see rich Republicans who think our system is the greatest in the world , and who are fighting to keep the status quo .
The political situation is spelled out as well .
The last segment interviews a woman who is getting chemotherapy while living in a tent – she had to choose between rent or medicine .
Several thoughts ( feel free to add your own ) :
We used to have a functioning media in this country that would take risks and report on this kind of thing .
Now it distracts , silences , and shapes public opinion , instead of being challenging or revealing .
While never perfect , who the media is supposed to serve has changed over time .
The victims in this documentary – the ones too poor for health insurance – come from states that usually vote for those whose policies overwhelmingly ensure the perpetuation of their victimhood .
How these people were bamboozled into voting against their own best interests is explained in Thomas Frank ’s What ’s the Matter With Kansas ?
Maha wrote earlier about the delusions of the very wealthy .
The healthcare situation in this country is a symptom of the same .
At some point , all of us choose to shut out the plight of others from our awareness , and we come up with rationalizations for this act – liberals to a lesser extent , conservatives to a greater extent .
So much of the political battle is consumed by efforts to cut through defenses of this sort .
Keeping explosive documentaries such as this out of the public eye is hugely strategic , because an angry public wo n’t put up with excuses .
Documentaries like this , that have the potential to foment public anger , torpedo all the defenses .
There is a spiritual dimension to this that all contemporary writers and documentaries show or talk around , but which can never seem to directly discuss .
It ’s as though we do n’t have the language for it , or we ’re not permitted to directly speak about it – which by itself silently screams obscenities against our culture .
We simply feel the moral outrage that some deep spiritual laws are being violated .
But without a common language to articulate and address this outrage , this energy is stymied from changing anything .
It ’s the result of conservative efforts to trivialize and confine spirituality to personal matters , such as who you ’re having sex with , blastocytes , and so on , and to keep spirituality away from anything that would seriously challenge the conservative worldview .
Part 2 is here .
Part 3 is here .
You ’ll want to watch all three .
Link to the original BBC program is here , but viewers outside the UK ca n’t see it .

The space shuttle disintegrated as it re-entered Earth 's atmosphere
The US space agency ( Nasa ) has released a detailed report into the deaths of the crew of space shuttle Columbia .
It comes almost six years after the orbiter disintegrated when re-entering the Earth 's atmosphere .
The report includes grim details of the crew 's final moments as the shuttle broke up over the state of Texas .
It concludes that the accident was not survivable but makes the point that astronaut seat restraints , suits and helmets did not work well .
The failure of these safety features by themselves would have resulted in " lethal trauma " , says the Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report .
It recommends the lessons be taken up in future spacecraft designs .
" This report confirms that although the valiant Columbia crew tried every possible way to maintain control of their vehicle , the accident was not ultimately survivable , " said Nasa deputy associate administrator Wayne Hale .
The accident happened on 1 February 2003 .
Forty - one seconds
When the space shuttle Columbia blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , the orbiter 's left wing was damaged by a piece of insulating foam falling off the orbiter 's external fuel tank .
That proved fatal for the seven astronauts when they re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere days later .
The world watched as the shuttle disintegrated as hot atmospheric gases blasted inside the breach , melting the ship 's structure .
COLUMBIA'S FATAL FOAM
Piece of insulating foam falls during launch , piercing one of shuttle 's wings
On re-entry , hot atmospheric gases blast inside the breach and melt ship 's structure Crew cabin breaks away from ship and starts spinning rapidly Astronauts try to regain control of craft , flipping cockpit switches as alarms sound Rapid depressurization causes crew to lose consciousness
Lack of safety restraints cause crew traumatic injuries Nasa 's extensive 400 - page report into their last moments found that the crew knew for as long as 41 seconds that they did not have control of the orbiter , and records that they went into problem - solving mode as they attempted to regain stability .
As a consequence , when the cabin structure failed , resulting in rapid depressurisation and loss of consciousness , some of the astronauts were not wearing their bulky protective gloves and still had their helmet visors open .
Some were not fully strapped in .
Had the astronauts switched earlier to survival operations - getting all their gear on and preparing their suits properly - they might have survived a little longer and been able to take more actions .
But , the report notes , they still would have died because of the extreme forces and conditions to which they were exposed .
The Spacecraft Crew Survival Integrated Investigation
Team lists individual failures in training and equipment which should now be addressed .
The recommendations call for improved training , and better seat harness systems , helmets and pressurised suits ; and more automated technology that can trigger actions if astronauts become incapacitated .
' Hard lessons '
The report says some safety components , such as suits and helmets , need to be integrated " into the design of the vehicle and provide features that will protect the crew without hindering normal operations " .
It draws some parallels with the restraint systems now used in motor racing to protect vulnerable areas of a driver 's body , such as their head and neck .
The report says future spacecraft should be designed so that , when they do begin to break up in an accident , they experience the " most graceful degradation of vehicle systems and structure to enhance chances for crew survival " .
Mr Hale , who oversaw the shuttle programme during its return to flight after the accident , urged spacecraft designers in the US and overseas to read the report and apply the " hard lessons which have been paid for so dearly " .
A separate study undertaken by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( CAIB ) has already conducted a thorough review of both the technical and the organisational causes of the loss of the Columbia orbiter .
This led , among other things , to a redesign of the external fuel tank to minimise the shedding of foam on launch .
The remaining vehicles in Nasa 's shuttle fleet are due to be retired in 2010 , on completion of the construction phase of the International Space Station .

Huckabee just said on TV that he ’s not “ pro-sodomy . ”
Well , sodomy is oral and anal sex .
So , if Huckabee wants to tell the entire nation on television what sex acts he is and is n’t in favor of , all I have to say is – really ?
Mike Huckabee is not , never has been , a fan of oral sex ?
Not that any of us really needed to know , but now that Huckabee has opened the door , er , zipper , on this one , I do hope someone fact - checks him .
January 13 , 2009 – In 1902 , the National Zoo in Washington D.C. arranged to have a unique and endangered animal called the thylacine , or Tasmanian Tiger , brought to the United States from Tasmania .
Later that year , a female and her three cubs arrived at the zoo .
However , by the mid-1930s , the thylacine was extinct , leaving behind only preserved museum specimens .
In a study published online today in Genome Research ( www.genome.org), researchers have used state - of - the - art DNA sequencing technology to analyze preserved thylacines , including one of those brought to the National Zoo more than 100 years ago , making novel discoveries in thylacine genomics and the burgeoning field of " museomics . "
The thylacine was actually not a tiger at all , rather a marsupial with many dog - like features — a striking example of convergent evolution in mammals .
Extensively hunted by farmers , the thylacine was becoming increasingly rare in the wild at the time the National Zoo acquired the female and cubs , and was declared extinct in 1936 upon the death of the last captive animal .
Genetic sequences sampled from the preserved specimens of the National Zoo thyalcine family have been studied in recent years , however these investigations were severely limited by DNA contamination and degradation .
Now , in a strategy nicknamed " museomics , " researchers are using improved methods for sampling DNA combined with the latest sequencing technology to analyze preserved museum samples .
In this study , an international team of scientists has sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from the hair of the male thylacine offspring brought to the National Zoo in 1902 and a female that died in the London Zoo in 1893 .
In addition to refining the place of this unusual animal in evolutionary history , genetic clues to the impending extinction of the thylacine became apparent .
" What I find amazing is that the two specimens are so similar , " said Dr. Anders Götherström of Uppsala University in Sweden .
" There is very little genetic variation between them . "
Götherström , a co-author of the study , explained that a lack of genetic diversity is indicative of a species on the brink of extinction , and we are now observing this more than 70 years later .
In addition to using the mitochondrial genome sequence to study the phylogeny of the thylacine , the authors also investigated the collection of genetic material of microbial and viral origin ( the " metagenome " ) present on the museum samples .
Interestingly , the research team found distinct differences in the microbial content of the hair of the wild - born thylacine from the London Zoo and the captive - born thylacine from the National Zoo .
Furthermore , the authors noted that the specimens were preserved by differing methods .
" Analyzing the microbial content of museum specimens will therefore allow us to gain insight into the microbial flora that lives on the exhibit samples and help to develop means to further protect them , " said Dr. Stephan Schuster of Penn State University , also an author of the report .
This work has established the groundwork for more detailed genetic analysis of the thylacine , opened the door to more museomic studies using the treasure trove of museum specimens worldwide , and will raise dialogue about even bigger projects .
" The large amount of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA gained in our study demonstrates the feasibility of a thylacine genome project , " explained Schuster .
" It will also revive discussions on the possible resurrection of the animal . "

Here is a thesis that I have been mulling over lately :
One of Python 3's fundamental problems is that it is trying very hard to pretend that Unix is fundamentally a Unicode operating system , so that Python itself can be Unicode - based while still working on Unix .
The problem with this is that it is demonstrably false , as seen in the os.listdir ( ) problem ;
Unix is fundamentally a ' bytecode strings ' environment , and attempts to pretend otherwise can run into problems any time that this pretense runs up against actual reality .
( The os.listdir ( ) problem is actually the smallest one . )
I am not sure why Python 3 has decided to hide this messy reality from programmers ( it certainly knows that it exists ; the release notes are full of commentary ) .
It seems very atypical for Python , which has always struck me as quite honest about this sort of thing .
My only theory is that the Python 3 people felt that programmers would revolt if they were forced to work in Unicode and to still deal explicitly with such conversion issues , so they felt that a flawed pretense that usually worked was absolutely required .
( Possibly this issue has been discussed to death on the Python 3 development lists , but I do n't follow Python news in much depth any more ; I ran out of time . )
Sidebar : why I care
It is tempting to brush this under the carpet with various excuses , especially because most people will never see this ; most people work on Unix systems where everything is correctly encoded in a single encoding .
But this is an unstable situation and results in software that merely usually works , if everything goes well .
As a system administrator , I am unhappy about software that can be broken by someone doing something peculiar ; I want my software to be as resilient as possible .
I ’ve been playing with the Bolt browser for a couple of hours now and my impressions are generally pretty good .
Bolt is from Cambridge , Massachusetts based Bitstream , a company best known for it ’s digital fonts and font rendering software .
But Bitstream is not new to the browser field , they also produce the ThunderHawk browser for Windows Mobile and Symbian .
Bolt , like ThanderHawk ( and Opera Mini , Skyfire , UCWEB and Teashark ) , is a server based browser meaning that much of the page rendering is done in the cloud and the browser is a relatively “ thin ” client application .
ThunderHawk is a $ 50 / year subscription product but Bolt is free .
Bolt is written in Java ME like Opera Mini and according to Bitstream can run on “ nearly all ” Java based handsets that support MIDP 2 and CLDC 1.0 .
The only handsets Bitstream specifically says Bolt will not run on are ones using the Palm OS .
Blackberries and “ selected ” Windows Mobile handsets are specifically mentioned as supported .
Bolt was announced yesterday on several tech sites including BlackberryCool , CrackBerry , IntoMobile , BerryReview and MobileCrunch Each site published a Beta code which was supposted to be limited to a few thousand users .
I entered one of the codes on the Bolt download page yesterday and waited for my promised SMS containing the download link , which never arrived .
As usually happens with these sorts of things , the process and servers completely broke down under the load .
BitStream ’s John Sidine left a comment on BerryReview explaining ;
“ We completely underestimated the response we ’d get to the beta .
Initially we had a manual process in place to distribute download links .
But we were quickly overwhelmed by requests for BOLT so we switched to an automated process at about 9:00 AM Eastern today .
Sometime after noon Eastern today , the server handling the downloads “ blew up . ”
We are now in the process of switching over to a dedicated server we ’re confident can handle the demand .
We appreciate everyone ’s patience .
We expect the new server to be online by 4:00 PM Eastern today . “
John was true to his word and shortly after 4:00 EST , I was able to get in and request Bolt for my two phones a Nokia N95 - 3 and an old iDEN BlackBerry 7100i .
I ’m happy to report that Bolt runs on both phones and is a formidable new competitor in the world of third party mobile browsers .
I ’m not sure if any of the codes are still good but even if the beta is full Bolt says people entering a code will get priority in the queue for the next round of invites .
Rendering Accuracy
Probably the best feature of Bolt is the way it maintains the original appearance of pages .
A recurring problem with most full web mobile browsers is overlapping of page elements .
Bolt seems to do much better than Opera Mini at preventing overlapping .
You can really see the difference in the two images above of this site ’s navigation menu .
Another difference is in the way the two browsers handle left floated images as shown in the screenshots below with the Nokia 7510 product photos .
Opera Mini formats the text as a single column until it gets to the image where the column of text shifts to the right forcing the user to scroll right to continue reading , Bolt reduces the size of the image and narrows the text column so that you can continue reading without horizontal scrolling .
Very nice !
There are however areas where Bolt ’s rendering is less stellar .
All text is rendered in the same font weight and style .
Bold and italic appear as normal text .
Header elements like the H1 post titles on this site are the same weight as body text .
CSS font - size is also ignored .
Opera Mini , on the other hand , handles all of these stylistic rendering elements correctly except italic which it displays as bold .
Features
Featurewise Bolt is fairly basic .
Like Opera Mini .
tabbed browsing and copying text from web pages are n’t suported ( UCWEB can do both ) .
Pages ca n’t be saved although images in pages can be “ downloaded ” .
Dowloading of both images and files launches the phone ’s built in browser .
Unlike Opera Mini , Bolt on the N95 and 7100i does not close when it launches the phone browser , a big plus because it means you do n’t lose your place on the page .
Bolt is able to play Flash videos , sort of .
The Bolt server transcodes the flash to a low quality mobile streaming format that most phones can play .
This feature worked well with YouTube although the 176×144 videos were pretty bad looking .
The N95 ’s built in Flash Lite player can natively play YouTube videos at full 240 x 320 screen resolution but Bolt does n’t let it , instead sending a lower quality stream .
I ’m unsure what other Flash video sites besides YouTube are supported .
Videos on Hulu.com did not play in Bolt and Veoh.com would n’t even let me try to play its videos , saying I needed to upgrade my Flash Player .
Bolt , like Mini , has both a fit - to - width “ mobile view ” and a “ desktop ” view that maintains a page ’s layout but requires horizontal scrolling to see the whole page .
I found the mode switching in Bolt quirky .
For one thing the User Agent string that Bolt sends changes depending on the mode .
In desktop mode the User Agent is :
Mozilla /5.0 ( X11 ; 78 ; CentOS ; US - en ) AppleWebKit /527 + ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Bolt / 0.741 Version /3.0 Safari/523.15
Most sites will treat that User Agent as a desktop browser and send full - web content to it .
However in mobile view the User Agent changes to :
Nokia3250/2.0 ( 3.21 ) SymbianOS /9.1 Serries60/3.0 Profile / MIDP -2.0 Configuration / CLDC-1-1
Sites that do browser detection and adaption treat that User Agent as a phone browser .
The “ Nokia3250 … ” string seems to be hardcoded into all versions of Bolt .
Both the unsigned version running on my Blackberry and the double signed one on the N95 send the same user agent in mobile view .
A changeable user agent is potentially useful feature .
It gives the user the ability to override sites that force mobile browsers to their mobile version with no way to reach the full version .
But using a user agent that misrepresents Bolt as a Nokia 3250 smartphone is wrong .
Providers of content like ringtones , games and themes need to be able to use the User Agent to identify the browser .
The Bolt mobile view user agent needs to be unique , ideally having “ Bolt Browser ” in it somewhere , so that every phone running Bolt is not mistaken for a Nokia 3250 .
It ’s not just the user agent that is misleading either .
In mobile view , Bolt does n’t send the Via : header as all proxies should .
Bolt also includes an x_wap_profile header pointing to http://nds1.nds.nokia.com/uaprof/N3250r100.xml , further misrepresenting Bolt as a 3250 .
Other Bolt mobile mode quirks are that web forms are missing their submit buttons in mobile view and thus are unusable and the that mobile view does n’t seem to work with many sites .
My full - web site at pc.wapreview.com is not reformatted to the screen width in mobile view , it looks identical in both desktop on mobile views .
The same is true of espn.go.com .
However the mobile site wapreview .
mobi , does look different in desktop view where horizontal scrolling is needed , while in mobile view where the page is reformatted to screen width .
I ’d like to see the layout mode ( mobile vs desktop view ) selection separate from the user agent switch .
I think most users will want the option to have the full web versions of sites reformatted into a single column for quick reading without side scrolling .
A unique feature of Bolt is the split screen option that is part of Desktop mode .
Pressing the 5 key toggles split screen mode which shows a zoomed out “ mini-map ” of the whole page in the top third of the screen and a “ keyhole ” view of a zoomed in section of the page in the bottom third ( image bottom left ) .
I found Split Screen worked as well as the traditional mini-map used by Opera Mini and WebKit – where you press a key to toggle between full - screen mini-map and keyhole views .
But I ’m not convinced it offers any real advantage in usability .
There is another hind of zooming which Bolt calls “ magnification ”
It ’s a menu option that gives five levels of zoom .
Magnification affects both text and images .
Changing the magnification level causes the page to reload and when it does text is re-flowed so it still fits screen width .
Usability
Bolt has a good set of well chosen one click shortcut keys for page up / down , column left / right , bookmarking the current page , entering a new URL , switching to the bookmarks or history pages and opening the built in RSS reader .
There is no jump to page top / bottom , but split screen mode lets you do that quickly .
The only real usability issue I encountered was that I was unable to use T9 to enter text in fields on the N95 .
The Blackberry ’s “ SureType ” equivalent was available in Bolt and T9 works in Opera Mini and other Java apps on the N95 so I do n’t know why the option to use it is n’t available in edit fields in Bolt .
Performance and Stability
Bolt seemed stable on N95 and the UI and scrolling speed were reasonably fast , generally comparable to Opera Mini .
I experienced no crashes in testing on the N95 although I saw quite a few non-fatal error messages .
When errors occur their is an option to send an error log to Bolt ( image ” bottom , right ) .
It only requires a couple of clicks and no data entry to send the log .
Bolt seemed to overtax the less powerful JVM and OS of the three year old Blackberry 7100i .
Scrolling was slow and there was a noticeable lag before key presses were recognized .
Bolt froze several times on the BlackBerry and would eventually crash with a key buffer overflow if I kept pressing the keys when it was frozen .
Although the BlackBerry is old , Opera Mini is very responsive on it , scrolling and general UI speed is as good on it as on the N95 .
Bitstream is touting Bolt ’s speed , claiming it to be 60 % faster than Opera Mini in loading espn.com and 100 % faster with cnn.com .
I was not able to reproduce those results , Bolt was fast but Opera Mini was even faster .
I tested both the full and mobile versions of ESPN and CNN and Opera Mini was consistently faster .
I ’m pretty sure that Bitstream was quoting times for the full web versions although both sites recognize Opera Mini as a mobile browser and deliver their mobile versions to it .
You can force the full web versions to load in any browser using the URL ’s http://edition.cnn.com/us/ and http://espn.go.com.
I also loaded the same sites in the N95 ’s native WebKit browser for comparison .
All tests were done on the AT&T network in San Francisco using a strong ( full bars ) HSPA signal .
Site CNN ( full ) CNN ( mobile ) ESPN ( full ) ESPN ( mobile ) Opera Mini 6 sec 3 sec 9 sec 3 sec Bolt 15 sec 6 sec 13 sec 8 sec WebKit 51 sec 8 sec 35 sec 10 sec
Site Compatability
I have a suite of “ horror sites ” which give almost all mobile browsers fits .
“ Classic ” Yahoo Mail , the “ Classic ” full version of Bloglines and 1and1 Webmail , all which use some complex Javascript .
The fourth site of the test suite is the WordPress administrative console of this blog which adds HTTP basic authentication to the mix .
Until recently none of them were completely functional in Opera Mini , however in Opera Mini 4.2 , Y !
Mail now works perfectly .
How did Bolt do ?
Bloglines – Bolt handled Bloglines with no problems at which is pretty impressive as the site does n’t work at all in Opera Mini , TeaShark , Skyfire or UCWeb
Yahoo Mail – Bolt did not do as well as Opera Mini on Y! Mail .
While reading emails was not a problem , moving them to folders was impossible because the “ Move ” drop down displayed as a solid gray rectangle .
1and1 Webmail – Bolt got past 1and1 ’s animated splash screen that trips up most mobile browsers and I was actually able to log in , however when I click on my Inbox I get an “ Unknown Host ” error .
Bolt is also not able to handle the HTTP basic authentication which I use to help protect the administrative console of my web host Not many mobile browsers support basic authentication but Opera Mini does .
Overall Bolt did better than most mobile browsers with the suite of “ horror sites ” it ’s the first server based browser I ’ve seen that can handle the horror of frames and Ajax that is Bloglines , it mostly worked with Y !
Mail and it got farther than most with 1and1 .
Conclusions
For an initial Beta , Bolt is very impressive .
It come close to Opera Mini in speed and site compatibility and equals it in overall rendering quality .
Stability is pretty good too .
I expect that Bolt will get better and better as it passes though the Beta cycle .
I ’m especially hopping that Bitstream can add the two features that everyone wants , tabs and the ability to copy text from web pages .

Obama - not much different that Reagan , Clinton or the Bushes �American finance : strange and preposterous , but never dull � *** A division of delusion , which led to huge bubbles �who will suffer most when the bus comes ?
***
One thing that Team Obama will fight to the death �countries around the world play " hot potato " with correction �and more !
---------------------
We 've been on Bubble Watch for the last ten years .
Now , we 're on Bust Watch � Tim Geithner , Obama 's choice for Treasury Secretary , may not have seen the bust on Wall Street coming �but he promises action on a " dramatic scale " to fix it .
That is probably what goosed - up the Dow yesterday - up 279 points .
Oil rose to $ 43 .
Both gold and the dollar went down .
The dollar fell to $ 1.29 per euro �while gold sellers got $ 5 less per ounce .
The price of gold is $ 850 .
" The End of the Reagan Era , " is how the French newspaper , The Liberation , described the handover of power to Barack Obama 's team .
The Liberation has it right .
What we are witnessing is the end of an era .
But it 's not exactly the era most people think .
The voters made a big symbolic change when they elected Obama .
But politically , Obama is not so different from Reagan , Bush I , Clinton or Bush II .
A much bigger change has just occurred - and gone almost unnoticed .
This one was wrought not by the voters , but by Mr. Market .
He has brought an end to the world financial system that arose during the Reagan years .
For the last ten years , these Daily Reckonings have been on Bubble Watch �watching �wondering �marveling �sometimes appalled �sometimes amused � � what we were watching was the blow up of a crazy system of imperial finance , in which the world 's hegemony appeared to live at the expense of its rivals �and the imperial citizens - those in the homeland of the United States of America - drove themselves into bankruptcy so competitors could continue to sell their products at a profit .
It was strange .
It was preposterous .
But it was n't dull .
We thought it was coming to an end in 2001 � when the bubble in dotcoms blew up .
Then , well , you know what happened �the feds got to work �and pumped up more bubbles .
Now , the Bubble Epoque is nearly over .
But Mr. Obama is jumping the gun� " Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America , " he says .
Hold on �there are some huge busts that have to happen first �
We 're watching for busts in U.S. government debt ( U.S. Treasury paper ) �the dollar �and finally , after a big run-up , gold .
Then , Americans can rebuild on a more solid foundation .
The gist of the world economy for the past quarter century was a division of delusion , which led to huge bubbles .
Americans pretended to have good money .
Asians pretended to have a good customer .
Bankers pretended to have good credits .
And Wall Street pretended that toxic assets were good ones .
Asians made ; Americans took .
Asians saved ; Americans borrowed .
Americans provided the demand .
Asians provided the supply .
Asians built a real economy , with real money , and real factories and real skills .
America 's economy was mostly a conceit , in which people became accustomed to a standard of living that very few of them could afford .
But now it has come to an end .
And whom do you think will suffer most ?
Our guess : the Chinese !
Eighty years ago , America was in China 's position .
It was the world 's young , growing , dynamic economy .
Manhattan soared then as Shanghai soars now .
But when the collapse came in the '30s , the demand for American goods shriveled .
Foreign and domestic purchasers pulled in their belts and cancelled their orders .
For a while , America was out of business .
It was only at the onset of WWII that the orders started coming in again in massive quantities .
This time , it 's China that 's going out of business .
Yes , dear reader , China is going to suffer even more than the United States .
At least in the short run .
America will lose its position in the world .
The dollar will lose its status as the world 's reserve currency .
Americans will be beaten up - first by deflation , then by inflation .
When it is over , they will be poorer , wiser , and probably better people �
With a little luck and good leadership , maybe they can sink into a graceful post - imperial poverty �followed by genuine prosperity .
That is the story we 'll be covering in The Daily Reckoning going forward .
It is the story of BUSTS .
Companies will go bust .
Governments will go bust ( Ireland and Iceland are already effectively broke . )
Households will go broke by the millions .
And , eventually , even the U.S. government itself will go bust .
( A bankruptcy that will most likely be disguised by inflation � )
But China !
There , the story will be even more dramatic�even more dangerous�even more explosive ! ***
" Time to mobilize for all - out war , " says a headline in the Financial Times , speaking of saving Britain 's banks from themselves .
But this could just as well refer to President Obama 's attack on the correction .
Nobody wants a correction .
And Team Obama has pledged to fight it to the death .
Which is why we will stick with our " Trade of the Decade . "
Buy gold on dips ; sell stocks on rallies .
This trade - announced 9 years ago - has been good to us .
Gold has closed every single year ahead of where it started .
From under $ 300 an ounce it went up over $ 1,000 - briefly .
Now , it trades in the $ 800 range .
What do you think , dear reader ?
Is the gold bull market over ?
Are the troubles in the world financial system all taken care of ?
Is it time for another bust in the gold market - the only market ( aside from U.S. Treasuries ) to resist last year 's sell - off ?
" My one recommendation for the longer term , " says Felix Zulauf in Barron's , " is physical gold .
Consider the basic set - up : World economies are so weak that we are seeing government stimulation of historic proportions .
At first this is deflationary , but it will become inflationary .
Gold is the only currency that wo n't get devalued .
It will be revalued .
" If the Fed 's liabilities had to be covered in gold , it would sell for more than $ 6,000 an ounce .
We are n't going back to the gold standard , but the markets wo n't trust the central banks anymore .
Gold is a very slow bull market �the gold market could have a shakeout in the next 6 months , and the price could fall back to $ 700 an ounce or below from today 's $ 850 .
But two years from now it will be a lot higher .
It is one of the few commodities that held up during the forced liquidation of almost everything else . " ***
If the United States catches the flu �the rest of the world throws up .
And now , with markets retching all over the planet , finance ministers are getting together to come up with a global solution .
Somehow , demand must be stimulated in Asia .
Supply must be coaxed out of the United States .
Balance must be restored , they say .
But do n't hold your breath .
Any global bailout plan is bound to be a bad one .
Because what the world really needs is a correction .
And no country wants one .
Instead , each nation does its best to push the correction onto its neighbors .
An old friend , Lord Rees - Mogg , adds further comment : " Between the mid nineteenth and mid twentieth century , there had been a vigorous debate about the causes of the trade cycle , and of the crises which had upset the growth of the world economy .
" That debate had , however , never reached a conclusion .
Among economists there was no consensus on what caused the crises to occur or on what measures would help to stabilise another depression � " �there are at least five different alleged causes , which are still arguable .
If the Central Bankers and Treasury Ministers do not agree on the cause of the present crisis they are not likely to agree on the remedy .
One needs to keep theory in mind because it influences decision - making .
" However , we are beginning to see that there is a consensus developing on the policy that is needed .
Economists and politicians are concentrating on the need to restore confidence .
The Inaugural Address of President Barack Obama repeated the theme of Franklin Roosevelt 's Address in March , 1933 : ' We have nothing to fear , but fear itself . '
He also attacked the greed and irresponsibility of the bankers , who had behaved just as badly as they did in the early 1930s .
The practical action of Governments around the world is to increase the money supply until businesses will borrow and banks will lend .
Everyone recognises that this makes a risk of excessive inflation of the money supply , but it is a risk which Governments feel they have no choice but to take .
They are not trying to rebalance the world economy ; they are desperate to relight the boiler .
In the end they will succeed . "
Inflation is what they want ; inflation is what they will get .
Until tomorrow , Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning ---------------------
The Daily Reckoning PRESENTS : Now that Obama has officially dropped the " elect " from his title , what can we expect from his administration �and what does it mean for the country ?
Byron King passes along some rather grim predictions from an " Obama insider " , and gives us some advice on how to deal with the coming fallout .
Read on � TIPS FROM AN OBAMA INSIDER ON THE NEXT 2 YEARS
by Byron W. King The Inauguration is over .
It 's PRESIDENT Obama now .
So let 's get back to work .
My plan was to do more portfolio updates .
But huh ?
You did n't get enough ?
You still want to talk about Tuesday 's festivities ?
Yes , the Inauguration was historic in many ways .
It was definitely a blend of many things .
There was classic Americana , with the Stars and Stripes snapping in the stiff breezes .
There was the Army 's Old Guard unit marching to fife and drum , along with respectful references to George Washington and the Founding Fathers .
Then there were elements of modern culture .
We saw the now elderly veterans of the 1960s Civil Rights movement , as well as the more youthful proponents of hard environmentalism whose chief focus is climate change .
There was even a " Green Inaugural Ball . "
So we saw the old and the new .
I think that 's a key theme of this administration .
How much of each ?
That 's the big question .
So stand by .
Meanwhile , what else can we discern about the incoming Obama administration ?
I had a long talk with an old friend who is a self - described " rabid Democrat . "
Let me rephrase that .
He 's a rabid Democrat in the way that Pittsburgh Steelers team owner Dan Rooney is a rabid football partisan .
This friend of mine loves his Democratic Party .
Just as Mr. Rooney wants his Steelers to win the Super Bowl , this guy 's focus in life is for his political tribe to do what 's right for the country .
This friend of mine is also privy to the inner circles of Democratic politics .
He 's just plain plugged in .
He 's on a first - name basis with many on Team Obama .
So what 's on Obama 's plate ?
" Well , the first thing the new group has to do is stabilize the banking system , " he told me .
" Things are still precarious with the banks .
Liabilities exceed assets by a large margin .
We will probably see more bank failures - small and even some large banks .
That would hurt worldwide investor confidence and lead the stock markets down .
We could test the old lows of last fall . "
This Democrat insider then got into other issues .
" The housing crunch still has more rope to hang out , as well .
A lot of the problem is isolated in a few states and regions of states - California , Arizona , southern Florida , the New York City metropolitan area , Massachusetts and a few other places .
But it affects a lot of people .
We 're dealing with populous , overbuilt places .
We are also on the cusp of a lot of failures of government entities , from localities and school districts to counties .
We 're going to have a lot of municipal bond defaults .
We 're going to see municipal bankruptcies .
Some large states are insolvent .
California can't meet payroll . "
And there 's more from this guy .
" The next big wave will be that consumer spending dries up .
This will lead to a failure of retail businesses all over the country .
It 's going to be a huge unwinding .
We spent the past 25 years spending more than we could afford .
Now we as a nation have to pay some big bills .
It 's time to save .
It 's a good thing , in the big scheme , for people to save .
But it 's going to put a lot of pain into the retail sector of the economy .
We 've overbuilt retail , and everything that goes with it .
Too many stores .
Too many buildings .
Too much inventory .
Too much shipping capacity .
Too many containerships unloading too much stuff made in China and elsewhere .
And a lot of people are going to lose jobs .
I mean a lot of people .
Everywhere . "
Here 's more from the Democrat insider .
" The next two years are going to stink for the economy .
Obama will face one financial crisis after another .
He 's going to hate Wall Street .
He 's going to hate bankers .
Every time he turns around , the money people are going to be screwing him .
He 'll try to fix one problem , and five more problems will spring up like weeds .
( ' Only five ? ' I asked . )
" The coming financial issues will test the ability of the legislative branch to act with integrity in the face of a media - driven clamor .
States will be lining up to borrow money from the feds just to pay unemployment compensation , let alone to fund Medicaid and road maintenance .
It will test the legal system as well .
Expect more petty crime and a lot more bankruptcy .
But fewer people will get divorced .
Who can afford that anymore ?
" And think about the foreign policy issues that the financial crises will cause .
Just think in terms that when U.S. prosperity declines , it takes the world down with it .
The economic contraction is going to set some societies back by decades .
Will people take that lying down ?
Or will they riot in the streets and burn down the capitol building ?
Expect a rash of failed states .
We 'll be surprised at some of the names that fall off the map .
Wow , we might look back and wish for the days when the world hated us just because we invaded Iraq .
Now they 'll blame us for stealing their future .
" The Republicans will make political hay out of it .
Unless they are totally incompetent , which you can't rule out .
Democrats will probably lose seats in the House and Senate in the 2010 elections , as well as in state legislatures and governorships .
But Obama will be working his own game of building consensus .
He 's from a new generation of politician .
He 's not nearly as in - your - face confrontational as the Democrats of the 1960s and 1970s era , the Kennedys and Waxmans and Barney Franks .
Obama will build coalitions out of whomever he can get on board .
You might not like him on issues like gun control or abortion , but you 'll deal with him on tax cuts and energy investment . "
So where do we go from here ?
Well , here 's my post - Inaugural advice .
Build up some cash reserves .
Got that ?
Hold Cash !
Cash in the mattress .
Cash in the bank .
Certificates of deposit .
Do n't try to get too fancy .
Just save some cash where you can get hold of it in case you need it pronto .
Next , buy precious metals like gold and silver .
Bullion coins or bars are my favorites .
But it never hurts to buy a few quality numismatic coins as well .
Do n't get spooked out of precious metals if we see a price dip in the near to medium term .
The dollar is in serious trouble , and eventually the precious metals will come back .
Precious metals are a way of preserving your purchasing power over the long term .
As for stocks , in the near future , we could see some severe market declines .
Initially , this might look like large trading spikes up and down .
Unless you are a serious trader , be careful about trying to " play " the swings .
Do n't be afraid to sell any stock that makes you nervous .
You have to be able to sleep at night .
Until next we meet , Byron W. King
for The Daily Reckoning P.S.
There are certain investment ideas that will probably work over the long term , and as I mentioned above , precious metals like gold and silver are excellent examples of this .
Gold in particular is one of the best stores of wealth you can have , and acts as a great hedge against inflation .
It 's a pretty good bet that gold has a lot further to go in the coming years , and this report should give you a head start on how to profit from it .

Omer Goldman is 19 , she ’s Jewish , lives in Tel Aviv , she ’s a pretty girl and it ’s not hard to imagine her fulfilling her ambition to one day be an actress .
But since she was eight years old , she also had another dream — she wanted to work with an organization like Amnesty International , hoping she could help make a better world .
Right now , her way of doing that is by going to prison .
Choosing to go to prison rather than serve in the Israeli army — a compulsory requirement for all young Israeli citizens .
And Omer Goldman was not destined for prison .
For most of her life she thought she ’d join the army , and become a hero for her country .
After all , her father is a former deputy head of Mossad , and still considered one of the most powerful men of the Israeli security establishment .
Her older sister and most of her friends all did their military service without question .
But the second Lebanon war began to change Omer ’s mind .
She visited Hebron , and started going regularly to the West Bank and saw how Palestinians lived , how they were treated .
Protest group
She took part in demonstrations , and she was with a protest group in a West Bank village and they were trying to pull down a checkpoint that had been built unnecessarily in the middle of the village
“ It should n’t have been there ” , she says , “ they only put it up to harass the villagers . ”
And suddenly the soldiers started firing on the group of demonstrators .
“ This is the army that I was brought up to think was protecting me , helping me ” , she says , the shock of the event still evident in her voice .
She was shot in the hand by a rubber bullet , and knew then and there that she would never wear the uniform of a force that committed such actions .
Meaningful time
On the day she was supposed to sign up , she turned up with about a hundred supporters .
And she publicly refused to join the army .
She was immediately taken to a cell , and then to a military court where the judge — a high ranking officer — tried to convince her that she could become a soldier and change things from the inside .
“ You could give toffees to the Palestinian children on the checkpoints ” , he told her , apparently without irony .
Her reply — “ giving out toffees does n’t change the fact that I will be there illegally ” — so incensed him that she was immediately given a harsher sentence than other conscientious objectors who stood out that day .
Omer has spent two spells in jail — despite her fear of prison , and her acknowledgement that it was an awful experience to be locked up in a middle sized cell with forty other women — she says that in retrospect that time was amongst the most meaningful in her life .
Shunned by friends
Omer is now exempt from conscription on medical grounds , but she continues to turn up to demonstrations , to speak out against what she sees as injustices committed by her countrymen and her government on an innocent civilian population .
Her stance has cost her dearly .
Friends have shunned her , strangers have physically attacked her , and her father refuses contact with her anymore .
So then why keep on ?
Why take such a stand ?
Her answer is firm :
“ Because when this Occupation ends — in twenty years or thirty , though I hope it will be sooner — I want to be able to say I did something , that I did n’t just stand by and watch this injustice …my being in prison has not helped one Palestinian I know , but at least I made a stand for what I believe to be right — to say that violence is not the answer . ”
$ 198M Facility To Be Completed In 2010
British billionaire Richard Branson signed a 20 - year lease with the state of New Mexico last week to build the first US spaceport , and Virgin Galactic expects to break ground on the facility by April , with completion slated for sometime in 2010 .
" The signing of this agreement is a momentous day for our state and has cemented New Mexico as the home of commercial space travel , " Governor Bill Richardson said .
" I want to thank Virgin Galactic for partnering with us to create a whole new industry that is going to transform the economy of Southern New Mexico - creating thousands of jobs , generating money for education , boosting tourism and attracting other companies and economic opportunities to the area . "
$ 140 million in state funds have been made available for the project , freed for use by the Federal Aviation Administration 's grant of a launch license to the New Mexico Spaceport Authority .
The launch site has previously been used by Lockheed Martin , Armadillo Aerospace , UP Aerospace , Microgravity Enterprises , and Payload Specialties .
As ANN reported , Burt Rutan originally designed the first White Knight and SpaceShipOne to win the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 .
The WhiteKnight Two mothership is powered by four Pratt and Whitney PW308A engines .
The WhiteKnight Two is the world 's largest , all carbon composite aircraft ; it has a unique high altitude lift capacity , capable of launching SpaceShip Two and its eight astronauts into sub-orbital space flight .
For the price of $ 200,000 , passengers will experience sub-orbital spaceflight and a brief period of zero - gravity .
The next Stargate crew is slowly coming together , including the boyfriend from Ugly Betty , David Blue .
The cast 's descriptions are n't really putting the " Teen Stargate " rumors to rest , but we 're still intrigued .

David Blue ( former the lovable ex-boyfriend of Mark from Ugly Betty , pictured above ) is playing Eli Wallace .
He 's got the brains of a Stargate problem solver , but none of the drive .
The crew 's resident slacker is good at everything he does , from computers to video games .
Eli supposedly has a mean streak in his humor — so basically we 're getting a young McKay , I approve only because it 's Blue .

Justin Louis of Hidden Hills fame is taking on the role of Colonel Everett Young , one of the more experienced members of the crew .
He 's married and was previously described as the Jack O'Neill of the group , but with a shorter fuse .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Jamil Walker will be Sr. Sgt. Ronald Greer .
You may remember him from Smith , Sister or also the voice of Gerald in Hey Arnold .
Greer is the pissy one with the tortured soul tough exterior .
What do you wanna bet he 's just waiting to crack open , with a little love and tenderness ?
I 'm also thinking that this character may be replacing the Ron " Psycho " Stasiak personality that was rumored in a casting call for Universe earlier .

Brian J. Smith from Hate Crime is cast as Lt. Matthew Scott , who is another one of the Stargate younglings .
But this year is all about Scott taking responsibility as a leader .
Like all of the other attractive males of Stargate past , he 'll be a bit troubled , maybe save a few lives and take a few " dangerous " risks , but I bet he makes it out okay everytime .
Robert Carlyle has been cast as Dr. David Rush which I think was a huge get for the Universe crew , so who 's still left to cast ?
We still need some ladies , and according to a casting call these roles are still left to be filled :
Robert Carlyle Joins Stargate Universe Crew
The producers of Stargate Universe have cast themselves a doctor .
Robert Carlyle is joining the SGU Read more

Tamara Jon :
A young 20 - something " preferably Asian " who will be the SGU medic .
She dreamed of being a doctor , but could n't afford medical school , so she joined the Air Force .
Jon is a miracle worker , who makes do with the limited supplies aboard her ship .
Chloe Walker :
Another 20 - year - old hottie who was born into wealth , but left it all for the Navy with dreams of becoming a politician just like Daddy ( who died tragically ) .
She also has an Ivy League education .
Lt. Jared Nash :
A young man who is , " every teenage girl 's fantasy . "
He 's the hottie of the group , a young and restless " always willing to go first " type of character ... so sort of like Sheppard .
This could also be Lt. Matthew Scott mentioned above , but we do n't have too much to go on right now .
UPDATE : This is indeed the character above Lt. Matthew Scott , the names were changed by the Producers .

Ron " Psycho " Stasiak :
Ron will be the big strong type , like a Teal'c — you can tell because his middle name is " psycho . "
Also a young man ( only 20 years old ) , Ron has a combat filled past .
But like all people who are quiet , he 's filled with mystery .
Unless he 's been replaced by Sr. Sgt. Ronald Greer , in which case this character has already been cast !

Selectors
CSS3
Sizzle supports virtually all CSS 3 Selectors , including escaped selectors ( . foo\ + bar ) , Unicode selectors , and results returned in document order .
The only exceptions are those that would require additional DOM event listeners to keep track of the state of elements .
As such , the following pseudo - selectors are not supported :
: hover
: active
:visited , :link
Note :
These CSS3 pseudo - selectors were unsupported prior to version 1.9 :
: target
:root
: nth - last - child
:nth - of - type , :nth - last - of - type , : first - of - type , : last - of - type , :only - of- type
, , , , : lang ( )
Other selectors and conventions
Changes
Full selector lists in : not ( ) ; e.g. : not ( a.b ) , : not ( div > p ) , : not ( div , p )
; e.g. , , Nested pseudo - selectors ; e.g. : not ( : has ( div: first - child ) )
Additions
[ NAME !=VALUE ] : Elements whose NAME attribute does n't match the specified value .
Equivalent to : not([ NAME=VALUE ] ) .
: Elements whose NAME attribute does n't match the specified value .
Equivalent to . : contains ( TEXT ) : Elements with textContent containing the word ' TEXT ' .
Case - sensitive .
: Elements with textContent containing the word ' TEXT ' .
Case - sensitive .
: header : Header elements ( h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 ) .
: Header elements ( h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 ) .
: parent : Elements with at least one child node ( either text or an element ) .
: Elements with at least one child node ( either text or an element ) .
: selected : ( option ) elements that are currently selected
Form Selector Additions
Note :
In this context , input , button , select , and textarea are all considered to be input elements .
:input : Input elements
: Input elements : button : Input elements that are button s or have type " button "
: Input elements that are s or have type " button " : checkbox , : file , :image , : password , :radio , : reset , : submit , : text : Input elements with the specified type
Positional Selector Additions
In this context , " positional " refers to an element 's placement in the collection after a selection , based on document order .
For example , div : first would return an array containing the first div on the page , while div : first em would target the first div on the page and select all em elements within .
Note : Positional indexes begin at zero .
: first / : last :
The first / last matching element
/ : The first / last matching element : even / :odd : Even / odd - numbered elements
/ : Even/odd - numbered elements :eq / :nth :
The nth element ; e.g. :eq ( 5 ) finds the 6th element
/ : The nth element ; e.g. finds the 6th element :lt / :gt : Elements at positions above / below the specified position
API
The Sizzle API consists of 3 parts :
The Public API , which users interact with .
, which users interact with .
The Extension API , for modifications to the selector engine .
, for modifications to the selector engine .
The Internal API , used internally by Sizzle .
Public API
Sizzle ( String selector [ , DOMNode context [ , Array results ] ] )
The main function for finding elements .
Uses querySelectorAll if available .
returns ( Array ) :
All elements matching the selector
Parameters
selector : A CSS selector
context :
An element , document , or document fragment to use as the context for finding elements .
Defaults to document .
Note : Prior to version 2.1 , document fragments were not valid here .
results :
An array or an array - like object , to which Sizzle will append results .
For example , jQuery passes a jQuery collection .
An " array - like object " is an object with a nonnegative numeric length property and a push method .
Sizzle.matchesSelector( DOMElement element , String selector )
Uses native matchesSelector if available
returns ( Boolean ) :
Whether the given element matches the selector
Parameters
element : A DOMElement against which Sizzle will test the selector
selector : A CSS selector
Sizzle.matches ( String selector , Array < DOMElement > elements )
returns ( Array ) : Elements in the array that match the given selector
Parameters
selector : A CSS selector
elements :
An array of DOMElements to filter against the specified selector
Extension API
Sizzle.selectors.match.NAME
= RegExp
This contains the regular expressions used to parse a selector into different parts , to be used for finding and filtering .
The name of each of the regular expressions should correspond to the names specified in the Sizzle.selectors .
find and Sizzle.selectors .
filter objects .
Finding
In order to add a new find function :
A regular expression must be added to the match object .
object .
A function to find must be defined .
must be defined . " | " + NAME must be appended to the Sizzle.selectors .order regex .
Sizzle.selectors.find.NAME = function ( match , context , isXML ) {}
A method for finding some elements on a page .
The specified function will be called no more than once per selector .
match is the array of results returned from matching the specified regex against the selector .
is the array of results returned from matching the specified regex against the selector .
context is the DOMElement or DOMDocument from which selection will occur .
is the DOMElement or DOMDocument from which selection will occur .
isXML is a boolean value indicating whether the function is currently operating within an XML document .
Filtering
In order to add a new filtering statement :
A regular expression must be added to the match object .
object .
A function must be added to the filter object .
object .
A function may optionally be added to the preFilter object .
Sizzle.selectors.preFilter.NAME = function ( match ) {}
An optional pre-filter function which allows filtering of the matched array against the corresponding regular expression , which will return a new matched array .
This matched array will eventually be passed and flattened as arguments against the corresponding filter function .
This is intended to clean up some of the repetitive processing that occurs in a filter function .
Note : match [ 0 ] will be deleted prior to being passed to a filter , and must not be used .
The arguments for a filter method are the element and the captures from the regex corresponding to this filter ( indicated above by what is in the match , starting at index 1 ) .
The return result must be boolean : true if the element matches the selector , false if not .
Attributes
Sizzle.selectors.attrHandle.LOWERCASE_NAME
= function ( elem , casePreservedName , isXML ) {}
Handle an attribute which requires specialized processing ( such as href , which has cross - browser issues ) .
The return result must be the actual string value of that attribute .
Sizzle.selectors.pseudos.NAME = function ( elem ) {}
The most common extension to a selector engine : adding a new pseudo .
The return result from this function must be boolean : true if the element matches the selector , false if not .
For example , this defines a simple : fixed pseudo :
var $ test = jQuery ( document ) ; Sizzle .
selectors .
pseudos .
fixed = function ( elem ) { $ test [ 0 ] = elem ; return $ test .
css ( " position " ) === " fixed " ; } ;
createPseudo is only required if the custom pseudo - selector accepts an argument .
Note :
In jQuery 1.8 and earlier , the API for creating custom pseudos with arguments was broken .
In jQuery 1.8.1+ , the API is backwards - compatible .
Regardless , the use of createPseudo is greatly encouraged .
Now that the parser compiles a single function containing other functions , custom pseudo - selectors with arguments are much cleaner .
For example , within Sizzle , the implementation of the : not ( < sub-selector > ) pseudo is very similar to :
Sizzle .
selectors .
pseudos .
not = Sizzle .
selectors .
createPseudo ( function ( subSelector ) { var matcher = Sizzle .
compile ( subSelector ) ; return function ( elem ) { return !
matcher ( elem ) ; } ; } ) ;
Backwards - compatible plugins for pseudos with arguments
In order to write a custom selector with arguments that can take advantage of the new API , yet still support all versions of Sizzle , check for the createPseudo method .
The following example uses jQuery syntax .
Live example
//
An implementation of a case - insensitive contains pseudo // made for all versions of jQuery ( function ( $ ) { function icontains ( elem , text ) { return ( elem .
textContent || elem .
innerText || $ ( elem ) . text ( ) || " " ) .
toLowerCase ( ) . indexOf ( ( text || " " ) .
toLowerCase ( ) ) > - 1 ; } $ . expr . pseudos .
icontains = $ . expr . createPseudo ? $ . expr .
createPseudo ( function ( text ) { return function ( elem ) { return icontains ( elem , text ) ; } ; } ) : function ( elem , i , match ) { return icontains ( elem , match [ 3 ] ) ; } ; } ) ( j Query ) ;
Sizzle.selectors.setFilters.LOWERCASE_NAME
= function ( elements , argument , not ) {}
These filters are run after a previous part of a selector has already returned results .
setFilters are found from matching Sizzle.selectors.match.POS
.
When applicable , argument is expected to be an integer .
The not argument is a boolean indicating whether the result should be inverted ( as in div: not ( : first ) ) .
For example , the code for the : first setFilter is similar to :
var first = function ( elements , argument , not ) { //
No argument for first return not ?
elements .
slice ( 1 ) : [ elements [ 0 ] ] ; } ; Sizzle .
selectors .
setFilters .
first = first ;
It is easy to extend Sizzle -- even Sizzle 's POS selectors .
For example , to rename : first as :uno :
Sizzle .
selectors .
match .
POS = new RegExp ( oldPOS . source .
replace ( " first " , " uno " ) , " gi " ) ; Sizzle .
selectors .
setFilters . uno = Sizzle . selectors .
setFilters . first ; delete Sizzle .
selectors .
setFilters . first ; Sizzle ( " div:uno " ) ; // ==> [ < div > ]
Internal API
Note : Functionality should be accessed via the Public and Extension APIs .
While the Internal API is intended specifically for internal use , it has been exposed for edge cases .
Sizzle internally caches compiled selector functions and tokenization objects .
The length of these caches defaults to 50 , but can be set to any positive integer by assigning to this property .
Sizzle.compile( selector )
This method compiles a selector function and caches it for later use .
For example , calling Sizzle.compile ( " . myWidget:myPseudo " ) during initialization of a plugin will speed up the first selection of matching elements .
returns ( Function ) :
The compiled function to be used when filtering the set of possibly matching elements
Parameters
selector : A CSS selector

Tomato Rice – Thakkali Sadham
Time is passing like crazy and I apologize for my absence off late .
Tomato Rice has to be one of those simplest of Â variety rice dishes yet can be very fulfilling to your taste buds .
It ’s one of my favorite lunch box meals in my school days .
This is the first year we had a little garden patch in our backyard and we got plenty of tomatoes this season .
Tomato rice being like my most favorite of variety rice dishes , I made it from our own garden tomatoes .
It ’s actually very easy to cook too .
This is my mom ’s special recipe and I can’t believe I am letting the family secret out .
Just kidding :-) .
I love sharing those secrets with you .
Ingredients :
Tomatoes : 2 ( make it into puree )
Onion : 1/2 ( Medium )
Green chili : 4
Curry Leaves : 5 to 6
Ginger : 2 tsp ( finely chopped )
Peanuts : 1/4 cup
For seasonings :
Oil : 2 tbsp
Mustard seeds : 2 tsp
Urad dal : 2 tsp
Channa dal : 1 tbsp
For masala Powder :
Coriander seeds : 1 tbsp
Channa dal : 1 tbsp
Fenugreek seeds : 1/3 tsp
Curry leaves : 2
Method of Preparation :
Fry all the masala ingredients and let it cool for a few minutes .
Then grind them into a fine powder .
Boil the tomatoes and peel the skin off it .
And mash it by hand or using a masher into a puree .
Heat oil in a pan , add the seasonings and when the seeds sputter , add ginger and peanuts and let them fry for few minutes .
Now add onions , green chilies and curry leaves and when the onions turns translucent , add the tomato puree , turmeric powder and little salt .
Let it boil for 5 minutes in medium heat .
When its come to a complete boil add the masala powder into it and mix it all together .
Turn off the heat and make sure the gravy is thick .
Now you can mix this gravy with the rice and garnish with coriander leaves .
DESERONTO , ont .
– Just minutes to game time , hockey fans are snaking up to the arena doors , eager to watch their beloved Deseronto Storm .
Little children hop from foot to foot , unable to still their excitement .
Giggly girls in tight jeans apply final coats of lip gloss .
Boys in hockey jerseys take deep drags from cigarettes before stepping in to watch their peers skate toward dreams of playing professional hockey in a country where the sport is akin to a national religion .
Spirits are high tonight in this town of 1,800 , about 200 kilometres east of Toronto , which has been dealt some harsh blows of late .
Industries have moved elsewhere , forcing residents to work in Napanee , Kingston or Belleville .
Development is at a standstill because of long - standing land disputes between residents of the town and nearby Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory .
And residents are still reeling from the lurid allegations involving David Frost , who once coached the now defunct Quinte Hawks at this same arena and became notorious for the alleged Svengali - like control he had over certain players .
Frost is charged with sexually exploiting two of his former players by having threesomes with them and their girlfriends in a Deseronto hotel room a dozen years ago .
The verdict , due Friday , should bring some closure to the townspeople .
But at the arena , all those troubles are set aside .
" The Storm seems to bring us together , " says the town 's mayor , Norm Clark .
" There 's no politics talked about , no land claim talked about , no roadblock issues talked about ; everybody is there , native and non-native .
...
Everybody is there with the same goal – that the Deseronto Storm win their hockey game . "
Outside the arena , a mural proudly announces that this is the home of the Deseronto Hockey Heroes .
It is a lofty term for the Tier II Junior A hockey team , a bunch of guys between the ages of 15 and 20 skating toward a scholarship with an American college or a spot in the Ontario Hockey League , two paths to the NHL .
In the parking lot , while rustling through their pockets for change to pay the $ 8 cover , adults agree it is a great deal for a night out in a town where the only other entertainment option is the local watering hole – called the Git R Dun Roadhouse .
The arena becomes a focal point , where pimple - faced , tobacco - chewing players are catapulted into small - town celebrities .
Their games routinely attract about 350 people , their photos appear in local papers , their signatures are sought by star - struck children and their attention is coveted by gaggles of girls who hang out at the arena , earning the nickname " puck bunnies " or " Storm chasers . "
But with the perks comes intense pressure to perform .
This is where they 'll make it or break it .
They have come from as far away as Sweden , across the GTA and neighbouring communities – all with the same dream .
On this crisp Saturday evening , the bleachers are filling quickly .
This is hockey night in Deseronto .
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM begins .
It is a sizeable crowd , but the stands are not quite filled to the rafters , as they were when the Hawks played here .
" The ( Toronto ) Maple Leafs could come to Deseronto and there 'd still be people saying it's not the Hawks , " recalls Cameron MacLean , who was in charge of the Hawks 's publicity .
When the Hawks disbanded in 1998 , the town suffered a " loss of identity " he says .
" The town went from having something good to having it all taken away , " says MacLean , who now lives in Kingston .
" Hockey in Deseronto was like Friday Night Lights . "
The void was filled in 2006 when the Deseronto Thunder surfaced , now called the Deseronto Storm .
But those early days were n't easy for coach Matt Barnhardt , a former Hawks player .
It was tough to earn the trust of parents , still shaken by the Frost legacy .
But with time , this local boy from the reserve who once played in the OHL has won their trust .
Town spirit is " back up " says Cindy Thompson , who billets a player from England and helps raise money for the team by knitting " puck bunny " ponchos , blankets and hats in orange , black and white – the team 's colours .
" It 's got the people reignited and passionate about hockey .
And it 's got people helping these kids to grow . "
The support is a major boost , says defenceman Josh Fontana , who is originally from Scarborough .
In Toronto , he says , fans typically consist of family and friends but in Deseronto , everyone shows up .
" Around the town , I have people saying , ` Hey Josh , good game , ' and some of them are people I do n't even know . "
He has no regrets about trading Toronto 's Yonge St. for Deseronto 's Main St. , about five blocks of antique shops , greasy spoons and variety stores .
" It 's the perfect place for hockey , " says the 19 - year - old , adding " there 's no , like , real distraction . "
BY THE FIRST INTERMISSION , the game is tied 2 - 2 . Coach Barnhardt paces the dressing room .
Few have the nerve to look at him .
" It 's your hometown crowd , it 's your puck , it 's your game , " yells the 28 - year - old coach .
" Mistakes are gonna cost you .
...
First place is on the line . "
The pressure is on .
And not just in this game .
Life can be tough , particularly for players away from home who are dependent on the kindness of strangers .
They are on a tight schedule , bouncing between school , work , the gym and the arena , with little time to do what boys their ages do , such as hunt and fish .
" It 's almost like a religion , " says defenceman Camron Edwards about coming to the rink everyday .
" It 's a way of life for some people . "
But for Edwards , 18 , from nearby Napanee , the hectic schedule is worth it , especially when he steps onto the ice before screaming fans : " It 's a rush . "
Players shrug off questions about pressure , saying it 's par for the course .
Leaving family and friends in the summer of 2007 was " a small sacrifice " for a shot at playing in the NHL , says goalie Jens Kansell , a 20 - year - old from the small town of Mora , Sweden .
This is the last year he is eligible to play junior A hockey and he has not received any offers .
If they do not come soon , he will return home and play for a league there .
" The NHL feels pretty far away right now , but it 's not impossible , " he says .
For Fontana , the pressure is on to boost his marks in the hopes of getting a better scholarship than the one he deferred last year to Michigan 's Finlandia University .
There are still dreams of playing in the NHL – dreams shared by his father , who taught him how to skate at 18 months on a frozen puddle in the backyard – but he is focused on taking the academic route and studying law along the way .
He is eager to please his parents .
While he was growing up , they drove him to countless practices , spent hundreds of hours in chilly arenas cheering him on , and invested about $ 100,000 toward helping him fulfill his dream .
They still make the trek from Ajax to watch his games in Deseronto , occasionally accompanied by a caravan of relatives .
" When I was younger , what drove me was I wanted to play somewhere big one day , like the NHL , " says Fontana .
" Now , my dream is getting into a good school ... and taking it from there . "
It 's a game plan Barnhardt encourages .
He passed up three scholarships to play in the Ontario Hockey League and says his hockey career was over by his early 20s .
He had little to fall back on .

" I 'm pissed off that I missed opportunities , " says Barnhardt , an ironworker by day .
" I had nobody tell me to take ( the scholarships ) .
I just had them tell me to play harder . "
AS PLAYERS EMERGE from the dressing room , 8 - year - old Noah Brant , who has been patiently waiting , excitedly reaches up to touch their gloves and sticks as they march past .
This area is reserved for team members , but the youngster is given special access because he " idolizes " the Storm , says a team member .
" The Storm is like the NHL to him , " says his mother Becky Brant , adding he keeps a hockey stick signed by all the players on display in his bedroom .
Such adulation is n't uncommon .
The first time Fontana was asked for his autograph he was bowled over .
A young boy knocked on the door of the home where he was billeting and asked him to sign an 8x10 glossy of himself , along with other team memorabilia .
Barnhardt suspects much of the town 's fascination , which " some of the guys feed off , " stems from the fact that of all the places to play , they chose Deseronto .
Particularly fascinated are the town 's young girls , who consider the local boys slim pickings and welcome the new crop of fresh faces each season .
The town is hopping with puck bunnies , say players , referring to hockey groupies or girls who have casual sexual relations with players .
They 're easy to spot at games .
Huddled in groups , seated in the top rows and as close to the dressing room as possible , without appearing too eager .
" There 's a lot of girls who wanna be with a guy for popularity , " says Katie Anderson , 16 , whose brother is on the team and who is dating a player on another Junior A team .
And for the most part , she says , players are happy to oblige .
" They just kinda switch girls .
... A lot of the ( players ) lie , they say , ` I really like you ' and then they 'll dump you after they get what they want . "
Most Storm players avoid the topic but Barnhardt jumps in .
" They come up to us after the games , and like a player holding onto a dream , they 're holding onto a dream , " says the coach , adding girls are crushed when guys they have had one - night stands with do not want a relationship .
" Maybe they see these guys as a meal ticket . "
So -called " puck bunnies " and casual sex are simply part of hockey culture , he says .
Back when he was a player , he remembers being at parties playing cards with the guys , while a threesome was taking place , in full view , just metres away .
Barnhardt tries to keep this to a minimum while they 're on the road and in other towns .
He wants his players rested and focused for the big game .
Last year , when the Storm travelled up north for the playoffs , Barnhardt set a " No Girls " policy .
But shortly after their bus rolled into the hotel parking lot , the girls came knocking .
Barnhardt left his hotel room door open , giving him a clear view of the hallway , and watched the gaggle of girls move from door to door , requesting players let them in .
No doors were opened , so they took their solicitations outside and stood beneath the players ' windows .
" It was - 30 C and they were taking their shirts off , " recalls Barnhardt .
MacLean , who saw his share of " puck bunnies " while on the road with the Hawks , points out , " These kids are n't altar boys , they 're normal teenage boys , with normal teenage boys urges . "
" When you 're a teenage guy , with one thing on your mind , and you 've got girls hanging off you , it 's like the all - you - can - eat buffet is open . "
THE BUZZER SOUNDS .
The Storm loses 5 - 3 to the Innisfil Lakers .
It 's a disappointing end to the night and nowhere is that more evident than on the faces of the players as they trudge toward the dressing room .
Fans trickle out of the arena , but some girls linger by the entrance .
Half an hour later , the players appear .
They are showered and ready to hit a few of the postgame house parties .
After some awkward hellos , accompanied by giggles and blushes , the girls and boys step out into the empty streets of Deseronto .
One of the Luftwaffe 's elite units
The Jupiter - sized planet , called HD 189733 b , is too hot for life .
But new Hubble observations are a proof - of - concept demonstration that the basic chemistry for life can be measured on planets orbiting other stars .
Organic compounds can also be a by - product of life processes and their detection on an Earth - like planet may someday provide the first evidence of life beyond Earth .
Previous observations of HD 189733 b by Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope found water vapour .
Earlier this year Hubble found methane in the planet 's atmosphere .
" This is exciting because Hubble is allowing us to see molecules that probe the conditions , chemistry , and composition of atmospheres on other planets , " says first author Mark Swain of The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , USA .
" Thanks to Hubble we 're entering an era where we are rapidly going to expand the number of molecules we know about on other planets . "
The international team of astronomers used Hubble 's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) to study infrared light emitted from the planet , which lies 63 light - years away .
Gases in the planet 's atmosphere absorb certain wavelengths of light from the planet 's hot glowing interior .
The team identified not only carbon dioxide , but also carbon monoxide .
The molecules leave their own unique spectral fingerprint on the radiation from the planet that reaches Earth .
This is the first time a near - infrared emission spectrum has been obtained for an extrasolar planet .
" The carbon dioxide is kind of the main focus of the excitement , because that is a molecule that under the right circumstances could have a connection to biological activity as it does on Earth , " Swain says .
" The very fact that we 're able to detect it , and estimate its abundance , is significant for the long - term effort of characterizing planets both to find out what they 're made of and to find out if they could be a possible host for life . "
This type of observation is best done for planets with orbits tilted edge - on to Earth .
They routinely pass in front of and then behind their parent stars , phenomena known as eclipses .
The planet HD 189733 b passes behind its companion star once every 2.2 days .
This allows an opportunity to subtract the light of the star alone ( when the planet is blocked ) from that of the star and planet together prior to eclipse ) , thus isolating the emission of the planet alone and making possible a chemical analysis of its " day - side " atmosphere .
In this way , Swain explains that he 's using the eclipse of the planet behind the star to probe the planet 's day side , which contains the hottest portions of its atmosphere .
" We 're starting to find the molecules and to figure out how many of them there are to see the changes between the day side and the night side , " " Swain says .
This successful demonstration of looking at near - infrared light emitted from a planet is very encouraging for astronomers planning to use the NASA / ESA / CSA James Webb Space Telescope when it is launched in 2013 .
These biomarkers are best seen at near - infrared wavelengths .
Astronomers look forward to using JWST to spectroscopically look for biomarkers on a terrestrial planet the size of Earth , or a " super - Earth " several times our planet 's mass .
Swain and colleagues next plans to search for molecules in the atmospheres of other extrasolar planets , as well as trying to increase the number of molecules detected in extrasolar planet atmospheres .
He also plans to use molecules to study changes that may be present in extrasolar planet atmospheres to learn something about the weather on these distant worlds .
Co-author Giovanna Tinetti from University College London adds : " In the terrestrial planets of our solar system , carbon dioxide plays a crucial role for the stability of climate .
On Earth , carbon dioxide is one of the ingredients of the photosynthesis and a key element for the carbon cycle .
Our observations represent a great opportunity to understand the role of carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter type planets " .

WHEN the Netherlands legalised brothels eight years ago , the mood was upbeat .
Politicians thought they were well on the way to solving one of the world 's perpetual policy dilemmas : how to stop all the bad things that are associated with the sex trade ( coercion , violence , infectious diseases ) while putting a proper , and realistic , limit to the role of the state .
The Dutch were hoping that links between prostitution and multiple forms of crime , from money laundering to smuggling , could finally be severed .
Ultimately , they believed , the buying and selling of sexual services would become a freely undertaken transaction , in which the state would only be involved as a regulator and tax - collector .
The police could then concentrate on criminals , instead of harassing people engaged in exchanges that were nobody 's business but their own .
While the Dutch experiment was beginning , another European country was trying out a different approach .
From 1999 onwards , Sweden began penalising people who patronise prostitutes ( through fines , jail terms of up to six months , and “ naming and shaming ” ) , while treating people who sell their bodies as victims .
All over the world — especially in rich democracies — policymakers have been watching the two places to see which philosophy works best .
In reality , neither is a silver bullet ; neither country has found a perfect way of shielding prostitutes from exploitation and violence , while avoiding a nanny - state .
So the arguments rage on , from liberal New Zealand to San Francisco , where people will vote on November 4th on virtually decriminalising the sex trade .
In Amsterdam — where the spectacle of half - naked women pouting behind shopfront windows is a city trademark — the link between prostitution and organised crime has proved durable .
Efforts to break it have been a “ complete failure ” , says Lodewijk Asscher , a deputy mayor who has led the city hall 's effort to buy up and transform much of the red - light district .
Fresh arguments in favour of his campaign emerged from a report published in July by Dutch police and prosecutors .
It drew heavily on the case of three Turkish - German vice barons who were sentenced recently to long prison terms for running a ring of 120 prostitutes in three Dutch cities .
Their operation included many of the ghastly practices that the liberal law was supposed to stamp out .
Saddled with fictitious debts , the women under the barons ' control were made to take 20 clients a day , subjected to forcible breast enlargements and tattooed with the names of their “ owners ” .
Such exploitation is not exceptional : the policemen who patrol Amsterdam 's red - light district reckon that more than half the ladies posing in windows are there against their will .
All that helps to explain why the Swedish experience is finding imitators in several countries — including England and Wales where people will soon be liable to prosecution for “ paying for sex with someone forced into prostitution … or controlled for another 's gain ” .
It is also becoming easier for English and Welsh police to prosecute people ( either pedestrians or motorists ) who solicit sex on the street .
In Scotland , kerb - crawling was banned a year ago .
The British moves were made after studying the Dutch and Swedish experience .
But what is really happening in Sweden ?
The policy of penalising clients or “ johns ” enjoys widespread consent .
It was introduced by a centre - left administration , despite opposition from the centre - right .
Now it is accepted by all Sweden 's main parties .
The authorities say the number of streetwalking prostitutes fell by about 40 % during the first four years of the new regime .
Swedish politicians say they have made their country a bad destination for traffickers .
But a sceptic might retort that by driving prostitution away from Sweden , the authorities have simply exported it , sending sex - hungry Swedes to nearby countries or else to Thailand .
It 's dark underground
Moreover , a sex- workers ' association in Sweden says the law makes life dangerous for those who ply their trade secretly .
A life of dodging between apartments and exchanging furtive texts can leave women more reliant on pimps .
Another argument is that fear of prosecution reduces the chances that clients will report the exploitation of under - age girls or boys .
Some drawbacks of doing things the Swedish way have been noted in more established quarters .
A report by Norway 's justice ministry , in 2004 , cited evidence of an “ increased fear of attack ” among Swedish prostitutes , who found it harder to assess their clients because transactions had to be agreed hastily or on the telephone .
But for Norway , it seems , these considerations have been trumped by others , including a sense that prostitution is getting out of control after an influx from Africa , South America and eastern Europe .
The Norwegian parliament is on the verge of mandating Swedish - style penalties for buying sex .
In a similar spirit , Italy 's cabinet has agreed to outlaw prostitution in public and make penalties harsher .
In Europe , then , things are moving towards tighter regulation — in part because many of the continent 's richer countries feel inundated by a wave of newcomers to the trade , some of whom are trafficked .
But there are other places where more liberal voices seem to be gaining the upper hand .
In the United States , trading in sex is a misdemeanour , at least , almost everywhere , with the exceptions of Rhode Island ( where it can take place only indoors , but not in brothels ) ; and , most famously and brashly , in parts of Nevada .
So if residents of San Francisco vote for “ Proposition K ” — which would bar police from taking action against sex workers — it will be a landmark in American history .
AP
Supporters of the change ( including sex- workers ' unions ) say it will transform the role of the police .
Instead of pointlessly arresting prostitutes , the police can help them stay healthy and protect them from violence .
Advocates of a “ no ” vote say that if the hands of the police are tied , they will be unable to deal even with obvious cases of abuse .
Some say the Dutch experience has made nonsense of the case for liberalisation .
Others say Proposition K could lead to a worse situation than the Netherlands ' : a free - for - all without the Dutch level of regulation and social security .
But for liberals in search of success stories , New Zealand appears to provide more promising evidence .
In 2003 , that country decriminalised the sex trade with a boldness that exceeded that of the Dutch .
Sex workers were allowed to ply their trade more or less freely , either at home , in brothels or on the street .
A study published by the government in May , measuring the impact of the new law , was encouraging .
More than 60 % of prostitutes felt they had more power to refuse clients than they did before .
The report reckoned that only about 1 % of women in the business were under the legal age of 18 .
And only 4 % said they had been pressured into working by someone else .
The report also acknowledges one distinct advantage enjoyed by New Zealand .
Although some illegal immigrants are engaged in the sex trade , the country 's isolation and robust legal system make it relatively free from the problem of trafficking , at least by European standards .
But there is also a big difference between the policy of New Zealand and that of other places where prostitution is legal .
In the Netherlands and Nevada , the business is confined to brothels , which are usually run by businessmen rather than the sex workers themselves .
Clearly , the brothel - masters ' status as the sole legal providers of commercial sex enhances their grip on the women who work for them .
In New Zealand , prostitutes can fend for themselves .
As well as letting them keep all their earnings , this independence gives them freedom to reject nasty clients and unsafe practices .
“ They feel better protected by the law and much more able to stand up to clients and pushy brothel operators , ” says Catherine Healy , head of the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective .
Unsurprisingly , the New Zealand system 's critics include brothel owners , both in that country and elsewhere .
Going with a girl outside a licensed establishment is like “ Russian roulette ” , says the website of the Chicken Ranch , a brothel that serves the Las Vegas crowd .
In New Zealand , one brothel keeper fumes that the earnings of independent sex workers are “ tax - free money , which is not benefiting the Inland Revenue Department ” .
What about other interested parties — such as respectable Kiwis who resent kerb - crawlers ?
According to polls , people are sure the number of prostitutes has risen — although the government says this is not true .
Auckland city council is trying to allay public concerns by restricting brothels to commercial and industrial areas .
Something similar happens in Nevada , where only the smaller counties may host brothels , and they are kept away from town centres .
( Such curbs have some bad effects ; prostitutes say they are stranded in the desert , totally reliant on brothel owners . )
In any case , one unusual investigation concluded that from the prostitutes ' point of view , the New Zealand system was the fairest .
A pair of British grandmothers from the Women 's Institute — a homely club that is more often associated with cooking tips — made a tour of brothels in the Netherlands , America and the Antipodes : their aim was to find which system was best for the women who worked in the business .
Their top marks went to a discreet house in a suburb of Wellington — classed in New Zealand as a “ small owner - operated brothel ” — where two women offered their services from Mondays to Fridays .
“ Just like a regular job , ” one of the grannies noted .

A Scrabble Quiz by Sandy Wood & Kara Kovalchi
We finally learned who Bush booked in the Blair House instead of letting the Obamas stay there .
And — surprise !—it 's a major - league asshole .
The one accomplishment listed in President Bush 's fantasy novel about his " successful presidency " ( he battled dragons ! ) that we can actually all be proud of is " Directed unprecedented preparations for a smooth presidential transition . "
But of course he had to screw that up in some small way , because that 's how he operates , and so he did n't allow the president - elect to stay in the traditional pre-inaguration home of the president - elect , Blair House .
The Obamas needed to move in this week to get their kids in school , but Bush 's people said Blair House was already booked .
Sorry , Obamas !
Well now we know who 's staying there : hated former Australian Prime Minister Yahoo Serious John Howard .
John Howard , Bush ally , is such an asshole , that when the new Prime Minister finally issued an official federal government apology to the indigenous people of Australia , the only living former Prime Minister who declined to attend the ceremony was , you guessed it , John Howard .
That is pretty assholish even for an Australian .
Also he lied Australia into Bush 's stupid Iraq War .
He is at the Blair House because Bush is giving him the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
Fellow hated war liar Tony Blair is getting one too .
Bill O'Reilly came briefly unhinged last night , but managed to keep himself from having one of his infamous all - out temper tantrums .
I thought for sure he was about to start shouting , " Do it live !
F--k it !
Do it live ! "
Or something like that .
His victim was Fox liberal Bob Beckel , who 'd actually spent most of the segment bending over backward to agree with O'Reilly .
But really , it was going to be anyone who appeared in the " liberal " slot last night .
O'Reilly signaled early in the program that he was on the warpath against the filthy , disgusting , wretched vermin of the far left for their ongoing campaign to bring Bush / Cheney & Co. to justice for their war crimes .
The flecks of foam were already visible around the corners of his mouth as he ranted :
Yeah , mistakes were made at Guantanamo Bay and other places while suspected terrorists were being interrogated .
Every one of those mistakes should be examined .
But those things happen in every war , by every nation .
Again , the far - left press is treating America like a pinata , whacking it at every opportunity because they do n't like Bush and Cheney .
Now there 's an insane call for fishing expeditions to find something !
that will lead to prosecuting the president and vice president .
Again , this is poison !
A destructive act toward America .
Bush and Cheney protected America after 9/11 and they did it fast , so mistakes were inevitable .
But they stopped the killing on American soil , did they not ?
To his credit , President - elect Obama wants no part of the radical - left jihad to tear the country down .
He says he 's looking forward .
And that is a smart thing to do .
But Talking Points despises -- despises -- those who , in the name of ideology , want to weaken the country , putting us all in danger .
As loyal Americans , we owe the benefit of the doubt to leaders in a time of war , and both Bush and Cheney say flat out they did their duty .
[ Clips of Bush and Cheney . ]
It 's also unAmerican .
Finally , all Americans want the economy fixed and their families kept safe from terror killers .
That should be Obama 's primary focus .
Those who continue to run this country down , and divert attention from those things should be condemned by the rest of us .
Condemned .
Now we 're going to name names , coming up in the future , ladies and gentlemen .
It 's going to stop .
But it was at the end of the following segment , when he had on Beckel and Col.
David Hunt , that he decided to unleash some of the ol ' O'Reilly Rage on Beckel :
Bob Beckel :
My last word is that we still have the fact that the general counsel to the Army under Ronald Reagan has made the determination that there was torture .
And somehow or another , without punishing people who had , under difficult circumstances , had to do things .
We need to get this clarified so in the future , people know what they 're doing .
It 's legal or not legal .
O'Reilly : Bob --
It happened one time , according to that woman !
One time !
OK , Bob ?
It 's not across the board !
We 're not a terror nation !
Beckel : I did not say it was .
I did not say it was , and I do not think it was .
O'Reilly : One time !
One time !
OK , thank you gentlemen , I 'm getting a little emotional , so I need to pull back now .
Our national discourse is being led by narcissistic psychos .
But then , we already knew that .
It obviously has never managed to make through the thicket of O'Reilly 's coif , let alone his pea brain , that we 're talking not just about whether or not a given act is torture but whether or not they broke the law .
Last I heard , O'Reilly was big on the Rule of Law and Law and Order and that sort of thing .
I guess he applies it selectively .
Prosecuting flagrant lawbreakers who violate their oath of high office is n't just about getting revenge .
It is n't just looking backward .
It 's also about preventing future such acts by making clear that those who break the law will face the consequences .
It 's very much a forward - looking enterprise too .
But that notion would obviously make O'Reilly 's head explode .
Barack Obama was elected on a message of change .
Now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
Here the BBC 's team in Washington track developments .
THURSDAY 29 JANUARY - DAY 10
1212 EST Lilly 's law
James Coomarasamy : After his bruising primary fight with Hillary Clinton raised awkward questions of sexism , Barack Obama seemed particularly happy that the first bill he signed into law as President ( the previous measures he 's signed , such as the decision to close Guantanamo Bay , have been in the form of executive orders and presidential memoranda ) was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act .
It 's named after a feisty grandmother from Alabama , who was told by the Supreme Court in 2007 that she 'd waited too long to sue the Goodyear plant , where she 'd worked for nearly 20 years , for wage discrimination .
She went on to become part of the Obama campaign ; recording a campaign advert for the presidential candidate and speaking at the Democratic National Convention .
Lilly Ledbetter was present at the high - spirited White House signing ceremony - as was another woman , who spoke on the same day of the convention as her ; the new Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton .
WEDNESDAY 28 JANUARY - DAY NINE
2030 EST Stimulus vote
1730 EST Smart assessment
Adam Brookes : A very large team of " smart people " is at work at National Defense University in Washington on a document that could tell us a lot about the future of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The question is - will we get to read any of it ?
It 's called the " Centcom Assessment " and was commissioned by the new commander of US Central Command ( Centcom ) - the command that has responsibility for the Middle East , Central Asia , Pakistan and Afghanistan - General David Petraeus .
Some 150 people - from the military , State Department , Treasury and other agencies - have been working on the assessment , which examines all aspects of Centcom operations .
Look for it to be published in mid or late February .
We wait to see how much of it - if any - is unclassified .
1400 EST O Canada
Max Deveson : News just in - President Obama 's first foreign visit will , as expected , be to Canada , on 19 February .
America 's northern neighbour has traditionally been the first port of call for incoming presidents , although Mr Obama 's predecessor , George W Bush , bucked the trend by going to Mexico on his first trip abroad .
" Canada is a vitally important ally , " said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs as he announced the trip .
Mr Obama could use the visit to put pressure on Canada - a Nato ally - to send more troops to Afghanistan .
During the presidential election campaign , an aide to Mr Harper sparked a mini-controversy when he said that Mr Obama 's economic adviser had told him that the then - candidate 's anti-free trade rhetoric on the stump should be taken with a pinch of salt .
1215 EST Predicting switchers
Max Deveson : Indefatigable polling analyst Nate Silver , who had such success predicting results during the presidential election campaign , has turned his attention to a smaller electorate - the US Senate .
He has started analysing senate votes in an attempt to predict which Republican senators are likely to vote for legislation favoured by President Obama .
His conclusion ?
Based on the seven meaningful senate votes so far , Republican moderates like Olympia Snowe and George Voinovitch are continuing to cast their lot in with the Democrats .
The surprise is Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , who - in a break with his previously conservative habits - has voted with the Democrats in six of the seven significant votes so far .
As Silver points out , one reason for this change of heart could be pragmatic - Mr Gregg is up for election in 2010 , in a state that voted for Mr Obama by a 10 point margin in November .
1150 EST Stimulating website ?
Rajini Vaidyanathan : Living up to the title of President 2.0 , despite earlier teething problems with the White House email server , President Obama has announced he is launching another website .
Recovery.gov will track the $ 825 bn stimulus package which is currently going through congress .
One of the criticisms of the package is that it will simply throw money at the problem .
The President says this website will promote accountability and transparency by allowing people to see how that money is being spent .
Another clever idea from the Obama administration to show they are an open and honest government , or just a gimmick ?
TUESDAY 27 JANUARY - DAY EIGHT
2046 EST Reaching out
Jonathan Beale : President Barack Obama has promised a new kind of politics .
In his inauguration speech , quoting the bible , he talked of putting away " childish things " .
So - true to his word - his grown up politics includes talking to Republicans .
He did n't ask them to pop over to the White House .
Instead he travelled to them on Capitol Hill .
It really looks likes he 's reaching out .
He 's trying to win round Republicans to supporting his $ 825 bn stimulus package .
By all accounts the meeting was polite and cordial .
President Obama described the talks as " constructive " .
But the charm offensive does not seem to have worked .
House Republicans remain deeply sceptical .
The Obama approach is very different from that of President Bush who would bang his fist on the table and demand that his political foe fall into line .
Barack Obama is far more conciliatory .
But is it really worth the hassle ?
Most Republicans still believe that big spending only leads to bigger government .
They 'd prefer tax cuts .
Leopards do n't change their spots .
One wonders how long the new approach will last .
1540 EST Gates 's testimony
Adam Brookes : I listened to Robert Gates 's intriguing testimony in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
1250 EST " Exhalation "
Kim Ghattas : Hillary Clinton spoke to the State Department press corps in " the bullpen " - a grim press area with cubicles for the correspondents who cover the beat .
" Your digs are better than those at the White House , " she exclaimed .
There was excitement as a group of about 20 of us lined up to introduce ourselves .
It 's quite rare for a Secretary of State to make such a visit .
She wore a dark blue pantsuit , with a silver necklace and topaz earrings and spent a good 15 minutes answering all our questions .
She spoke about everything from Iran to China , Pakistan to Afghanistan , and the need for dialogue on all of these issues .
But what stood out most was her saying that " there was an exhalation of breath going on around the world as people express their appreciation for the new direction being set by the new president " .
She added there was a lot of damage to repair , a not - so subtle jab at the last administration .
Mrs Clinton insisted , however , that this was not a repudiation or an indictment of the last eight years - just excitement about what was ahead .
1220 EST Afghanistan is now the priority
Adam Brookes :
It 's official .
Robert Gates , Secretary of Defense , tells the Senate Armed Services Committee : " President Obama has made it clear that the Afghanistan theatre should be our top overseas military priority . "
And Mr Gates , while not making a firm commitment to sending more troops to Afghanistan , makes it pretty clear that 's what 's going to happen .
He said two more brigade combat teams will be available for deployment in April , and more will become available during the summer .
But , with the candour he 's well - known for , he says civilian casualties caused by US air strikes are " doing us enormous harm " .
" If Afghans come to see us as part of their problem , not as part of their solution , then we are lost , " he says .
And a crucial moment : when asked if missile strikes against targets inside Pakistan will continue , he replies : " The President has made it clear that we will go after al Qaeda wherever al Qaeda is . "
Has the government of Pakistan been told this ?
" Yes , " he replies .
The message seems to be that there will be no halt to strikes inside Pakistan by unmanned drones against suspected terrorist targets , no matter what Islamabad says .
1115 EST Teething trouble
Rajini Vaidyanathan :
For a politician who has been dubbed the ' internet President ' , it has not been the smoothest of starts .
The White House email server is now back up , having been down for several hours on Monday .
" Our email system is not working so well , " said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs .
" We 'll endeavor to get you information from earlier in the day , hopefully in a little bit more of a timely manner , if we can get the email to work . "
The White House was forced to hand briefing and news releases out on paper , rather than send them via email .
It seems the transition from cyber - friendly campaign to wired White House has not gone too smoothly .
Some aides have complained that the technology in their new White House offices is not as high - tech as they are accustomed to .
White House spokesman Bill Burton told the Washington Post that the transition to new equipment was " kind of like going from an Xbox to an Atari " .
UPDATE : While we 're on the subject of politicians and their technological ways ...
If you were wondering what life is like for Senator John McCain post- election , he has set up his own personal twitter feed , following on from the one he set up during his campaign .
0117 EST Prospect of a thaw ?
Mr Obama repeated his intention to go to a Muslim capital to make a speech to the Muslim world .
He also elaborated on the State Department 's line that Middle East envoy George Mitchell would be in listening mode on his first trip to the region : " What I 've told him is start by listening .
Because all too often the United States starts by dictating , in the past on some of these issues , and we do n't always know all the factors that are involved . "
MONDAY 26 JANUARY - DAY SEVEN
1750 EST Listening , not talking , in the Middle East
Kim Ghattas : President Obama has empowered US Middle East envoy George Mitchell to speak on his and Hillary Clinton 's behalf during his nine - day long trip to the Middle East and Europe .
Mitchell probably wo n't do that much talking on the trip , however - the State Department said Senator Mitchell will be in " listening mode " .
Before Washington does anything substantive on the Middle East , it wants to know who its Israeli partner is going to be .
Israel 's general elections are due on 10 February and , depending on the results , the approach to peace - making could be very different .
The new administration 's main goal at the moment is to show that it is engaged and to buy itself some time while it decides how to proceed .
This thorough analysis asserts that Obama 's options are limited - he could try to build on two decades of diplomacy or simply accept that there is nothing to build on and " manage " the conflict .
Along the same lines , this opinion piece spells out what a lot of Middle East experts are thinking : time is really running out .
UPDATE : For very interesting reading and perhaps some inspiration about where to look for a different approach to peace - making in the Middle East , two pieces - one from Scott Atran and Jeremy Ginges , the other from Ethan Bronner - look at the impact of words in war .
1730 EST Obama 's car ruling
James Coomarasamy : I 've been looking into President Obama 's ruling on fuel emissions standards .
1225 EST Intriguing signs
Kevin Connolly : From the housing market , that reliable source of bad news in recent times , comes an intriguing sign of life .
The average price of existing homes fell again , month on month and year on year , but the number of sales rose by 6.5 % between November and December .
It is an indication that there are buyers out there with the cash to snap up foreclosed homes when they judge the price is right .
Not an end to recession of course , but the kind of thing you need to start hearing before a recession can end .
1130 EST Green day
Max Deveson :
After signing a series of dramatic executive orders last week on government ethics , the treatment of terror suspects , and the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , President Obama 's latest decision concerns car emissions .
Mr Obama has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to review its earlier decision to block California - and a number of other US states - from setting their own vehicle fuel and emissions standards .
California had wanted to tighten the standards in an attempt to tackle climate change - but Mr Obama 's predecessor had been keen to retain a single national standard for cars made in the US .
Critics said the Bush administration was dragging its heels on climate change because it was linked too closely to the oil and car - making industries .
Environmentalists have already hailed Mr Obama 's new ruling - an analysis of the decision from the BBC's James Coomarasamy will be available on this site later .
SUNDAY 25 JANUARY - DAY SIX
2200 EST Normal service resumed
Sarah Morris : Politics as usual has returned to Washington .
After the goodwill of the inauguration period , when even diehard Republicans could be heard gushing over the new spirit of bipartisanship , the first hints of opposition were seen on the Sunday morning talk shows .
First there was Republican House leader John Boehner on NBC , threatening to vote against the president 's economic stimulus package if the spending promises were n't reduced .
Then Senator John McCain told Fox TV the package would n't get his support without major rewrites .
Democrats in both houses could push through this measure by themselves , but Mr Obama knows this will be the first test of his much - vaunted abilities to reach across the floor and bring unity in a crisis .
He wants this massive $ 825 bn re-floatation of the US economy to appear to Americans as more than a one - party measure .
A more cynical view comes from political commentator Stuart Rothenberg , who said : " The president wants at the end of the day to say this is not the White House 's package , not the Democrats ' package - it 's a bipartisan package .
That frankly spreads some of the blame around if stuff does n't work . "
SATURDAY 24 JANUARY - DAY FIVE
1256 EST Economic recovery pledge
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He focused solely on the economy - there was no mention of foreign policy - and he painted a bleak picture , reminding people that unemployment is at a 26 - year high , and could soon reach double digits .
He talked again about his plan for a huge public works programme , which he believes will kick - start the economy .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan , as it is known , is intended to create three - to - four million jobs , renovate 10,000 schools , rebuild thousands of roads and improve 3,000 miles of electricity lines .
Some Republicans say the plan does not get to the root of the problem , and that the $ 825 bn price tag is too high .
Mr Obama says he hopes to sign it into law within a month .
The pressure is on him in more ways than one .
The economy is Americans ' single biggest concern , and his handling of it will be what many will judge his presidency on .
FRIDAY 23 JANUARY - DAY FOUR
1705 EST Under review
Kim Ghattas :
The daily press briefing today at the State Department did not really produce any news .
Answers to reporters ' questions were mostly along the lines of : " We are reviewing the policy , we have not fully enunciated our policy yet , give us some time ... "
The briefing made it sound like every single policy - from Africa to Iran , North Korea to Afghanistan - was under review .
Every policy except one : talking to Hamas .
The spokesman said very clearly that some principles of American policy remain the same .
So we 'll see how much has really changed at the end of all the reviews .
1640 EST Obama lifts abortion funding ban
Max Deveson :
In a much - trailed , but significant move , President Obama has signed an executive order overturning the so - called " Mexico City Rule " - the ban on federal funding for NGOs that perform abortions or offer abortion counselling .
The order - which comes the day after the 36th anniversary of the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision which legalised abortion in America - is likely to be seized on by anti-abortion activists as evidence that President Obama intends to push a radical pro-choice agenda .
In fact , Mr Obama 's move takes America back to the status quo that existed eight years ago .
The ban was originally put in place by Ronald Reagan , but was lifted by Bill Clinton .
George W Bush reinstated it in 2001 .
Both Mr Obama and the Secretary of State who will implement the policy - Hillary Clinton - pledged during the election campaign that they would repeal the ban .
1605 EST Aggressive push or smokescreen ?
Kim Ghattas :
Is Obama making an aggressive push for peace or is he trying to buy some time ?
The appointment of two special envoys on his second full day in office can probably be read both ways .
It shows him delivering on two campaign promises - tackling the Middle East from Day One and shifting focus to Afghanistan .
Sceptics , however , will say there has been no dramatic shift away from the Bush policies in anything the president has said about the Middle East so far .
Like Bush , President Obama has talked about the need for a durable and sustainable cease - fire .
He has stressed America 's support for Israel and Egypt , rejected dialogue with Hamas , and backed the Arab peace initiative of 2001 .
Some of the reactions in the Arab world have been stingingly critical .
And while it was not a reaction to Obama 's statement , an opinion piece by Saudi royal Turki el Faisal makes clear how badly bold action by the US is needed .
Still , the appointment of someone high - profile like George Mitchell to focus on the Middle East does seem to signal a willingness to get down to business .
Mitchell 's 2001 report on the causes of the second Palestinian Intifada and his recommendations to move forward were widely praised .
1114 EST Waste ( bin ) of money ?
Kevin Connolly : Unemployment in the United States has risen again .
It went up by one when John Thain the CEO of Merrill Lynch departed shortly after the loss - making financial group was absorbed by Bank Of America .
It has emerged in the last few days that Mr Thain spent more than a million dollars re-decorating his office - and paid the interior designer Michael Smith $ 800,000 to get it looking just the way he wanted .
That 's apparently eight times what Mr Smith is being paid to makeover the White House for the Obamas .
My favourite item on Mr Thain 's shopping list - which has a flavour of decadence you 'd associated with early Elvis or one of the later Roman Emperors - is a waste bin that cost $ 1,400 ( £ 1,000 ) .
Look out for a more austere , chastened version of capitalism in the coming months ( and maybe years ) of recession .
1101 EST Healthcare a priority ?
James Coomarasamy :
It was one of the great unanswered questions of the presidential campaign and it continues to hang in the air : what effect will the dire economic situation have on Barack Obama 's domestic policy pledges ?
Even without the crisis , reforming the US health care system - the size of which has been compared to the economy of France - would not have been an easy task .
Just ask the new Secretary of State .
But some - like the New York Times ' Nobel Prize - winning economic columnist , Paul Krugman - are now worried that universal healthcare will be put on the back burner .
He 's disappointed that , in his Inaugural Address , President Obama only referred to technology reducing healthcare costs , but did n't mention the problems faced by the estimated 46 million Americans without health insurance .
THURSDAY 22 JANUARY - DAY THREE
1715 EST Economic balancing act
Kevin Connolly :
As the 100 days begin to tick by , we are getting a few clues as to where the administration 's priorities will lie .
Even as he makes hugely significant announcements about foreign policy - on torture , on Guantanamo and on the appointment of special envoys - Mr Obama reveals that he will be adding an economic daily briefing to the standard morning session he gets on intelligence and national security .
The announcement goes to the heart of the balancing act that all recession - related news requires .
You have to re-assure the American people you 're on top of things without creating the impression that things are deteriorating so fast you need an update every 24 hours just to keep track of the crisis .
1308 EST Obama 's spy -proof phone
Rajini Vaidyanathan :
He has admitted he 's addicted to it , now it looks like Barack Obama 's craving for his Blackberry will continue to be satisfied .
Reports suggest President Obama will be given a special spy - proof smartphone .
The speculation is that the president will be given an extra-secure phone which will enable him to make personal phone calls and send personal e-mails .
The National Security Agency would not comment on this , and there is still no word from the White House .
In a recent interview Mr Obama said : " I think we 're going to be able to hang onto one of these .
I want to be able to have voices , other than the people who are immediately working for me , be able to reach out and send me a message about what 's happening in America . "
The biggest concern is how secure any device would be .
It seems the new phone is likely to be a Sectera Edge , which according to its website " is certified to protect wireless voice communications classified Top Secret and below as well as access e-mail and websites classified Secret and below . "
UPDATE : So , now we know ...
At a media briefing today , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters that the president will get to keep his Blackberry " through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends " .
He will become the first US president to have personal email in the White House .
1130 EST Bad numbers
Kevin Connolly : Obama may have a gift with words , but in his first week in office the numbers remain bad .
Housing starts for December - the number of new homes on which builders started work - fell by 15 % , making 2008 the worst year for the construction industry since the government began keeping these kinds of records .
And this is in spite of record low interest rates .
Housing starts matter because they 're an indicator of confidence , and because lots of other spending ( think everything from plumbers to interior designers ) depend on them .
It takes seven months to build a house and more than a year to build an apartment block , so even if builders got going now ( and they 're not ) it will be a long time before the housing market really gets moving .
So whatever politicians see , real recovery is a long way off .
0907 EST Foggy Bottom abuzz
Kim Ghattas : Hundreds of excited State Department staff have filled up the lobby of the austere building in Foggy Bottom waiting for their new boss to arrive .
There 's a real buzz of energy .
I 've never seen so many people making their way into the building in the morning .
I 'm sure no - one showed up late for work today .
All the big American TV stars who usually cover the State Department are back this morning .
We had n't seen them in a while .
Obama has tasked Clinton with stepping up US diplomacy - it 's clearly off to a good start .
WEDNESDAY 21 JANUARY - DAY TWO
1852 EST
All change at State
Kim Ghattas : The State Department was somewhat in limbo on the first day of the Obama administration with no - one at the helm .
But hundreds of career foreign service officers had already swapped their Bush administration " hat " for an Obama one .
Reporters who cover State take great pleasure in asking a question on a controversial topic on the last day of an administration and then putting it again to the same press officer after a new president is sworn in , to see whether he can answer with a straight face .
The media were briefed today by spokesman Robert Wood .
When asked about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which the Bush administration opposed , he made a quick turnaround to reflect Mr Obama 's position : " We will see what we can do to push it forward . "
Meanwhile , Mr Obama telephoned Prime Minister Olmert of Israel , President Mubarak of Egypt , King Abdallah of Jordan and President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority - a clear signal he really meant it when he said he would tackle the Middle East conflict from Day One .
Even the Palestinians were surprised to be getting a phone call this quickly .
1840 EST The Note
Rajini Vaidyanathan : So , we know President Obama spent 10 minutes on his own in his new place of work - the Oval Office .
There , left for him in the top drawer was a note .
Not just any note but a one written to him by his predecessor , George W Bush .
President Obama 's spokesman Robert Gibbs said he did n't ask him what the message written to the new President was : " I knew he was n't going to tell me anyway . "
President Bush 's outgoing White House spokesperson Dana Perino told reporters that the theme of the message , which was written by President Bush on Monday , was " similar to what he 's said since election night about the fabulous new chapter President - elect Obama is about to start , and that he wishes him the very best . "
The exact contents of the note remain private , but there will be much speculation as to what it might have said .
Note - passing in this way has been a tradition for a number of years .
When President Reagan left office he scribbled a message to his successor President George Bush Snr .
The message was light - hearted , with Mr Reagan joking , " Do n't let the Turkeys get you down " .
1800 EST Hillary Confirmed
Kim Ghattas :
She had to wait a day , but Hillary Rodham Clinton is now confirmed as American 's top diplomat .
The State department website was instantly updated .
No new policies have been outlined just yet ; staff are probably still poring over files about everything from North Korea to Iran , climate change and Russia , trying to update them to reflect the change in administration .
The delay in her confirmation was caused by objections raised by a Republican senator concerned about ' Billary ' .
In the end , 94 senators decided that Bill Clinton 's foundation and his foreign donors were not an obstacle .
Only two of her former colleagues voted against .
On Thursday , Mrs Clinton will be greeted - as is traditional for incoming and outgoing Secretaries of State - by cheering staff in the lobby of the austere building in Foggy Bottom .
Condoleezza Rice was cheered on her way out on Friday .
When she enters her new offices , Clinton will find a welcome note left for her by her predecessor .
She 's going to be hitting the ground running and it's likely to be a long marathon .
I 'd better get in shape myself or I wo n't be able to keep up !
1612 EST Movement on Afghanistan
Adam Brookes : Afghanistan will be President Obama 's war .
We understand a National Intelligence Estimate on Afghanistan has been circulating in Washington for some time , the contents of which remain closely held .
Will the Obama administration declassify portions of it ?
I 'm told , too , that a review of the Afghan situation is underway at National Defense University in Washington , and that a group of military personnel from US Central Command are involved in it .
I 'll be looking for more detail on this .
The Armed Forces Journal has this interesting , if bleak assessment of the situation there .
Mr Obama is meeting General Petraeus and Secretary Gates today , Wednesday .
Mr Obama seems to be signalling to the world that the " war on terror " policy is to be at least re-worked , and perhaps even replaced .
The signal comes in his move to suspend the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay .
Early statements on Iraq will get much scrutiny .
We are all aware of Mr Obama 's pledge to withdraw combat troops from Iraq .
But I 'll be trying to read the fine print .
What forces will remain in Iraq to conduct training of the Iraqi security forces , counterterrorism operations , and other ' support ' functions ?
How many ?
For how long ?
1540 EST New President , new media
Rajini Vaidyanathan : The Obama family have moved into the White House , not just in the real world but in the virtual world too .
The newly revamped White House website has many of the features that existed on the old site .
In the first blog posting on the site , Macon Phillips , the incoming Director of New Media , encourages people to sign up to White House email updates .
It also repeats a campaign pledge made by Barack Obama - to publish all non-emergency legislation online for five days , and allow people to comment on it before the president signs it .
During his campaign , Mr Obama gathered a database of 3 million email addresses , which proved to be a vital resource for fundraising and mobilising the grassroots .
Will as many people sign up to the White House distribution list ?
We 'll have to keep clicking to see just how much change President Obama will bring about using new media .
1330 EST Obama in the Oval
President Obama holds his first meeting in the Oval Office - with Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
1200 EST Geithner 's grilling
Kevin Connolly : Another tough day on Capitol Hill for Timothy Geithner , the smart technocrat who is Obama 's choice as Treasury Secretary and who 's been in the engine - room of the economy with Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke attempting to plug the many holes which have suddenly appeared below the waterline .
The right man for the job - except that as Treasury Secretary he'd be in charge of the IRS , and Mr Geithner turns out to have not paid his full income taxes in recent years .
Abjectly contrite , he says it was a mistake , although one Senator has hinted that if the man who runs the tax system can't understand it then maybe it really is time for some kind of reform .
Republican John Ensign summed up the problem .
He said Mr Geithner was an engaging man who knew his stuff - but his switchboard had lit up with calls from constituents asking how someone who'd failed to pay their taxes could be put in charge of the system .
Mr Geithner will probably get in - but he probably wo n't enjoy the process .
1130 EST
In the cathedral
Max Deveson :
The new president 's first engagement on his first full day in office was to attend a service at the National Cathedral in Washington .
The tradition goes back to America 's first president , George Washington .
According to his press secretary , before setting off for the service , Mr Obama spent 10 minutes in the Oval Office , reading the note left for him by his predecessor , George W Bush .
1045 EST
The struggle to close Guantanamo
Jonathan Beale : I 've been in Guantanamo , where I interviewed John Bellinger , a former legal adviser to Condoleezza Rice .
He told me that President Obama 's order to close down the Guantanamo prison camp may be easier said than done .
TUESDAY 20 JANUARY - DAY ONE
2330 EST First decision
Jonathan Beale :
In what appears to be his first decision since taking office , Barack Obama has made clear that he wants to put a halt to the controversial military commissions taking place at Guantanamo .
On his request , the prosecution in the US military trials has issued a motion requesting the suspension of the process for 120 days .
The purpose of the order is to give the Obama administration time to review the cases of those detainees being tried at Guantanamo .
It also provides the new administration with an opportunity to re-examine the controversial legal process which has been widely criticised because it allowed the US military to act as jailer , judge and jury .
2200 EST I shall go to the ball
Kim Ghattas : I was lucky enough to get a ticket to some of tonight 's inaugural balls .
2030 EST
On the streets
Max Deveson :
My tough assignment : to hop around the bars of Washington DC to find out how Obama supporters were celebrating the day .
1200 EST
The big day
Stanford Professor John Taylor has coined a new , unflattering term to describe the Federal Reserve ’s approach to managing the financial crisis : “ Mondustrial Policy . ” Mr. Taylor , a former Bush administration official who was once considered a possible successor to former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , has instead emerged as an outspoken critic of the Fed .

Linda Lusardi dialled 999 because she was stuck in traffic
Former glamour girl Linda Lusardi dialled 999 after getting stuck in heavy traffic on her way to a pantomime appearance , police have said .
Ms Lusardi , 50 , called emergency services to ask if she could drive on the M25's hard shoulder so she could reach the High Wycombe theatre in time .
A Hertfordshire police spokesman said : " The request was denied and she was given suitable words of advice . "
Ms Lusardi is playing the Wicked Queen in Snow White at the Swan Theatre .
The former Emmerdale actress was on her way to the matinee performance when she made the call .
The police spokesman said : " We received a phone call from a woman asking if she could have emergency permission to use the hard shoulder of the M25 as she was late for an appointment .
" Being late for work is not a reason to call 999 , contact the police or use emergency measures .
Use of the hard shoulder is restricted for emergency service vehicles only .
" In particular , we would also strongly urge people to only phone 999 in an absolute emergency , such as where there is immediate threat to life or property . "

Genocide is an appalling crime against humanity that we hope will never again be repeated .
Today , as we approach Holocaust Memorial Day , we might stop and reflect on the fact that it still has the potential to be repeated and perpetrated around the world , unless we are on our guard and understand that our actions today have consequences tomorrow .
The use of the term genocide can be problematic and contentious but it should n't disguise historical fact .
One of the first modern day genocides took place in Armenia , a part of modern day Turkey in 1915 .
This massacre of 1.5 million people , indiscriminate of age or gender , is still not acknowledged as genocide by Turkey - long after it took place .
The United States did not recognise or act on the events at the time and consequently Hitler admitted looking at the Armenians and deciding that if they can get away with it , he could also .
If people do n't recognise something , its entire existence is erased .
It begs the question - if the United Kingdom and United States had not recognised the Holocaust when it happened , would anyone think it had ever existed ?
Who decides what we remember and what we do n't – and does it mean that things we do n't remember or recognise did n't exist and do n't count ?
My earliest recollection of hatred was in the late 60s when I was eight years old , and I still have the scar to prove it .
I was walking home from school in Handsworth , Birmingham , when another boy came cycling past with a brick in his hand .
He hit me across the back of my head with the brick and shouted ' You black bastard ! ' , as he rode off .
When I got home , blood pouring from the back of my head , my mother told me that some people in the world are just like that and it 's something we have to live with .
It was not even a consideration to report the crime – it would have been ignored anyway .
This incident was the first time I realised I was different and that people actually hated me for who and what I was .
The scar on the back of my head is a constant reminder of this .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
People have to understand the past to see the future , they have to start recognising the dangers of the present to prevent them escalating into the Holocaust of the future .
A close late friend of mine recently told me a story of how , when she was very young , she went to a political meeting in Austria with her mother and auntie .
After the meeting , the two adults were debating the event , concluding that the main political figure , who was a radical speaker , would never amount to anything and should just be ignored .
That main figure was Adolf Hitler .
When people do n't recognise these dangers , the problems start .
Call it innocent ignorance , call it optimism , however you want to look at it , unless we recognise and stand up to these figures , who knows where it can lead ?
My friend 's mother and auntie certainly would never have imagined what Hitler could go on to do in the years that followed that meeting .
Bob Marley said in one of his songs ' Well the biggest man you ever did see , was once a baby ' , and that is what interests me as a writer .
Hitler was once a baby and would have been looked on adoringly by people .
He then went on to become one of the most powerful men in history , orchestrating the killings of hundreds of thousands of innocent people .
The boy who racially attacked me in Handsworth may have gone on to abuse and physically hurt other people since .
His attack on me was left unchecked so what 's to stop him ?
It is so important that we have Holocaust Memorial Day in January to remind us to acknowledge how bad we can be to each other , whether it 's direct and intentional or indirect and unintentional .
All it takes is one discriminatory group to gain power and it can all fall apart .
We must join together to recognise where these acts of hatred , regardless of size , can lead if left unchecked .
I urge all Britons to “ Stand up to Hatred ” and recognise the impact we can have on our future .
By considering these things , next time we see , hear , or experience any act of hatred anywhere and in any form , we can make a better future .
So , yesterday , Jane ( 8 ) started a new story on the computer upstairs .
She kept making herself laugh , so she would copy down snippets from her story and come downstairs to read them to me .
( I do n't mean to say the apple does n't fall far from the tree but when I was writing the blog post about our unfortunate symbol in Christmas lights , I was laughing out loud . )
At any rate , I 'm just warning you that when I read this I was eating my breakfast and cereal almost came out of my nose .
The Amazing NightBy Jane CooperTable of continents : 1 .
The animals that are out at night2 .
Learn about the night3 .
Certain nights4 .
Reminder5 .
There are some rules in this book , you know .
6 . A note from the author7 .
About the AuthorThere are a lot of animals out , at night .
Let me get this straight .
I am NOT going to list all of them .
Okay , let ’s move on .
Raccoons are a very fierce part of nature .
There are MILLIONS in the world .
You may think a raccoon to be fuzzy and cuddly .
Most of all , you think a raccoon to be a GREAT pet .
NO , you are really wrong .
Raccoons are very fierce and mean .
Stay away from any raccoons you see .
If a raccoon is sick , or badly injured , you may need to get an adult to take it to a vet .
NOTE : Moles are also out in the day .
I must say Moles are quite fascinating .
Moles are mysterious little balls of fur that live UNDERGROUND .
Please do not be startled , or scared , of our Moles .
Moles are VERY rare sights to see .
Just last year I saw a Mole scampering across the yard and turned into a star .
Kidding !
He just RAN and I mean RAN into the woods .
He was chubby .
Moles are slow runners .
So do n’t catch one , or you ’ll be repaid by Bandages .
In the night Owls come out .
They hide from you in the day .
Owls cry one word , WHO … WHO … WHO …
Owls are very sad Birds .
There is a saying … they wanted to be out at night and had a Lon - n - n - n - n - g neck , with red feathers .
But today they are the colors of the Earth , and have NO neck at all .
Watch out for The Owl.NO .
Let ’s learn about the night LATER .
And I MEAN it .
First a note .
PLEASE DO NOT EVER CLOSE THISE BOOK IN THE MITTLE OF READING IT !
Okay , let ’s move on .
The night is made out of different chemicals in the atmosphere .
Night comes when the earth is tired of looking at the sun and turns away .
Kidding !
The sun has had 12 hours of turning a little foot an hour .
The sun sets at about 5:00 PM .
Be kind to the night .
Be thankful that it lets you get some sleep for once .
Certain nights are difficult to explain .
We will start this Chapter in a minute or two .
Please stand by .
Okay , I ’m ready let ’s move on .
Well , first of all , certain nights only come in certain PLACES .
For example … in Alaska , the sun only comes up for … hmmm … five minutes a day .
We are now DONE with this chapter .
Remember how I told you to ever , NOT EVER put this book down while not finished ?

JPMorgan Chase says that its potential losses related to Bernard L. Madoff , the man accused of engineering an immense global Ponzi scheme , are “ pretty close to zero . ”
But what some angry European investors want to know is when the bank cut its exposure to Mr. Madoff  and why .
As early as 2006 , the bank had started offering investors a way to leverage their bets on the future performance of two hedge funds that invested with Mr. Madoff .
To protect itself from the resulting risk , the bank put $ 250 million of its own money into those funds .
But the bank suddenly began pulling its millions out of those funds in early autumn , months before Mr. Madoff was arrested , according to accounts from Europe and New York that were subsequently confirmed by the bank .
The bank did not notify investors of its move , and several of them are furious that it protected itself but left them holding notes that the bank itself now says are probably worthless .
A spokeswoman , Kristin Lemkau , said the bank withdrew from the Madoff - linked funds last fall after “ a wide - ranging review of our hedge fund exposure . ”
Ms. Lemkau acknowledged , however , that the bank also “ became concerned about the lack of transparency to some questions we posed as part of our review . ”

SAN FRANCISCO , Dec 11 ( Reuters ) - U.S. sales of video game hardware and software rose 10 percent in November from a year earlier , market researcher NPD said on Thursday , as Nintendo Co Ltd 7974 .OS reported its Wii console and DS hand - held system both set U.S. sales records in the month .
NPD said the U.S. video game industry is set to top $ 22 billion in 2008 , and Nintendo , Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Sony Corp 6758.
T said their strong sales in November showed that consumers are still spending despite the global economic crisis .
Rising unemployment and tighter credit have dented U.S. consumers ’ purchasing power , and most retailers have posted dismal sales results in recent months .
But the U.S. video game industry “ continues to set a blistering sales pace , ” NPD analyst Anita Frazier said , with hardware and software sales strong even though this November had seven fewer shopping days than last year’s .
Nintendo ’s
Wii console sold over 2 million units in November , up from over 800,000 in the previous month , setting a record for console unit sales in a non-December month , Nintendo said .
Nintendo ’s
Wii console has sold over 15 million units since its release in November 2006 and holds the title as the country ’s best - selling video game console .
Nintendo ’s DS hand - held system also set a record for U.S. sales in a non-December month , selling over 1.5 million units in November .
“ It was a stellar month , ” Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils - Aime told Reuters .
“ It ’s clear that the consumer demand is exceptionally strong . ”
Frazier said the expanded inventory of Wii consoles in stores boded well for Nintendo at the beginning of the holiday season .
But even with more Wii consoles shipped to stores , Fils - Aime said the company still can’t keep shelves full .
“ With all our activity and effort , we ca n’t commit that the product will be available up until Christmas Day , ” he said .
“ We ’re in uncharted territories when it comes to demand . ”
Although Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 and Sony ’s PlayStation 3 were both sharply outsold by the Wii , the two systems also boasted strong sales in November , according to NPD .
U.S. consumers bought 836,000 units of Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 console in November , up from 371,000 units in the prior month .
Sales of Sony ’s PlayStation 3 more than doubled month over month , rising from 190,000 units sold in October to 378,000 units in November .
“ Despite the tough economic times , we recorded our largest November on record , ” said Xbox 360 product management director Aaron Greenberg .
“ We sold more consoles and more games in November than we ’ve ever done before . ”
Microsoft ’s “ Gears of War 2 ” took the lead on the top ten best - selling games in November , selling 1.56 million units .
Activision Blizzard's ATVI.O " Call of Duty : World at War " came in second at 1.41 million units sold .
Nintendo ’s Wii Play , Wii Fit and Mario Kart Wii filled out the rest of the top five , while Wii Music took the tenth slot .
Sales of hand - held devices picked up in November after dropping 14 percent in the prior month .
Sony ’s PSP and Nintendo ’s DS sold more than double the units in November they did in October .
The PSP hand - held sold 421,000 units in November , up from 193,000 units in October .
Sales of the Nintendo DS tripled , from 491,000 in October to 1.57 million in November .
NPD said U.S. sales of video games hardware , software and accessories totaled $ 2.91 billion in November .

I 'd like to share with you all here some writing that I did last month for Guile 's manual .
It runs through the 15 - year history of Guile Scheme , re-visions a commonly misunderstood episode , and gosh darnit I just really like " the emacs thesis " .
You can find the original here .
* * *
The Emacs Thesis
The story of Guile is the story of bringing the development experience of Emacs to the mass of programs on a GNU system .
Emacs , when it was first created in its GNU form in 1984 , was a new take on the problem of " how to make a program " .
The Emacs thesis is that it is delightful to create composite programs based on an orthogonal kernel written in a low - level language together with a powerful , high - level extension language .
Extension languages foster extensible programs , programs which adapt readily to different users and to changing times .
Proof of this can be seen in Emacs ' current and continued existence , spanning more than a quarter - century .
Besides providing for modification of a program by others , extension languages are good for intension as well .
Programs built in " the Emacs way " are pleasurable and easy for their authors to flesh out with the features that they need .
After the Emacs experience was appreciated more widely , a number of hackers started to consider how to spread this experience to the rest of the GNU system .
It was clear that the easiest way to Emacsify a program would be to embed a shared language implementation into it .
Early Days
Tom Lord was the first to fully concentrate his efforts on an embeddable language runtime , which he named " GEL " , the GNU Extension Language .
GEL was the product of converting SCM , Aubrey Jaffer 's implementation of Scheme , into something more appropriate to embedding as a library .
( SCM was itself based on an implementation by George Carrette , SIOD ) .
Lord managed to convince Richard Stallman to dub GEL the official extension language for the GNU project .
It was a natural fit , given that Scheme was a cleaner , more modern Lisp than Emacs Lisp .
Part of the argument was that eventually when GEL became more capable , it could gain the ability to execute other languages , especially Emacs Lisp .
Due to a naming conflict with another programming language , Jim Blandy suggested a new name for GEL : " Guile " .
Besides being a recursive acroymn , " Guile " craftily follows the naming of its ancestors , " Planner " , " Conniver " , and " Schemer " .
( The latter was truncated to " Scheme " due to a 6 - character file name limit on an old operating system . )
Finally , " Guile " suggests " guy-ell " , or " Guy L. Steele " , who , together with Gerald Sussman , originally discovered Scheme .
Around the same time that Guile ( then GEL ) was readying itself for public release , another extension language was gaining in popularity , Tcl .
Many developers found advantages in Tcl because of its shell - like syntax and its well - developed graphical widgets library , Tk . Also , at the time there was a large marketing push promoting Tcl as a " universal extension language " .
Richard Stallman , as the primary author of GNU Emacs , had a particular vision of what extension languages should be , and Tcl did not seem to him to be as capable as Emacs Lisp .
He posted a criticism to the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup , sparking one of the internet 's legendary flamewars .
As part of these discussions , retrospectively dubbed the " Tcl Wars " , he announced the Free Software Foundation 's intent to promote Guile as the extension language for the GNU project .
It is a common misconception that Guile was created as a reaction to Tcl .
While it is true that the public announcement of Guile happened at the same time as the " Tcl wars " , Guile was created out of a condition that existed outside the polemic .
Indeed , the need for a powerful language to bridge the gap between extension of existing applications and a more fully dynamic programming environment is still with us today .
A Scheme of Many Mantainers
Surveying the field , it seems that Scheme implementations correspond with their maintainers on an N - to - 1 relationship .
That is to say , that those people that implement Schemes might do so on a number of occasions , but that the lifetime of a given Scheme is tied to the maintainership of one individual .
Guile is atypical in this regard .
Tom Lord maintaned Guile for its first year and a half or so , corresponding to the end of 1994 through the middle of 1996 .
The releases made in this time constitute an arc from SCM as a standalone program to Guile as a reusable , embeddable library , but passing through a explosion of features : embedded Tcl and Tk , a toolchain for compiling and disassembling Java , addition of a C - like syntax , creation of a module system , and a start at a rich POSIX interface .
Only some of those features remain in Guile .
There were ongoing tensions between providing a small , embeddable language , and one which had all of the features ( e.g. a graphical toolkit ) that a modern Emacs might need .
In the end , as Guile gained in uptake , the development team decided to focus on depth , documentation and orthogonality rather than on breadth .
This has been the focus of Guile ever since , although there is a wide range of third - party libraries for Guile .
Jim Blandy presided over that period of stabilization , in the three years until the end of 1999 , when he too moved on to other projects .
Since then , Guile has had a group maintainership .
The first group was Maciej Stachowiak , Mikael Djurfeldt , and Marius Vollmer , with Vollmer staying on the longest .
By late 2007 , Vollmer had mostly moved on to other things , so Neil Jerram and Ludovic Court s stepped up to take on the primary maintenance responsibility .
Of course , a large part of the actual work on Guile has come from other contributors too numerous to mention , but without whom the world would be a poorer place .
A Timeline of Selected Guile Releases
guile - i --- 4 February 1995 SCM , turned into a library .
guile - ii --- 6 April 1995
A low - level module system was added .
Tcl / Tk support was added , allowing extension of Scheme by Tcl or vice versa .
POSIX support was improved , and there was an experimental stab at Java integration .
guile - iii --- 18 August 1995
The C - like syntax , ctax , was improved , but mostly this release featured a start at the task of breaking Guile into pieces .
1.0 --- 5 January 1997 #f was distinguished from '( ) .
User - level , cooperative multi- threading was added .
Source - level debugging became more useful , and programmer 's and user 's manuals were begun .
The module system gained a high - level interface , which is still used today in more or less the same form .
1.1 --- 16 May 1997 1.2 --- 24 June 1997 Support for Tcl / Tk and ctax were split off as separate packages , and have remained there since .
Guile became more compatible with SCSH , and more useful as a UNIX scripting language .
Libguile can now be built as a shared library , and third - party extensions written in C became loadable via dynamic linking .
1.3.0 --- 19 October 1998 Command - line editing became much more pleasant through the use of the readline library .
The initial support for internationalization via multi- byte strings was removed , and has yet to be added back , though UTF - 8 hacks are common .
Modules gained the ability to have custom expanders , which is still used for syntax - case macros .
Ports have better support for file descriptors , and fluids were added .
1.3.2 --- 20 August 1999 1.3.4 --- 25 September 19991.4 --- 21 June 2000
A long list of lispy features were added : hooks , Common Lisp 's format , optional and keyword procedure arguments , getopt - long , sorting , random numbers , and many other fixes and enhancements .
Guile now has an interactive debugger , interactive help , and gives better backtraces .
1.6 --- 6 September 2002
Guile gained support for the R5RS standard , and added a number of SRFI modules .
The module system was expanded with programmatic support for identifier selection and renaming .
The GOOPS object system was merged into Guile core .
1.8 --- 20 February 2006
Guile 's arbitrary - precision arithmetic switched to use the GMP library , and added support for exact rationals .
Guile 's embedded user - space threading was removed in favor of POSIX pre-emptive threads , providing true multiprocessing .
Gettext support was added , and Guile 's C API was cleaned up and orthogonalized in a massive way .
2.0 --- thus far , only unstable snapshots available A virtual machine was added to Guile , along with the associated compiler and toolchain .
Support for internationalization was added .
Running Guile instances became controllable and debuggable from within Emacs , via GDS .
GDS was backported to 1.8.5 .
An SRFI - 18 interface to multithreading was added , including thread cancellation .
Status , or : Your Help Needed
Guile has achieved much of what it set out to achieve , but there is much remaining to do .
There is still the old problem of bringing existing applications into a more Emacs - like experience .
Guile has had some successes in this respect , but still most applications in the GNU system are without Guile integration .
Getting Guile to those applications takes an investment , the " hacktivation energy " needed to wire Guile into a program that only pays off once it is good enough to enable new kinds of behavior .
This would be a great way for new hackers to contribute : take an application that you use and that you know well , think of something that it can't yet do , and figure out a way to integrate Guile and implement that task in Guile .
With time , perhaps this exposure can reverse itself , whereby programs can run under Guile instead of vice versa , eventually resulting in the Emacsification of the entire GNU system .
Indeed , this is the reason for the naming of the many Guile modules that live in the ice - 9 namespace , a nod to the fictional substance in Kurt Vonnegut 's novel , Cat 's Cradle , capable of acting as a seed crystal to crystallize the mass of software .
Implicit to this whole discussion is the idea that dynamic languages are somehow better than languages like C .
While languages like C have their place , Guile 's take on this question is that yes , Scheme is more expressive than C , and more fun to write .
This realization carries an imperative with it to write as much code in Scheme as possible rather than in other languages .
These days it is possible to write extensible applications almost entirely from high - level languages , through byte - code and native compilation , speed gains in the underlying hardware , and foreign call interfaces in the high - level language .
Smalltalk systems are like this , as are Common Lisp - based systems .
While there already are a number of pure - Guile applications out there , users still need to drop down to C for some tasks : interfacing to system libraries that do n't have prebuilt Guile interfaces , and for some tasks requiring high performance .
The addition of the virtual machine in Guile 2.0 , together with the compiler infrastructure , should go a long way to addressing the speed issues .
But there is much optimization to be done .
Interested contributors will find lots of delightful low - hanging fruit , from simple profile - driven optimization to hacking a just - in - time compiler from VM bytecode to native code .
Still , even with an all - Guile application , sometimes you want to provide an opportunity for users to extend your program from a language with a syntax that is closer to C , or to Python .
Another interesting idea to consider is compiling e.g. Python to Guile .
It 's not that far - fetched of an idea : see for example IronPython or JRuby .
And then there 's Emacs itself .
Though there is a somewhat - working Emacs Lisp translator for Guile , it can not yet execute all of Emacs Lisp .
A serious integration of Guile with Emacs would replace the Elisp virtual machine with Guile , and provide the necessary C shims so that Guile could emulate Emacs ' C API .
This would give lots of exciting things to Emacs : native threads , a real object system , more sophisticated types , cleaner syntax , and access to all of the Guile extensions .
Finally , there is another axis of crystallization , the axis between different Scheme implementations .
Guile does not yet support the latest Scheme standard , R6RS , and should do so .
Like all standards , R6RS is imperfect , but supporting it will allow more code to run on Guile without modification , and will allow Guile hackers to produce code compatible with other schemes .
Help in this regard would be much appreciated .

( This part 's not in the document .
If you 've gotten here , thanks for reading ! )
The closest thing to Emacs these days is the web browser , and who do we find there : Jim Blandy 's now at Mozilla working on ActionMonkey , and Maciej Stachowiak is at Apple hacking Webkit .
Neat .
Sweet , even !
But to me there 's a weakness in JavaScript , that it 's a kind of watered - down Scheme .
You can't buy good wine in the supermarket ; you have to go closer to the producer .
Similarly if you want to hack something really delightful , go to what the hackers hacked back before they had mortgages -- and what they still hack on in their free time .
This document was made with Guile , and served with it too .

By By Kyle Pallanik Jan 5 , 2008 in Crime 14 Year Old Stefanie Rengel was tragically murdered on January 1st , becoming Toronto 's first homicide victim of the New Year .
Many mourn her loss , but angry calls for the accused to be tried as adults has led to their names being made public on Facebook .
Teen Gets Life in Prison for Murder More
At the time of this writing there are Police are concerned with the interference with the rule of law and a Many of the critics of the Youth Criminal Justice Act echoed the opinion that the Stefanie Rengel 's murderer (s ) should be tried in an adult court in various Facebook posts and opposed the publication bans that would have them keep the identities of the accused to themselves .
The Accused and the Crime Just after dark on New Year 's day Stefanie Rengel was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach on the sidewalk near her home at St. Claire and O'Connor .
Just a few metres from her front door , she was left to bleed to death , by her attacker who fled the scene .
She was found later by an off - duty police officer and rushed to hospital , where she was pronounced dead .
Two teens are now in the custody of police after appearing before an Etobicoke court on Thursday .
The oldest , who has just turned 18 on January 5th is accused of first degree murder , abetted by a 15 year old female , also accused of the same felony .
The crown , who has said that they will be seeking adult sentences for both teens , indicated in their synopsis that the boy was driven to commit the murder by the jealous girl who wanted Stefanie dead .
The girls lawyer Marshall Sack has The young man who is accused of stabbing Stefanie to death , is reputed to have had a bad temper , as fellow teen Anthony Kozac Mourning the Loss
On the evening of January 4th , about 400 friends , relatives and well wishers , gathered for a silent candlelight vigil outside the home where Stefanie had lived .
Her mother Patricia and stepfather James Hung came outside to meet the gathering from their front porch .
" Thank you so much , " an emotional James Hung was The people gathered there began to sing ' Amazing Grace ' quietly as Adolfo Rengel - Gonzalez , her birth father , stepmother Maureen Rengel and younger brother Ian came outside to join in an embrace .
The vigil had been organized by Scott Patton , the pastor of the Presteign - Woodbine United Church , that Stefanie had attended and spent a lot of time .
" We carry this light with us in the community to show the family we cherish Stefanie 's memory , " he said .
" Even in the midst of this we continue to have hope . "
A friend of Stefanie 's stepfather , Sgt. Terry Sidora , who works in the police Emergency Task Force unit with him , has established a trust fund , where donations can be made to raise money intended to commemorate Stefanie .
Donations can be made to TD Canada Trust , account number 502-004-729-863-22671 .
“ It ’s a tragedy clearly that ’s touched everyone , and it ’s something as friends that we ’re trying to do for the family , ” he said .
Stefanie 's friends continue to share their memories of someone who they describe in many heartfelt ways , including a touching The Youth Criminal Justice Act in Canada prevents media from publishing the names of the accused .
However , but the names of the accused , a 17 year boy , and a 15 year old girl , have been repeatedly mentioned on Facebook messages and even posted pictures of them , despite efforts by staff and police to remove the posts that contain the information .
At the time of this writing there are three discussion groups dedicated to the memory of Stefanie on Facebook , where hundreds of messages express everything from heartfelt sympathies to her family , personal messages to her spirit and various points of view about the laws that protect the accused .
Police are concerned with the interference with the rule of law and a CBC report quoted Toronto Police spokesperson Mark Pugash as saying that the police " simply have no control " over the actions of users on the Internet .
" I think what the events of the last few days have shown is that there are many people who are part of the criminal justice process who have to look and see whether changes are necessary . "
he said , about the justice system 's inability to keep up with the changes in technology and the expressive nature of social networking tools .

The girls lawyer Marshall Sack has fiercely challenged the first degree murder charge , saying that she was not at the scene of the murder .
Regarding the accusation that the girl ' ordered ' the boy to kill Stefanie , he is reported to have said , “ My client is alleged to have indicated at some point in time that she wanted the deceased not to be alive ” but she did not “ put this young man up to this .

The young man who is accused of stabbing Stefanie to death , is reputed to have had a bad temper , as fellow teen Anthony Kozac explained " We knew him through baseball .
And he had fits sometimes , like angry outbursts . "
Another teen , Casey Brown , said to CityNews reporters that her friend Stefanie had dated the boy , and mentioned that he had trouble controlling his emotions .

Oakland marijuana author and activist Ed Rosenthal will be back before a federal appeals court in San Francisco Wednesday to challenge his conviction for growing marijuana .
Rosenthal , 64 , was convicted in federal district court in San Francisco in 2007 of three counts of conspiring to grow marijuana and growing marijuana in an Oakland warehouse .
He was sentenced to one day already served in prison .
Rosenthal ’s appeal will be heard Wednesday morning by a three - judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which is expected to issue a written ruling at a later date .
Rosenthal , the self - described ‘ Guru of Ganja , ’ claims his trial was unfair because the jury was not allowed to hear evidence that he believed he had been deputized by the city of Oakland to carry out its medical marijuana program .
If Rosenthal wins a new trial , it would be his third .
He was convicted in an earlier trial in 2003 , but that conviction was overturned by the appeals court on grounds of juror misconduct .
Rosenthal ’s attorney , Michael Clough , said Tuesday that even though his client was sentenced to only one day in prison , he is appealing to clear his name and remove the designation that he is a convicted felon .
Clough said that Rosenthal does n’t fear that he is risking a longer sentence because both the appeals court and the trial judge have approved the one - day penalty .
Outside of court , Rosenthal has claimed he was growing starter plants for patients needing medical marijuana .
But he was never permitted to make that argument in federal court because U.S. drug laws make no exception for state medical marijuana laws .

Doctor Who ?
After months of febrile speculation the BBC tonight revealed the identity of the 11th Doctor .
Not a prominent black actor , nor a woman , nor any of the high - profile names touted to play the iconic Time Lord .
Instead , the honour of wielding the sonic screwdriver and battling Daleks and Zygons has fallen to relative unknown Matt Smith – at 26 he is the youngest Doctor in the 45 years since the Tardis first landed at the BBC .
Smith , from Northampton , whose TV debut was in the 2006 adaptation of Philip Pullman 's The Ruby in the Smoke , which also starred former Doctor Who companion Billie Piper , said he was so excited at landing the coveted role he paced his room for three days smiling to himself .
" I 'm flabbergasted .
I have n't slept , really , to be honest , " he said .
His unveiling as the next extraterrestrial scientist came during Doctor Who Confidential – The Eleventh Doctor , broadcast on BBC1 at the same time as being simultaneously cast on giant screens in city centres all over Britain .
Smith will replace David Tennant , 37 , who will leave after filming four specials , and take over the role in October 2010 .
Doctor
Who executive producer Steven Moffat said he knew he had found his Doctor at the start of auditions .
" The way he said the lines , the way he looked , his hair .
Everything was spot on , " he said , praising Smith 's dynamism and swagger .
Whovians , too , were impressed .
" We think it is a great choice to have someone so young .
David Tennant was the most energetic Doctor ever , and you need somebody with youth and energy to take that forward , " said Sebastian Brook , editor of the drwho - online fan website .
Punters had tipped Paterson Joseph , one of the stars of the recent Survivors sci-fi series , and Golden Globe winner Chiwetel Ejiofor as contenders for the first black Doctor , while Catherine Tate and Catherine Zeta Jones had been suggested as female doctors .
But Matthew Sweet , cultural commentator and broadcaster , said : " The idea of a black or woman Doctor is something we only seem to be able to enjoy as a tease .
When Tom Baker left , for example , there was speculation about Joanna Lumley taking over .
There is a little part of me that 's disappointed the Obama effect has n't reached Gallifrey yet . "
Sweet , a lifelong Doctor Who fan , added : " This was one of the best kept secrets .
Matt Smith has got a fascinating face .
It 's long and bony , with a commanding jaw .
He looks like someone who could have been in Duran Duran .
He has a quality of the old man trapped in the young man 's body .
" I suspect he might be a more sensual character than David Tennant , who had no kind of dangerous sexuality about him .
There 's something Byronic about Matt Smith – he's got the lips for it . "
Sophie Aldred , who played companion Ace opposite Sylvester McCoy 's Doctor , said : " I 'm delighted .
I 'm so pleased that they have n't chosen a big name but gone with someone who 's obviously a good actor but not well known to the public at large .
" He 's got a very interesting face and a fantastic presence .
It 's going to be a difficult job to follow David Tennant , but I think he 'll be a safe pair of hands . "
Smith , a former headboy , took up acting after hopes of a professional football career were dashed by a back injury .
He appeared in Alan Bennett 's play The History Boys at the National Theatre in London , and in Swimming with Sharks in the West End .

Tennant , who announced he was leaving last year , said : " As I begin the end of my connection to all of this , I do feel a bit of jealousy of Matt who 's just about to start and has got all of this ahead of him , and it's a very exciting journey to go on . "

In the online games industry , if we keep quiet about the causes , the hopes , the fears , the successes , and the failures of the best part of $ 100 million burnt on a single project , then what hope is there for us to avoid making the same mistakes again ?
Unlike Scott , I actually ( superficially speaking ) agree with this statement as to why Tabula Rasa , Age of Conan , Pirates of the Burning Sea , and Hellgate : London failed ( TR , AoC , PotBS , and HL from now now … )
“ No , these games failed because their developers let it happen . ”
Funcom * should have * learned enough lessons with Anarchy Online not to make the mistakes they did with AoC ; not the precise same mistakes , but the same “ class ” of mistakes were made , suggesting that they tried to fix only the symptoms and failed to understand the causes
Destination Games knew a long long time before TR went to beta that it was n’t ( going to be ) ready even for beta , let alone launch .
IMHO NCsoft collectively knew very well that TR was n’t ready for launch , but went ahead and launched it anyway
Bill Roper went on record to say that no - one understood their sales / revenue model , from the start .
As I ’ve mentioned before , that pretty much guarantees failure , and it ’s not rocket - science to understand why !
Pirates … I have no idea , actually .
It ’s the one that I have never played ( although I really wanted to ) nor even * seen * ( which is unusual ) .
I ’m not going to talk about PotBS any more , since I really know nothing about it
NB : I do n’t happen to agree with anything else in that post .
I ’ve got nothing against it , I just did n’t find anything interesting or new about the games themselves in the post , and IMHO the list of “ why this happened ” is too shallow and derivative to be worth saying in 2009 – the same has been said many times over the last ten years by many people , and ain’t particularly insightful in the first place .
Sorry , dude .
How do you “ let ” an MMO fail , pre-launch ?
Anyway , back to the interesting bit .
This is why I find the statement particularly interesting : the choice of phrasing , that the developers “ let it ” fail .
The implication being that they did n’t do anything wrong , perhaps , but that they stood by and watched the train rolling slowly towards the brick wall and did n’t try ( hard enough ) to stop the collision .
TR was in development for 7 years ( give or take a bit , and arguably just half that depending on whether you count the bit before there was an official “ resetting ” of the project ( and re-shuffling of staff ) ) .
When did they first ship a playable that people found fun ?
Ah. Hmm. Um . Well .
Now , * I * certainly was n’t around during all this , so I ca n’t authoritatively answer that .
However , I well remember the large number of people remarking that the beta – just before launch – was starting to be “ actually a lot of fun to play ” .
6 + years to get to the first fun version , eh? Hmm .
Traditionally , you start with something fun , then you build a game around it , not the other way around .
Rating Tabula Rasa , in Alpha
While people are busily shooting me down in flames for such disloyalty :) , I ’m going to make a confession : I played TR in the alpha , and ( to the great amusement – and in many cases total disbelief – of my colleagues ) I actually enjoyed it .
It certainly was n’t a lot of fun to play , but there were nice elements that I could really see how they would develop ( could be developed ) into a great game , if we started development of the game at that point .
I was accustomed at the time to making forward - looking evaluations of games , and reading between the lines and guess at how the final product would look .
i.e. it was a good pre-production prototype , and if I ’d been asked “ this studio wants us to fund them to turn this into a full game , should we do it ? ”
I ’d have said “ well , modulo some small but fundamental changes that are needed , and the fact we need to explain to them a small number of basic mistakes they ’re making with misunderstanding the MMO market , and they obviously will want a * lot* more money to build it up , flesh it out , and implement what they ’ve barely sketched out in outline at this point … definitely YES .
This will make a great game , probably ” .
( IIRC … I was asked this question at the end of my second playsession and gave pretty much that answer .
At which point he said something like “ Yes .
We ’ve been telling them that for a while .
They ’re not going to do any of it ” )
Which maybe sounds very negative ?
To me it was n’t .
At that time I was ( one of many people ) doing due - diligence reviews and milestone reviews for games being published by NCsoft .
IMHO no game ( and no studio ) is perfect in pre-production .
Every studio worth their salt pushes the boundaries , and – critically important – their own personal comfort zones .
That guarantees that they ’re not experts at producing the new game - type when they start .
There are always warts ; that ’s partly why they make the prototype – to show to many other people , get second opinions , find out the flaws other people see , and then go “ ah ! yes !
and actually … now you ’ve said that , we ’ve just thought of a much better way of doing this ! ” .
( incidentally , I found Valve ’s post - mortem discussions of Team Fortress 2 fascinating , revealing that even for a studio with a perfect record of successes making new IPs they still screwed - up the pre-production work on TF2 , and only late into the project did they really turn it around into the shining piece of awesomeness that they finally shipped .
I ca n’t find a google link to the frank interviews Valve did on the subject , but here ’s an interesting one on how much they still had left to do post launch – 53 updates (! ) – even AFTER rescuing the project halfway through by fundamentally rethinking it )
Time - out : who are you , again ?
I… :
… was the European CTO at the time … was not on the TR dev team ( was n’t even in the same office ) … started playing TR as soon as I joined the company , and played Alpha , Beta , and some of Live … unlike many outside the TR team ( I suspect : “ the vast majority ” )
I voluntarily played TR during my free time … got locked - out when the game launched , and it took many months for my official corporate free account to get allowed back in , thanks to some stupid bugs in NCsoft North America ’s account management systems … was on a lot of the internal development mailing lists .
Particularly interesting ones were the bugs list , the internal playsessions list ( both for the dev teams and for other internal players ) , and the producers list ( especially the scrum - masters list when the team eventually switched to Scrum ) .
I want to be clear about this : I had nothing to do with the development of TR .
But , like many people who can say that , I was heavily exposed to it – both the project , and the game , and the politics .
TR had a massive effect on the company at the time , everyone was touched by it .
Anyone in development – anywhere – got affected a lot more than most ; it affected budgets , management structures , technology investments , publishing strategy , investment strategy , etc .
I ’m not claiming to know what was going on in there for certain , but given my position I had the luxury of a lot of insights that other people would n’t have had .
So … although I know a lot about what happened , please view this post ( it was going to be about the 4 games generally , but it appears to have warped into a TR - centric story ) as an outsider ’s view .
And do n’t read it as all true , I may accidentally report some rumours ( and , you know , I do n’t want to get sued if someone takes this as 100 % literal truth ) though I ’ll try hard not to .
TR team members may well find some big mistakes in what ’s here – and I ’d welcome their corrections and counter - arguments .
( I know my name appears in at least one set of the credits due to an NCsoft policy of “ crediting all staff who were employed on the launch day of the product ” , especially ironic since I think I ’ve ended up being “ officially ” credited only on the game I did * not* work on : ) . )
Back to the topic :
The difficulty of ….
Timing
It was n’t ready for beta .
I said so .
Many others said so .
How privately they said it , in many cases I do n’t know .
However , I am aware of plenty of people that said it pretty loudly internally at NCsoft ( I saw the emails , or sat in the meetings ) .
NB : I said “ was n’t ready for beta “ .
We ’re not even discussing “ launch ” yet .
But it was never going to be as easy as simply saying “ hey , I ’m not that busy for the next fortnight ; howabout we launch TR next week ?
Or do you want to wait another year or two ? ” .
On a project that had already burnt through tens of millions of dollars with almost nothing concrete to show for it ( not necessarily a “ fair ” judgement ; but if you were * literal * about it , which by that point many people were , then technically there was “ nothing ” to show ) , and had on the order of 100 people employed full time working on it every day , there was a lot of money at stake even just delaying launch by a single week .
( do the math ; you ’re already counting in the “ hundreds of thousands of dollars ” each time you prolong development by a single week there )
And then there were the political issues , for instance the fact that NCsoft North America had never developed a game internally in their long years of existence ( all the internal games were developed by studios that NCsoft acquired during development ) .
That means that the core business for the USA was n’t making any revenue * at all * ( publishing and development are usually seen as different divisions ) .
Again , I ’m not defending this perspective , or claiming it ’s fair – but it was technically true , and was mentioned a lot .
Such things tend to scare stakeholders , especially shareholders .
Especially directors of a public company who are trying to keep shareholders happy .
Especially directors in a foreign country who may or may not even speak the same language as you .
( I ’m not trying to make veiled accusations against individuals here , nor against the different national divisions within NCsoft – I ’m simply pointing out basic facts of life when it comes to large multinational companies , and observing that there was * inevitable * pressure along those lines , independently of whether or not anyone deliberately applied it ) .
And there were other issues .
With that many people working on one project ?
Some of them for more than 5 years ?
Well .
There ’s plenty of dirty laundry on a project that size .
But I do n’t feel that anyone except the people directly involved get to decide whether its fair and reasonable to air it ( because , frankly , no - one else is going to have much insight into what really happened ) .
So .
It was hard , surely , to make any decision on launch dates .
There are no easy decisions in such situations , no “ obviously , the best solution is X ” ( although to many different people such obvious answers seem to exist , the “ easy ” answers tend to screw - over several other teams ) .
Making any decision was hard , but the decisions that were taken were considered inarguably “ wrong ” by many people , immediately that they were made .
They may not have known what the “ best ” solution was , but they certainly recognized ( or felt they did ) one of the “ worst ” ones .
And they were vocal about it .
A survey was taken , internally , asking what people thought .
The results were never published – so no - one ( apart from the survey takers ) knows exactly what the results were , but we were told that the * company * knew .
TR : The stage is set
To summarise so far ( I know , I know – this is a long post , sorry )
TR went off the rails on some meandering journeys into research & development for many years burning through lots of cash ( this is not necessarily something to castigate them for – many hit games did exactly the same ; if you can afford the cash + the chance of failure ( and NCsoft is a billion - dollar company , so let ’s face it : they could ) , then it ’s perfectly reasonable to decide on this course of action / allow it to continue )
Very late , they eventually hit upon a good formula , a good core game Before they could actually make that game , a difficult decision was taken to push the team to the wall and force an early beta test … and then the even more difficult decision taken to push them even harder to do an insanely early live launch .
Certain alignments of astrological constellations in the Marketing department ( also known as “ tenth anniversary of the launch date of the last MMO that the core members of this team shipped ” ) may or may not have had something to do with this The choice made was widely ( if not universally ) regarded as “ very bad ”
The company was made aware of the volume of people holding opinions along those lines
… and as they say on the Quiz shows : What Happened Next ?
And this is where we come back to the point that interests me : did we , collectively as an organization , “ allow it to happen ” ?
Personally , I believe the answer is an unqualified : “ Yes ” .
Because many people worked * really hard * from that point on to make the game a success ; many who had been working very hard already pushed themselves to work harder .
And yet , in parallel , while working their asses off to make sure the train was big and beautiful , no - one stopped the train - wreck from happening .
There are excellent mitigating excuses for why individuals allowed this , many of them related to “ not wanting to lose my job ” .
Many others relate to “ life is too short to kill myself ( with stress ) over continuing to bash my head against this particular brick wall ” ( many people had complained long and hard about TR in the months and years running up to that point ) .
Some people had just given up hope , and decided it was less painful simply to stop caring .
Others were relishing the impending catastrophe , and I can think of some individuals who I personally believe were deliberately planning to get maximum political advantage for themselves out of the death of TR .
Re-reading this as I go , I remember there was another big excuse that I never gave credence to : “ I ’ll bury my head in real work and make * my * parts as good as I possibly can , and hope if everyone else does the same , it will All Come Together In The End ” .
This one was n’t voiced so much , but is simply what people did , in some cases .
Hope is not a strategy .
Whenever your attempt to avoid disaster revolves around the H - word instead of a concrete averting action , you are doomed .
But since I ’m not trying to blame anyone here , it does n’t matter whether or not we had good reasons for allowing it .
What I ’m really interested in is “ how to make games better ” , so the important point is that – collectively – we did allow it .
What would Jesus do ?
What should we have done , not as an organization , but as individuals ?
How often does anyone talk about this ?
% of player forums posts that blame developers for launching early % of player forums posts that explain what an individual employee should do about it
It ’s very easy to “ work harder ” when doom is impending , but as I ’ve mentioned above this achieves nothing .
There are plenty of cases in the games industry where disasters are forseen , and the people involved charge into them with gusto , screaming “ YOU’RE ALL WRONG ! DON ’T BE A HATER ! ” , and deserve what they get .
But in those situations where people know it ’s wrong , what can they do ?
One colleague attempted various things and ultimately ended up trying to deal with the “ root ” of the problems by bringing about wholesale organizational change .
Not in terms of who was employed , who was in charge , etc , but in terms of the basic attitudes and beliefs of the people turning up to work each day .
He tried to remove the cultures of secrecy and fear ( * ) and replace them with cultures of actively seeking constructive criticism and actively supporting naysayers , so long as they adhered to rules of “ decency ” when it came to how criticism was provided .
(*) – ( tens of millions of dollars spent and the game doesnt work but is going to beta / live ?
Fear was ever - present .
Maybe ( I heard rumours , and saw some … strange … stuff , but I do n’t know for sure ) for other reasons too .
c.f. my comments about dirty laundry above )
In the end , I suspect if he ’d started his campaign a year earlier , it * might * have worked .
It certainly seemed to be having some surprisingly impressive results towards the end .
Among other things , the team itself tried adopting Scrum , with some tremendous results IMHO .
Incidentally , I ’m hoping one of the talks at GDC this year will be someone from the TR team ( perhaps Andy Bruncke or April Burba ? ) on their experiences adopting Scrum with a team of 50 - 100 people at the end of development of a > $ 50 million failed AAA title .
( If that talk does happen , I ’ll be the one at the back of the room during the Q&A session at the end sticking my hand up to ask :
In your opinion , if the team had adopted Scrum 12 months earlier , might it have saved TR ?
I would be very interested to hear the team ’s thoughts on that )
Of course , both of those paths – and some of the other things people tried – were probably too little too late .
TR did n’t have the luxury of time – the ( contested ) decisions being made were by definition time - critical .
So … what should we have done ?
Both as individuals , and as members of an organization that we each believed in ?
What would you do ?
Not long after , for unrelated reasons , my manager resigned .
And shortly after that , so did several other people , myself included .
TR did n’t ( I believe ) cause any of us to leave – none of them were on the TR team itself – but some of the problems it exposed within the company did come up often in people ’s informal ( down the pub ) complaints about leaving .
When the organization disempowers you , and nothing you do seems able to make a diference , but – in your opinion – the impending event is an “ extinction - level ” disaster , is resignation the only valid response ?
Surely not ?
Final Note
To my knowledge , NCsoft never admitted that TR was a failure , internally .
In June 2008 , when I left the company , the CEO had gone , the lead designer had gone , and the rest of the directors were about to get axed in the pending re-shuffle ( which had n’t been announced even internally yet ) – but still no admission in sight .
I used to gently point out that until we admitted the failure , we would fail to fully respond to it , and to fully adjust and improve – so that we were almost certainly doomed to repeat it .
As far as I know , the painful admission has still never been made , even internally .
The subject was danced around many times , but no - one would come out and say it publically ( internally ) ; it was always oblique references , and statements such as “ Tabula Rasa is doing very well , although not as well as we hoped ” – eliciting mirth , disbelief , looks of remembered pain , or simply blank looks of “ wanting to forget it ever happened ” etc among the various people in the company .
Personally , for each of the senior management at the company at the time , I shall never forget that you guys did not make that happen .
To me , this one thing was symptomatic of , and encapsulates , the institutional failure to respond to the failings of the project .
Privately , reasons were cited to me varying from “ it does n’t matter any more , everyone knows its over ” to “ I do n’t want to hurt anyone more than they ’ve already been hurt ” to “ just basic tact ” to “ let ’s not rock the boat ” to “ we should look on the bright side and get on with the other games we ’re making as a company , and not get mired in history / water under the bridge ” .
But as one of my friends said at the time : what ’s it got to do with hurting people ?
we just want to use the experience to learn to make better games .
And how the hell are we going to do that when you people wo n’t even admit we were wrong ?
Well , they were more polite about it than the title suggests , but the sentiment is real :
Joseph P. Kennedy II , whose father Robert F. Kennedy championed Native American rights , is at war with a band of Navajo Indians .
The Cameron Chapter of Navajo Nation is charging that Kennedy , president of Citizens Energy Corp. and its for - profit business Citizens Wind , is trying to seize control of a proposed wind farm on the tribe ’s reservation on Gray Mountain in northern Arizona .
“ Kennedy ’s actions have single - handedly obstructed project development , delaying much - needed income and jobs for our nation , ” said Edward Singer , president of the Navajos ’ 1,500 - member Cameron Chapter .
In a letter to Kennedy earlier this month , Singer accused Kennedy of using his “ political connections ” to take control of the project .
“ If you are honestly committed to helping communities such as ours , please stop interfering with the Cameron Chapter so that we can move forward with the development of our Navajo Wind Project , ” Singer wrote .
“ Instead , we suggest you support wind development elsewhere , including the Cape Wind Project in Massachusetts . ”
It ’s that last sentence about Cape Wind that indicates that the gloves are off on this one , and many people reading this are nodding in agreement .
For the rest of you , it goes like this :
The Cape Wind Project is a Massachusetts - based organization trying to create an offshore wind farm several miles off the coast of Nantucket .
Me , I ’m more of a nuclear power kind of guy when it comes to alternative energy , but what the heck : I ’m also more of a regionalism kind of guy , and there ’s nothing wrong with wind power generally .
If you ’ve got a resource like a reliable breeze to exploit , go ahead and exploit it if you can do so without messing up your neighbors ’ lives .
Alas , when you ’re a Kennedy , “ messing up your neighbors ’ lives ” and “ messing up your neighbors ’ view ” is pretty much synonymous – at least , when a Kennedy is a neighbor .
I ’ll give you a choice .
You can read this article ( “ Ted Kennedy hits Cape Wind OK “ ) , or watch the video about Kennedy vs. Cape Wind below :
… but , really , the message is the same either way .
Espousing the use of alternative energy is all very nice , but not if it has even the slightest negative impact on any aspect of our self - identifying “ elite ” class .
Yes , you ’ve heard this one before : “ I ’ll believe that it ’s a problem when the people who say it ’s a problem act like it ’s a problem ” is the way that Glenn Reynolds puts it , I believe .
And so the guy who pushes alternative energy in general tries to push it away from Nantucket .
So that ’s why this guy from the Navajos is bringing it up .
He ’s claiming that Nephew Bobbie is conniving with the president of the Navajo tribe to take away the wind farm that the local Navajos have been working to develop so that Kennedy ’s company can move in – and , not incidentally , reap in revenues that can apparently sustain an annual payment of $ 10 million a year .
You can read more on the story here : if all of this sounds like the plot of an episode of Magnum PI or The A - Team , complete with greedy developers conniving to cheat a local community out of its only resource , well , yes .
With one difference .
This is actually happening .
Energy - guzzling flatscreen plasma televisions will soon be banned as part of the battle against climate change , ministers have told The Independent on Sunday .
" Minimum energy performance standards " for televisions are expected to be agreed across Europe this spring , they say , and this should lead to " phasing out the most inefficient TVs " .
At the same time , a compulsory labelling system will be drawn up to identify the best and worst devices .
The moves , which follow last week 's withdrawal of the 100W incandescent lightbulb , are part of a drive to slow the rapid growth of electricity consumption in homes by phasing out wasteful devices and introducing more efficient ones .
Giant plasma televisions – dubbed " the 4x4s of the living room " – can consume four times as much energy as traditional TVs that used cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) .

Over the past 30 years , the number of electric appliances and gadgets in a typical home has almost trebled – from 17 to 47 – as a host of devices from scanners to security systems , cappuccino makers to computer game consoles have joined the more traditional kettles , irons , vacuum cleaners and cookers .
And the number of televisions in homes has also grown rapidly ; there are now 60 million of them , one for every person in the country .
The amount of power needed to run this electronic explosion has more than doubled in the same period , and the official Energy Savings Trust estimates that it will grow by another 12 per cent over the next four years .
The boom in flatscreen TVs , partly spurred by the digital changeover , is helping to fuel the increase , as is the growing size of the screens .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) said last week : " In the past five years we have seen the main television in a household change from typically being a 24in to 32in CRT television to being a much larger flatscreen television , with screen sizes of between 32 and 42 inches becoming more and more common .
Not surprisingly , this has seen the energy used by the main television in the house increase . "
Different makes and models of television vary in their use of power , but a 42in plasma television may use some 822 kilowatt hours a year , compared to 350kWh by an LCD flat screen of the same size .
A 32in CRT , the biggest available , would use 322kWh .
Power consumption goes up as the screens increase in size , so the trust says that a big plasma model could use four times as much electricity and be responsible for the emission of four times as much carbon dioxide as the biggest CRT ; they now account for twice as much as a fridge - freezer .
Now European governments are finalising a mandatory EU regulation to set minimum standards for televisions .
The worst performers will be phased out , and the rest will have to be labelled with energy ratings which , says Defra , " will make it easier for consumers to identify the most and least energy - efficient televisions available " .
The scheme is modelled on an existing one for fridges and other white goods which has greatly increased their efficiency over the past decade .
The EU has already agreed minimum standards for the electricity consumed in standby mode .
Defra says this should cause a fourfold drop by early next year in the energy used by a TV when it has been switched off by remote control instead of the main switch .
Similar steps are being taken in Australia and the United States ; in the US , 275 million televisions gobble up as much electricity as is produced by 10 coal - fired power stations .
Manufacturers are responding by making their products greener .
The best new plasma televisions now use one - third less energy than the average , and new LED televisions , which are more efficient , are being developed .
The robots are not so much coming ; they have arrived .
But instead of dominating humanity with superior logic and strength , they threaten to create an underclass of people who are left without human contact .
The rise of robots in the home , in the workplace and in warfare needs to be supervised and controlled by ethical guidelines which limit how they can be used in sensitive scenarios such as baby - sitting , caring for the elderly , and combat , a leading scientist warns today .
Sales of professional and personal service robots worldwide were estimated to have reached about 5.5 million this year – and are expected to more than double to 11.5 million by 2011 – yet there is little or no control over how these machines are used .
Some help busy professionals entertain children ; other machines feed and bathe the elderly and incapacitated .

Professor Noel Sharkey , an expert on artificial intelligence based at the University of Sheffield , warns that robots are being introduced to potentially sensitive situations that could lead to isolation and lack of human contact , because of the tendency to leave robots alone with their charges for long periods .
" We need to look at guidelines for a cut - off so we have a limit to the contact with robots , " Professor Sharkey said .
" Some robots designed to look after children now are so safe that parents can leave their children with them for hours , or even days . "
More than a dozen companies based in Japan and South Korea manufacture robot " companions " and carers for children .
For example , NEC has tested its cute - looking personal robot PaPeRo on children : the device lives at home with a family , recognises their faces , can mimic their behaviour and be programmed to tell jokes , all the while exploring the house .
Many robots are designed as toys , but they can also take on childcare roles by monitoring the movements of a child and communicating with a parent in another room , or even another building , through wireless computer connection or mobile phone .
" Research into service robots has demonstrated a close bonding and attachment by children , who , in most cases , prefer a robot to a teddy bear , " Professor Sharkey said .
" Short - term exposure can provide an enjoyable and entertaining experience that creates interest and curiosity .
But because of the physical safety that robot minders provide , children could be left without human contact for many hours a day or perhaps several days , and the possible psychological impact of the varying degrees of social isolation on development is unknown . "
Less playful robots are being developed to look after elderly people .
Secom makes a computer called My Spoon which helps disabled people to eat food from a table .
Sanyo has built an electric bathtub robot that automatically washes and rinses someone suffering from movement disability .
" At the other end of the age spectrum [ to child care ] , the relative increase in many countries in the population of the elderly relative to available younger care - givers has spurred the development of elder - care robots , " Professor Sharkey said .
" These robots can help the elderly to maintain independence in their own homes , but their presence could lead to the risk of leaving the elderly in the exclusive care of machines without sufficient human contact .
The elderly need the human contact that is often provided only by caregivers and people performing day - to - day tasks for them . "
In the journal Science , Professor Sharkey calls for ethical guidelines to cover all aspects of robotic technology , not just in the home and workplace , but also on the battlefield , where lethal robots such as the missile - armed Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan are already deployed with lethal effect .
The US Future Combat Systems project aims to use robots as " force multipliers " , with a single soldier initiating large - scale ground and aerial attacks by a robot droid army .
" Robots for care and for war represent just two of many ethically problematic areas that will soon arise from the rapid increase and spreading diversity of robotics applications , " Professor Sharkey said .
" Scientists and engineers working in robotics must be mindful of the potential dangers of their work , and public and international discussion is vital in order to set policy guidelines for ethical and safe application before the guidelines set themselves . "

The call for controls over robots goes back to the 1940s when the science - fiction author Isaac Asimov drew up his famous three laws of robotics .
The first rule stated that robots must not harm people ; the second that they must obey the commands of people provided they does not conflict with the first law ; and the third law was that robots must attempt to avoid harming themselves provided this was not in conflict with the two other laws .
Asimov wrote a collection of science fiction stories called I , Robot which exploited the issue of machines and morality .
He wanted to counter the long history of fictional accounts of dangerous automatons – from the Jewish Golem to Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein – and used his three laws as a literary device to exploit the ethical issues arising from the human interaction with non-human , intelligent beings .
But late 20th - century predictions about the rise of machines endowed with superior artificial intelligence have not been realised , although robot scientists have given their mechanical protégés quasi- intelligent traits such as simple speech recognition , emotional expression and face recognition .
Professor Starkey believes that even dumb robots need to be controlled .
" I 'm not suggesting like Asimov to put ethical rules into robots , but to just to have guidelines on how robots are used , " he said .
" Current robots are not bright enough even to be called stupid .
If I even thought they would be superior in intelligence , I would not have these concerns .
They are dumb machines not much brighter than the average washing machine , and that 's the problem . "
Isaac Asimov :
The three laws of robotics
The science fiction author Isaac Asimov , who died in 1992 , coined the phrase " robotics " to describe the study of robots .
In 1940 , Asimov drew up his three laws of robotics , partly as a literary device to exploit the ethical issues arising from the interaction with intelligent machines .
* First Law : a robot must not harm a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to be harmed .
* Second Law : a robot must obey the commands of human beings , except where the orders conflict with the first law .
* Third Law : a robot must protect its own existence so long as this does not conflict with the first two laws .
Later on , Asimov amended the laws by adding two more .
The " zeroth " law stated that a robot must not harm humanity , which deals with the ethical problem arising from following the first law but in the process putting other human beings at risk .
Asimov also added a final " law of procreation " stating that robots must not make other robots that do not follow the laws of robotics .
The speeches of US President Barack Obama are proving to be a popular aid to learning English in Japan and a compilation has become a national bestseller .
Roland Buerk reports .
Of the many parallels between Barack Obama and John F. Kennedy , one has eluded all coverage : Both attended Catholic school as children .
In fact , while JFK may have been the Irish Catholic from Boston , he spent less time at the Canterbury School in Connecticut than did young Barry ( as he was then called ) at St. Francis of Assisi in Indonesia .
At a time when America 's 6,165 Catholic elementary and 1,213 secondary schools are celebrating Catholic Schools Week , President Obama 's first - hand experience here opens the door to a provocative ...
We love bikes .
We love riding them , we love looking at them , we love everything they stand for .
So in this bike - loving spirit , we honed down the five most inspired pieces of bike - centric design innovation .
YAKKAY HELMETS
We ’re big believers here in the inherent insufficiency of mere aesthetics .
But when an object is smart by concept and aesthetically delightful by design , we ’re all over it .
Case in point : YAKKAY bicycle helmets , the marriage of safety and style .
Rather brilliantly dubbed “ brainwear for smart people , ” the helmets are basically a hard “ core ” covered by a soft hat - like “ skin . ”
They ’re available in a multitude of colors and currently come in 4 models , each named after a major fashion capital and reflecting its iconic style .
YAKKAY is the brainchild of 5
Danish designers who felt the need to reconcile their love for bikes with their hate of above - the - neck dorkiness .
BIKE TRASH CAN
Reason # 3,587 to love The Netherlands : Bike - centric garbage disposal .
No more slowing down , no more obscene pressure for Major League hand - eye coordination .
And that ’s just the tip of the Dutch cycling infrastructure iceberg .

BACKPACK BIKE
Folding bikes have been around for a while , regarded with anything from indifference to ridicule .
But thanks go Bergmönch , we ’re about to enter a whole new era of folding bike street cred .
The Technik folding bike is a slick , beautifully engineered technological marvel that folds into a rather regular - looking backpack weighing a measly 20 pounds .
It includes a helmet net and 12 liters worth of storage space for other stuff you may choose to lug around .
Best part :
It takes less than two minutes to go from backpack to downhill cruising .

Few of us suspect just how broad and diverse the bike - centric lifestyle really is .
Always the subculture explorer , PUMA recently partnered with bike - minded filmmaker Daniel Leeb to release The I - Cycle Film Series — five wonderful short films documenting the contributions of five different influencers to bike culture .
Each film explores a different passion for the two - wheel lifestyle , from the artistically driven to the socially conscious to the urban-utilitarian .
Featured in the series are Matthew McGuinness , co-founder of Brooklyn - based art collective The 62 , George Bliss , mastermind of New York ’s Pedicabs , Brendt Barbur , founder of The Bicycle Film Festival , Matthew Modine , actor and founder of Bicycle - For - A - Day , and PUMA ’s own CMO , Antonio Bertone .

LIGHT LANE
Even in the most bike - friendly of cities , there are never enough bike lanes .
Their scarcity is as dangerous as it is annoying — with nearly 1,000 people dying in bike accidents each year and over 40,000 getting injured , alleviation is desperately needed .
Luckily , the smart design folk at Altitude came up with LightLane — a brilliant concept that equips bikes with a set of lights , which project a moving bike lane a few feet in front of and behind the cyclist .
And while there ’s no prototype yet , the idea is simply too good to perish — so get ready to roam the city from the safety of your own private bike lane while enjoying the bewildered looks of drivers and pedestrians alike .

Music is the language of the soul .
We have had music for centuries but now more than ever music is one the biggest entertaining sources in the world .
We have great musicians all over the globe .
Most of the famous ones come out of the United States but depending on your likes a lot of them come from other countries .
Many musicians become one hit wonders which means that they were only able to produce one song that was a hit but they never did much more .
A perfect example of a musician like that would be Vanilla Ice .
モーニングアフターピル
モーニングアフターピルにはアイピルやノルレボなどの商品が挙げられます。
アイピルやノルレボなどのモーニングアフターピルは避妊に失敗した際、性行為の後に服用するタイプの避妊薬です。
所謂緊急避妊薬で前もって準備する必要もありませんし、非常に高い効果があるため、コンドームが破れてしまったなど急な事態にも対応できます。
処方してもらう方法は簡単で、性行為があってからできるだけ早くに医療機関を受診します。
緊急避妊薬を扱っているのは婦人科や産婦人科など、医療機関によってはホームページ上にその詳細が明記されています。
アイピルやノルレボのような緊急避妊薬は性行為からの経過時間が短ければ短いほどその効果が高くなるという特徴があります。
そのため、望まぬ妊娠を避けたいというのであればできるだけ早めの行動が鍵となります。
アイピルやノルレボなどのモーニングアフターピルも低用量ピルと同様にホルモン分泌を促すことでその避妊効果を高めていきます。
緊急避妊薬の場合、低用量ピルとは仕組みが違い強制的に生理を促していくのが特徴です。
ただ、そのホルモン分泌を促す期間が非常に短期間であるため人によっては一時的に気分が悪くなってしまうこともあり、注意が必要です。
トリキュラーなどの低用量ピルの飲み忘れを避けることはもちろんですが、アイピルやノルレボなどのモーニングアフターピルを服用する際にも最低限の注意事項を押さえておくようにしましょう。
体の中から望まぬ妊娠を避けるピル
低用量ピルなどの医薬品はもちろんのこと、モーニングアフターピルも体の中からより強力な形で望まぬ妊娠を避けることが出来ます。
性行為に対して慎重になることはもちろんですが、妊娠という形で女性の人生が大きく左右されることを考えるととても大切なことです。
医薬品を使用するとなると不安に感じる人も中にはいるでしょうが、それはあくまで医師の処方によるものです。
何かしらの諸症状が出てもすぐに主治医による治療を受けることが出来る、これが医療機関で処方される医薬品で避妊を続けるメリットとなります。
安全な形でより確実に避妊をというのであればピルの他にも道具を併用する必要がありますが、緊急避妊薬や低用量ピル、うまく使い分けて女性の体を守っていくことも時には大切になってきます。
When George Bush , with his malapropisms and Homer Simpson gaffes , finally leaves the White House , the satire industry will briefly join the rest of the economy in recession
IT WAS Lenny Bruce who said that after Kennedy was shot , they dug two graves at Lexington Cemetery – one for Kennedy , the other for Vaughn Meader .
Who was Vaughn Meader ?
Well , that ’s the point .
He was the leading Kennedy impersonator of the day .
Who remembers him now ?
When George Bush finally leaves the White House , the satire industry will briefly join the rest of the economy in recession .
It will certainly be the end of an era .
The Americans pronounce that “ error ” .
You could say that Bush ’s departure will mark the end of one of the greatest eras in US presidential history .
We forget that he was n’t meant to happen .
Fate chose the wrong brother , and the US Supreme Court did the rest .
It was Karl Marx who said history repeats itself , first as tragedy , then as farce .
Bush managed to do both simultaneously .
On the way , he provided rich pickings for mimics and comedians the world over .
It was like shooting fish in a barrel : hunch the shoulders , push out the elbows , pout like a chimp , look confused and talk .
In small sentences .
Using words like “ folks ” .
It was enough to get audiences laughing , prime them for anything satirical that followed .
“ They said there was no link between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
There is now . ”
“ I have a message for those suicide bombers .
We ’re gonna find you . ”
He was his own worst enemy , his own best satirist , so much so that it was hard to keep up with him .
Bush had many of the tools of the clown ’s armoury : funny walk , air of innocence and comedy props .
He was capable of anything .
Or was that “ incapable ” ?
Just when you thought he could n’t get any better , he did n’t .
But it was Bush who had the last laugh : a full eight years in charge of the world ’s biggest military machine ( unless you count the Chinese and , as Bush will tell you , they ’re only made out of terracotta .
Just think !
Another four years and we could have seen a war on terracotta ! ) .
His term was bookended by two of the most momentous crises to hit the country : 9/11 and the financial crisis that began in 2007 .
He ’s certainly left his mark in Iraq , in the ozone layer , on Wall Street .
He inherited a budget surplus of $ 128 billion in 2001 .
The forecast for 2009 is a $ 482 billion deficit .
That takes some doing .
Similarly , to turn the empathy felt for the US in 2001 into suspicion and hostility in many parts of the Arab world was also quite an achievement .
It ’s too easy to dwell on the gaffes , the malapropisms , the Homer Simpson bits .
But that ’s to misunderestimate him .
He was in many ways a Trojan horse .
Apart from the obvious similarities – woodenness , apparent innocuousness , hollow head – he was the perfect vehicle for the cohort of neocons who took over .
Overshadowed intellectually by Clinton , Blair must have thought he had it in the bag when Bush came to power .
How wrong he was .
So , will Obamamania give way to Baracknophobia ?
Time will tell .
My first thought on his acceptance speech was : one small step for man , one more hour in make - up .

NEW YORK -- Next up at No. 1 , Alabama .
The Crimson Tide became the fifth team this season to sit atop the AP Top 25 , moving up a spot Sunday after previously top - ranked Texas was toppled by Texas Tech .
The Red Raiders , who scored a touchdown with a second left at home to beat the Longhorns 39 - 33 Saturday night , jumped four spots and past No. 3 Penn State to No. 2 . The unbeaten Nittany Lions were idle .
No .
4 Florida moved up one place after its 49 - 10 rout of Georgia and Texas dropped four spots to No. 5 .
The Crimson Tide , which beat Arkansas State 35 - 0 , received 46 of a possible 65 first - place votes from the media panel and 1,600 points .
Texas
Tech got 12 first - place votes and 1,528 points and Penn State had six and 1,525 .
The Gators received the other No. 1 vote .
The top spot in the poll has n't been held by this many teams since 1990 , when Miami , Notre Dame , Colorado , Michigan and Virginia all had a turn at No 1 .
Georgia started this season No. 1 and was replaced by Southern California after the opening week .
USC lasted four weeks before being upset by Oregon State and Oklahoma took the top spot .
The Sooners were No. 1 for two weeks , then lost to Texas , which held the top spot for three weeks .
Now it 's Alabama 's turn .
The Crimson Tide has n't been No. 1 since finishing that way after the 1992 season , when coach Gene Stallings , quarterback Jay Barker and a ferocious defense won the last of the Tide 's six AP national championships .
Alabama 's first game as a No. 1 team since Oct. , 27 , 1980 , will be Saturday at LSU , a date that was one of the most anticipated in the Southeastern Conference even before this season .
Tide coach Nick Saban will be coaching in Baton Rouge , La. , for the first time since he left the Tigers for the NFL after the 2004 season .
Saban led LSU to a BCS national title in 2003 .
So the Tide , with its new lofty status , will face a stiff test immediately .
Same goes for Texas Tech , which had never been ranked higher than No. 5 . The Red Raiders host No. 8 Oklahoma State on Saturday , then have a week off before a road trip to No. 6 Oklahoma .
Penn State next plays at Iowa .
Seven ranked teams lost last weekend , most from the lower half of the rankings , so the back end of the Top 25 got a shake - up , too .
Southern California is No. 7 , and the final two spots in the top 10 are held by potential BCS Busters -- No. 9 Boise State of the Western Athletic Conference and No. 10 Utah , which hosts Mountain West Conference rival and No. 11 TCU in a Thursday night game that could decide the league title .
Ohio State is No. 12 , followed by Missouri , Georgia and LSU .
No .
16 Ball State is the lowest ranked of the six remaining unbeaten major college teams in the country .
The Cardinals of the Mid-American Conference play Wednesday night against Northern Illinois .
No .
17 BYU , Michigan State , North Carolina and West Virginia , back in the rankings after falling out in mid-September , complete the top 20 .
No. 21 California , No. 22 Georgia Tech and No. 25 Pittsburgh re-entered the rankings .
Maryland is No. 23 and No. 24 Florida State dropped eight spots after losing at Georgia Tech .
Falling out of the Top 25 were Minnesota , Tulsa , Oregon and South Florida .
The wobbly video shows a group of adults mulling inside Chuck E. Cheese 's restaurant in Susquehanna Twp .
Suddenly it pans left and captures a fight breaking out .
The 22 - second clip , uploaded Sunday to YouTube , is the latest example of what police describe as a disturbing and bizarre crime trend :
escalating violence among adults
at a place designed for children 's birthday parties .
Susquehanna Township police have been called to the restaurant on Union Deposit Road 12 times in the past year for reports of disorderly conduct , assault and theft .
Those calls have resulted in 13 arrests , including six women -- five adults and a juvenile -- charged with disorderly conduct in a Saturday - night brawl .
In 2007 , police responded to the restaurant 18 times for similar offenses .
" It 's madness , absolute madness , " Susquehanna Twp. Police Chief Robert A. Martin said .
Martin said he believes much of the violence stems from ongoing disputes among people who bump into each other in the restaurant .
" They see each other at Chuck E. Cheese , and before you know it an argument turns into something physical . "
The assaults also could be attributed to separated or divorced parents who attend a child 's birthday party , he said .
Such was the case in an April 4 incident , when police accused a man of slapping his estranged wife in the head at their child 's party .
The violence at Chuck E. Cheese 's is n't isolated to the Susquehanna Township restaurant .
Last month , the Wall Street Journal published an article about a growing number of adult melees at locations in Brookfield , Wisc. ; Topeka , Kan. ; Toledo , Ohio ; and Flint , Mich .
The number of calls at the Susquehanna Township location increased from 11 in 2005 and nine in 2006 , Martin said .
In late March , police broke up a fight involving 20 people .
Other Chuck E .
Cheese restaurants in central Pennsylvania have had similar problems .
At the Manheim Twp. restaurant in Lancaster County , a man was arrested March 20 after police said he ran around the restaurant spitting and yelling he had hepatitis C. A week earlier , a 17 - year - old Warwick Twp. girl was walking to her car in the parking lot when a man walked up behind her , grabbed her and tried to drag her away , police said .
No one has been arrested in that incident .
A call to CEC Entertainment , Inc. , which runs Chuck E. Cheese , was referred to the company 's legal department in Irvine , Texas .
Messages left Tuesday morning and afternoon were not returned .
In April , a company spokeswoman told The Patriot - News all the restaurants have security cameras to help ensure peace of mind for customers and the restaurants ' workers who dress as the Chuck E. Cheese mouse mascot .
" As in our other urban , high - density locations , we rely on the local authorities and their advice to control situations such as the ones we have experienced in Harrisburg , " spokeswoman Brenda Holloway said .
Incidents reported by police at the Susquehanna Township Chuck E Cheese in the past year :
Jan. 19 , 2007 : Theft of cell phone
Feb .
16 : Domestic dispute
Feb .
19 : Domestic assault ; one arrested
Feb . 26 : Assault
March 22 : Disorderly conduct ; one arrested
March 29 : Disorderly conduct ; two arrested
April 2 : Disorderly conduct
April 4 : Domestic assault ; one arrested
May 10 : Disorderly conduct ; one arrested
Sept. 9 : Theft , assault .
Oct. 3 : Domestic assault , simple assault ; one arrested

BBC Nepali Service
The Himalayas provide Nepal with fast flowing rivers , ideal for hydropower Just when switching over to clean energy to fight climate change has become a global mantra , water - rich Nepal appears to be heading in the opposite direction , changing from renewable to dirty energy .
To deal with crippling power cuts that last two thirds of a day , the government has declared a national power crisis , and announced a plan to install a series of generators of up to 200 megawatts ( MW ) .
They will run on diesel , a fossil fuel that emits the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
Officials at the Water Resources Ministry , responsible for power supplies , said there were talks about importing the generation plants from China , which reportedly had many of them spare after hosting last year 's Olympics .
" The government may consider other options of suppliers as well , " said Anup Upadhyay , the ministry 's joint secretary .
" What is important is we will have to get thermal plants to immediately address the load shedding , it 's a compulsion . "
Quick fix
Having been hit hard by the power cuts , the private manufacturing sector is also stressing the need for businesses to install their own electricity generators .
Most of these will again be equipment run on diesel .
Some factories already have diesel powered generators , with a total installed capacity of about 15 MW , and the government wants them to install even more .
People have been protesting about the 16 - hour daily power cuts " With such increase and additional new plants in private factories , we may be able to add about 30 MW to the national grid , " Mr Upadhyay suggested .
Traditionally , Nepal is not known for generating electricity using fossil fuels .
With more than 6,000 rivers and rivulets gushing down the Himalayan foothills , snaking through the country 's rugged topography , there is the potential to generate tens of thousands of megawatts .
To date , only a small percentage of the potential hydro- electricity generation capacity has been tapped , providing electricity to less than 40 % of Nepal 's population .
However , the nation - until now - has stuck to hydropower over the years , maintaining a clean energy track record .
In 2007 , it won the prestigious Ashden Award for replacing diesel powered mills with water - powered ones .
Two years earlier , it won another Ashden Award for a scheme that used cow dung to generate electricity .
The bio - gas project had even been able to sell surplus carbon credits to the World Bank under the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) of the UN's Kyoto Protocol .
Although the Nepalese have the biggest electricity bills in the region , the government continued to promote hydropower .
But all that is changing now , as demand for electricity quickly outstrips supply .
The huge costs of developing hydropower , coupled with political wrangles and alleged mismanagement , has made matters worse .
Low water levels in rivers during the dry season has also meant that generation capacities of hydro - plants have halved .
Warning signs
It is not the first time that Nepal has experienced electricity shortages , but this year 's 16 - hour outages each day have been painfully long .
And it appears as if there is no respite in sight .
The state - owned Nepal Electricity Authority and international aid agencies has been projecting for a number of years that demand was set to outstrip supply .
So why was nothing done ?
The decision by the government to bring in 200MW of diesel generation is indeed a step backwards
Biksh Pandey ,
Energy analyst
There appears to be a host of reasons , ranging from local , to national and international circumstances .
Major large hydroelectric project partnerships with India , agreed years ago , have never moved off the drawing board .
And the medium to small - scale projects that Nepal planned to construct itself either failed to happen or were severely delayed by the 10 - year Maoist insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead .
During the insurgency , the Maoists were repeatedly accused of disrupting the construction works .
Today 's government , which the Maoists now lead , says the present problems are the result of not doing anything in the past .
Declaring the national power crisis recently , it brought out a work plan consisting of emergency , short and long - term measures .
Installation of the diesel - powered plants was considered to be part of the emergency work plan .
But energy experts say this approach is wrong , especially for a nation with access to so much potential hydropower .
" The decision by the government to bring in 200MW of diesel generation is indeed a step backwards , " says Biksh Pandey , a director of Winrock International , a clean energy specialist organisation .
" While the world is moving from dirty to clean energy , Nepal would be going in the other direction . "
Criticism from a number of areas led to speculation that the government might change its mind on the diesel decision .
But Water Resources Minister Bishnu Poudel did not give the impression of someone about to change their mind .
" After the last announcement of the measures to deal with load shedding , we have not made any new decision , " he told the BBC .
This suggests that the government is sticking to its plans ; one of which is to switch from renewable energy sources to a growing dependence on fossil fuels .

I 'm sorry -- you still look like a fucking kid , and the government of British Columbia says that fucking kids are n't supposed to be drinking so that 's why I 've IDed you .
What -- do you think that it 's OBVIOUS you 've just turned 19 and I should just be able to tell ?
Well , sorry , I can't .
So do n't roll your eyes at me and sigh heavily when you reach for your cards .
My job is on the line .
Why can't you believe it ?
That 's what my bosses tell me to ask for , so I ask for it .
It 's plastered everywhere : right when you walk in , on drink displays , and at every cash register .
So , yes , I want TWO pieces of ID .
No , your gym membership is not government ID !
GODDAMMIT DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME .
What are you , some kind of serial environmental offender ?
What really kills me are the assholes who buy a PLASTIC bottle ( virtually unbreakable ) , then want the plastic bottle in a paper bag , then want the plastic bottle in a paper bag in a plastic bag , then want a double plastic bag for their plastic bottle in a paper bag in a plastic bag .
The best is when people catch me giving them a sour look and they say , " I 'm taking the bus . "
Really .
Does that make it better ?
Smiling is n't in my job description .
The line up is HUGE .
I 'm just putting my head down and trying to plow down as MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IN AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE SO YOU CAN ALL GO HOME AND DRINK FASTER .
Speed requires concentration ; when I concentrate I do n't smile , so do n't ask me to fucking smile when I 'm already trying to be as fast as possible for you .
Generally happens about once or twice a busy weekend -- someone hammered ( or weird ) comes in and really wants to touch my hair .
I know my hair tends to look fabulous , but just because I 'm within arm 's reach does n't give you the right to maul my locks .
Look , compliment , but do n't touch !
Chewing gum , too .
Okay --
I can accept that being irritated by chewing gum is a problem that I ought to keep to myself , but cell phones ?
Now that I 've worked as a cashier I understand how intensely rude it is to be on your cell while going through the checkout .
Just get off that damned cancer pod you 've got glued to your ear and provide a little respect to the cashier .
Once I had a lady refuse to acknowledge me because she was yakking on her cell , but then had the nerve to exclaim , " I just guess they do n't do anything around here anymore ! " when I pretended not to hear her asking for a bag .
Okay -- so you wanna check your receipt because you seem to believe that I have incorrectly rung up ONE OR TWO ITEMS .
But move on -- do n't stand in the way of the next customer and , seriously , does it take a full 30 seconds of INTENSE FOCUS to understand your receipt ?
You 're clearly an idiot , so get out already !
Being able to hear your idiot babble all the way from the other side of the store means that you 're being too damned loud .
I feel sorry for all the people within 30 feet of you , let alone 100 .
Groups like this generally have me bolting for the warehouse .
Oh , you own a restaurant ?
It 's ever - so - popular , is it ?
Well , my !
I 'm sorry I did n't know who you were right away , because clearly you 're VERY IMPORTANT because you own a restaurant .
Now I have to ring the WHOLE THING through again because you did n't have the foresight to tell me who you were .
Sorry for wasting your VERY IMPORTANT time .
Listen , buddy , that 72 cents of change you really wanna hand me while staring deep into my eyes does not impress .
I 'm not allowed to accept tips anyways .
So do n't try to tip me -- I do n't like it , I have to say no , it 's awkward .
No , you can not have my number because you gave me 72 cents .
Ugh , yeah , back to the ID thing .
Listen --
I 'm sorry you 're 30 - something and you do n't look under 19 anymore .
Really , I think people are beautiful at all ages .
Do n't worry about it !
Just be gorgeous the way you are .
But I still do n't need to see your ID , so please stop shoving it at me .
It just makes you look really desperate , especially in front of your friends .----------------------------Anyways , do n't get me wrong -- there are a great many things I love about my job .
It pays well , my coworkers are pretty colourful , and the job tends to protect my safety and human dignity pretty damned well .
When it 's notthen it 's a dream job .
There 's even a great many kinds of customers that I do love -- I just love bitching about the ones I hate more . :P
Young women with high levels of oestrogen may be more likely to love ’em and leave ’em ( Image : Nick Cunard / PYMCA / Rex Features )
Women with high levels of oestrogen may adopt a simple relationship strategy more often associated with men : love ’em and leave ’em .
New research suggests that young women who produce naturally high levels of an oestrogen compound linked to fertility are more prone to hop from man to man , as well as cheat on their current partner .
They also see themselves as more attractive than other women .
“ These women are willing to trade up when the opportunity arises and continue to extract these lucrative resources from men when they can , ” says Kristina Durante , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Texas in Austin , who led the study .
She thinks the behaviour could be an adaptation to the high costs of giving birth .

“ For women it ’s all about the resources that we need .
If you ’re going to be getting knocked up there ’s a significant cost , ” she says .
Previous research had shown that women who produce high levels of an oestrogen hormone called oestradiol are perceived as more attractive and mother more children than women with lower amounts of the sex hormone .
Oestradiol levels also wax and wane across a woman ’s ovulatory cycle – generally corresponding to fertility and interest in sex , Durante says .
Attractiveness advantage
To rule out the effect of these monthly fluctuations , Durante and colleague Norman Li measured the hormone in 52 female university students at two points in the cycle , representing a woman ’s baseline level of the hormone .
The researchers also asked the students , who averaged 19 years and five months , to rate their own attractiveness and fill out a survey that gauged their propensity to cheat on a partner by flirting , kissing , dating , having sex , or maintaining a serious affair .
High oestradiol levels corresponded to higher self - attractiveness ratings .
As independent confirmation , a panel of two men and seven women also judged them the prettiest .
High oestradiol women reported that they had dated more men and were more willing to cheat , from innocent flirts to serious affairs .
These women , however , proved no more interested in one - night stands than women with lower levels of oestradiol .
“ Highly attractive women can get the Brad Pitts to be long - term partners , not just the one - night stand , ” Durante says .
Unneeded hunks ?
Behaviour associated with high oestradiol levels could have evolved when women were more dependent on men to support them through childbirth and child - rearing .
Most modern women , she says , rely less on male support for food , shelter , and other resources , than their ancestors .
But these deep psychological inclinations linger , modified by modern environments .
Take actress Angelina Jolie , an attractive woman more than capable of supporting her self and a fast - growing family .
“ She does n’t need Brad Pitt long term , but she still faces these same preferences , ” Durante says .
Grażyna Jasieńska , a psychologist at Jagiellonian University of Krakow , Poland , notes that oestradiol levels tend to fall when women lose weight , exercise regularly , and age .
The study only looked at younger women , so “ it would be interesting to see if this [ longer - term ] variation in oestradiol corresponds to variation in behaviour , ” she says .

[ This is part 2 of my live blog of this book ]
How strange this " intellectual property " issue is .
In normal life , we tend to ( or should ) credit enterprise and markets for most innovations that surround us .
I 'm typing on a system here that includes products for several dozens different creative companies , with hardware and software and applications of all sorts stitched together through some miracle we call the coordinative power of the market .
No news in that , I suppose .
Ho hum .
But let the subject of IP come up , and most people will say that we only have this stuff thanks to IP .
Think of the shift here .
On the one hand , we credit markets .
On the other hand , we credit monopoly .
Both can't be true .
Or if both are true , we have a serious theoretical tangle to unravel .
So which is true ?
This is the topic addressed in the second chapter of Boldine and Levine 's Against Intellectual Monopoly .
They begin by observing that " virtually none of the innovations " in the digital industry of computers " took place with the protection of intellectual monopoly . "
Before 1981 it was not possible to patent or copyright software .
The craze to patent every mouse click began only following a 1994 court ruling ( In re Alappat ) .
Meanwhile , the underlying guts of all that you see began long before .
As with all genuine economic revolutions , the foundation of end - user consumption was decades in preparation .
The compilers , assemblers , linked listed , databases , search algorithms , displays , languages , word processing : all began long before the age of software patents or copyrights .
Let 's see how this works .
Property rights are protected .
Trade is free .
People made useful stuff .
People bought stuff and used it .
They imitated and emulated each other and improved things step by step through investment , profit , and re-investment .
That 's all .
All development since this great age of innovation that preceding software IP has built on this foundation of open - source material .
Bill Gates : " If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today 's ideas were invented , and had taken out patents , the industry would be at a complete standstill today . "
The authors comment on the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy : " Intellectual monopoly is not a cause of innovation , but rather an unwelcome consequence of it . "
How so ?
Young industries do amazing things and get a foothold in the market .
Then even better folks come along with better ideas .
The old guys panic , and turn to government for protection .
The industry freezes in place .
It is the oldest pattern .
Thus did Microsoft make no effort to protect its IP in the early days ; it begged for attention and encouraged widespread use and copying .
When it saw a threat from newcomers , matters changed .
There has n't been that much innovation in operating systems since 1994 .
There has been innovation in web browsing , but where did the web browser come from ?
It bought it from a creative company in 1993 , before there were software patents .
Imagine how a patent in web browsing would have set back the entire industry !
The losses would have been incalculable .
We can see here that the authors are holding up the computer industry as a model for how things work in a free market .
And a super strong case for their position is the open - source software movement , which is a main fuel behind the development we see today .
Firms relinquish monopoly to assure longevity in the industry : others can pick up their designs and develop them .
This helps build their market .
In any case , we all depend on open - source software every day if we use Google : it runs Linux , an open - source OS .
There are many others .
Indeed , open source dominates the web completely .
Some 70 % of servers online today run Apache .
But how can they make money ?
The authors tell the story of Red Hat .
It is open source .
It has plenty of competitors who offer the exact same product .
But because of brand name , Red Hat is still marketable and has more staying power .
As B &L say " If you had a problem with software you bought , and had to call the seller for advice - who would you prefer to call - the people who wrote the program , or the people who copied it ? "
Thus does Red Hat profit and their many competitors come and go , come again and go again .
The authors effortlessly segue from software to books , and here is the part that especially interests me .
They provide an alternative explanation for why British literature was so widely circulated in the United States in the 19th century .
American publishers could publish without copyright -- there were no international copyright agreements -- and there was massively competition .
It was so intense that American firms would pay authors directly for sending chapters even before they appear in Britain .
The amounts they would receive even exceed their British royalties over a period of years .
As a result , there was huge dissemination of knowledge .
And the prices were low : Dickens 's A Christmas Carol sold for $.06 in the US and $ 2.50 in England .
And printing technology improved .
Literacy improved .
Ideas spread .
Children and schools could have books , which in turn increased the demand for books , and spurred on new investment and technological improvements .
It was a dynamic and wild world of publishing , comparable to what we see with the web today .
But could it work in modern times ?
Look at government documents , which are always and everywhere in the public domain ( unless they are secret ) .
The 9 - 11 report of 2004 was a huge bestseller , comparable to the first Harry Potter in sales volume .
Norton even negotiated a deal with the government to release a paperback on the day of release , and it was also available for free download .
Why would they do this ?
The same reason all entrepreneurs do what they do : to be the first to market .
Meanwhile , anyone on the planet could publish it a day later .
Still , Norton turned a massive profit .
Another fascinating section concerns the newspaper industry .
It began without patent protection .
Benjamin Day started the New York Sun and his technology was open source : he collected advertising to pay the costs and recruited young boys to sell it .
Anyone could do it .
But the point is that he did it first and made lots of money .
He was first and he was innovative .
That 's the key to success .
It was a massively costly undertaking !
Why was n't he driven of business by piracy ?
The RIAA claim constantly that a free market can't work because pirate will go straight to the most profitable production ends and steal them .
But the authors ask us to think about this carefully .
How do we know what is profitable ?
We have to let the market work .
You can't know in advance .
And once a line of production is profitable , it is too late : the player has market dominance , and all the advantages that come with that .
They ask us to try this yourself : try ruining a pop star by pirating song only once you are certain they are big hits .
Back up and consider the history of IP .
It is a modern invention , whereas music and literature appeared at the dawn of civilization .
Music and literature and art thrived for many centuries before IP .
The authors do n't go into it , but just imagine if the invention of the musical staff had been copyrighted and patented by the monk Guido d'Arezzo who invented it .
Progress would have been set back by a century !
The first signs of IP appeared after the invention of the printing press .
Governments used it to suppress political dissent ( I suspect that the religion wars had something to do with this ) .
It was a royal mercantilist privilege confer on printers , same as it was conferred on tea , tin , cotton , banking , or any other good .
In the day , it seemed reasonable .
The ruler wanted to control goods and producers want guarantees .
Everyone wins , right ?
Except that there is no competition , no market process , and hence there is stasis .
Mercantilism was refuted by economists and free market emerged and history was changed .
What happened to IP in the age when mercantilism was being repealed ?
It was not abolished but transferred from kings to producers : the exclusive right to produce was granted to private owners who became responsible for enforcement under the cover of law .
This was a huge mistake in the liberal revolution of the 18th century , an inconsistency that continues to haunt us .
This section on IP history should be mandatory reading !
Next in this chapter : a short section on the history of sheet music .
Did you know that the industry leader in sheet music -- Francis , Day & Hunter - - got its start in mass piracy ?
Fascinating .
The war on cheap sheet music is comparable to the war on pirates today .
It did n't work , thank goodness .
We conclude this chapter with a long and interesting section on the dynamic hugely profitable industry of porn .
You wince .
Of course .
So does the state .
Copyright protection is nearly unavailable here for reasons that are obvious .
It is a legitimate subject for investigation from an economic perspective .
This open - source industry is massive and growing , orderly and profitable and technologically innovative .
How tragic that IP has created a situation in which we have to look to the seedier side of life to see how truly free markets work .
Patrick Swayze has checked into a hospital .
The actor who has battled pancreatic cancer has pneumonia and he checked in for observation .
Bob DeBitetto , the president and general manager of A&E , told sources :
“ He ’s still fighting ’
“ Patrick is undergoing treatment and he ’s still fighting , ” a source close to the star tells PEOPLE Magazine .
“ He felt so bad that he could n’t be at the TCAs .
He ’s fighting and doing well , and that ’s all anybody can hope for at this stage .
He is not at death ’s door .
Nobody ever knows with cancer , but he ’s doing alright .
As soon as he ’s out , he ’s going to try to reschedule as much as he can . ”
During a recent interview with Barbara Walters Swayze talked about battling cancer told her his road had been difficult “ You can bet that I ’m going through hell , ” the 56 year - old actor said .
“ And I ’ve only seen the beginning of it . ”
The announcement that he had been diagnosed came last March and it has taken a huge emotional toll .
Swayze said : “ There ’s a lot of fear here , Yeah , I ’m scared .
Yeah , I ’m angry .

Oakland , CA – The Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) raided a medical marijuana dispensary today in South Lake Tahoe , California , in the first days of the new Obama Administration .
Even though President Barack Obama had made repeated promises during his election campaign to end federal raids in medical marijuana states , many high - ranking Bush Administration officials have yet to leave office .
For example , still at the helm of the DEA is acting Administrator Michele Leonhart , who has been responsible for numerous federal raids in California , following in the footsteps of her predecessor Karen Tandy .
Neither Eric Holder , President Obama ’s pick for U.S. Attorney General , nor a new DEA Administrator , have taken office yet .
“ Whether or not this unconscionable raid on a medical marijuana provider is the fault of federal officials from the previous administration , President Obama has an opportunity to change this harmful and outdated policy , ” said Caren Woodson , Director of Government Affairs for Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) .
“ We are hopeful that these are the last remnants of the Bush regime and that President Obama will quickly develop a more compassionate policy toward our most vulnerable citizens . ”
Medical marijuana and an unknown amount of cash was seized during the raid today from Holistic Solutions , but no arrests were made .
This first DEA raid under the new Obama Administration is another example of more than 100 raids on medical marijuana providers that have occurred in California over the past two years .
While the greatest federal enforcement has occurred in California , the DEA has been active in other states as well .
Federal agents raided the Washington State offices of a medical marijuana advocacy group that was supplying starter plants to hundreds of authorized patients .
In Oregon , a federal grand jury was used by the DEA to obtain the medical records of several patients , an effort that was later rejected by a federal court .
The DEA also went as far as to threaten New Mexico officials for planning to implement that states medical marijuana distribution program .
“ I would not have the Justice Department prosecuting and raiding medical marijuana users , ” Senator Obama said in an August 2007 statement .
“ It ’s not a good use of our resources , ” he continued .
This statement was followed up by Obama in other public events in the run up to the election .
“ President Obama must rise to the occasion by quickly correcting this problem and by keeping the promise he made to the voters of this country , ” said Woodson .
ASA has been working with the new Administration on changing federal law around medical marijuana , which has included providing a comprehensive set of policy recommendations .

If he was neutered recently it is possible he is still feeling some discomfort from the procedure .
If this is the case contact your veterinarian for pain management options .
For several days after visiting a veterinary hospital cats can be grumpy but do not associate procedures done at the clinic with their owners long term .
They may associate the procedure with the clinic itself .
We need to be careful not to put too much human emotion and reasoning skills on pets .
They are smarter than many give them credit for but there is a limit .
You should not feel guilty for having your cat neutered and being a responsible pet owner .
If he was not neutered recently have him examined by a veterinarian .
There may be a medical cause for this behavior .
Again he may be in pain perhaps from a cat fight , abscess , or trauma he experienced while outside .
He is a little young for certain diseases ( like hyperthyroidism ) that can lead to behavior changes .
Think about his environment and see if you can figure out if anything has changed .
Also think about his daily routine to see if this has been interrupted .
If there is a behavioral cause your veterinarian can work with you on behavior modifying techniques and prescribe behavioral modifying medication if appropriate .
Almost four years ago , I noted that a Michigan law , the effect of which was to essentially ban mail - order wine to in - state residents from out - of - state vendors , had been struck down .
The special interests were , of course , Michigan ’s vinyards — heaven forbid they have to compete with California , and Michigan ’s alcohol distributors — heaven forbid someone challenge their brontosaur of a business model .
All was well and good , apparently , until yesterday , when in the interest of preserving “ fairness ” , the Governor signed House Bill 6644 , which by amending Section 436.1203 of Public Act 58 of 1998
[ P] prohibits stores from sending wine directly to customers .
The wine law comes after a federal court ruling saying Michigan ’s old law was unfair to out - of - state stores .
The law was , as are most laws governing commerce between “ free ” individuals , about protecting vested special interests .
In this case , Michigan ’s liquor control board , and their three - tiered distribution model .
Now , if your local liquor distributor does n’t stock that particular label from Napa that you love , you ’re out of luck , without recourse .
Now , if your local liquor distributor does n’t stock that particular label from Traverse City ( MI ) that you love , you ’re out of luck .
That is , unless a road trip to Napa ( CA ) or Traverse City ( MI ) is in your future .
The Supreme Court ruling which struck down the previous law on account of it being “ unfair ” to out - of - state producers was only half right , and because it was only half right , it was wrong enough to be challenged .
Now , the State will prevent Michigan residents from buying any liquor , from any producer , in any State via mail order .
But hey , it ’s fair , right ?
A correct ruling would ’ve also noted that the old law was also “ unfair ” to consumers , because there was not then , nor is there now , a compelling reason for the government to prevent grown men and women , from purchasing a particular brand of beer or wine merely on the basis of where it happens to have been produced , distilled or bottled .
A model crowned the Face of Asia has fallen 150 ft to her death from a luxury block of flats in Greater Manchester after finding out her boyfriend was married with a child .
Sahar Daftary , 23 , a Londoner , fell from the 12th storey of the ultra- modern NV buildings in Salford Quays just before 10 pm on Saturday night .
Ms Daftary is thought to have visited the flat to collect her belongings after pulling out of a fashion show earlier in the day , claiming ill - health .
Friends said the model , who held a ceremony last year in which she publicly declared her love for her boyfriend , was distraught to discover subsequently that he was married with a child .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The boyfriend , a 33 - year - old property developer who has not been named , was arrested and questioned by police but has since been bailed .
Police investigating the cause of death are examining the content of a blog with Ms Daftary 's name in which two postings ruminate on the " journey of life 's ups and downs " .
The first posting , " Letting Go " , dated Thursday 13 November , is 522 words long .
In a confused tone it asks : " What is wrong with you that you hold on so tight to what is not there ? " , before declaring " Let go of the hope of maybe " .
It continues : " Look at the pain it has caused you , look at the dreams it has shattered " .
A second posting the following day , " Life Goes On " , is more positive .
In it the author says : " I myself was a person who carried too much luggage , " but later implores : " Let go of the past and stop staring at the losses " .
It concludes with the uplifting message : " Fight it and you will come out on top ! " .
Both postings were written soon after Ms Daftary split from her boyfriend .
Ms Daftary , who won the Face of Asia competition last year , was in Manchester to appear at a catwalk show at an Indian restaurant on Stockport Road called Nawab , but left during the preparations .
A resident at the waterfront apartment block , who did not wish to be named , said : " We were out for the evening , and when we came back , the police had cordoned off part of the car park . "
Her friend , Afrah Sami , told The Manchester Evening News : " We are all ... devastated .
Sahar loved life and she was always at the centre of the party .
She met [ her boyfriend ] in Manchester and they were very happy .
Then she won the Face of Asia .
She seemed to have the world at her feet .
" But she discovered that he was married and became very unhappy .
The stress changed her and she had stopped eating properly .
When she came up on Saturday she was ... preoccupied with collecting her things from the apartment , but he did n't want to see her . "
A police source disclosed : " Witnesses have said there was no shouting or ranting – just a single scream .
It is being looked at as either a suicide or a horrible accident . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters .
The news from the world ’s largest software maker , which had not been expected to report results until after the close of trading on Thursday , sent shock waves across financial markets , pulling down the Nasdaq , and sending U.S. Treasury debt prices higher as investors sought safer assets .
Microsoft ’s shares dropped as much as 11 percent to their lowest level since January 1998 , adding to a 40 percent decline in the past year .
The company blamed the miss on the weak PC market and the popularity of low - cost netbook computers , which have combined to badly undercut sales of its Windows operating system .
“ Our financial position is solid ... but it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy , ” Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told employees in a letter .
“ Consumers and businesses have reined in spending , which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures . ”
The market has become so volatile , Microsoft cautioned , that it will not issue earnings or revenue forecasts for the rest of its fiscal year ending June 30 , 2009 -- other than to predict both will very likely be lower .
“ It is pretty bad when things are deteriorating so fast that even the largest companies in the world do n’t know how rapidly it is happening , ” said Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert .
Microsoft posted a profit of $ 4.17 billion , or 47 cents per share , in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31 , versus a profit of $ 4.71 billion , or 50 cents per share , a year earlier .
Analysts were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Revenue rose 2 percent to $ 16.63 billion , missing the average analyst forecast of $ 17.1 billion .
Sales in the Windows segment fell 8 percent , while its Business division , responsible for the Office software package , marked a 1 percent increase .
Revenue at the unit that makes the popular 360 Xbox gaming system rose 3 percent .
Looking ahead , the Windows business is expected to perform in line with the weak traditional PC market , Microsoft said .
BIGGEST JOB CUTS EVER
Microsoft ’s staggered elimination of 5,000 jobs -- 1,400 immediately and the rest over 18 months -- amounts to about 5 percent of its estimated 96,000 work force , the biggest reduction ever by the software maker .
Other cost cuts include travel and marketing budgets , and the roster of independent contractors .
“ Clearly business conditions are worse than people were expecting , ” said Richard Williams , analyst at Cross Research .
“ This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts .
Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it ’s sending a signal that the times are definitely changing . ”
The job cuts follow similar moves by other technology firms , including AT&T Inc , Dell Inc , Motorola Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc , all of which are suffering from the global economic slowdown .
Microsoft faces a shift by PC buyers to netbooks , which are smaller , stripped - down laptops .
Microsoft only gets $ 60 or less for each sale of Windows for a netbook , compared to $ 90 for traditional laptops , according to Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle .
Some netbooks also use the rival open - source Linux software instead of Windows .
On a conference call , Ballmer said Microsoft also lost market share to Apple Inc , which on Wednesday posted surprisingly strong results .
Ballmer , whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and gift for numbers , was serious in tone .

“ We are certainly in the midst of a once - in - a - lifetime set of economic conditions , ” Ballmer said , adding that the company is “ dealing with unprecedented ground . ”
As for the economy , Ballmer said he did not expect a quick rebound .
Still , Ballmer noted that Microsoft will be adding “ thousands of jobs ” in strategic areas like Internet search , where it has been lagging behind Google Inc , and that he still desires a search partnership with Yahoo Inc .
Ballmer said the result of the job cuts and additions would be an overall staff reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 positions .
But Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said he does not expect significant acquisitions this year , despite hopes from some Yahoo shareholders for a buyout .
Shares of Microsoft were down $ 2.13 at $ 17.25 , after touching an intraday low of $ 17.17 , the weakest level since January 1998 .
It was the biggest single - day drop in the stock since an 11.38 percent fall on April 28 , 2006 .

OPINION : Behind the cruel edifice of a wall around the birthplace of Jesus , an enclave of university students triumph in the face of adversity , writes John Kelly .
IT WAS late Friday afternoon and I was finishing up my week 's work in Bethlehem University when Brother Jack put his head round my door and shouted : " Hi John , every Friday a few of us go up to the wall - would you like to join us ? "
Conscious though I was of " the Wall " , the 70 km - long , eight - metre - high monstrosity that attempts to divide Palestine from Israel , I thought in my naivety he was referring to a local pub .
I said : " Sure , great , be right with you " , only to find that it was indeed the wall and we were there to say the rosary walking up and down past the Israeli armed guards at the main checkpoint leading to Jerusalem .
There were about 10 of us , a few De La Salle Brothers from Bethlehem University , some nuns from the Caritas Baby Hospital and a couple of locals , one of whom was an elderly lady whose lovely olive and lemon back garden had been cut in half and destroyed by the construction of the wall a few years before .
As we walked up and down saying the rosary , in full view of the Israeli guards , Jack hacked a bit off the wall with his crucifix and gave it to me .
I have it framed in my study .
The wall almost completely circumscribes the small town of Bethlehem and it has a number of checkpoints , each with Israeli armed guards .
It is impossible , for me at any rate , not to compare this situation with the Nazi's Warsaw Ghetto and second World War checkpoints .
As with the Jews in that terrible city of the early 1940s , the Palestinians are being treated like scum by the Israeli guards .
Bethlehem resembles a ghetto where the local population is not permitted by the Israeli authorities to leave by the main roads .
Illegal though it is by United Nations Charter and the International Bill of Human Rights , this is occupied territory , and it is a very hostile occupation .
The distance from Bethlehem to Jerusalem is some 10 km , but Palestinians must take a 26 km secondary dirt road passing through Israeli checkpoints which are often closed with no warning or explanation .
Palestinians in the West Bank are not permitted to enter Jerusalem without a date - and time - limited pass from the Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) - more often than not refused .
This has made the operation of the small but very courageous Bethlehem University very difficult .
Before this wall was built , the majority of students and staff lived outside the Bethlehem area , mostly in Jerusalem , Ramallah , Hebron - and yes , even Gaza .
While some of the staff have passes that allow them to travel on the more direct routes , most students do not .
In effect , the student population is now restricted to those living in Bethlehem , within the wall .
Likewise in Gaza , the Israeli authorities do not allow university students travel to universities in the EU and the USA where they have been accepted for postgraduate studies .
As a strategy for future peace and reconciliation , this makes no sense .
It is the students , more than any other sector of the Palestine communities , who are suffering with non-stop harassment and humiliation by Israeli checkpoint soldiers .
Palestinian student Rula ( 22 ) dreads the journey every day to and from Jerusalem .
She says : " Sometimes I can not concentrate in my lectures because I am . . . worried what the Israelis will do to me on my way home . "
For no reason , they often have to take off their shoes , have their laptop computers confiscated , undergo strip searches and be made wait hours , with no explanation , being sneered at .
Strangely , for us non-Arabs , these checkpoint guards are generally quite affable and send you on your way with " have a nice day " American - style .
Dr Hala al - Yamani , a professor in the faculty of education in Bethlehem University , says she has noticed a dramatic decline in her students ' concentration and motivation .
" When you are facing this sort of pressure or humiliation , your feelings towards yourself change and you feel worthless . "
Despite this ,
Dr al - Yamani says this year 's graduation of more than 530 Bethlehem University students proves they are strong and committed .
" Despite these troubles , they say 'hey , I want to do it and I will .
We 've got that power that nothing will stop us .
When you lose your home , and you lose your land , and you lose everything , you have to prove yourself and we do n't have any way other than by education ' . "
This is indeed a fine university , with the highest international academic standards and procedures .
Inside those walls there is a different world where the students , Christians , Muslims and those of no religion , live in harmony , shut out physically and spiritually from the harsh and cruel realities of the Israeli occupation outside .

The US war on drugs places great emphasis on arresting people for smoking marijuana .
Since 1990 , approximately 17 million Americans have been arrested on marijuana charges , a greater number than the entire populations of Alaska , Delaware , the District of Columbia , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont and Wyoming combined .
In 2010 , state and local law enforcement arrested 746,000 people for marijuana violations .
This is an increase of 800 percent since 1980 and the highest per capita in the world .
As has been the case throughout the 1990s , 2000 ’s and continues that the overwhelming majority of those charged with marijuana violations were for simple possession , around 88 % .
The remaining 12 % were for “ sale / manufacture ” , an FBI category which includes marijuana grown for personal use or purely medical purposes .
These new FBI statistics indicate that one marijuana smoker is arrested every 45 seconds in America .
Taken together , the total number of marijuana arrests for 2010 far exceeded the combined number of arrests for violent crimes , including murder , manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault .
Like most Americans , people who smoke marijuana also pay taxes , love and support their families , and work hard to make a better life for their children .
Suddenly they are arrested , jailed and treated like criminals solely because of their recreational drug of choice .
State agencies frequently step in and declare children of marijuana smokers to be “ in danger ” , and many children are placed into foster homes as a result .
This causes enormous pain , suffering and financial hardship for millions of American families .
It also engenders distrust and disrespect for the law and for the criminal justice system overall .
Responsible marijuana smokers present no threat or danger to America or its children , and there is no reason to treat them as criminals , or to take their children away .
As a society we need to find ways to discourage personal conduct of all kinds that is abusive or harmful to others .
Responsible marijuana smokers are not the problem and it is time to stop arresting them .
Once all the facts are known , it becomes clear that America ’s marijuana laws need reform .
Gao dressed and acted like a Silicon Valley moneyman rather than one from Wall Street — open - necked tattersall shirt , muted plaid jacket , dark slacks , scuffed walking shoes .
Rimless glasses .
His father was a Red Army officer who was on the Long March with Mao .
As a teenager during the Cultural Revolution , Gao worked on a railroad - building gang and in an ammunition factory .
He is 55 , fit - looking , with crew - cut hair and a jokey demeanor rather than an air of sternness .
His comments below are from our one on - the - record discussion , two weeks before the U.S. elections .
As I transcribed his words , I realized that many will look more astringent on the page than they sounded when coming from him .
In person , he seemed to be relying on shared experience in the United States — that is , his and mine — to entitle him to criticize the country the way its own people might .
The conversation was entirely in English .
Because Gao ’s answers tended to be long , I am not presenting them in straight Q&A form but instead grouping his comments about his main recurring themes .
Does America wonder who its new Chinese banking overlords might be ?
This is what one of the very most influential of them had to say about the world financial crisis , what is wrong with Wall Street , whether one still - poor country with tremendous internal needs could continue subsidizing a still - rich one , and how he thought America could adjust to its “ realistic ” place in the world .
My point for the moment is to convey what it is like to hear from such a man , rather than to expand upon , challenge , or agree with his stated views .
.....
About the financial crisis of 2008 , which eliminated hundreds of billions of dollars ’ worth of savings that the Chinese government had extracted from its people , through deliberately suppressed consumption levels :
We are not quite at the bottom yet .
Because we do n’t really know what ’s going to happen next .
Everyone is saying , “ Oh , look , the dollar is getting stronger ! ” [ As it was when we spoke . ]
I say , that ’s really temporary .
It ’s simply because a lot of people need to cash in , they need U.S. dollars in order to pay back their creditors .
But after a short while , the dollar may be going down again .
I ’d like to bet on that !
The overall financial situation in the U.S. is changing , and that ’s what we do n’t know about .
It ’s going to be changed fundamentally in many ways .
Think about the way we ’ve been living the past 30 years .
Thirty years ago , the leverage of the investment banks was like 4 - to - 1 , 5 - to - 1 . Today , it ’s 30 - to - 1 .
This is not just a change of numbers .
This is a change of fundamental thinking .
People , especially Americans , started believing that they can live on other people ’s money .
And more and more so .
First other people ’s money in your own country .
And then the savings rate comes down , and you start living on other people ’s money from outside .
At first it was the Japanese .
Now the Chinese and the Middle Easterners .
Deflation or stagflation in the Eurozone ?
Sylvester Eijffinger
Assessments of European price stability risks outright reversed in recent months .
1
Until summer 2008 , monetary policy was concerned with inflation pressures from surging commodity and energy prices .
Last month , facing possible recession , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) cut interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points .
Falling commodity prices and weak demand have eased inflation .
All major economic organisations found forecasting growth and inflation difficult and uncertain in 2008 .
While most observers expect both growth and inflation to significantly slow ( i.e. a traditional recession ) , some argue that we are on the brink of deflation , while others argue that stagflation could be the true concern in the medium to long run .
Obviously these views yield very different ECB policy recommendations .
In this column , I argue that inflation is a far greater risk than deflation and urge policymakers to recognise the option value of waiting in changing interest rates .
The danger of deflation is exaggerated
Deflation previously captured significant attention during the last global recession .
The 2003 deflation scare resulted from the belief that the negative output gap would push already - low rates of US ( core ) inflation into negative territory .
This year , the Wall Street Journal , International Herald Tribune , and The Times mentioned the term deflation 50 times in the first 20 days of November , by the Economist ’s count .
There have been many more mentions since , although most stories were referring to the US , not the Eurozone .
Any deflation danger is far from imminent , according to the authorities .
ECB President Jean - Claude Trichet and Executive Board Member Jürgen Stark have both indicated that the central bank does not see trends or signs of deflation arising in the Eurozone .
The ECB is happy with the easing of inflation , as it will allow central banks to lower interest rates and governments to apply fiscal stimulus measures .
OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria did not rule out all risk of deflation , but he said that the OECD does not see any major deflation risk at present .
Only some products and commodities have declining prices ; there is no general price decline .
Similarly , European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia attributed the drop in prices to oil , commodities , and the recession .
“ We have a labour market that is organised in such a way that makes it extremely , extremely difficult to go towards deflation , " he said .
Presumably , he refers to the Eurozone ’s higher degree of nominal and real wage rigidity , which is an important line of defence against deflation .
The recession should be mitigated by fiscal and monetary stimuli , and Almunia foresees a return to growth in the second half of 2009 .
We can even go further and say that the danger of deflation is exaggerated .
Thomas Mayer ( 2008 ) , Managing Director at the Global Economics division of Deutsche Bank , states that the future will bring very low growth in large industrialised economies and a long - term rise of inflation .
He argues that , due to global imbalances , consumers in the large economies were no longer able to repay their debt .
The government had to step in to take over bad debts to prevent mass bankruptcy and avoid deflation due to faltering demand .
Additionally , monetary policy must be eased , as the US has and the Eurozone may be following .
This should avoid a very deep recession and thus deflation and , given the amount of monetary stimulus , might lead to inflation instead in the medium to long run .
Empirical evidence on inflation and deflation risks
Kilian and Mangianelli ( 2007 ) have proposed formal , quantitative measures of deflation risks .
They have assumed that the risk preference of the private sector with respect to inflation matters for the assessment of ( excessive ) inflation or deflation risks .
Using data on inflation from 1960 to 2002 , they have estimated the risks of deflation and inflation for the United States , Germany ( as a proxy for the Eurozone ) , and Japan for horizons of up to two years using a sophisticated forecast model .
Since deflation was also an issue in 2002 , it is surprising that is the forecast suggests no evidence of substantial deflation risks for the United States or Germany .
The authors do find evidence for substantial deflation risks in Japan .
Figure 1 below illustrates their result .
Deflation risks for the US and Germany were around zero for almost the entire period ( the exceptions are 1987 and 2000 , after the stock market crash ) , and they have never actually approached the deflation risks in Japan during the 1990s .
Figure 1 . Excessive inflation risks and deflation risks : US , Germany , and Japan
Note : EIR denotes excessive inflation risks and DR denotes deflation risks .
Updating this model with data through November 2008 , I find similar estimates of risks to price stability , reported in Table 1 .
Large ( positive ) inflation risk and large ( negative ) deflation risk are undesirable – the optimal balance of these risks is zero .
I have taken the lower and upper bounds of acceptable inflation to be 0 % and 2 % respectively , corresponding to the ECB ’s acceptable range .
2
Table 1 . Risks of inflation and deflation , November 2008
One - year horizon Two - year horizon Excessive inflation risk United States 1.76 1.80 Germany 0.88 0.00 Japan 0.41 0.23 Balance of risk United States 1.77 1.80 Germany 0.88 0.20 Japan 0.20 - 0.55 Deflation risk United States 0.01 0.00 Germany 0.01 0.20 Japan - 0.21 - 0.78
The table shows that Kilian and Mangianelli ’s conclusion still holds .
All three countries face positive inflation risk , and only Japan faces a substantial deflation risk .
The risk of deflation in the Eurozone and United States are almost negligible , particularly at the one - year horizon .
There is no evidence of substantial deflation risks in Europe or the US .
This conclusion is supported by current evidence on break - even inflation rates derived from inflation - linked bonds showing also a larger risk of negative inflation rates in the US than in the Eurozone .
Central bank policy in the Eurozone and the US
What should a central bank do to avoid deflation ( and deflationary expectations ) ?
If central bank decision - making is costly , then there is an option value of waiting for changing interest rates ( Eijffinger , Schaling , and Verhagen 2007 ) .
It may be better for a central bank to wait and see if the economy moves to target inflation on its own .3
Moreover , acting too much to prevent deflation may lead the public to believe that deflation is a real danger .
The US Federal Reserve is much more active than the ECB in changing its interest rate .
It may be risking these adverse consequences while exhausting its options by the time the recession really kicks in .
The US is not in such a worse position to justify such activist behaviour .
The ECB may wait to see whether oil and commodity price decreases are permanent or temporary and then act .
Only permanent drops will necessitate further ECB action .
ECB Executive Board Member Bini Smaghi ( 2008 ) has explained the bank ’s policies to avoid deflation .
First , the ECB anchors expectations by a quantitative definition of price stability and transparency in decision - making .
Second , it preventatively acts to reduce the probability of hitting zero interests rates , while exercising restraint so that it does not adversely affect market sentiments by acting too quickly .
Moreover , a central bank should avoid exhausting its ammunition in pre-emptive actions .
The ECB , with its rate of 2.5 % , is better positioned to face a shock than the Fed , whose rate is near 0 % .
Finally , too low interest rates can induce excessive risk taking , the main cause of the current crisis .
Excessively low rates were an important factor at the beginning of the global credit crisis in the US subprime crisis .
Unfortunately , there is a natural tendency to postpone tightening of interest rates in a period of recession until a solid recovery is taking place .
The Fed was very quick to reduce its interest rate after the dot - com bubble , but it took years for the Fed to bring the interest rate back up .
This is likely to be repeated .
Indeed market participants now expect the Fed to bring the Federal Funds rate to 1.5 % only at the end of 2010 .
Raising interest rates contrary to investors ’ expectations would disrupt capital markets , so the Fed is less likely to do so .
Additionally , when interest rates have been low for a long time period , the central bank has to increase them more sharply to bring interest rates back in line with inflation expectations .
In the short run , the ECB has to act in an environment with major flaws in the financial system ( dysfunctional money and credit markets ) under a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty .
Therefore , its monetary policy actions will not probably work as expected and the ECB ’s option value of waiting will be high .
In the medium term ( the ECB ’s policy horizon ) the risk of excessive inflation is ( much ) higher than the risk of deflation .
By the globalisation of monetary policy , it will be hard for the ECB to shield the Eurozone from the quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks in the world .

As a trumpeter player , his work – especially for CTI – was such an essential part of the soul - jazz sound of the 1970s that would find renewed resonance two decades later .

I suspect that even for many hardcore emacs users it is something other than emacs .
The $ EDITOR environment variable determines which editor is run to change the contents of files by various unix commands .
Until a few weeks ago , my $ EDITOR and $ P4EDITOR variables were both set to vi .
Why ?
Starting my emacs takes a few seconds on a local server and up to a minute on a remote server ( because of X ) .
I could use emacsclient which connects to an already running emacs .
I would also have to change my work habits and access remote servers using tramp .
Doing that would be inconvenient and a better solution for me is to start a stripped - down emacs - in - a- terminal .
The first thing to do is to set up a simple file which loads your basic configuration .
I call this one basic - emacs.el .
basic-emacs.el
( add - to - list ' load - path ( expand - file - name " ~/emacs - files " ) ) ( require ' my - defaults ) ( require ' my - utils )
Then set your EDITOR variables in . bashrc for example .
. bashrc
EDITOR = 'emacs - nw -q -- load ~/emacs-files/basic-emacs.el '
P4EDITOR =$ EDITOR export EDITOR P4EDITOR
The q flag prevents emacs from loading your .emacs
The nw flag runs emacs in a terminal
" At both sites the flowers of goldenrod provided ample pasturage , with the honey flow commencing in the middle of August and tapering off by the second week in October .
Medium - depth empty honey storage supers ( a super is the part of the beehive used to collect honey ) were put on the hives at this time in addition to the three brood chambers already there .
By the simple expedient of lifting the hives from behind , progress could be roughly monitored .
This monitoring showed that the hives of the farmland bees , while numerous , were not gaining weight .
Meanwhile , the non-farm colonies steadily gained weight .
This part of the experiment was terminated Oct. 14 with the removal of the honey storage supers , with these results :
The farmland bees had not even started to work in the honey supers and will require extensive feeding before winter sets in .
The non -farm bee colonies produced , in total , nearly 200 pounds of extra honey in addition to about 150 pounds per hive stored in the over - wintering brood supers .
These colonies will be left in place to see whether the die - off of last season is repeated .
These results should encourage new research to determine what factor or factors are present in farm country to cause such a discrepancy in honey production . "

As the disappearance of honeybees continues , researchers are trying desperately to discover the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) .
General concensus at this point is that there is more than once cause and the latest culprit may be genetically modified crops .
This is one area of research being neglected as mainstream scientists insist GM crops are safe .
For the last 100 years , beekeepers have experienced colony losses from bacteria , ( foulbrood ) , mites ( varroa and tracheal ) and other pathogens .
These problems are dealt with by using antibiotics , miticides and and other methods of pest management .
Losses are slow and expected and beekeepers know how to limit the destruction .
This new mass die - off is different in that it is virtually instantaneous with no warning of the impending collapse .
John McDonald , a bee keeper in Pennsyvania with a background in biology , speculated that genetically modified crops could play a role in CCD .
Although the government constantly reassures us that these genetic manipulations are safe for both humans and the environment , his hope is that looking more closely at these issues might raise questions about those assumptions .
The common bacterium , supplies the most commonly used segment of transgenic DNA .has been used for decades by farmers and gardeners to control crop damage from butterfy larvae .
Now , instead of spraying this bacterium directly on the crops , where it is eaten only by the target insects , the genes containing the insecticidal traits are incorporated into the genome of the plant itself .
As the genetically modified plant grows , thesegenes are replicated in every cell of the plant , including pollen .
Therefore , every cell of each GM plant contains its own poison aimed to kill the target insect .
The target insects consume some portion of the plant , then once ingested , the toxin produced by thegenes causes crystallization in the guts of boring larvae and thus death .
The primary toxin is a protein called Cry1Ab .
In the case of field corn , the targeted insects are stem and root - borers and butterfly larvae .
Although scientists " assure " us that bees ( hymenopterans ) are not affected , there arevariants available that target beetles , flies and mosquitoes .
There is indisputable proof that Cry1Ab is present in beehives .
Beekeepers sprayunder hive lids to control the wax moth because the larvae cause messy webs on the honey .
Canadian beekeepers have noted the disappearance of this moth even in untreated hives , apparently the result of bees ingesting Cry1Ab while foraging in GM canola plants .
Bees forage heavily on corn flowers to obtain pollen for the rearing of young bees .
These pollen grains also contain thegenes of the parent plant , because they are present in the cells from which pollen forms .
Mr. McDonald believes it may be possible that while Cry1Ab has no direct lethal effect on young bees , there may be some sub-lethal effect , such as immune suppression , acting as a slow killer .
Tens of millions of acres of genetically modified crops are allowing thegenes to move off crop fields and contaminate other flowers from which bees gather flowers .
" Given that nearly every bite of food that we eat has a pollinator , the seriousness of this emerging problem could dwarf all previous food disruptions " .
( John McDonald )
He proposed an experiment to compare colony losses of bees from regions where there are no GM crops to losses of colonies where they are exposed .
He wanted to put test hives where GM crops are so distant from the hives that the foraging worker bees would have no exposure to GM crops .
Researches readily dismissed his ideas and no one followed through with such an experiment .
At this point , he decided to do his own investigation at his own expense .
He established 8 colonies in new wooden hives to ensure no possible disease transfer from old hives .
The bees were fed continuously with sugar syrup until the hives were placed at the selected locations .
John McDonald is a beekeeper in Pennsylvania .
He welcomes comments or questions about the bee problem at [ email protected ]
Another study indicating thatmay be contributing to the death of honey bees was undertaken in Mexico .
This study compared the effects on young adult honeybees of 2 concentrations of Cry1AB ( 3 and 5000 parts per billion ) to a chemical pesticide , imidacloprid .
3 different effects were evaluated by the researchers : Neither test concentration of Cry1Ab had lethal effects on the honeybees , however , when exposed to the higher concentration , feeding behavior was affected .
The bees spent longer ingesting the syrup which contained the Cry1Ab which could mean smaller amounts of pollen would be collected .
These bees also had impaired learning performance .
Honeybees normally do not continue responding to an odor when no food is present , but should be discouraged and seek other sources .
These bees continued responding to the odor which again , could affect pollen gathering efficiency .
This study indicates that althoughis not directly lethal to honeybees , it could indirectly lead to colony death due to failure to collect enough food to sustain the hive .
These findings may be the key to the difference in honey production in Mr. McDonald 's experiment .
appears to have non-lethal effects which become apparent only when the lethal effect is absent .
Although not directly lethal to non-target organisms , the toxins from thegene potentially puts non-target insects such as honeybees at risk .

The Mac clone maker being sued by Apple because it installs Mac OS X on generic Intel - based systems said it bought copies of the operating system from Apple itself , court documents show .
In papers filed with a San Francisco federal court last week , Psystar repeated its argument that Apple has abused copyright laws by tying the Mac operating system to Apple hardware .
The filing came in response to an Apple motion asking U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup , who tossed out Psystar 's original antitrust allegations against Apple last November , to also throw out the Florida company 's revamped countersuit .
" Apple contends that because Psystar is ' distributing computers with Apple 's copyrighted software loaded on them ' that ' Apple is within its rights in asserting copyright infringement ' , " said Psystar in the papers filed Jan .
7 . " Apple 's assertion that Psystar cannot distribute computers with Apple software ( and that a purchaser could not use the same ) would run roughshod over 17 U.S.C. , " Psystar added , referring to the section of U.S. law that pertains to copyright .
To make its point , Psystar claimed that it has purchased some copies of Mac OS X — which it pre-installs on the Intel - powered machines it sells under the " Open Computer " and " OpenPro " labels — straight from Apple .
" Psystar distributes computers with legitimately purchased copies of Mac OS loaded thereon , " the company said .
" Many of those copies [ were ] directly obtained from Apple .
While Psystar complies with Section 117 ( b ) of the Copyright Act , Apple attempts to usurp those limitations by telling Psystar and its customers that Apple — and Apple alone — will say ' whether , how or by whom its software is ... distributed or used . ' "
Apple 's case relies on exactly that ; it has claimed from the start of its July 2008 lawsuit that the Mac OS X end - user licensing agreement ( EULA ) forbids users from installing the operating system on hardware not sold by Apple .
Apple , argued Psystar , can't have it both ways by taking Psystar 's money and then claiming its copyright has been infringed upon .
" Psystar acquired lawful copies of the Mac OS from Apple , " Psystar said .
" Those copies were lawfully acquired from authorized distributors , including some directly from Apple ; Psystar paid good and valuable consideration for those copies ; Psystar disposed of those lawfully acquired copies to third - parties .
" Once a copyright owner consents to the sale of particular copies of a work , the owner may not thereafter exercise distribution rights with respect to those copies , " Psystar added , citing U.S. law and the " first sale " doctrine .
The first sale doctrine , which traces its history to a 1908 U.S. Supreme Court decision and was codified by Congress in the Copyright Act of 1976 , essentially says that the buyer of a copyrighted work may sell or give away a lawfully - made copy without the copyright holder 's permission .
For its part , Apple 's motion of Dec. 30 said that Psystar 's request to revise its countersuit was nothing more than smoke and mirrors .
" Psystar attempts to repackage its dismissed antitrust allegations under the guise of copyright misuse , " Apple told Alsup .
" Apple is well within its rights to determine whether , how or by whom its software is reproduced and how it is to be licensed , " Apple added elsewhere in the motion .
Apple initiated the legal tussle — prompted by Psystar 's April 2008 launch of Intel - based computers running Mac OS X — but Psystar hit back with a countersuit in late August , when it argued that Apple violated antitrust laws by tying the operating system to its hardware .
When Alsup dismissed the antitrust allegations , he left the door open to an amended complaint .
Psystar took advantage of the opportunity in mid-December and filed a revised lawsuit that instead claimed that Apple had stretched the copyright laws .
Apple declined to comment on the case , which is slated to go to trial in April .
This story , " Mac clone maker Psystar claims it bought OS X from Apple " was originally published by Computerworld .
Apple 's Safari web browser has crested 7 % of worldwide browser market share according to online research firm Net Applications .
While Safari's accomplishment is significant the biggest winner is clearly Mozilla 's Firefox which crested 20 % market share and climbed nearly an entire percentage point in one month .
Meanwhile , Internet Explorer continues to bleed market share and now sits below 70 % , a 1.5 % decline from October 2008 .
The news is similar for Microsoft and Apple 's respective operating systems , with Microsoft Windows falling below 90 % market share for the first time according to Net Applications and Apple 's Mac OS X approaching 9 % .
Net Applications gathers their market share numbers differently from sales - based statistics compiled by firms like Gartner or IDC in that they use identifying information from internet browsers .
Therefore , their statistics best describe the installed internet - using population .
We collect data from the browsers of site visitors to our exclusive on - demand network of live stats customers .
The data is compiled from approximately 160 million visitors per month .
The information published is an aggregate of the data from this network of hosted website statistics .
The site unique visitor and referral information is summarized on a monthly basis .
What Happened Here
Any number of things could have just happened .
In an effort to better understand how people use the web , Mozilla has launched a new data gathering project for usability studies called Test Pilot .
It 's still just a concept , but as an aggregation model , it shows great promise .
Test Pilot is sort of a distributed usability lab .
It uses simple crowdsourcing mechanisms to gather data from volunteers all over the world as they interact with web apps and desktop software .
The collected data remains transparent and openly available , so the data sets can be used by anyone .
Volunteers will be invited to download a Firefox extension , which will ask for some demographic information – age , location , your level of technical aptitude – that 's used to build a profile .
Based on that profile , you 'll occasionally receive a request to take part in a usability study .
Click " yes , " complete the survey or click around on a website for a few minutes , and the Test Pilot add - on will gather the information it needs .
The tests will be unobtrusive , and the data will be collected anonymously .
The user profiles will remain anonymous , too , so they wo n't contain any information that would allow anyone to directly link data collected from your browser back to you .
Aza Raskin , head of user experience at Mozilla Labs , outlined the details of the proposed platform in a blog post Tuesday .
Raskin notes that the project was initially intended to provide feedback for Mozilla 's own products – Firefox , the Thunderbird e-mail client and add - ons like Weave and Ubiquity – with a 1 % sample of active users .
That 's a huge sample size for usability testing , so the distributed model makes sense .
It 's also this level of scalability that makes Test Pilot special .
Not only will the collected data be made open to the public , but the testing platform will as well .
Any research institution that needs usability data can draft a request to query the hive mind of worldwide Firefox users .
Tests can be conducted in a matter of hours with virtually no overhead – a dream compared to the hours and days spend recruiting , screening and testing participants in traditional usability studies .
" Test Pilot is open and transparent , " Raskin says in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" Anyone can submit a test to be run for research .
We are particularly excited that this enables new communities , like non-profits , ethnographers , and usability researchers , to participate in making the open web better .
Simply put , Test Pilot 's doors are open as long as the data gathered by a test protects our user 's privacy and furthers Mozilla 's mission to help people work , play , and communicate on the web . "
Raskin is quick to point out that the project is n't intended to be a generic platform for market research .
" Test Pilot is specifically scoped towards usability and feature research , " he says .
Do n't expect the tight focus on usability to limit innovation , though .
Consider a project like IBM's Many Eyes , which aggregates public data and catalogs it in freely available data sets .
IBM 's team also experiments with new forms of data visualization .
Given the Firefox community 's obsession with things like layout rendering , cutting edge animation techniques and fancy JavaScript frills , visualization tools seem like a logical extension of the platform .
The potential for growth and experimentation in that area alone is enormous .
I 'm looking forward to downloading the add - on myself .
Do you suppose there 's a shortage of 30 - something white male Firefox users in the San Francisco bay area ?

One of three children from a single family killed during an Israeli missile strike is buried in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah , 29 December 2008 .

Like many other members of my community , I wonder what is happening to humanity in the 21st century that makes it deaf to the cries of Gaza ’s children and of its entire population , trapped in their open - air prison for more than two years now .
Why is this so - called free world blind , deaf and dumb towards these atrocities , again and again ?
There must be something wrong when families all over the world gather to celebrate the eve of a new year while Palestinian families remain shattered and scattered .
There must be something wrong when five sisters of the Balousha family — Jawaher , Dunia , Samar , Ikram and Tahreer , all children — were buried under the rubble of their home in Jabaliya camp when their home was bombed by Israeli war jets , and no world leader has condemned this barbaric crime .
There must be something wrong when Gaza universities , mosques , United Nations and government schools , homes , clinics , ministries and charities are bombarded from US - manufactured and - supplied F - 16 war planes on the pretext of stopping the rockets coming out of Gaza .
How can the world accept the Israeli claim that this bloodiest of air strikes , the worst in Gaza since 1967 , is an act of self - defense against the crude rockets launched by Hamas and other resistance groups ?
Does the world ever dig deeper behind the reasons for the launching of these rockets after they were fired so rarely during the past six months of the cease fire brokered in June by Egypt ?
Does the world know that ending the siege imposed on Gaza ’s 1.5 million people , opening the borders and stopping Israel ’s ongoing invasions and killings , which were the Palestinians ’ three main conditions for truce , have not been fulfilled by Israel ?
All international and human rights reports released during the past few months confirm this unequivocally .
During the truce , 23 Palestinians were killed by Israel and Gaza ’s borders remained sealed , and the entire population was starved .
Is this really a war against Hamas and the rockets it launches from Gaza or is it something else ?
Is the goal of the aggression to bring peace to the people of Sderot or is it to destroy any potential opportunity for peace ?
And if Hamas and other resistance groups are terrorist organizations because they demand an end to the siege on Gaza and opening the borders for basic humanitarian needs , then does n’t the near - starvation of a population , the lethal power cuts , the bombing of infrastructure and the killing of hundreds of Palestinians make Israel a terrorist state as well ?
If Israel has the right to such heavy - handed self - defense exercised against the civilian population of Gaza , how would the world wish the Palestinians to defend themselves and end the siege ?
And if the world understands that protecting civilians involves the bombing of other civilians by F - 16 jet fighters , then how would the world want the people under occupation and siege to defend themselves ?
Like the people of British , the US , the UK , and elsewhere , the Palestinians are humans and belong to humanity .
The blood of all Palestinians including those in Gaza is just as valuable as the blood of Israelis .
If these barbaric acts and this systematic , criminal destruction of a nation are acceptable to the world then Palestinians , as all oppressed people in the world , have every right to declare the death of humanity .
Ghada Ageel is a third - generation Palestinian refugee .
She grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza and is currently in the United Kingdom and cannot return to Gaza because of the closure of Gaza ’s borders by Israel .

White House altered , deleted press releases on ' coalition of the willing '
John Byrne
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This The White House altered documents regarding the nations involved in the so - called " Coalition of the Willing " that aided the US invasion of Iraq .
A University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign political science professor says he found that the White House had modified elements of its website dealing with the coalition and in some cases deleted key documents in the public record .
At the onset of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the White House released a list of the nations participating in the coalition , an important part of Bush Administration PR efforts , as the war was not UN - endorsed .
Over a period of years , however , the original releases were modified to account for the diminishing number of nations .
Two releases were deleted from the White House website entirely , the professor says .
" I think that it raises the question of whether or not we can trust the government to maintain public records of things that were said or done that later prove embarrassing , " Illinois political science professor Scott Althaus said .
" It could be what we found is limited , " Althaus added .
" But if it is not , it certainly opens the finding up to larger questions . "
According to the university 's student newspaper , a proofreader doublechecking a paper Althaus co-authored on the edited releases found that one of the URLs included in his paper now led to a blank page .
" Related lists of coalition countries also appeared to contradict one another , " the paper added .
The Cline Center for Democracy asserted that the " pattern " of " revision and removal " suggest that the White House has edited documents dealing with the period between 2003 and 2005 .
" Instead of the White House Web site maintaining an updated list while preserving copies of the old ones or issuing revised lists in addition to the original posts , the White House removed original documents , altered them and replaced them with backdated modifications that only appear to be originals , " wrote Illinois University reporter Kelly Gibbs on Friday .
The findings showed " that several documents had been revised and listed different numbers and names of coalition countries . "
" In many ways it is puzzling why so much effort was put into revising and deleting these documents , " Althaus told Gibbs .
" This is mainly because the changes were pretty small potatoes . "
Althaus says he 's been surprised by the reaction to his revelations on political blogs , cautioning that he is n't inherently saying that the modifications were part of a Bush political propaganda effort .
" Our findings out in the blogosphere are generally interpreted in a political lens , which was not our intention at all , " Althaus said .
" Our intention was to alert scholars and journalists who rely on government documents to let them know the facts have been tampered with . "
Sky News reports 100 protesters have occupied the Glasgow Headquarters of the BBC over the refusal to air an emergency aid appeal for Gaza .
The report continues : “ The BBC is still standing firm on its decision not to show the advert for the Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) .
The corporation has said it has received “ approximately ” 1,000 telephone complaints and a further 10,000 by email .
Rival broadcasters ITV , Channel 4 and Five have now agreed to air the appeal .
Sky is still considering its position ” .
This action has taken place the day after thousands marched on the BBC in London before heading to Trafalgar Square via Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus .
The “ End the Blockade on Gaza ” demonstration was organised by the Stop The War Coalition and others and asked for the BBC to immediately air the Gaza Aid Appeal .
UPDATE …
Free & Independent has spoken with protester Keith Boyd .
The occupation has ended peacefully without arrest .
Mr Boyd noted Al Jazeera were there to report the story .

I was walking by a TV the other day and CNN was on , airing a hearing of what seemed to be a banking committee in Congress debating whether to release more bailout money .
CNN did n’t identify the lawmaker who was speaking .
He had a bit of a Southern drawl .
But I burst out laughing when he said something like : “ I remember a time when banks lent money to people .
Now it ’s the other way around . ”
Yes , kids , those were the days  when banks lent money to the people not the people to the banks !
Many commentators have suggestions for Barack Obama on what should be his first meeting at the White House .
Here is mine : Mr. Obama and his economic team should convene the 300 leading bank presidents in the East Room and the president should say to each one of them something like this :
“ Ladies and gentlemen , this crisis started with you , the bankers , engaging in reckless practices , and it will only end when we clean up your mess and start afresh .
The banking system is the heart of our economy .
It pumps blood to our industrial muscles , and right now it ’s not pumping .
We all know that in the past six months you ’ve gone from one extreme to another .
You ’ve gone from lending money to anyone who could fog up a knife to now treating all potential borrowers , no matter how healthy , as bankrupt until proven innocent .
And , therefore , you ’re either not lending to them or lending under such onerous terms that the economy ca n’t get any liftoff .
No amount of stimulus will work without a healthy banking system .
“ So here ’s what we ’re going to do : we ’re going to unclog the arteries .
My banking experts have analyzed each of your balance sheets .
You will tell us if we ’re right .
Those of you who are insolvent , we will nationalize and shut down .
We will auction off your viable assets and will hold the toxic ones in a government reconstruction fund and sell them later when the market rebounds .
Those of you who are weak will be merged .
And those of you who are strong will receive added capital for your balance sheets , after you write down all your remaining toxic waste .
I am not going to continue rewarding the losers and dimwits amongst you with handouts . ”
A Post By : Darren Rowse
Earlier in the year DPS forum member stevoarnold ( on flickr here ) shared in the ‘ how I took it ‘ section how he ’d managed to get the following transformation of an image because he shot it in RAW and was able to do significant post production and recover much of the image despite it being under exposed .
See the two images at before and after .
Here ’s his description of how he did it :
“ I thought I would share with you my latest experience .
I went out this evening with the intention of getting some nice dusk shots of the sea shore but left it a little late and it was pitch black when I got there .
I took some shots anyway which turned out completely under exposed due to lack of light even at a 30 second exposure .
So I got them home , imported a RAW file into photoshop and after a little bit of fiddling about I came up with the image below .
Here are the steps I took to get from this Before shot to the after shot :
1. Open RAW file in photoshop
2 . Increase the exposure by 2 stops and then “ open image ”
3. Create an “ Orton effect ” layer by :
Duplicate background layer
Add gaussian blur to the duplicate
Set blend mode to Soft Light
4 . Add a curves adjustment layer to increase brightness
5. Flatten , rotate to straighten and crop final image
Got an image that you want us to tell us about the shooting and processing photograph of ?

Aubrey Coleman Stomps On Chase Budinger 's Face ( Video , Photos )
When did basketball become a sport that is played with your foot and someone else 's face ?
Houston Cougarsliterally stomped on the competition when he planted his foot in Arizona Wildcat 's face .
Coleman ended up with a flagrant foul and was ejected from the basketball game with 9:51 left in the second half .
The final score of Saturday 's contest was 96 - 90 with AZ triumphant over Houston - no doubt motivated by the actions of Coleman .
We wonder where he learned his ' cheap shot ' technique and if a suspension will be forthcoming .
Check out the video below .
If nuclear waste was dumped on your beach you ’d grab a cutlass , too .
We just read an amazing article from the UK newspaper , the Independent , about the true story of Somalia ’s pirates that have been grabbing the headlines for months now .
If the information is true – and to be honest , if fits – then it ’s a scandal of epic proportions , the kind of everyday tragedy that does n’t make the news because Paris Hilton is taking up the airwaves .
So get this : the article by Johann Hari explains that since Somalia ’s government fell in 1991 , ships have been arriving off Somalia ’s shores and dumping nuclear and chemical waste .
Where do the ships come from ?
Europe .
Who brings them there ?
The Camorra , Italy ’s largest mafia that runs a good deal of Europe ’s waste disposal service .
Roberto Saviano spelled out in his courageous book Gamorrah just to what extent the Camorra have polluted , scarred and poisoned Italy ’s countryside , how they have infiltrated all levels of local government in Napoli and run worldwide business in imitation fashion , guns and drugs .
The offer cheap contracts , Western governments save some money and a country on its knees like Somalia is just a convenient dump .
Nothing personal , it ’s just business .
Naturally , Somalians were n’t too happy about that and sent out boats to try to stop the ships from poisoning their seas and jeopardising the health of their people .
They were n’t too happy about all the fishing trawlers depleting the stocks of shrimp either that they depended on for survival .
Now we ’ve overfished our own oceans until there ’s barely a healthy fish population left , a free market economy just moves on to the next exploitable resource .
That , after all , is the Story of Stuff .
S why have n’t we heard such an incredible story before in more than a year of BBC and CNN coverage ?
Because like all news , there are too many special interests for certain subjects to get reported .
Every day people are shot and maimed but when do we hear news stories about the companies that produce the arms ?
Every day 3000 children in Africa die from malaria in countries that could eradicate the disease if they were n’t run by dictators propped up by Western aid .
Every day women are abducted from their homes and forced into slavery in brothels across Europe , the US , Japan and Australia .
And then we go abroad and wonder why we ’re not always greeted with open arms ?
But the calm , balanced media coverage will continue , including perhaps the odd ‘ radical ’ who mentions nuclear waste – but no , these are common criminals .
They threaten our oil supply and that makes them guilty before the newspapers go to press .
The exception in this case might be Journeyman Pictures ’ short documentary about the fisherman - turned - pirates .
The small bit about nuclear waste is n’t mentioned but after seeing this you ’d think twice about the authenticity of European lobster .
Also , read Johann Hari ’s article on the truth behind the Somalian pirates in full .
Examples of suggested questions for the public include : " How should we react to the referendum defeats on the EU Constitution ? " and " What will the EU of the future look like ?
Will it develop into a form of federation ? "
Microsoft 's 3,000 employees in the UK face an uncertain 2009 as the software giant considers a plan for substantial redundancies to combat the economic downturn .
At least 10 per cent , and possibly as much as 17 per cent , of its global workforce could be cut in what would be the first mass lay - offs in the company 's 32 - year history .
Across the world , up to 15,000 jobs could be under threat .
According to rumours in the US , overseas divisions could be particularly hard hit , and an announcement of the plan could come within two weeks .
The company said yesterday that it does not comment on speculation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Analysts say the software giant faces pressure on several fronts this year .
With retail spending having turned down , consumer sales of its Windows operating system – installed on nine out of ten personal computers – could slow .
Businesses , too , are scaling back , threatening licence fees from its Office products , including Microsoft Word , and other corporate software .
Meanwhile , online advertising growth has decelerated sharply as a result of the recession , threatening Microsoft 's hopes of turning a profit at its troubled MSN internet business .
" The prevailing wisdom on Microsoft is that the company may pre-announce disappointing December results , " Brad Reback , analyst at Oppenheimer & Co , told clients .
" Should such headcount reductions materialise , we would view them as a positive sign that management is interested in preserving the company 's operating margin structure through the downturn . "
A 10 per cent cut in Microsoft 's 90,000 global workforce could save $ 1.2bn ( £ 826 m ) a year , analysts say .
A Silicon Valley website reported over the new year holiday that up to 17 per cent of Microsoft 's employees could lose their jobs , citing internal conversations at the company .
The website , Fudzilla , said that the European divisions may be disproportionately affected .
Microsoft set up its UK subsidiary in 1982 , its first overseas outpost , seven years after Bill Gates created the company to make operating systems for the nascent personal computer market .
Employees are concentrated at the UK headquarters in Reading , although the British division of MSN is run from London .
The company has almost doubled in size in the UK in the past five years .
Microsoft is due to report earnings for the final three months of 2008 on 21 January , but could pre-announce any revenue shortfall and any restructuring plans .
Get Rid of that Spare Change !
2013 Update : Rob reports that now >300 locations with coin machines , so do a search on http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/customer-service/contact-us/branch-locator/index.jsp
2013 Update : Steve - O reports the following as of March 4th , 2013 :
Personal TD Accounts - FREE ( and you can set up a free savings account at TD )
Small business - 3 % cut
Non-TD users - 8 % cut
Looks like non -TD account holders may have better luck at BMO .
See below .
2011 Update : BMO now has FREE ( now only free up to $ 250 for non-customers ) coin counting machines too .
The current list is here , and they have some outside of Ontario too !
Here 's the original 2007 article :
Like many US banks have been doing for the past decade , TD Canada Trust is running a pilot project that puts automatic coin counting machines into branches .
I 'm not sure of any other banks in Canada that have the same system .
Now , since this is a pilot project of TD / Canada Trust Bank , it could be expanded , changed or ended at any time .
I 'm not sure if they 're doing anything outside of Ontario .
These automatic coin sorter / counting machines let you bring in your unwrapped mixed coins , dump them in a machine , and then ( I presume ) you can deposit it into your TD account .
I 'd guess you must be an account - holder to do this ( actually , read below for more details ) .
At the moment , their service is fee - free .
Many grocery stores , like Dominion , and I think even the Canadian Tire in downtown Toronto on Bay street have these machines , but their fees can be pretty hefty ( like 7 - 10 % , ouch ! ) .
Anyways , I managed to email TD and get a list of locations in which they are piloting these things , which can save you a ton of time .
Too bad they do n't have one in downtown Toronto ( which I can't quite figure out why , it 's where TD bank 's headquarters are located ) .
TD Canada Trust With Automatic Coin Sorter / Counters :
10908 Hurontario Street ( at Wanless ) Brampton , ON .
L7A 3R9
1440 Royal York Road ( at Eglington ) Etobicoke , ON M9P 3B1
808 York Mills Road ( at Leslie ) Toronto , ON .
M3B 1X8
5000 New Street ( at Appleby Line ) Burlington , ON .
L7L 1V1
5887 Main Street ( at West Lawn Cr ) Stoufville , ON .
L4A 1N2
1684 Danforth Ave ( at Woodington ) Toronto , ON .
M4C 1H6
1119 Fennell Ave E. ( at Upper Ottawa ) Hamilton , ON .
L8T 1S2
1260 Commissioners Rd W ( at Boler ) London , ON .
N6 K 1C7
1005 Ottawa Street N ( at River Road ) Kitchener , ON .
N2A 1H2
1365 Fanshawe Pk Rd W ( at Hyde Park ) London , ON .
N6G 0E3
So there it is .
Feel free to use Mapquest or some such to get more precise directions .
This list is accurate as of the email I received in Sept 2008 .
Check out my review / followup of my experience when I brought in over $ 300 in coins ( which took about 17 minutes to count )
Also note that these sorter / counters wo n't differentiate between Canadian and US currency , though that does n't make much of a difference these days
I liked the fact that so much had been done with some coloured boxes and a few props .
And crateman 's creators had obviously taken some risks to install him .
Here was street art with a sense of humour and a dash of courage ; a whimsical , Lego - like presence enlivening my train ride .
Last week , feeling faintly ridiculous even by the standards of cyberspace , I Googled the question : " Who is crateman ? " I did n't exactly find an answer ( and perhaps there is none ) but I discovered he had quite a profile .
He has been turning up around Melbourne for several years now .
There 's a crateman website , made by a fan , and a YouTube slideshow .
Most of his earlier cameos are long gone , but they live on in photos .
I saw crateman perched on the roof of a Richmond building and hanging , as if crucified , from the side of the Newport Mill .
I saw a weightlifter ( cratelifter ? ) hoisting a plastic barbell and two crate men ascending a city skyscraper , one leaning down to offer the other a helping hand .
I read of forays into Bendigo , where in August 2007 , ABC radio reported the arrival of a huge crate person in the middle of the town 's busiest roundabout .
By lunchtime , he had disappeared .
A year later , a giant made of more than 40 crates had turned up under a Bendigo gum tree .
A sign announced : " It 's been whey too long !
It 's crate to be back .
Crateman . "
That sign was a mistake , I reckon .
Part of crateman 's appeal is his enigmatic silence , the way he keeps us guessing .
He can , at times , resort to painfully undergraduate obviousness ( such as the four - crate erection on one prone figure ) but at his best , his character 's body language is surprisingly sophisticated , conveying mood and meaning .
The best of crateman may be a four - person installation that appeared on a sound barrier at Victoria Park in 2007 .
Like frames in a cartoon animation , the four figures are all at different stages of climbing this wall : from just hanging on , to fully seated on top .
It 's a complicated piece , using more than 150 crates , which must have been hard to pull off .
So who is crateman ?
The only clue I found was on the website www.streeteditors.com, which reported that these large - scale artworks " subverting built forms " were created by " the mysterious Sam , Jerome , Ed and Gab " .
Actually , I 'm glad I learned nothing more about crateman 's makers because this way I can fully indulge my own readings of the work .
Crateman is part of a thriving international street art scene .
In New York , the artists known as Skewville have dressed up as construction workers and built a false fence outside a public park .
In Sydney , a group of " guerrilla knitters " apparently drape strange woollen forms on street trees and fire hydrants .
In Washington , artist Mark Jenkins has used Scotch tape to turn parking meters into " lollypop " sculptures and created life - size " tape men " .
Given his city 's tough anti-graffiti stance , this medium , he says , is less risky than spray paint .
" There are n't laws specifically designed against what I do " .
Crateman might partly be a response to Victoria 's hardline graffiti laws , which virtually demonise spray paint .
His impromptu appearances also prompt questions about the use of public space and the kinds of officially sanctioned works that get commissioned as public art .
Maybe I 'm reading too much into some plastic stacks .
But I hope he sticks around .

HAMDEN , Conn . -
" The moving finger writes , " says the famous Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , " and , having writ , moves on . "
Nowadays , the finger more likely is hammering away on a computer keyboard , texting on a cellphone , or Twittering on a BlackBerry .
If you predate the computer age , you might remember a school subject called " penmanship , " which trained your cursive handwriting , usually by the Palmer Method .
The penmanship teacher would come by once a week to rate your work , and if your handwriting was bad , you 'd hear about it .
It 's still taught , to be sure , but it 's no longer emphasized .
" There 's been a decline in attention to all kinds of basic skills , " said Louise Spear - Swerling , coordinator of the graduate program in learning disabilities at Southern Connecticut State University .
" With handwriting , people think it 's just not that important . "
Some people are concerned , though , and one is Kitty Burns Florey , whose book " Script and Scribble : The Rise and Fall of Handwriting " comes out Friday - John Hancock 's birthday and National Handwriting Day .
Florey , author of nine novels and a book about sentence diagramming , became interested in the subject after reading that computer keyboarding has displaced handwriting in schools .
" My first reaction was horror , " Florey said in an interview at her home , " then I thought , ' Why would anyone use handwriting in today 's world ? '
I write my books on the computer .
I discovered two schools of thought :
One is that it would n't matter if nobody learned handwriting because we all have computers , and the other is that this is an interesting , historic , valuable , and beautiful skill that has been around for thousands of years , and we are just tossing it out . "
Diane Desmond , who has taught fourth grade for 39 years at Fall River 's Letourneau Elementary School , says pressure on teachers to improve test scores is partially to blame .
" Cursive was always taught in the third grade , " she said .
" In the last four or five years , I 've had more students who have trouble with it .
This year , I have five or six .
They have trouble reading it , too . "
Victoria Munroe of Northampton , who taught for 10 years in the New Salem - Wendell district , said she had no training in college or the school system on the teaching of handwriting .
" I walked in and they said , ' Here are some worksheets ; see what you can do . '
The kids could n't write , they could n't hold a pencil , they were tiring , and I was supposed to be moving them into words and sentences and paragraphs . "
Finally she took a workshop , on her own initiative , in the teaching of handwriting .
Lockheed Martin rolled out a conventional takeoff and landing ( CTOL ) variant of the F - 35 Lightning II fighter , called F - 35 AF - 1 , which joins three weight - optimized F - 35B short takeoff / vertical landing variants currently undergoing testing .
The aircraft are structurally identical to the F - 35s that will be delivered to armed services beginning in 2010 .
The first F - 35A , known as AA - 1 , has completed 69 flights , and has a production - representative external shape and internal systems .
Unlike AF - 1 and the other F - 35 test aircraft , AA - 1's internal structure was designed before a 2004 weight - savings program resulted in structural revisions to all three F - 35 variants .
" The Lightning II CTOL aircraft will be , by far , the most widely employed F - 35 variant in the world , with more than 1,700 to be used by the U.S. Air Force alone , " said Dan Crowley , Lockheed Martin executive vice president and F - 35 program general manager .
" The F - 35A we delivered is , at its core , the same aircraft that will enter operational service with the Air Force and international customers . " AF - 1 is the first F - 35 to have employed the moving assembly line at its full - rate production speed of 50 inches ( 127 millimeters ) per hour .
Workers tested the system by installing the vertical tails as the line moved at maximum speed .
The moving assembly line , designed to improve production quality and speed , is the first ever for a modern fighter .
AF - 1 becomes the first aircraft since World War II to use a moving assembly line at Lockheed Martin's ( formerly Consolidated Vultee , Convair and General Dynamics ) Fort Worth factory .
F- 35 Lightning II systems and parts are built by industries worldwide .
Six F - 35s are now complete , 17 are in assembly - including the first Low Rate Initial Production aircraft - and F - 35 test aircraft have completed 83 flights .
Lockheed Martin is developing the F - 35 with its principal industrial partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems .
Two separate , interchangeable F - 35 engines are under development : the Pratt &Whitney F135 and the GE Rolls - Royce Fighter Engine Team F136 .
Political polls that include cell phone users show Obama leading McCain by an average of 10 points , versus just over five points in land - line - only surveys , notes a Sunday survey put together by Nate Silver , founder of the electoral projections site FiveThirty Eight .
The survey shows a snapshot of 15 polls conducted on behalf of media companies and by polling companies such as Gallup and Zogby .
Six of those , including one released late Sunday by NBC and the Wall Street Journal , include cell phone users .
The rest do n’t .
The survey confirms a trend that the Pew Research Center noted late this September , although the differences between the surveys with and without cell phones was not statistically significant at that point .
Given the varying results of late regarding the size of Obama ’s lead in the polls , there ’s been a lot of discussion over the question of how accurate the polls are .
Much of the uncertainty over their " accuracy " centers around the question of who really is likely to show up to vote this year .
Obama ’s campaign is counting on young voter and African - American turnout while McCain ’s campaign , according to this Washington Post article , expects the electorate to be similar in composition to the electorate of 2004 .
You can hear more discussion between the experts on this subject from KQED ’s Forum radio program , which aired Friday .

Here 's something that NONE of you have thought about .
What if it 's the WOMAN 'S idea ?
What if it 's HER fantasy ?
That does n't make her a whore or easy or a slut .
Besides , if it's with the bf's friends you'd think that the bf would know if any of his close friends have an std .
My boyfriend wants to indulge my fantasies .
He only wants to do things if I 'M comfortable with them and they 're MY idea .
That does n't make one crazy .
That does n't mean you do n't have any respect for yourself .
Heck , if it 's something you want to do then it 's more like an indulgence to yourself .
My bf and I are considering it because 1 .
I want to >:D 2 . He can't have kids .
Seriously , zero sperm count .
3 . I want to do it .
He never said anything like " If you love me / care for me you 'll do X " THAT'S when you exit stage left .
Do n't let these naysayers burst your bubble .
Like I said , if YOU want to , go for it .
Personally , I AM choosing which of his male friends / family members ( brothers cousins ) I 'd agree to , after all , we want a baby and everyone knows it .
They all understand and WE will take care of our baby .
They do n't want kids / more kids but are willing to help us out in this aspect .
We 're all consenting adults .
We 're all well informed adults who have talked at length about this so no one has any preconceived notions .
They know the no no's and that I WILL bite if they do .
Have fun hun .
Use protection and birth control since you 're not in my shoes .
Do n't kiss the friends on the lips .
That 's a major no no .
My boyfriend has a fantasy about watching me and another guy .
Lot 's of men like that , lots do n't .
It 's a personal preference .

Gordon Brown has won plaudits over recent days for inspiring the turnaround in Hank Paulson 's thinking that saw him progress from his " cash for trash " plan - derided by almost every economist , and many respected financiers - to a capital injection approach .
The international pressure brought to bear on America may indeed have contributed to Paulson 's volte - face .
But Paulson figured he could reshape the UK approach in a way that was even better for America 's banks than his original cash strategy .
The fact that US taxpayers might get trashed in the process is simply part of the collateral damage that has been a hallmark of the Bush administration .
Will this bail - out be enough ?
We do n't know .
The banks have engaged in such non-transparency that not even they really know the shape they are in .
Every day there are more foreclosures - Paulson 's plan did little about that .
That means new holes in the balance sheets are being opened up as old holes get filled .
There is a consensus that our economic downturn will get worse , much worse ; and in every economic downturn , bankruptcies go up .
So even if the banks had exercised prudent lending - and we know that many did n't - they would be faced with more losses .
Britain showed at least that it still believed in some sort of system of accountability : heads of banks resigned .
Nothing like this in the US .
Britain understood that it made no sense to pour money into banks and have them pour out money to shareholders .
The US only restricted the banks from increasing their dividends .
The Treasury has sought to create a picture for the public of toughness , yet behind the scenes it is busy reassuring the banks not to worry , that it 's all part of a show to keep voters and Congress placated .
What is clear is that we will not have voting shares .
Wall Street will have our money , but we will not have a full say in what should be done with it .
A glance at the banks ' recent track record of managing risk gives taxpayers every reason to be concerned .
For all the show of toughness , the details suggest the US taxpayer got a raw deal .
There is no comparison with the terms that Warren Buffett secured when he provided capital to Goldman Sachs .
Buffett got a warrant - the right to buy in the future at a price that was even below the depressed price at the time .
Paulson got for the US a warrant to buy in the future - at whatever the prevailing price at the time .
The whole point of the warrant is so we participate in some of the upside , as the economy recovers from the crisis , and as the financial system starts to work .
The Paulson plan responded to Congress 's demand to have something like a warrant , but as a matter of form , not substance .
Buffett got warrants equal to 100 % of the value of what he put in .
America 's taxpayers got just 15 % .
Moreover , as George Soros has pointed out , in a few years time , when the economy is recovered , the banks should n't need to turn to the government for capital .
The government should have issued convertible shares that gave the right to the government to automatically share in the gain in share price .
Whether we were cheated or not , the banks now have our money .
The next Congress will have two major tasks ahead .
The first is to make sure that if the taxpayer loses on the deal , financial markets pay .
The second is designing new regulations and a new regulatory system .
Many in Wall Street have said that this should be postponed to a later date .
We have a leaky boat , some argue , we need to fix that first .
True , but we also know that there are really problems in the steering mechanism ( and the captains who steer it ) - if we do n't fix those , we will crash on some other rocks before getting into port .
Why should anyone have confidence in a banking system which has failed so badly , when nothing is being done to affect incentives ?
Many of those who urge postponing dealing with the reform of regulations really hope that , once the crisis is passed , business will return to usual , and nothing will be done .
That 's what happened after the last global financial crisis .
There is a hope : the last financial crisis happened in distant regions of the world .
Then it was the taxpayers in Thailand , Korea and Indonesia who had to pick up the tab for the financial markets ' bad lending ; this time it is taxpayers in the US and Europe .
They are angry , and well they should be .
Hopefully , our democracies are strong enough to overcome the power of money and special interests , and we will prove able to build the new regulatory system that the world needs if we are to have a prosperous and stable global economy in the 21st century .

On a cold , wet morning at Atlas Iron and Metal yard south of downtown , scrap peddler Charlie Anderson was not happy about the cash he was handed in exchange for a truckload of junk .
“ Oh man , it took a week to collect this stuff , ” Anderson , 75 , groused to his associate , Sunny Miles , also 75 .
“ All we get for it is $ 17 .
After $ 10 for gas , that leaves us with $ 3.50 each . ”
Atlas owner Gary Weisenberg sympathized with his customers .
But Atlas Iron and Metal -- like all the yards of Alameda Street , a grimy swath that only months ago was at the top of the scrap yard industry heap -- has fallen on hard times .
“ Demand for scrap metal plunged , prices dropped and business is lousy , ” Weisenberg said as he stood on a dock where peddlers were unloading recyclables scavenged from streets and alleys throughout Southern California .

Scrap peddlers behind the wheels of an endless parade of trucks unloading metal discards -- bicycles , refrigerators , brake shoes , radiators and exercise machines -- were earning nearly $ 500 per ton last summer .
China ’s hunger for metals had fueled an economic boom not seen in the rough - edged area since World War II .
Scrap - yard owners treated themselves to new cranes , forklifts and shredders that Weisenberg described as “ the fruit of the good times . ”
Some scrappers bought all the metals they could , believing that prices would continue to rise .
Likewise , peddlers and yard workers , most of them Latino immigrants and African Americans from surrounding neighborhoods , prospered and moved their families into bigger apartments .

But the bottom fell out in October , when foreign markets suddenly dried up and the price of scrap iron fell dramatically to about $ 40 a ton .
Even copper , which has been a hot commodity for thieves , has sunk from $ 3.49 per pound in July to $ 1.33 per pound .
Stainless steel has dropped from $ 1.18 per pound to 35 cents .
Compounding trouble among the dozens of fortress - like scrap yards -- surrounded by corrugated metal walls rimmed with razor wire -- demand for raw material in the United States had already plummeted because of the depressed housing and automobile industries .
To be sure , scrap metal has always been a volatile business .
But “ what ’s going now is unusual , ” said Bob Garino , director of commodities for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries .
“ We ’ve never seen market prices go so high and fall so fast . ”
Garino , whose association serves producers , brokers and consumers of recyclables , said : “ It ’s almost as if there was a buyers ’ strike all along the $ 70 - billion scrap metal market chain . ”

Now , operators are laying off workers or slashing their hours by as much as 50 % .
One yard , Central Metal , was stuck with 30 - foot - high mounds of scrap it bought when prices were high -- an unusual sight for a region that has been an important supplier of exported scrap .
Also hard hit are peddlers , who worry about being able to provide for their families .
Business at local doughnut shops around the Alameda yards is off 20 % .
Elias Aramouni , co-owner of A & N Liquor , said the paychecks “ we ’ve been cashing lately are a lot smaller , so these guys are not buying as much on their way out of the store . ”

Then there was Airgas , an Alameda Street supplier of liquid oxygen and propane gas that earned about $ 30,000 a year from surplus brass valves sold to local scrap metal yards .
“ This year , they told us to take them to the dump because they do n’t want them , ” said Scott Farrar , operations manager at Airgas .
“ Business is down , down , down ; I ’m working very hard for very little money in return , ” Salvadore Gallo , 71 , said as he waited on the Atlas dock to get paid for scrap plucked out of dumpsters in Costa Mesa and Westminster .
“ I ’ve got two small boys , daughter in high school , and an apartment that costs me $ 1,200 a month , ” he added .
“ If things do n’t get better soon , we ’ll have to move into a smaller place . ”
A few blocks down the street , peddler Gladys Boch , a 39 - year - old mother of four , backed her battered blue Toyota mini pickup to the edge of a mound of glistening discards at the Alameda Metal Recycling yard , where a sign at the entrance beckoned in Spanish , “ Tenemos los mejores precios , ” “ We have the best prices . ”

As one of her children watched from the cab , Boch , a diminutive woman with shoulder - length brown hair and an easy smile , got out and climbed into the bed of the truck .
She pulled on a pair of heavy work gloves and began pushing off items she said she had collected “ street by street since 4 a .m. ” -- pipes , bicycles , chairs , curtain rods , steel shelves , a refrigerator , a stove , an artificial Christmas tree and a red fire extinguisher .
Wiping sweat from her brow , Boch complained that scrap was getting harder to find because in the weak economy , people were holding on to potential recyclables longer than they used to .
In addition , she added , “ The competition is terrible out there . ”
“ I used to be a photographer ; I took photos of weddings and parties and such , ” said Boch , who expected to get about $ 25 for the material .
“ I was n’t getting enough photography jobs to pay the bills , so I turned to this . ”

At his Sun -Lite Salvage business , Jay Lite said it is only a matter of time before things improve .
In the meantime , the type of discards arriving in his yard continue to reflect the hardest hit sectors of the nation ’s economy .
“ Take a look at this , ” he said , pointing to a corner of the yard dominated by stacks of crates containing tens of thousands of new steel brake shoes and brass - plated steel door hinges .
“ They could n’t sell them , or customers canceled orders , ” he said .

“ The good news is that demand for steel recently picked up a bit overseas , ” he said .
“ So this stuff will be heading back to China where it will be melted and made into something else . ”

PARIS , Nov 30 ( Reuters ) -
The financial crisis has prompted British officials to acknowledge the merits of the euro and those who mattered were thinking about adopting the currency , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said .
Speaking on France 's RTL radio , Barroso said British leaders had told him in conversation that they would be better off now if they had adopted the euro EUR= as their currency .
“ The crisis has emphasised the importance of the euro ... that undoubtedly ( has ) also ( been the case ) in the United Kingdom , ” he said on Sunday .
“ I do n’t mean to say that it will be tomorrow and I know that the majority in Britain remain opposed to this idea , but it is evolving and the people who count in the United Kingdom are in the process of thinking about it , ” he said .
Pragmatism was one of Britain ’s qualities and the day people there concluded that adopting the euro would make them economically better off , they would take such a step , he said .
Barroso noted that Denmark was now explaining the cost of not using the euro to its public .
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in November that he would seek to secure broad support for holding a referendum on joining the euro .
Some analysts believe a vote could be held as early as March or April next year .
Denmark rejected the euro in a 2000 vote .

Once severely endangered , elephants in South Africa now thrive , causing some to worry that their population could threaten smaller species .
While some are calling to reinstate culling of elephants for the first time since 1994 , other conservationists worry that the effects of killing elephants run deeper than we understand .[ social_buttons ]
In 1900 , the elephant population sunk to only 200 due to hunting ; now , the population is estimated to be 17,000 .
This soaring number combined with their individual demand for feed can result in over - grazing , which hurts the rhinoceros and gazelle populations first .
The animals , which can live up to 70 years , seem to have strong familial bonds that extend to death .
After one of their own dies , elephants often sit near the body for days and sometimes try to cover the body with sticks .
Due to the emotional impact on other elephants , the government would require that entire families of elephants be killed rather than only the old or sick .
Contraception and translocation have been deemed too expensive to use .
Other parts of Southern Africa are experiencing similar over - population , but forest elephants in central Africa still face numerous threats .
Conservation group the World Wildlife Fund agrees with South Africa ’s plans .
“ In some areas there may be too many elephants for the available area , and culling may be needed , ” said Sue Lieberman , director of the WWF International species program .
“ It ’s not a preferred option and it ’s not a pretty sight .
Nobody wants to do this , but the option of doing nothing does n’t exist . ”

Contemporary philosophy 's three main naturalisms are methodological , ontological and epistemological .
Methodological naturalism states that the only authoritative standards are those of science .
Ontological and epistemological naturalism respectively state that all entities and all valid methods of inquiry are in some sense natural .
In philosophy of mathematics of the past few decades methodological naturalism has received the lion 's share of the attention , so we concentrate on this .
Ontological and epistemological naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics are discussed more briefly in section 6 .
Methodological naturalism has three principal and related senses in the philosophy of mathematics .
The first is that the only authoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of natural science ( physics , biology , etc. ) .
The second is that the only authoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of mathematics itself .
The third , an amalgam of the first two , is that the authoritative standards are those of natural science and mathematics .
We refer to these three naturalisms as scientific , mathematical , and mathematical - cum - scientific .
Note that throughout this entry ‘ science ’ and cognate terms encompass only the natural sciences .
Naturalism — ‘ methodological ’ and ‘ in the philosophy of mathematics ’ hereafter understood — seems to have anti-revisionary consequences for mathematics .
The mathematician - philosopher L.E.J.
Brouwer developed intuitionistic mathematics , which sought to overthrow and replace standard ( ‘ classical ’ ) mathematics .
Brouwer attempted to motivate intuitionistic mathematics philosophically with an intuition - based account of mathematical truth .
A more recent exponent of intuitionistic mathematics is Michael Dummett , who has developed arguments from the philosophy of language , in particular the theory of meaning , on its behalf .
Yet scientific standards arguably condone classical over intuitionistic mathematics : even if present - day science could be entirely recast intuitionistically — a big if — it would be less simple and more cumbersome than its current classically - based version .
Mathematicians also tend to view intuitionistic mathematics as inferior to classical mathematics if construed as a rival to it .
Hence neither Brouwer nor Dummett 's intuitionism is apparently sanctioned by scientific or mathematical standards , so naturalism rules them out of court .
Indeed , for many of its adherents , that is precisely naturalism 's point .
Its point , it is often thought , is to block fanciful attacks on established disciplines such as mathematics by disciplines with less secure methodologies .
Contemporary interest in naturalism stems from Quine , whose naturalism is prominent in his later works .
A representative quotation is that naturalism is ‘ the recognition that it is within science itself , and not in some prior philosophy , that reality is to be identified and described ’ ( Quine 1981 , 21 ) .
Another major influence is Hilary Putnam , who articulates his scientific naturalism as follows :
… it is silly to agree that a reason for believing that p warrants accepting p in all scientific circumstances , and then to add ‘ but even so it is not good enough . ’
Such a judgement could only be made if one accepted a trans - scientific method as superior to the scientific method ; but this philosopher , at least , has no interest in doing that .
( Putnam 1971 , 356 )
Thus from this perspective mathematics is judged by scientific standards because everything is .
Moreover , Quine and Putnam maintain that these standards sanction platonist mathematics because mathematics and its platonist construal are an indispensable part of our best scientific theories .
Although naturalism as a self - conscious position in the philosophy of mathematics emerges most fully with Quine there are , as always , precursors .
The empiricist tradition in its various guises ( logical positivism , Mill , Hume , etc. ) is the most obvious precursor , though there are significant differences between pre-Quinean empiricists and contemporary naturalists .
The rise of scientific naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics also coincides with a rise in a broader scientific naturalism , also in part attributable to Quine , which sees all philosophy — not just philosophy of mathematics — as taking place within natural science .
Naturalism also goes hand in hand with a now generally prevalent pessimism about traditional philosophical modes of argumentation .
Some version of naturalism is attractive to virtually all philosophers today .
That the methodologies of mathematics and science are the best we have seems a platitude , which philosophy should try to acknowledge and build on rather than ignore .
The question is how exactly to do so .
The past couple of decades have seen a great surge of interest in naturalism .
1997 was an important year in recent philosophy of mathematics , as it saw the publication of four books articulating the positions of five leading philosophers of mathematics : John Burgess and Gideon Rosen 's A Subject with No Object , Penelope Maddy 's Naturalism in Mathematics , Michael Resnik 's Mathematics as the Science of Patterns , and Stewart Shapiro 's Philosophy of Mathematics .
All four books are to various degrees and amongst other things naturalistic : the first two are naturalist manifestos , the third advocates a Quinean scientific naturalism , and the last , though mainly concerned with other matters , is sympathetic to naturalism .
John Burgess 's naturalism , first set out in his ( 1983 ) and in the past few years elaborated with his colleague Gideon Rosen ( 1997 , 2005 ) , is perhaps most naturally construed as a version of mathematical - cum - scientific naturalism ( 1997 , 211 ) .
Penelope Maddy 's naturalism is a heterogeneous form of naturalism which distinguishes between mathematics proper and the philosophy of mathematics , embracing mathematical naturalism about the former and scientific naturalism about the latter ( section 5 ) .
Another position suggested by Maddy ( 1997 ) is a thoroughgoing mathematical naturalism that takes mathematical standards as authoritative within both mathematics and its philosophy .
Ignoring qualifications , the main contemporary versions of naturalism , with their representative advocates , may be tabulated as follows :
Mathematics Proper Philosophy of
Mathematics Scientific
( Quine ) Scientific Scientific Mathematical - Cum - Scientific
( Burgess ) Mathematical - cum -
Scientific Mathematical - cum -
Scientific Mathematical
(?) Mathematical Mathematical Heterogeneous
( Maddy 1997 ) Mathematical Scientific
To illustrate the difference between statements in mathematics proper and the philosophy of mathematics , consider as an example of the former the Green - Tao theorem , proved in 2004 , which states that the sequence of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions ( but of course no infinitely long one ) ; as examples of the latter take the platonist claim that the number two exists and is abstract or the claim that because mathematical entities are created rather than discovered , impredicative definitions are not permissible .
For any given philosopher , the Green - Tao theorem and its proof are to be assessed by the standards of the first column .
For example , Quine accepts the theorem if and only if it is part of the best systematisation of science ( which it is assuming that the principles from which it is deduced and the logic by which it is deduced from those principles are ) .
Similarly , for any given philosopher , platonism and the stricture regarding impredicativity are to be assessed by the standards of the second column .
For example , Quine accepts platonism because he takes it to be the scientifically sanctioned interpretation of mathematics : in his view , the mathematics contained in the best systematisation of science is platonic .
There are no clear exemplars of the view that mathematical standards should be authoritative in philosophy of mathematics , hence the question mark .
David Lewis flirted with this position in his monograph on set theory ( 1991 , viii–ix , 54 ) , but by the time of his ( 1993 ) had already repudiated it .
The position is suggested by remarks in Maddy ( 1997 ) , though as we will see in section 5 , Maddy ( 1997 ) is more naturally interpreted as advancing a heterogeneous form of naturalism .
Several other philosophers of mathematics are also professed naturalists , notably Alan Baker ( 2001 ) and Mark Colyvan ( 2001 ) .
Like many –isms , naturalism is perhaps better thought of as an orientation with doctrinal implications than as a doctrine per se .
Nevertheless , we may attempt to elucidate it along several dimensions .
How should we understand the claim that some set of standards ought to be authoritative in the philosophy of mathematics ?
We may preserve generality by referring to X - standards , the instances of interest to us being ‘ scientific ’ , ‘ mathematical ’ or ‘ scientific - cum - mathematical ’ .
Here are some ( non-exhaustive ) readings of the authority claim :
Biconditional Naturalism : accept p iff p is sanctioned by X - standards Trumping Naturalism : accept p if p is sanctioned by X - standards .
Emphasis Naturalism :
In assessing whether p , give more emphasis to X - standards .
Compatibility Naturalism : do not accept p if p is incompatible with X - standards .
The biconditional reading is the strongest of the four .
It expresses the thought that valid standards just are X - standards .
In contrast with biconditional naturalism , the trumping version apparently allows that a statement in the philosophy of mathematics may be acceptable even if X - standards do not sanction it .
For instance , Burgess and Rosen express their naturalism as follows :
The naturalists ' commitment is … to the comparatively modest proposition that when science [ understood to include mathematics ] speaks with a firm and unified voice , the philosopher is either obliged to accept its conclusions or to offer what are recognizably scientific reasons for resisting them ( 1997 , 65 ) .
This is naturally glossed as a trumping version of scientific - cum - mathematical naturalism .
It seems to allow that if mathematics and science do not speak with a firm voice on a question , we may accept the verdict of some other discipline .
Emphasis Naturalism is a vaguer doctrine .
Various versions arise depending on how much emphasis is placed on X - standards .
A modest version captures the position of naturalistically - inclined but not outright naturalist philosophers .
We recover biconditional naturalism when X - standards are emphasised to the point where no others matter .
Compatibility naturalism is not as strong as trumping naturalism .
If p is sanctioned by X - standards then compatibility naturalism enjoins the non-acceptance of ¬p but it does not necessarily enjoin the acceptance of p. Non-acceptance of ¬p falls short of acceptance of p since there is always the option to suspend judgment on p .
The compatibility view is generally accepted by most contemporary philosophers .
To take an example from outside the philosophy of mathematics , most philosophers would reject a philosophy of time that clashes with the theory of relativity ( in this case X = science ) .
Within the philosophy of mathematics , most philosophers would reject a philosophy of mathematics that implies , for instance , that complex analysis should be jettisoned ( in this case X could be science , mathematics , or mathematics - cum - science ) .
Various weaker methodological theses are sometimes labelled ‘ naturalist ’ , for instance the rejection of Cartesian foundationalism , but here we understand the term more robustly .
Which of the above variants is the right way to develop naturalism depends of course on how naturalism is motivated ( section 4 ) .
Naturalism sets up an opposition between X - standards ( scientific , mathematical or scientific - cum - mathematical ) and other types of standards , e.g. , astrological , theological , or the standards of common sense .
Another example of standards that the naturalist sees as on the wrong side of the tracks are ‘ fundamental ’ philosophical ones .
Goodman and Quine ( in his pre-naturalist phase ) once began an article by declaring that the basis for their nominalism was a fundamental philosophical intuition irreducible to scientific grounds ( 1947 ) .
Naturalists reject appeal to such standards .
An apparent problem with naturalism is that there do not seem to be sharp boundaries between science and non-science and between mathematics and non-mathematics .
For example , the transition from physics to philosophy of physics to physics - heavy metaphysics to common - or - garden metaphysics seems to be gradual .
When a mathematician writes a research article , an undergraduate textbook , a popular book on mathematics , a book expounding his personal philosophy of mathematics and his psychological associations with various mathematical theories , at what point exactly has he stopped doing mathematics ?
When research mathematicians get together after the seminar and agree over coffee that the Riemann Hypothesis is the most important outstanding problem in mathematics , is this a strictly mathematical claim or a personal judgement recognised by mathematicians as outside the province of mathematics proper ?
Many philosophers follow Quine by citing a standard cluster of principles putatively constitutive of scientific standards : empirical adequacy , ontological economy , simplicity , fertility , and so on ( Quine 1955 , 247 ; Quine and Ullian 1970 , chapter 5 ) .
However , lists of this kind are unsatisfactory for several reasons .
For one thing , the principles come in different versions .
Yet it is doubtful whether the general versions are the scientifically sanctioned ones .
Some writers claim , for example , that scientific appeal to ontological parsimony does not extend to the postulation of abstract objects ( Burgess 1998 ) .
Others maintain that scientific appeals to simplicity are not best captured by the utterly general slogan ‘ Prefer any theory T 1 to any less simple theory T 2 ( in this respect ) ’ ( Paseau 2007 ) .
Moreover , lists of this kind do not tell us how to balance desiderata against one another .
Since the explosion of science studies in the 1960s , more attention is now paid to the nuances of scientific practice .
Yet a more precise articulation of scientific standards and their weights remains elusive .
The existence of an algorithm encapsulating the scientific method is generally questioned ( though many human beings apparently manage to implement the scientific method , so if the method is not algorithmic then neither are our minds ) .
What is not questionable , however , is that its exhibition currently escapes us .
Having said that , it is not clear how serious the boundary problem is for naturalists .
Perhaps they can argue that there is a fairly sharp boundary , though one that is hard to define .
Perhaps mathematicians implicitly know when something counts as a piece of mathematics and when it is a non-mathematical commentary on mathematics .
In any case , naturalism seems to survive the absence of a sharp boundary .
Naturalism can apparently rest its claims on a set of standards with fuzzy boundaries .
What if there are no global scientific standards , but just the standards of this or that part of science ( e.g. , physics or biology , or particle physics or fluid mechanics ) , or even just the standards of this or that group of scientists ?
In that case , scientific naturalism would fragment into several versions ( e.g. , physics - naturalism or biology - naturalism ) .
If the motivation for scientific naturalism points to one of these finer - grained naturalisms over the others ( e.g. , physics - naturalism ) , or if they all return the same verdicts in the philosophy of mathematics , the potential fragmentation is not worrying .
But if not , the scientific naturalist is in trouble , as all these competing naturalisms are by assumption equally valid .
So far scientific naturalists have tended to assume that science operates with a single set of standards .
Plausible though that assumption is , a rigorous naturalist will want to shore it up with detailed case studies .
Similarly for mathematical naturalism and mathematical - cum - scientific naturalism .
Scientific standards sanction propositions to a certain degree rather than outright .
The latest hypothesis at the research coalface adopted tentatively by a few experts does not have the same standing as a long - entrenched theory .
Thus the black - or - white notion of scientific standards sanctioning or not sanctioning p will not do .
( This is an idea which Bayesian confirmation theory takes seriously . )
It might also be argued that this is also true for mathematical standards , for example by considering non-deductive grounds for belief in mathematical propositions .
It seems reasonable to see Goldbach 's Conjecture , the claim that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two primes , as supported to a high degree by the non-deductive evidence currently available for it .
In the absence of a proof of Goldbach 's Conjecture , however , this degree falls short of 1 .
A more precise statement of the naturalist 's creed must therefore issue guidelines for apportioning credence in p in line with the degree and type of commitment to p scientific or mathematical standards recommend .
It would be wrong to equate what X - standards sanction with what X - practitioners believe ( for X = science or mathematics or more generally ) .
For one thing , X - practitioners may not have given a particular question any thought .
For another , X - practitioners might all be mistaken .
Moreover , X - practitioners might self - consciously maintain the opposite of or at any rate something distinct from what X - standards sanction .
For instance , a scientist may believe p , perhaps on the basis of a ‘ gut feeling ’ or on account of some overriding religious convictions or for whatever non-scientific reason , whilst still recognising that scientific standards support not -p .
Or a mathematician may believe that the number 7 has mystical properties but not believe it qua mathematician .
A tighter connection between practitioners and standards , then , might be this : what X - standards sanction is what X - practitioners are disposed to correctly believe qua X - practitioners .
( This is not intended as a reductive analysis . )
Having said that , it takes special pleading to attribute widespread error to the community of X - practitioners regarding what X - standards sanction .
Thus what X - practitioners in fact believe usually serves as good , though defeasible , evidence for what X - standards sanction .
Scientific naturalism as here defined encompasses only natural science ( and likewise for scientific - cum - mathematical naturalism ) .
Broader naturalisms take in not just traditional natural science but also some of the other sciences : perhaps all of social science , perhaps only some of it , perhaps linguistics , perhaps cognitive science .
Note that in later writings Quine himself adopts a broad version of naturalism ( 1995 , 49 ) .
Penelope Maddy has more recently made it clear that the form of scientific naturalism she espouses — ‘ Second Philosophy ’ as she now prefers to call it — is very broad indeed , taking in not only the natural sciences but also psychology , linguistics , sociology , etc. ( 2007 , 2 ) .
Broadening scientific or scientific - cum - mathematical naturalism to include these disciplines has potentially significant consequences for the philosophy of mathematics .
For instance , if semantics falls under the naturalist umbrella it may provide a naturalistic sanction for mathematical realism or platonism , as the face value semantics for mathematics seems to assimilate it to the uncontroversially literal parts of language — a point famously made in Benacerraf ( 1973 ) .
Whether to construe naturalism broadly or narrowly depends on its motivation .
The attractions of scientific or mathematical or scientific - cum - mathematical naturalism lie in the disciplines ' incomparable success ( on some understanding of what this success comes to — see section 4 ) .
At this point in time , however , the non-natural sciences are less successful than the natural sciences .
The less successful one deems the non-natural sciences compared to the natural ones , the less attractive a broader scientific or scientific - cum - mathematical naturalism becomes in comparison with a strictly natural - scientific one .
All naturalists , especially those of the broader variety , have to balance potentially competing standards .
A broad naturalist might decide , say , to give the natural sciences 2/3 - weighting and semantics 1/3 - weighting .
Or she might hold that a proposition in the philosophy of mathematics is acceptable if ( or even : if and only if ) all the sciences , natural or non-natural , sanction it — that is to say , when all the sciences speak with one voice .
These balancing questions have unfortunately not been much addressed by naturalists .
Perhaps that is because questions of this kind arise for everyone : whichever justificatory standards one accepts , the problem of how to adjudicate between them arises .
But to the extent that naturalism is prescriptive and cannot rely on an implicit procedure that is already in place , it owes us an articulation of how to balance different sets of standards .
The balancing issue is particularly pressing for mathematical - cum - scientific naturalists .
A scientific naturalist is in principle happy to say that if a mathematical theory M is scientifically superior but mathematically inferior to another mathematical theory M* then M should be preferred to M* ( the next paragraph contains an example ) .
Mathematical - cum - scientific naturalists , however , may come down on either side , depending on the details of the particular theories : it all depends on whether M's scientific advantages compared to M* are outweighed by its mathematical disadvantages .
Now the philosophy of mathematics does not have an established tradition of weighing mathematical theories ' scientific and mathematical pros and cons against one another ; nor does any other discipline .
So the problem of how to balance mathematical and scientific standards is particularly pressing for the mathematical - cum - scientific naturalist .
To illustrate this problem , suppose , as many philosophers maintain , that the general principle of ontological economy — posit as few entities as possible — is a scientific standard .
Suppose also , as Penelope Maddy maintains , that a set - theoretic version of ontological profligacy — posit as many sets as possible — is a mathematical standard ( this is one way of cashing out the set - theoretic maxim Maddy calls MAXIMIZE ) .
These two standards clash , as Maddy recognises ( 1997 , 131 ) .
Thus given these assumptions a predicativist set theory which posits a relatively small number of sets , say of the kind developed in Hermann Weyl 's Das Kontinuum , might be scientifically superior to ZFC , which posits more sets .
Yet ZFC is generally thought to be mathematically superior to a predicativist set theory .
Perhaps the right diagnosis is that the clash is only superficial , since the correct scientific version of ontological economy is ‘ posit as few concrete entities as possible ’ and the correct mathematical version of ontological profligacy is ‘ posit as many abstract entities as possible ’ .
However that may be in this instance , the mathematical - cum - scientific naturalist has to come up with a general policy for dealing with potential clashes , or argue that no such clashes are possible .
One may simply adopt naturalism without providing an argument or motivation for it .
But motivations for naturalism buttress it , making it internally stronger , and give it dialectical strength , increasing its appeal to non-naturalists .
They answer the fundamental question : why exactly those standards ?
( The same goes for naturalisms primarily conceived as approaches or stances rather than doctrines .
Since the publication of her 1997 book , Penelope Maddy has clarified that her version of naturalism is a stance ( Maddy 2001 ) or a piecemeal approach / method of inquiry ( 2007 , see e.g. , p. 19 fn. 15 , p. 403 ) .
However , stances and approaches to inquiry are attractive to the extent that they are well motivated . )
Naturalism is often thought to be a conservative philosophy of mathematics , as we suggested in section 1 .
But actually things are more complicated .
Each of the three naturalisms of interest is revolutionary in some respect .
Our default view is that mathematical standards decide questions in mathematics proper , for example questions such as whether Fermat 's Last Theorem or the Axiom of Choice is true .
Scientific standards are thought not to affect this : when Andrew Wiles proved Fermat 's Last Theorem in the mid-1990s , he was not particularly concerned with how his proof would go down in physics departments , or more generally its impact on empirical science .
Similarly , the claim that if some large cardinal axiom is not scientifically sanctioned ( perhaps because it leads to no new empirical consequences ) then there is no good reason to accept it is , as Maddy points out , ‘ out of step with the actual practice of set theory ’ ( 1997 , 132 ) , and indeed out of step with the actual practice of much philosophy .
We usually do not judge large cardinal axioms by scientific standards ; we judge them by mathematical standards .
Quine was self - consciously going against the grain when he rejected the higher flights of set theory on scientific grounds ( 1986 , 400 ) .
Scientific naturalism about mathematics proper is thus a philosophically revolutionary view , since it advocates a different set of standards with which to judge mathematics ( scientific ones ) from the traditional ones ( mathematical ) .
It is also potentially revolutionary about mathematics itself , as it might lead to a revision of mathematics .
( Notice that even if scientific naturalism does not entail a revision of mathematics , it still counts as philosophically revolutionary : advocating the replacement of Y - standards with X - standards as the proper arbiters in some domain is philosophically revolutionary even if the Y - standards and X - standards happen to endorse the same claims in that domain . )
Having said that , recent scientific naturalists have tended to be mathematically conservative in temperament and have advocated little or no revision of mathematics .
These morals also apply to mathematical - cum - scientific naturalism , but to a lesser extent , as the latter gives some weight to mathematical standards in mathematical justification .
The third of the three naturalisms of interest , mathematical naturalism , is philosophically but not mathematically revolutionary .
Mathematically , it is as conservative as can be : no standards other than mathematical ones are relevant to the assessment of mathematical claims .
Thus no accepted mathematics is overturned from without .
Yet mathematical naturalism is a revolutionary stance in the philosophy of mathematics .
To see this , suppose that platonism is part of standard , accepted mathematical practice .
In that case , mathematical naturalism entails that there is no further question of its truth .
Loosely put , simply because mathematicians ( qua mathematicians ) are platonists , platonism is the correct philosophy of mathematics .
This is clearly out of step with philosophical practice : philosophers look to mathematicians ' views ( qua mathematicians ) as defeasible data for the philosophy of mathematics , not its conclusion .
Thus we see that the simple characterisation of mathematical naturalism as conservative is not quite right : though mathematically conservative , it is philosophically revolutionary .
In sum , scientific , mathematical , and mathematical - cum - scientific naturalism are each revolutionary in some respect and face a corresponding burden of proof .
We may now appreciate the sense in which the general claim , expressed in section 1 , that naturalism is anti-revisionary is true and the sense in which it is not .
This also shows that contemporary naturalism is different from the latter Wittgenstein 's superficially similar metaphilosophy .
Wittgenstein 's anti-philosophy , like naturalism , bars philosophy from changing mathematics : “ Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language …
It leaves everything as it is .
It also leaves mathematics as it is ” ( 1953 , § 163 ) .
Naturalism 's revolutionary tenor , however , means that it does not leave everything as it is .
Arguments for naturalism are lacking in the literature .
Most naturalists simply posit their naturalism and work downstream from it , hoping that its consequences will prove attractive to the susceptible ( Maddy 2007 , 3 ) .
Naturalism thus effectively becomes a personal credo with little direct attempt to bring anyone else on board : I accept only X - standards in some domain because I find them more credible than others .
Now perhaps at the end of the day one cannot do better .
But we should n't assume that at the outset .
That is all the more important given naturalism 's revolutionary features , as explained earlier .
A conservative theory of justification might sanction naturalism given a broadly naturalist starting point ; but our starting point , as we have seen , is not that of trumping naturalism : it is at most compatibility naturalism .
So an argument for anything more than the mildest version of naturalism would be welcome .
Naturalists are motivated by the thought that scientific or mathematical standards are the most successful standards we possess .
But what does success come to ?
Very roughly , the following could be taken to be a mark of a discipline 's success : ( i ) among its practitioners , there is a widely shared conception of the discipline 's guiding questions and permissible methodology ; and ( ii ) there is progress within the discipline in addressing its guiding questions .
One may then try to argue along these lines that physics is more successful than metaphysics , that psychology is more successful than parapsychology , and that astronomy is more successful than astrology .
An approach of this kind faces a twofold problem .
If anything goes when it comes to methodology , all sorts of disciplines can achieve success without thereby achieving credibility .
Consider Guru-ology , the discipline that takes its guiding questions to be those enunciated by some guru , and lays down as its methodology that acceptable answers are all and only the guru 's pronouncements ( perhaps assuming consistency — so let us assume for good measure that the guru is consistent and more generally probabilistically coherent ) .
These answers could be as fanciful as you like : we leave it to the reader 's imagination to devise examples of outlandish claims made by the guru .
If we suppose that the guru answers each of the questions that he raises , Guru- ology is therefore progressive — it answers all the questions it raises — and it is therefore successful .
But its success speaks nothing of its credibility .
In general , if the success of any given set of standards S is gauged on its own terms , i.e. , by using S - standards , several self - supporting but intuitively unacceptable sets of standards count as successful .
This relativism is clearly not what the naturalist wants .
Likewise for the thought that success is to be determined by how well the standards help us to ‘ cope with reality ’ ; several non-scientific and non-mathematical naturalisms likewise self - vindicate under this criterion .
Perhaps success should instead be measured by how well the standards explain and predict natural phenomena , i.e. , with how they cope with the subject matter of natural science .
But adopting our usual view of how to judge success in this respect would be question - begging in favour of scientific naturalism , since scientific standards are precisely the standards we have developed to cope with this portion of reality .
Compare an astrological naturalism motivated by the idea that success is to be measured by how well the standards explain and predict ‘ astrological phenomena ’ , understood as the astrologers do .
So if a naturalist argument based on success is to succeed , some other naturalistically acceptable but non-question begging understanding of ‘ success ’ must be found .
The second problem with a success argument is that success in one sphere is no indication of success in another .
Biology is rather successful at explaining and predicting biological phenomena .
But why should that give it authority over questions in mathematics or the philosophy of mathematics ?
Likewise for other natural sciences .
As we shall see , this point generalises .
Traditional philosophy , a naturalist might say , leads to endless disagreement .
Science and mathematics , on the other hand , usually reach broad agreement — often consensus — on questions within their domain .
Hence scientific or mathematical standards are to be preferred to others .
( Such arguments from disagreement and lack of convergence in opinion have featured prominently in other areas of philosophy , notably meta-ethics . )
However , the moral that the naturalist wishes to draw from patterns of agreement and disagreement seems unwarranted .
Agreement or disagreement in a community is a contingent matter .
A totalitarian state could achieve community - wide agreement with chilling efficacy by imposing some preferred set of standards on its subjects .
In general , there are countless non-epistemic reasons for agreement or disagreement .
It is therefore not agreement that matters , but rather the explanation of why agreement obtains .
A more sophisticated version of this argument might therefore be based on the tractability of disagreement rather than on its mere presence .
Disagreement is rife in both philosophy and science , but only in the latter , it might be said , is disagreement tractable .
At the very least , progress can be made and perhaps agreement can in principle always be reached .
Actual patterns of agreement and disagreement might then be cited as evidence for the respective tractability or intractability of debates umpired by , say , scientific and non-scientific philosophical standards .
It is beyond the scope of this entry to assess this more sophisticated version of the argument , which in one form or another has recently garnered considerable attention outside the philosophy of mathematics .
However , note a couple of prima facie difficulties .
In order to abstract from the contingencies of our epistemic situation , arguments about tractability usually proceed by considering highly idealised subjects , in particular subjects whose factual , logical , etc. knowledge far exceeds ours .
But the problem with such idealisations is that they seem question - begging .
For example , a theological anti-naturalist would maintain that factually highly - informed subjects will be apprised of facts about supernatural reality .
Our grip on idealised subjects and how disagreement between them is likely to resolve itself may therefore be too loose to draw any substantive morals from such thought experiments .
Either that or such arguments are likely to be question - begging .
Second , we may grant that considerations of tractability reveal that scientific and mathematical standards are more truth - conducive in their respective spheres .
Yet that does not seem to provide a warrant for thinking that they will be successful in other spheres .
( This is the same point we made in connection with the argument from success . )
Perhaps the most promising argument for naturalism is based on historical success .
Scientific and mathematical standards have a better track record than others ; therefore scientific and mathematical standards should be taken as authoritative , in the philosophy of mathematics and elsewhere .
Observe that like the previous two arguments , this argument for naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics is an argument for global naturalism .
Some naturalists have explicitly relied on this motivation .
For example , Lewis uses it to reject structuralism as the correct philosophy of set theory in Parts of Classes ( 1991 , 58 –9 ) even if he disclaims it as an argument ; see also Colyvan ( 2001 , 33 ) , Shapiro ( 1997 , 30 ) and Burgess ( 1998 , 197 ) .
There is much to say about the argument , explored in Paseau ( 2005 ) .
Here we content ourselves with two critical observations .
Since philosophers deploy apparently different standards , it is not clear what it means to say that philosophy as a whole has a poor historical track record .
Consider the early Popper ( 1935 ) , who held that no amount of evidence can make an unfalsified theory probable ( or at least no more probable than any other unfalsified theory ) .
This is the kind of example David Lewis wields to poke fun at philosophy : surely — surely — the standards that led to this conclusion are not trustworthy .
The theory of relativity is undoubtedly more probable than the as yet unfalsified hypothesis that the world will end in the year 2525 .
Yet if I do not share Popper 's 1935 standards , the fact that his then philosophy of science is from my point of view manifestly wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my own philosophical standards .
Similarly , take Thomas Aquinas , whose philosophical standards included consonance with the Bible and more generally with the tenets of the Christian faith .
If I am not a Christian , the fact that Aquinas ' philosophical theology is from my point of view wrong does nothing to shake my faith in my philosophical standards .
Thus , that Sir Karl or St Thomas ' standards were , as I see it , no good does not tend to undermine my faith in my own .
I may therefore agree with the naturalist that philosophy has a worse track record than science and mathematics .
But it does not follow that the ( non-scientific or non-mathematical ) standards that I use have a poor track record .
If philosophers have consistently assumed a more or less uniform set of standards over the course of history , and if I too follow in that tradition by accepting them as mine , and furthermore if these standards demonstrably have a poorer track record than scientific or mathematical standards , that would be a reason for me to turn naturalist .
But the first assumption is at least questionable , and it is not clear what remains of the argument from history if my standards ' antecedents do not have a poor track record .
A second problem with the argument has to do with its application to philosophical questions .
Let us agree that scientific standards have a good track record when it comes to answering scientific questions , that mathematical standards have a good track record when it comes to answering mathematical questions , and moreover that these track records are better than philosophical standards ' track record in answering philosophical questions .
These facts , however , do not seem to be relevant to the issue of which standards should be treated as authoritative when it comes to philosophical questions .
A good track record in one sphere is not in itself evidence for truth - conduciveness in another .
This by now familiar objection may be illustrated by considering the debate between platonists and structuralists in the philosophy of mathematics .
Platonists interpret ‘ 1 + 2 = 3 ’ as a claim about abstract objects .
Structuralists on the other hand interpret ‘ 1 + 2 = 3 ’ as a claim about what is the case in any structure that satisfies the axioms of arithmetic .
( Here we are thinking of structuralism as the type of view often labelled ‘ eliminative structuralism ’ following Charles Parsons , and whose most sophisticated book - length — and modal — version may be found in Hellman ( 1989 ) . )
Naturalists claim that mathematical standards have been more successful in the past and hence should be trusted on this issue .
But it is by no means clear that this is the type of question concerning which mathematical standards have a better track record than philosophical ones .
Mathematical standards have a good track record when it comes to questions such as whether 1 + 2 is equal to 3 , or what the series 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + … converges to , or whether the Poincaré Conjecture ( concerning the classification of 3 - manifolds ) is true ; but they do not have a proven track record when it comes to questions such as whether these truths are platonist or structuralist .
( A related objection to the argument is that scientific standards do not speak to questions of interpretation , such as the question of which of platonism or structuralism to prefer .
Cf. Paseau ( 2007 ) . )
In sum , the need for naturalists to develop these arguments or to produce better ones remains pressing .
So far we have considered three uniform types of methodological naturalism relating to mathematics : scientific , mathematical , and mathematical - cum - scientific .
Consider now a heterogeneous methodological naturalism that accepts mathematical standards when it comes to mathematics proper but adopts scientific standards for the philosophy of mathematics and for philosophy more generally .
Heterogeneous naturalism has been advanced by Penelope Maddy ( 1997 ) , whose rich contributions have animated and incomparably influenced the debate on naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics over the past twenty years .
( Maddy now prefers to call her naturalism ‘ Second Philosophy ’ , as in the title of her 2007 book , but here we maintain the label ‘ naturalism ’ in keeping with the rest of the entry . )
To begin with , a representative quotation from Maddy :
Where Quine holds that science is ‘ not answerable to any supra-scientific tribunal , and not in need of any justification beyond observation and the hypothetico - deductive method ’ … , the mathematical naturalist adds that mathematics is not answerable to any extra-mathematical tribunal and not in need of any justification beyond proof and the axiomatic method ( 1997 , 184 ) .
In our terminology , Maddy 's heterogeneous naturalism is a trumping thesis .
As she puts it , ‘ if our philosophical account of mathematics comes into conflict with successful mathematical practice , it is the philosophy that must give ’ ( 1997 , 161 ) .
Neither philosophy nor science can overturn mathematics ' ‘ methodological verdicts ’ ( 2007 , 361 ) , since they are both extra-mathematical tribunals .
However , Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics as opposed to mathematics proper to be a branch of natural science , as she explains in the following passage :
So naturalistic philosophy of mathematics takes place within natural science , like naturalistic philosophy of science , but unlike naturalistic philosophy of science , it takes a hands - off attitude toward the naturalized model of mathematical practice ( 1997 , 202 ) .
These and similar passages ( especially 1997 , 200 –203 ) indicate that Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics to be answerable to ( natural - ) scientific standards .
The distinctiveness of heterogeneous naturalism is thus that it recommends one set of standards ( mathematical ) for settling some questions about mathematics — mathematical ones , such as which axioms to choose — and another set of standards ( scientific ) for settling other questions about mathematics left open by the practice itself — philosophical ones , such as how to interpret mathematics .
This is in contrast to uniform naturalisms in the philosophy of mathematics , for example Quinean scientific naturalism , or Burgessian mathematical - cum - scientific naturalism , or a uniformly mathematical naturalism ( also suggested by Maddy ( 1997 ) but in our view ultimately not advocated there ) .
To explain how this bivalent attitude might work in practice , take Maddy 's favourite example : set theory .
Suppose that ZFC + LCA is our current accepted set theory , where LCA is some collection of large cardinal axioms .
Given mathematical naturalism about mathematics proper , there is no question of rejecting ZFC + LCA in favour of , say , ZFC + the axiom that there are no inaccessibles , or some other set theory , say Quine 's New Foundations .
Mathematical standards sanction ZFC + LCA , so that is the set theory we must accept .
But how should we interpret ZFC + LCA ?
Platonistically , structurally or in some other way ?
That is a philosophical question , so given scientific naturalism about the philosophy of mathematics ( and philosophy more generally ) its correct answer is that sanctioned by scientific standards .
For example , if an overriding scientific criterion of simplicity favours platonism over all other interpretations , that must be the correct interpretation of ZFC+LCA .
Maddy motivates her naturalism by appeal to the “ fundamental spirit that underlies all naturalism : the conviction that a successful enterprise , be it science or mathematics , should be understood or evaluated on its own terms , that such an enterprise should not be subject to criticism from , and does not stand in need of support from , some external , supposedly higher point of view ” ( 1997 , 184 ) .
One strained reading of this sentence is that naturalism 's fundamental conviction by definition applies only to natural science and mathematics .
A more natural reading is that it applies to any successful science whatsoever .
Maddy then claims that as a matter of fact non-mathematical grounds have not impinged on mathematics .
We can express this as the thesis that mathematics is autonomous .
The assessment of Maddy 's heterogeneous naturalism consists principally in the assessment of the autonomy thesis regarding mathematics and its implications .
One question is whether the thesis is true .
Another is whether , if true , the thesis supports heterogeneous naturalism .
Maddy claims that the correct model of mathematical justification will vindicate the hypothesis that traditionally scientific or philosophical arguments do not enter into the justification of mathematical statements .
For example , the French analysts Baire , Borel and Lebesgue criticised the Axiom of Choice on the basis of a definabilist methodology , according to which the existence of an object depends on its definability : functions should be definable rules , membership of a set should given in a definable way , etc .
But definabilism ended up having no influence on the practice of mathematics , and its sympathisers were silenced or gave up on it when its mathematically undesirable features became clear .
For example , the Axiom of Choice allows the taking of maximal ideals in rings and other structures ; it entails the kinds of maximality principles that even the analysts were already using ; it simplifies transfinite arithmetic ; and despite its suspicious abstractness it turns out to be equivalent to ‘ concrete ’ and ‘ mathematical ’ statements such as the claim that every vector space has a basis .
The reasons for accepting the Axiom of Choice were in the end purely mathematical .
Maddy also offers an admirably detailed account of the kinds of mathematical reasons that militate against the ‘ Axiom ’ of Constructibility , V = L , in particular the fact that its adoption goes against the set - theoretical maxim MAXIMIZE , which enjoins that the universe of sets should be as expansive as possible ( by containing as many isomorphism types as possible ) .
Most commentators have let the descriptive component of Maddy 's naturalism , the autonomy thesis , pass , focusing criticism instead on its normative implications .
Yet the autonomy thesis is very radical .
The usual picture of the interaction between mathematics and philosophy is of a two - way street .
In particular , it is usually thought that philosophy impinges to some degree on mathematical practice .
Intuitionists for example take the dependence to be profound : they think that all of mathematical practice rests on a false philosophical foundation and that once that foundation is removed , mathematics totters .
Maddy willingly concedes that philosophical doctrines such as definabilism or realism are important inspirations for mathematical development even if they fall short of justifications ( 1997 , 192 ) .
And she accepts that “ theories of mathematical truth or existence or knowledge do in fact appear in most mathematical debates over proper methods , alongside more typically mathematical considerations ” ( 2007 , 348 ) .
But she maintains that such theories have not in the end played an ‘ instrumental role ’ ( 2007 , 359 ) , and that they have racked up a ‘ track record of irrelevance ’ ( 2007 , 366 ) in the development of mathematics .
So do philosophical ( or more generally non-mathematical ) considerations always fall on the side of inspiration rather than justification ?
Well , philosophical considerations are hardly ever advanced in mathematical journals or books .
And whenever they are Maddy sees them as amounting , when one scratches the surface , to ‘ intra - mathematical ’ arguments ( 1997 , 193 ) , of which a naturalized model of the practice would be ‘ purified ’ , because of their methodological irrelevance ( 1997 , 197 ) .
If she is right , this reply generalises from this particular , rather restricted , type of context to all mathematical contexts .
One of the implications of this view is that the kinds of maxims Maddy sees as purely internal to mathematics , such as MAXIMIZE or UNIFY , are never themselves underlain by philosophical beliefs .
UNIFY is a methodological consequence of set theory 's foundational ambition of providing ‘ a single system in which all objects and structures of mathematics can be modelled or instantiated ’ ( 1997 , 208–9 ) .
Yet perhaps UNIFY and set theory 's foundational ambition — the fact that as Maddy correctly observes , “ set theory is ( at least partly ) designed to provide a foundation for classical mathematics ” ( 2007 , 355 ) — are themselves in some small way , perhaps to some slight degree , underpinned by set - theoretic realism , i.e. , the view that set theory is about a single universe of sets .
Likewise for the Axiom of Choice , which on the surface owes its place in the set - theoretic canon partly — perhaps only to a small degree — to an ingrained realism about set theory .
Several set theorists are on record as making claims to that effect , so the burden of proof is on Maddy to explain away these remarks .
Maddy also employs the following problematic style of argument .
She thinks that the fact that philosophical debates ( e.g. , about realism ) are wide open but that mathematics has developed in a particular way ( e.g. , to allow impredicative methods ) shows that philosophical debates have not affected the outcome of modern mathematics ( e.g. , 2007 , 348 ) .
But the fact that a debate about realism is wide open in philosophy does not mean that it is wide open in mathematics .
Perhaps mathematicians have implicitly taken a realist stance , which in part underlies their acceptance of impredicativity , even as philosophers continue to debate the correctness of realism as a philosophy of mathematics .
Mathematics may be philosophically parti pris , which is why it has developed the way it has .
These points against the autonomy thesis are hardly conclusive .
To evaluate it , greater clarity is required on where the boundary between justification and inspiration lies and what exactly it means to say that something falls on one side or the other .
And of course we then need to identify more precisely which of the factors in the evolution of mathematics are justificationally operative and which idle .
However , even if the autonomy thesis is not true , perhaps it is almost true .
And perhaps nothing quite as strong as an autonomy thesis is required to support trumping as opposed to biconditional naturalism .
That a statement - issuing practice is as a matter of fact autonomous does not entail that its statements are thereby acceptable .
Practices may be hermetically sealed from outside influence ( e.g. , astrology , dogmatic theology ) , but that does not in itself make their claims acceptable .
What makes mathematics different ?
Maddy recognises this problem for her position ( 1997 , 203 –5 ; 2005 , 449 ; 2007 , 346–7 ) , which reviews and discussions of her work have seized upon ( e.g. , Dieterle 1999 , Rosen 1999 , Roland 2007 ; only Tappenden ( 2001 ) is more sympathetic ) .
She addresses it by making a distinction between pure and applied disciplines .
Taking astrology as a foil , she notes that applied astrology may be construed as making claims about the empirical world .
Using her ordinary scientific standards , the scientific naturalist appreciates that applied astrology is false ( as it diverges from the accepted scientific story ) .
Hence applied astrology does not deserve the naturalist 's respect .
Pure astrology in contrast is astrology interpreted as treating of ‘ certain supernatural vibrations that do n't interact causally with ordinary physical phenomena ’ ( 1997 , 204 ) .
However , there is no reason to believe in pure astrology , since it does not feature in our best scientific theory of the world .
On either interpretation , then , astrology is disanalogous to mathematics .
Maddy seems to want to have her cake and eat it .
The reason for mathematics ' credibility is supposed to be its application in science .
But why should the fact that mathematics features in our best science be a reason for believing mathematicians ' utterances — that is , a reason for taking them to be true ?
The suspicion is that if featuring in best science is the mark of credibility , it should be scientific standards that ultimately determine mathematical theories ' acceptability .
Maddy has indeed cited a feature distinguishing mathematics from pure astrology , as she points out ( 2007 , 390 ) ; but what still remains unclear is why this feature should make mathematics rather than science authoritative with respect to questions in mathematics proper .
Thus it seems that she has not explained how one can consistently be a mathematical naturalist about mathematical theories but a scientific naturalist about everything else , including the truth and nature of mathematics .
More generally , given that a practice issues in truth - evaluable statements , it seems that one cannot advocate X - standards as the arbiters of these statements ' acceptability while simultaneously advocating a different set of standards , the Y - standards , as arbiters of whether or not the statements should be taken as true , how they should be interpreted , etc .
Notice that this is a problem faced exclusively by heterogeneous as opposed to uniform naturalism .
The only way to avoid this apparent inconsistency is to suppose that to ‘ accept ’ a statement sanctioned by mathematical practice — a statement to which the autonomous practice of mathematics gives the thumbs - up — does not amount to taking it as true .
Although suggested by a couple of passages in Maddy ( 1997 ) , this interpretation is not one that can seriously be put on her book .
Besides , it is tantamount to scientific naturalism in all but name .
It amounts to the claim that whatever mathematicians spend their time saying , doing , and publishing should not be interfered with , but that we should be mindful only to believe those mathematical claims sanctioned on scientific grounds , whether or not they are given the thumbs - up in mathematicians ' language - game .
This picture has recently been complicated by Maddy 's claims that what she calls Arealism — not taking set theory and more generally mathematics to be true — may be just as scientifically respectable as Thin Realism — roughly , the view that sets have only the properties ascribed to them by set theory ( 2007 , IV.4 ) .
This entry does not have space to do justice to this twist in Maddy 's metaphilosophy .
Suffice it to note the following .
The issues just discussed seem to arise for the Thin Realist just as much as any other kind of realist .
And the Arealist construal seems to transform Maddy 's position into something quite different from the heterogeneous naturalism under consideration here .
Turning away from methodological naturalism , consider now ontological naturalism , the view that all entities are natural .
One way to read this is that only the entities posited by the natural sciences exist .
A second and perhaps more natural reading is that only spatiotemporal entities exist .
We address both readings briefly in this final section , and take in epistemological naturalism briefly in 6.3 .
On its first reading , ontological naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics is a straightforward consequence of methodological scientific naturalism .
It states that the ontology of mathematics is the mathematical ontology of our best natural science .
Scientific platonists claim , following Quine and Putnam , that this ontology is platonist , as do mathematical - cum - scientific platonists ( e.g. , Burgess and Rosen ( 1997 ) ) .
Resistance to scientific platonism and the associated indispensability argument has been mounted on several fronts ( e.g. , Field 1980 , Sober 1993 , Maddy 1997 , ch. II.6 , Paseau 2007 ) .
Consult Colyvan ( 2011 ) for a detailed discussion .
The second reading of ontological naturalism , according to which all entities are spatiotemporal , amounts to a version of anti-platonism in the philosophy of mathematics .
The position subdivides .
On a reductionist view , mathematics is taken at logico - grammatical face value but its objects ( numbers , functions , sets , etc. ) are taken to be spatiotemporal .
This view is advocated for sets in Armstrong ( 1991 ) and more generally in Bigelow ( 1988 ) .
Non-reductionist views are manifold .
They include taking mathematics as meaningless symbol - manipulation ( formalism ) , or as the exploration of what is true in all structures obeying the axioms ( structuralism ) , or as the exploration of what is true in all possible structures obeying the axioms ( modal - structuralism ) .
Bueno ( forthcoming ) discusses various nominalisms , i.e. , views which countenance only spatiotemporal entities .
Since many of these nominalisms are compatible with non-naturalist as well as ontologically naturalist motivations , we do not discuss them here .
We concentrate on a handful of issues relating mainly to reductionist versions of ontological realism .
Reductionist ontological naturalism and non-modal structuralism about set theory face an immediate problem : there are apparently far fewer entities in spacetime than there are sets .
Even on the most liberal assumptions ( spacetime points and arbitrary regions thereof exist , some smallish infinity of entities may be collocated at any of these points or regions ) , the size of spacetime and the objects in it is a relatively low infinite cardinality ( surely no more than ω — even that is generous ) .
Thus there are not enough spatiotemporal entities to interpret set theory literally nor to make a structural interpretation of set theory non-vacuously true , and hence to ensure that set - theoretic falsehoods come out false rather than true .
See Paseau ( 2008 ) for discussion of this and other problems for set - theoretic reductionism .
Another problem is that even if spacetime were large enough to provide either a model for a literal interpretation of set theory or an instance for its structural interpretation , this would be a contingent fact about our universe .
Set theory would be true but contingent .
Since we typically think of mathematics as necessary , however , this is an untoward consequence for a philosophy of mathematics .
Some might even call it a reductio .
Versions of these problems also affect Mill 's empiricism ( 1843 ) .
For Mill , mathematics and logic are natural sciences , and their principles are laws of nature .
Arithmetic , for instance , is the theory of aggregates , i.e. , the theory of collections of concrete entities .
Geometry is the theory of idealised limits of concrete entities — lines , points , planes and so on — whose principles are “ real facts with some of their circumstances exaggerated or omitted ” ( Mill 1843 , vol. 1 , bk. II , ch.v ) .
Millian philosophy of mathematics is susceptible to the cardinality problem just given .
( Of course this is an anachronistic criticism , since infinitary set theory had yet to be developed in Mill 's time . )
As for the contingency of mathematics , Mill bit the bullet and accepted it .
A related problem for a Millian view , which arises even for the mathematics of Mill 's day , is a dilemma concerning the existence of aggregates of aggregates , aggregates of aggregates of aggregates … .
Higher - order aggregates , if they exist , can only be abstract — what else ?
But if they do not exist — if there are only first - order aggregates — then in particular there are no numbers of numbers , for instance it is meaningless or false to say that there are two primes between 20 and 30 .
Kitcher ( 1983 ) is an attempt to resuscitate Mill 's philosophy of mathematics by modalising it .
It accounts for mathematical truth in terms of the operations of a possible but non-actual ideal agent , and thus falls under the heading of modalist philosophies of mathematics .
( Though Kitcher himself is not fond of the label ( 1983 , 121–2 ) . )
Other apparent problems for reductionist ontological naturalism include the problem of arbitrariness and the fact that it goes profoundly against mathematical method .
Suppose arithmetic is the study of some particular spatiotemporal entities .
Very well ; but which ones ?
Surely it is arbitrary which spatiotemporal entity is chosen as the number zero .
This criticism is a version of a general anti-reductionist argument presented in Benacerraf ( 1965 ) .
The response to it is usually that reductionism does not seek to uncover the meaning of number terms but instead proposes a theoretical identification ( Paseau 2009 ) .
The charge of contradicting mathematical method is a serious one too .
If mathematical objects are spatiotemporal , why do mathematicians not perform experiments to discover their properties ?
If mathematics were genuinely concerned with the spatiotemporal , surely its methodology would be more empirical .
Ontological naturalist views of the type discussed are for these and related reasons seen as problematic , and are consequently unpopular .
Whatever their motivation , ontological naturalists are by definition ( on this second reading of the doctrine ) agreed that platonism is false .
Sometimes ontological naturalism is motivated by metaphysical doctrines , for instance by the principle that everything that exists has causal powers .
Subscribers to this principle include Armstrong ( 1997 ) who calls it the Eleatic Principle ; for criticism , see Colyvan ( 2001 ch. 3 ) and Papineau ( 2009 ) .
The most popular argument for ontological naturalism is epistemological , and consequently ontological naturalism is often allied with epistemological naturalism .
If there are abstract entities then it seems we cannot know nor form reliable beliefs about them ( Benacerraf 1973 , Field 1989 ) , because of their causal isolation from us .
Most philosophers take this to be the main problem afflicting platonism .
Note that the argument typically leads to agnosticism rather than denial of abstract mathematical objects ' existence .
This is not the place to engage with the argument — for more details , see Balaguer ( 2009 ) — save to sketch how a platonist who is also a scientific or mathematical - cum - scientific naturalist — e.g. , Quine — responds to it .
The naturalist - platonist response is two - pronged ( Burgess and Rosen 1997 , 2005 ; for criticism , see Linnebo 2006 , Chihara 2006 ) .
The first prong is that no simple criterion for knowledge ( or reliable belief or justified belief ) has ever been devised that succeeds in ruling out knowledge of the abstract without thereby ruling out types of knowledge most naturalists would accept ( Steiner 1975 ) .
A couple of examples : ( i ) the condition that p is a cause of the belief that p is too strong , as it rules out knowledge of the future ; ( ii ) as the naturalist - platonist sees it , that abstract mathematical reality is thus - and - so is in fact part of the best explanation for the belief that p ; hence an explanatory condition of this kind turns out to be compatible with platonism .
Moreover , naturalist - platonists complain that even if a criterion were found that draws the line where the nominalist wishes it to be drawn , it would beg the question against platonism .
Secondly , naturalist - platonists run a standard Quinean line by construing any challenge to the reliability of our beliefs about platonic mathematical objects as a general challenge to the scientific method 's reliability .
( This is from the point of view of the scientific naturalist ; the scientific - cum - mathematical naturalist can run the same line with corresponding adjustments . )
However , by our best lights — according to our best theory of the world , i.e. , natural science , which posits abstract mathematical objects — belief in abstract mathematical entities is arrived at by a reliable method , namely the scientific method .
This is not simply self - vindication , since the scientific method is here being used to explain the reliability of mathematical beliefs , albeit holistically .
But of course if the reliability of the scientific method itself is put into question , the naturalist has no choice but to use the scientific method itself to explain its own reliability .
The naturalist - platonist may add that we can do no better , and that anyone who questions the scientific method 's reliability has thereby abandoned the naturalist camp .
From this perspective , then , there is no epistemological problem for platonism once it is settled that platonist mathematics is part of best science .

At a taped video interview in my office , before the crew would start the camera , a man had to remove my Picasso prints from the wall .
The prints are probably under copyright , they said .
But the guy who drew them died 30 years ago .
Besides , they are mine .
Does n't matter .
They have to go .
What about the poor fellow who painted the wall behind the prints ?
Why does n't he have a copyright ?
If I scrape off the paint , there is the drywall and its creator .
Behind the drywall are the boards , which are surely proprietary too .
To avoid the " intellectual - property " thicket , maybe we have to sit in an open field ; but there is the problem of the guy who last mowed the grass .
Then there is the inventor of the grass to consider .
Is there something wrong with this picture ?
The worldly - wise say no .
This is just the way things are .
It is for us not to question but to obey .
So it is with all despotisms in human history .
They become so woven into the fabric of daily life that absurdities are no longer questioned .
Only a handful of daring people are capable of thinking along completely different lines .
But when they do , the earth beneath our feet moves .
Such is the case with Against Intellectual Monopoly ( Cambridge University Press , 2008 ) by Michele Boldrin and David Levine , two daring professors of economics at Washington University in St. Louis .
They have written a book that is likely to rock your world , as it has mine .
( It is also posted on their site with the permission of the publisher . )
With piracy and struggles over intellectual property in the news daily , it is time to wonder about this issue , its relationship to freedom , property rights , and efficiency .
You have to think seriously about where you stand .
This is not one of those no - brainer issues for libertarians , like minimum wage or price controls .
The problem is complicated , and solving it requires careful thought .
But it is essential that every person do the thinking , and there is no better tool for breaking the intellectual gridlock than this book .
The issue is impossible to escape , from the grave warnings you get from the FBI at the beginning of " your " DVD to the posters warning kids never to download a song to the outrageous settlements transferring billions from firm to firm .
It even affects the outrageous prices you pay for medicine at the drug store .
The issue of " intellectual property " is a ubiquitous part of modern life .
Some of the police - state tactics used to enforce IP have to make anyone with a conscience squeamish .
You have surely wondered about the right and wrong of all this , but , if you are like most people , you figure that copyrights and patents are consistent with the justice that comes from giving the innovator his due .
In principle they seem fine , even if the law might be in need of reform .
The first I 'd ever thought critically about issues of intellectual property was in reading about it in the abstract many years ago .
The Austrian position has traditionally favored copyrights on the same grounds it has favored property rights in general , but has tended to oppose patents on grounds that they are government grants of monopolistic privilege .
Machlup , Mises , and Rothbard — as well as Stigler , Plant , and Penrose — have discussed the issue but not at great length and with varying levels of cautious skepticism .
That changed in 2001 with the publication of Stephan Kinsella 's article and now monograph " Against Intellectual Property . "
He made a strongly theoretical argument that ideas are not scarce , do not require rationing , are not diminished by their dissemination , and so cannot really be called property .
All IP is unjust , he wrote .
It is inconsistent with libertarian ethics and contrary to a free market .
He favors the complete repeal of all intellectual - property laws .
The argument initially struck me as crazy on its face .
As I considered it further , my own view gradually changed : it 's not crazy , I thought , but it is still pie - in - the - sky theorizing that has nothing to do with reality .
Kinsella 's article appeared just before the explosive public interest in this subject .
The patent regime has in the meantime gone completely wild , with nearly 200,000 patents issued every year in the United States , and half a million more in other countries — with 6.1 million patents in effect worldwide — and large firms collecting stockpiles of them .
And the copyright issue has led to a massive struggle between generations : young people live by " pirating " music , movies , software , whereas the old consider this practice to presage the end of the capitalist system as we know it .
The music industry has spent billions trying to contain the problem and only ended up engendering consumer embitterment and terrible public relations .
Kinsella 's article continued to haunt me personally .
It took about six years or so , but I finally worked through all the theoretical problems and came to embrace his view , so you might say that I was predisposed to hear what these authors have to say .
What I had n't realized until encountering the Boldrin / Levine book was just how far - reaching and radical the implications of a detailed look at IP really is .
It is not just a matter of deciding what you believe from a theoretical or political perspective .
It is not just a matter of thinking that " pirates " are not really violating moral law .
To fully absorb what these authors say changes the way you look at technology , at history , at the ebbs and flows of economic development , and even who the good guys and bad guys are in the history of civilization .
Kinsella deals expertly with the theoretical aspects , while Against Intellectual Monopoly does n't really go into the theory at great length .
What this amazing book deals with is the real - world practice of intellectual - property regulation now and in history .
I can make a personal guarantee that not a single objection you think you have to their thesis goes unaddressed in these pages .
Their case is like the sun that melts all snow for many miles in all directions .
The implications are utterly shattering , and every day I 've turned the pages in the Boldrin / Levine book I 've felt that sense of intellectual stimulation that comes along rarely in life — that sense that makes you want to grab anyone off the street and tell that person what this book says .
It helps you understand many things that had previously been confusing .
The emergent clarity that comes from having absorbed this work is akin to what it must feel like to hear or see for the first time .
If they are right , the implications are astonishing .
Their main thesis is a seemingly simple one .
Copyright and patents are not part of the natural competitive order .
They are products of positive law and legislation , imposed at the behest of market winners as a means of excluding competition .
They are government grants of monopolies , and , as neoclassical economists with a promarket disposition , the authors are against monopoly because it raises prices , generates economic stagnation , inhibits innovation , robs consumers , and rewards special interests .
What they have done is apply this conventional model of monopoly to one of the most long - lasting , old - world forms of mercantilist / monopolistic institutional privilege , a surviving form of mercantilist privilege of the 16th century .
IP is like a dam in the river of development , or perhaps very large boulders that impede the flow .
They too favor its total repeal but their case goes far beyond the theoretical .
They convince you that radical , far - reaching , uncompromising , revolutionary reform is essential to our social well - being now and in the future .
The results are dazzling and utterly persuasive .
I personally dare anyone who thinks that he believes in patent or copyright to read this book and deal with it .
For this reason , I 'm thrilled that the Mises Institute is now carrying the book to give it the broadest possible exposure .
I 'm not sure what aspect of their case is the most powerful .
Here are just a few examples :
They show that people like James Watt , Eli Whitney , and the Wright Brothers are not heroes of innovation , as legend has it , but rent - seeking mercantilists who dramatically set back the cause of technological development .
These people spent vast resources prohibiting third parties from improving " their " product and making it available at a cheaper price .
Instead of promoting innovation and profitability , they actually stopped it , even at the cost of their own business dreams .
The authors show that every great period of innovation in human history has taken place in the absence of intellectual property , and that every thicket of IP has ended up stagnating the industries to which they apply .
Think of the early years of the web , in which open - source technology inspired breakneck development , until patents and copyright were imposed with the resulting cartelization of operating systems .
Even today , the greatest innovations in digital communications come from the highly profitable open - source movement .
It is impossible to develop software without running into IP problems , and the largest players are living off IP and not innovation .
Meanwhile , the most profitable and most innovative sector of the web , the porn sector , has no access to courts and IP enforcement because of the stigma associated with it .
It is not an accident that absence of IP coincides with growth and innovation .
The connection is causal .
And look at the industries that do not have IP access , such as clothing design and architecture and perfume .
They are huge and fast moving and fabulous .
First movers still make the big bucks , without coercing competition .
Boldrin and Levine further speculate that IP is behind one of the great puzzles of the last millennium : stagnation in classical music .
The sector is seriously burdened and tethered by IP .
Other mysteries are answered .
Why no musical composition of note in England after 1750 ?
England had the world 's most strict copyright laws .
Why was English literature so popular in the United States in the 19th - century schoolrooms ?
It could be imported without copyright restriction — and therefore sold cheaply — whereas American authors used IP and limited their market .
And consider the irony that Disney , which relies heavily on IP , got its start and makes it largest profits by retelling public - domain stories !
Examples like this abound .
One wonders if the modern history of literature and art needs to be completely rewritten .
Examples will occur to you that are not discussed in the book , such as fan fiction .
It is technically illegal , so far as anyone can tell , to take a copyrighted character and tell a story about him even if the story is original .
And yet Harry Potter fan - fiction sites enjoy tens of millions of hits per month .
One hosts 5,000 pieces of fan fiction , some as long as 1,000 pages .
Enforcement has been spotty and unpredictable .
And yes , the book covers the poster child of the IP world : pharmaceuticals .
They muster plenty of evidence that IP here does nothing to promote innovation and widespread availability and is largely responsible for the egregiously high prices of drugs that are driving the system toward socialization .
The authors explore the very strange tendency of capitalists to misdiagnose the source of their profits in a world of IP , spending far more on beating up pirates than they would have earned in a free market .
They further demonstrate that IP is a form of exploitation and expropriation that is gravely dangerous for civilization itself .
In short , they have taken what might seem to be merely a geeky concern and moved it to the center of discussion over economic development itself .
What about the far - flung conclusion that IP should be repealed ?
The authors take away your fears .
The development of IP came about in the 16th century as a mechanism for governments to enforce political control and punish dissenters .
The cause of this " property right " was then taken over by individuals in the 18th and 19th century as part of the liberal revolution for individual rights .
In the 20th century , it was transferred again , to corporations who become the effective owners through copyright .
The creators no longer own anything , and let themselves be beaten and abused by their own publishers and production companies .
Boldrin and Levine 's thesis really steps up this issue .
It makes you wonder how long authors and creators will put up with the nonsense that some company has a state - enforced exclusive to use the work of others for longer than 100 years .
Fortunately , the digital age is forcing the issue , and alternatives like Creative Commons ( roughly akin to what would exist in a free market ) are becoming increasingly popular .
As the tyranny has grown more obvious , the free market is responding .
No , the authors are not really Austrian , and I 'm not even sure that they can be called libertarians , but they understand the competitive process in ways that would make Hayek and Mises proud .
As I 've thought more about their book , it seems that it might suggest a revision in classical - liberal theory .
We have traditionally thought that cooperation and competition were the two pillars of social order ; a third could be added : emulation .
In addition , there is surely work to do here that integrates Hayek 's theory of knowledge with the problem of IP .
A book that must be understood and absorbed by every thinking person
If the book lacks for anything , it is precisely what Kinsella provides : a robust theory behind the practical analytics .
But since Kinsella has already provided this , the value added of real - world application is enormous .
I have a minor nit to pick with them on their passing comment on trademarks , which strikes me as wrong .
Otherwise , this book moves mountains .
In the coming weeks I will blog about this book chapter by chapter , and Mises.org plans a series of excerpts from it .
For now , let me say that a book like this comes along very rarely .
Against Intellectual Monopoly is a relatively small manifesto on economics that absolutely must be understood and absorbed by every thinking person without exception .

In places around the world where people observe Christmas , they do so with a wide variety of religious , secular and folk traditions .
Most traditions are celebrations of the birth of Jesus Christ , ( observed on December 25th in most places , on January 7th by some Eastern Orthodox churches ) , but many incorporate other customs and figures , such as Santa Claus , Father Frost , Saint Nicholas the Krampus and others .
Last Tuesday , January 6th , was Epiphany , the day the Magi became the first religious figures to worship the infant Jesus Christ , and the conclusion of the Twelve Holy Days of the Christmas season .
Here is a collection of people around the world observing traditions and ceremonies of the Christmas Season .

Paul Buchheit has a really nice post on the power of code over talk and has one item that resonated with me :
This is where Google ’s “ 20 % time ” comes in — if you want innovation , it ’s critical that people are able to work on ideas that are unapproved and generally thought to be stupid .
The real value of “ 20 % ” is not the time , but rather the “ license ” it gives to work on things that “ are n’t important ” .
( perhaps I should do a post on “ 20 % time ” at some point … )
That is exactly how I felt about 20 % time .
It was n’t about the time .
In fact , I did n’t actually know that many people who took the time !
The key was the following effect :
In order for 20 % time to work , anyone must be able to see what is out there
In fact , if you want to get some people working “ for free ” you need to both advertise your project , and write it in such a way that it is easy to get ramped up and productive ( end result : better code )
The end result is the culture HAS to be kept very open .
The ability to see the projects that are worked on , check out the code , see presentations and design docs , is a key reason why Google does so well at engineering in my opinion .
Compare this to companies such as Apple where you do n’t know what the chap sitting on the other side of the cube is doing .
Therefore , even if you have some amazing wisdom that could be game changing for his project , it will never happen .
20 % time means that sparks of genius can happen .
If you copy anything about it , ignore the “ time ” part , and go with the open culture part .
Whenever I saw projects that were secret within Google it irked me .
It stopped this from happening .
It was as though that project was going walkabout instead of joining the party .
Immokalee U.S.A. : Bleak but sympathetic view of migrant farmworkers ’ conditions
By James Brewer
19 January 2009
Picking tomatoes : A scene from Immokalee U.S.A .
Directed by Georg Koszulinski
Immokalee U.S.A. , the documentary distributed in DVD format by Substream Independent Films , describes itself as “ an account of migrant farmworkers in the U.S.A . ”
The notes cite this comment from the Maine International Film Festival : “ What is our collective role in this chain of servitude ?
the film seems to ask us , providing an opening for self - reflection rather than didactic sermonizing . ”
The film , directed by Georg Koszulinski , begins slowly and makes clear from the start that it aims to present the reality of the life of the migrant worker without any intervening point of view .
It opens with scenes of different stages of the agricultural process of tomato growing , from planting to harvesting , packing , warehousing and shipping .
First , these processes are shown with as few people as possible , focusing on their mechanization .
Little by little , we see glimpses of the labor force , initially in dark scenes of the Bluebird buses loading up with anonymous looking workers and moving out to the fields well before dawn .
We also see that not everyone who shows up gets to work .
A worker is turned away after having traveled to Immokalee , Florida — in the southern part of the state , 120 miles northwest of Miami — on the promise of work .
He says he has been there fifteen days , and there is nothing for him .
We encounter him later , numerous times throughout the film , on each occasion more demoralized .
An unemployed worker repeatedly tries to make contact with his family in Mexico
It takes a certain effort to watch the film ’s opening sequences .
The viewer is presented with a bleak and rather uninteresting image of this industry , apparently to transmit the harshness of the life the workers are compelled to endure .
It becomes more engaging when we get a glimpse of the mothers and children left behind in the trailer camps , as they get ready for school .
Initially though , these scenes are without dialog of any kind , forcing us to draw our own conclusions from the images we see .
Cute kids , devoted mothers , in many ways like the typical American family .
Eventually dialog is introduced .
The children speak the most directly , sometimes to each other , sometimes to the camera .
“ The man that lives over there hates my daddy , he wants to kill my daddy , ” “ Mommy says when I 'm old enough , I will have to work , but I do n't want to .

In general , Immokalee , U.S.A. presents a highly sympathetic and sincere view of the migrant workers ’ conditions , but it is limited by the liberal outlook with which it is imbued .
We are presented with a sense of the striving of the children and the hopefulness of their mothers for a better future .
How is this to come about ?
This is the fundamental weakness of the film .
It ’s one thing to make a film that does n’t lecture and allows for some spontaneity , permitting an audience to reflect and think for itself .
But a thoroughly hands - off “ see for yourself ” approach to filmmaking sidesteps the critical issues .
The filmmaker ’s responsibility lies in drawing certain conclusions .
Workers are not simply victims .
Nor do migrant laborers face their conditions of life in isolation .
They , like all other workers , will be compelled to seek ways to unite with their class as a whole and struggle for their interests .
Notable films ( documentary or otherwise ) in the past about migrant workers , such as Salt of the Earth , El Norte , even The Grapes of Wrath , had a forcefulness in their depiction of this inclination of the working class to fight against the conditions they face .
Recent decades and global economic changes have brought about the protracted death agony of the official , nationally - based labor movement in the US and exposed its leadership , including the United Farm Workers union , as corrupt and bankrupt .
For decades the AFL - CIO bureaucracy has subsisted on national chauvinism , anticommunism and class collaboration .
Union officials , along with Democratic Party liberals and those who make up the leadership of the so - called “ civil rights ” movement , are indifferent to the plight of the most oppressed layers of the population .
The documentary makers take up an important subject , but what they do with it has a great deal to do with some of these difficulties .
Immokalee U.S.A. is a serious effort at documenting social conditions .
Its shortcomings are perhaps not so much the fault of the filmmakers as they are products of the period .
By Dave Lindorff
The deafening silence from American government officials and from the US media regarding the criminal Israeli assault against civilians in Israel ’s ghetto of Gaza , where nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are trapped every bit as brutally as were the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto , is beyond unconscionable .
' As Israeli shells and bombs and rockets rain down on university buildings , clearly marked ambulances , and homes , it has to be pointed out that much of the ammunition being used , as well as the planes that are delivering this death and mayhem , are provided by the United States and by American taxpayers — with no strings attached .
Media outlets like the New York Times may call “ evenhandedly ” for a cease - fire by “ both sides , ” as though the handful of home - made unguided rockets fired into Israel by Hamas are in any way comparable to the massive assault by the IDF .
But the reality is that it is the Israeli forces , which , thanks to their overwhelming US - supplied and financed firepower , are killing Palestinians on purpose , at a rate of 100:1 compared to Hamas .
It is true that Hamas has been firing its rockets at Israeli towns .
These rockets cannot be aimed except in the crudest fashion .
Whether Hamas rockets hit a house or a school or a military installation is a matter of chance .
And as observers of the conflict have pointed out , the cities being targeted by Hamas pretty much all have military installations located in them , which by the logic of US military strategists , makes them legitimate military targets .
This is not to justify the killings of civilians by Hamas rockets — all such killing is evil and tragic — merely to point out that Hamas is not doing anything that American military forces have n’t done routinely in places like Vietnam , or , more recently , in cities like Baghdad and Fallujah .
Israel , however , does not have the excuse of poor technology to justify its atrocities .
Israel is using the same “ smart ” bombs that American forces use .
It has elaborate satellite and aerial surveillance images to work with .
The same military technology that can pinpoint the location of Hamas commanders and hit them with precise rocket fire , is clearly able to identify whether a vehicle is an ambulance before blasting it with a rocket or a bomb , as the Times reports was done yesterday , killing a Palestinian doctor on a mercy mission .
So let ’s be honest here .
The goal of Israel ’s attack on Gaza ( like America 's attacks on Fallujah and the Sadr City slum in Baghdad ) is a terrorist one — - to frighten the population of Gaza into rejecting the Hamas government that they elected in the last free and fair elections there .
Israel has gone to great lengths to ensure that the world does not know the extent of its crimes against humanity inside of Gaza .
Reporters have been barred from the 10 - mile - by - 1 - mile walled - off ghetto .
Israeli gunboats , patrolling off the coast of Gaza , have driven off boats that have sought to bring reporters and other witnesses to the assault .
In Israel itself , there are protests against this war on a captive people .
Thousands have gathered to protest in Tel Aviv .
Citizens called up as reservists to prepare for a possible land assault on Gaza have refused service , risking jail .
None of this is being reported in the American corporate media , which is largely cheerleading the Israeli attack , primarily by “ evenhandedly ” reporting on the attacks in Gaza and the rockets launched by Hamas into Israel .
As Dov Khenin , an Israeli Knesset member from the leftist Jewish / Arab opposition political party Hadash stated in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now ! , “ Well , the most important thing to realize is that there is an opposition inside Israel to the war and to everything going on around right now in Gaza .
This position is a Jewish - Arab one .
On Saturday night , we had a demonstration in Tel Aviv of 2,000 young people , mainly Jews , and there are a lot of demonstrations all over Israel of Jews and Arabs opposing the war policy of the current government .
This opposition is growing steadily .
It is very important to know this and to understand that there are other voices in Israeli society who ( oppose ) a war , and they believe there is a better alternative for Israelis and Palestinians alike . ”
The ludicrous claim by Israel that its assault on the people of Gaza is justified by the “ right of self - defense ” is absurd on its face .
Gaza is not a foreign country attacking another sovereign nation .
It is a ghetto , maintained by Israel , which controls the walled - in community ’s very life — the flow of fuel for its electric generators , its water , its food , and its medical supplies , and which determines who can enter and who can leave .
Granted , there is a narrow border with Egypt , but Israel , backed by the US , has also used diplomatic efforts to keep that border tightly controlled too , with the complicity of an autocratic Egyptian regime not anxious to be flooded with Palestinian refugees .
It is as if some of the long - suffering poor of Detroit , MI or of Newark , NJ , were to begin firing rockets into the suburbs , and the US were to cordon off the downtowns of those cities , and then launch a weeks ’- long aerial assault on them by the USAF .
Perhaps Americans would be as silent about such a domestic atrocity as they are being about the one Israel is visiting on Gaza today , but I doubt it .
The national outrage at what was done , by acts of commission and omission , in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to the poor residents of the city of New Orleans suggests not .
That we remain callously silent at the ongoing crime against humanity being perpetrated by Israel today on the people of Gaza , with weapons that we have provided , is , I hope , more a reflection of the failure of our jingoistic media to do its job honestly , than of a blind support of those attacks .
The American government — including the government in waiting which , from Barack Obama on down , has maintained a shameful silence over the attacks , with Obama himself even offering support for the Israeli attacks — has no such excuse .
2009 , and the new Obama administration , are off to a terrible start .

Amber Sabathia : CC Sabathia 's Determining Factor in Signing with Yankees ?
may have more than just a little to say aboutsigning with the Yankees .
In fact , it may be a case of Yankees General Managerrecruiting her , more than her star pitcher husband .
It is a widely held believe in the industry that Amber , highly respected among C.C. 's friends , wants her husband to pitch for the Giants .
Amber and C.C. were high school sweethearts and have three small children .
They have deep ties to the San Francisco area .
Sabathia 's third meeting in as many days with the Yankees included Amber , and there are clearly concerns about how living in New York half the year will affect their family 's lifestyle .
The Yankees have inked a deal , adding a seventh year to their six year , $ 140 million offer , upping the ante to $ 160 million - the biggest contract for any pitcher in history .
Money does n't seem to be the determining factor for the Sabathias , who are more concerned about adjusting to life in New York .
A three year opt out clause may be what seals the deal .
After a month of negotiations , the Yankees are confident they have their guy , although all terms of the deal are not agreed to yet .

COLOMBO : In a discovery described as startling , Sri Lankan troops scouring Mullaitivu district in the north have found what appears to be a submarine built by the Tamil Tigers .
The army���s Task Force 3 found the LTTE ���underwater vehicle " , along with three other smaller versions of the same boat , at Udayarkattukulam on Wednesday , the defence ministry said .
" Three suicide boats and a large haul of LTTE maritime equipment were also found at the location , " an army statement said on Thursday .
The biggest �� �submarine��� was about 35 feet long and was armour - plated .
Also recovered were a low - bed trailer , an armour plate used for bending machines , 15 oxy - acetylene welding cylinders , 30 armour plate sheets of 20 feet each , three pedal - type suicide boats , a Dvora - type fast attack craft , a large number of vehicles like trucks , buses and water tankers and equipment like lathe machines , compressors and electric motors .
There were also three ���hangar - shaped buildings " , 15 small tiled - houses of 20 ft x 30 ft dimension and five tiled billets .
The houses and billets were fully air - conditioned .
Meanwhile , in a much delayed medical evacuation operation , the United Nations managed to bring hundreds of wounded civilians , including 50 critically injured children , from the ramshackle hospital inside the war zone to government - controlled Vavuniya town .
Human rights groups and the army had earlier charged the LTTE with preventing their evacuation .
LTTE political head B Nadesan , however , denied the reports and claimed that it was in fact appealing to international aid agencies to shift the patients to Vavuniya immediately .
The LTTE did not oppose any attempt by civilians to leave the combat zone , he said .
This photo basically sums up contemporary American society , no ?
Be it the Youth Ball on Inauguration Day or a Radiohead concert , everyone wants their own unique shot .
Is this obsessive documentation worth it ?

This is definitely something I 've noticed a lot of lately : people are more interested in taking photos of something they 're witnessing than actually , you know , witnessing it .
These people are all looking at LCD screens instead of the new Presidential couple standing in front of them .
Sure , they 'll be able to post the photo to their Facebook accounts , but they 'll ( obviously ) be able to find 100 identical or better photos of the same thing on Flickr when they get home .
Is it more important to take a unique photo to prove you were there or to exist in that moment fully as to remember it better ?
I certainly was n't at the Youth Ball yesterday , but this phenomenon happened when I saw Radiohead last summer .
During the first few songs I could barely see the band due to almost everybody holding up digital cameras ( and I was relatively close , too ) .
These people were n't really paying attention to the show ; they were trying to get their shots or keep their shitty video steady .
And with pro photographers in the pit up front and hundreds of other people doing the exact same thing , there was just no point .
Thankfully , people started putting their cameras away after not too long , but it seriously marred the experience of those first songs .

And in the end , what will help you remember an experience better : taking a not - great picture that 's 80 % crowd , or giving that experience 100 % of your attention ?
You can always find photos online later , but you 'll never be able to go back to that moment again and , well , pay attention to it .

People have been dying of Aids for 100 years , scientists say
People have been dying from Aids for about 100 years - decades longer than originally thought , scientists said today .
Britons first became aware of the HIV virus in the 1980s after it was formally recognised in America .
It was believed to have been passed from chimpanzees to man in the 1930s .
But a new study has found the disease dates back to between 1884 and 1924 , with a more focused estimate at 1908 .
Early victims were probably isolated in remote villages before the arrival of colonial cities in sub-Saharan Africa at the turn of the century sparked a spread of the disease .
Help : Prince Harry with Lintle , an Aids orphan , in Lesotho in 2006 .
The disease is decades older than first thought , scientists believe , originating around 1908
DNA shows Aids had a firm footing in African cities in the 1960s .
But it was n’t formally recognised until 1981 when it got the attention of public health officials in the United States .
The new result is ‘ not a monumental shift , but it means the virus was circulating under our radar even longer than we knew , ’ said lead investigator Michael Worobey , of the University of Arizona .
The results appear in today ’s issue of the journal Nature .
Scientists say HIV descended from a chimpanzee virus that jumped to humans in Africa , probably when people butchered chimps .
Many individuals were probably infected that way , but so few other people caught the virus that it failed to get a lasting foothold , researchers say .
But the growth of African cities may have changed that by putting lots of people close together and promoting prostitution , Worobey suggested .
‘ Cities are kind of ideal for a virus like HIV , ’ providing more chances for infected people to pass the virus to others , he said .
Perhaps a person infected with the AIDS virus in a rural area went to what is now Kinshasa , Congo , ‘ and now you 've got the spark arriving in the tinderbox , ’ Worobey said .
Key to the new work was the discovery of an HIV sample that had been taken from a woman in Kinshasa in the Congo in 1960 .
It was only the second such sample to be found from before 1976 - the other was from 1959 , also from Kinshasa .
Researchers took advantage of the fact that HIV mutates rapidly .
So two strains from a common ancestor quickly become less and less alike in their genetic material over time .
That allows scientists to ‘ run the clock backward ’ by calculating how long it would take for various strains to become as different as they are observed to be .
That would indicate when they both sprang from their most recent common ancestor .
The new work used genetic data from the two old HIV samples plus more than 100 modern samples to create a family tree going back to these samples ' last common ancestor .
Researchers got various answers under various approaches for when that ancestor virus appeared , but the 1884 to 1924 bracket is probably the most reliable , Worobey said .
The new work is ‘ clearly an improvement ’ over the previous estimate of around 1930 , said Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland .
His institute helped pay for the work .
He described the advance as ‘ a fine - tuning . ’
Experts say it's no surprise that HIV circulated in humans for about 70 years before being recognised .
An infection usually takes years to produce obvious symptoms , a lag that can mask the role of the virus , and it would have infected relatively few Africans early in its spread , they said .
Keep up with the news about our flag and the issues of the day , share your thoughts and provide feedback .
Some passengers screamed , others tucked their heads between their knees , and several prayed over and over , “ Lord , forgive me for my sins . ”

He pulled out the safety card and read the instructions on how to open the exit door .
US Airways Flight 1549 smacked the Hudson River the way a speedboat lands after jumping over a wake — with a thud that rattled teeth and nerves and stunned the cabin silent .
It was as if everyone was waiting for someone else to shout in pain , and no one did .
Then Josh stood up .
“ Someone tried to pull the door in , ” another passenger recalled , “ and he said , ‘ No , you ’ve got to throw it out . ’
He twisted it and threw it out . ’ ”
Thus began some of the most harrowing minutes of what Gov. David A. Paterson described as the Miracle on the Hudson .
Untangle today announced Re-Router , a free open source download that lets any Windows desktop become a security gateway .
The program can handle policies on viruses , spam , spyware , and censorship , said CTO Dirk Morris .
Re-Router™ Technology is a breakthrough from Untangle that provides network - wide protection and filters from any Windows XP desktop .
Running transparently in the background without sacrificing any desktop functionality ( word processing , spreadsheets , web browsing , etc. ) , Re-Router ™ Technology enables users to :
Provide network gateway security & filters without buying new hardware
Protect the entire network from just 1 PC ( Unlike Norton or McAfee )
Get started in minutes …
No network reconfiguration , recabling or extra NICs to install
Leverage the best open source networking apps on the familiar Windows platform
“ What it does behind the machine is run Untangle on a virtual machine , and using a re-routing protocol , to run traffic through it .
You get all the benefits of Untangle but you do n’t need dedicated hardware , or the need to reconfigure the network . ”
Morris expects the biggest impact to lie in helping small businesses prevent use of IM , peer - to - peer , and improper Web pages .
Anyone can become China , and for free .
There are sound and honest reasons for you to do this , Morris said .
“ The Web is overtaking e-mail as the chief vector for malware .
You can stop people from going to sites that have malware .
You need to block phishing and malware sites even if you ’re not blocking other things . ”
FYI : Jessica Simpson is Busy on Sunday and Monday
For all you die - hardfans , we thought you might want to know that she is always busy on Sunday and Monday so you may want to plan around those days if you 're looking to have the celeb appear at any of your local community events .
Over the weekend Simpson was at the 99.9 Kiss Country 's Annual Chili Cookoff which was held at C.B. Smith Park in Pembroke Pines , Florida .
It must have been a pretty big day for Jess .
Country star Alan Jackson and several other singers were also on hand to entertain a crowd of 30,000 .
When Jessica took the stage she gushed some about her " football " boyfriend , Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo .
She dedicated her song You 're My Sunday to Tony and told the crowd that he was waiting for her in Dallas .
She also shared the fact that HE is her Sunday and Monday schedule and makes her very happy .
Awwww .
Before jetting off , she reportedly did a meet and greet with 25 fans .

Advertisement Australian writer Harry Nicolaides has been sentenced to three years in a Thai jail for insulting the monarchy .
Nicolaides wrote a novel four years ago , which contained a brief passage referring to an unnamed crown prince .
It sold just seven copies .
He admitted the charge of insulting the royal family , but said he was unaware he was committing an offence .
Thailand 's monarchy is sheltered from public debate by some of the world 's most stringent " lese - majeste " laws .
A ' bad dream ' Harry Nicolaides was arrested as he was leaving the country last August .
His self - published book , called Verisimilitude , was hardly well - received ; in fact the only copy which is still known to exist sits on the shelf of the Thai National Library , freely available to the public .
Shackled in leg irons , and wearing standard - issue prison pyjamas , Nicolaides pleaded guilty to the charges against him at Bangkok 's Criminal Court on Monday .
King Bhumibol is revered in Thailand
He was quickly found guilty , with a judge telling the court : " He has written a book that slandered the king , the crown prince and Thailand and the monarchy . "
The court initially sentenced him to six years in jail , but reduced the term because of his guilty plea .
Before the trial Nicolaides had seemed stunned by what was happening to him , describing it is like a ' ' bad dream ' ' .
But he is just one of a growing number of people being investigated and charged under Thailand 's draconian " lese - majeste " law , as the police and army try to suppress what they fear is a rising tide of anti-monarchy sentiment .
More than 3,000 websites have now been blocked , and one political activist was jailed for six years in November for an anti-monarchy speech she made just a stone 's throw from the old royal palace last July .
Several other people are now awaiting trial .
As a repentant foreigner , Harry Nicolaides does at least have a good chance of being pardoned by the king , according to the BBC correspondent in Bangkok , Jonathan Head .
The king did the same for a Swiss man given a 10 - year sentence two years ago for defacing his portrait .

Splay Trees
A self - adjusting search tree
The demo below implements the operations insert , delete and locate on splay trees .
Each of the operations is performed almost as in a standard binary search tree , except that after each , a splay is performed at the node that has been accessed .
A splay at a selected node essentially drags it to the root of the tree , through a sequence of rotations .
These rotations are performed in pairs ( pictured as ) through all of this node 's ancestors .
The algorithm is described further here .
Informally , one can think of the splay trees as implementing a sort of LRU policy on tree accesses : the most recently accessed elements are pulled closer to the root ; and indeed , one can show that the tree structure adapts dynamically to the elements accessed , so that the least frequently used elements will be those furthest from the root .
But remarkably , although no explicit balance conditions are imposed on the tree , each of these operations can be shown to use time O ( lg n ) on an n-element tree , in an amortized sense .
This demo starts you with a very unbalanced tree .

Do police have the right to confiscate your camera ?
Seconds after BART police officer Johannes Mehserle shot and killed Oscar Grant , police immediately began confiscating cell phones containing videos that have yet to see the light of day .
In fact , the only videos that have been seen by the public were filmed by people who managed to leave the scene before police confronted them .
Seconds after BART police officer Johannes Mehserle shot and killed Oscar Grant , police immediately began confiscating cell phones containing videos that have yet to see the light of day .
In fact , the only videos that have been seen by the public were filmed by people who managed to leave the scene before police confronted them .
In one instance , police chased after Karina Vargas after she stepped on the train , banging on the window and demanding her to turn over the camera .
The train sped away with Vargas still holding her camera .
Her video , which did not show the actual shooting but captured the turmoil before and after , was one of the first to pop up on the internet .
And soon after more videos popped up showing the actual shooting .
In the most vivid video , the train doors can be seen closing seconds after the shooting as the train speeds away .
The truth is , police had no legal right to confiscate a single camera .
“ Cops may be entitled to ask for people ’s names and addresses and may even go as far as subpoenaing the video tape , but as far as confiscating the camera on the spot , no , ” said Marc Randazza , A First Amendment attorney based out of Florida and a Photography is Not a Crime reader .
Bert P. Krages
II , the Oregon attorney who drafted the widely distributed The Photographer ’s Rights guide , responded to my inquiry with the following e-mail message :
“ In general , police cannot confiscate cameras or media without some sort of court order .
One exception is when a camera is actually being used in the commission of crime ( e.g. , child pornography , counterfeiting , upskirting ) . ”
It did n’t appear that the BART shooting videos were being used in a commission of a crime , so what could people have done to prevent police from illegally confiscating their cameras ?
“ Probably not a whole lot , ” said Randazza .
“ You do n’t want to get into a situation where you are refusing to comply with law enforcement , especially when that law enforcement officer just shot and killed somebody .
No camera is worth losing your life over . ”
But what can you do if you ’re as stubborn as me and have a tendency to refuse unlawful orders ?
“ Make sure you have an attorney that specializes in First Amendment law , ” he said .
“ Make sure you have his cell phone and home number .
Sometimes calling an attorney on the spot can be helpful . ”
Needless to say , I now have Randazza ’s cell phone number programed into my cell phone .
In the spring of 1981 , conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives cried .
They cried because , in the first flush of the Reagan Revolution that was supposed to bring drastic cuts in taxes and government spending , as well as a balanced budget , they were being asked by the White House and their own leadership to vote for an increase in the statutory limit on the federal public debt , which was then scraping the legal ceiling of one trillion dollars .
They cried because all of their lives they had voted against an increase in public debt , and now they were being asked , by their own party and their own movement , to violate their lifelong principles .
The White House and its leadership assured them that this breach in principle would be their last : that it was necessary for one last increase in the debt limit to give President Reagan a chance to bring about a balanced budget and to begin to reduce the debt .
Many of these Republicans tearfully announced that they were taking this fateful step because they deeply trusted their President , who would not let them down .
Famous last words .
In a sense , the Reagan handlers were right : there were no more tears , no more complaints , because the principles themselves were quickly forgotten , swept into the dustbin of history .
Deficits and the public debt have piled up mountainously since then , and few people care , least of all conservative Republicans .
Every few years , the legal limit is raised automatically .
By the end of the Reagan reign the federal debt was $ 2.6 trillion ; now it is $ 3.5 trillion and rising rapidly [ed .
Note : $ 6.9 trillion , Jan. 13 , 2004 ] .
And this is the rosy side of the picture , because if you add in " off - budget " loan guarantees and contingencies , the grand total federal debt is $ 20 trillion .
Before the Reagan era , conservatives were clear about how they felt about deficits and the public debt : a balanced budget was good , and deficits and the public debt were bad , piled up by free - spending Keynesians and socialists , who absurdly proclaimed that there was nothing wrong or onerous about the public debt .
In the famous words of the left - Keynesian apostle of " functional finance , " Professor Abba Lerner , there is nothing wrong with the public debt because " we owe it to ourselves . "
In those days , at least , conservatives were astute enough to realize that it made an enormous amount of difference whether  slicing through the obfuscatory collective nouns  one is a member of the " we " ( the burdened taxpayer ) or of the " ourselves " ( those living off the proceeds of taxation ) .
Since Reagan , however , intellectual - political life has gone topsy - turvy .
Conservatives and allegedly " free - market " economists have turned handsprings trying to find new reasons why " deficits do n’t matter , " why we should all relax and enjoy the process .
Perhaps the most absurd argument of Reaganomists was that we should not worry about growing public debt because it is being matched on the federal balance sheet by an expansion of public " assets . "
Here was a new twist on free - market macroeconomics : things are going well because the value of government assets is rising !
In that case , why not have the government nationalize all assets outright ?
Reaganomists , indeed , came up with every conceivable argument for the public debt except the phrase of Abba Lerner , and I am convinced that they did not recycle that phrase because it would be difficult to sustain with a straight face at a time when foreign ownership of the national debt is skyrocketing .
Even apart from foreign ownership , it is far more difficult to sustain the Lerner thesis than before ; in the late 1930 ’s , when Lerner enunciated his thesis , total federal interest payments on the public debt were one billion dollars ; now they have zoomed to $ 200 billion , the third largest item in the federal budget , after the military and Social Security : the " we " are looking ever shabbier compared to the " ourselves .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
When other diplomatic allies can't be found , Israel knows it can count on Canada .
That 's certainly the message it received Monday , when Canada earned the ignominious distinction of being the only country at a United Nations human rights council in Geneva to vote against a motion condemning Israel 's attack on Gaza - an attack that , as of January 15 , has killed nearly 1,000 people ( 292 of them children ) , injured more than 4,250 and caused 90,000 Gazans to flee their homes .
Thirteen countries , mostly from Europe , abstained , while the U.S. does n't sit on the body .
The non-binding motion calls for an investigation into human rights violations by the Israeli army .
Canada 's representative at the council , Marius Grinius , criticized the motion for failing to acknowledge that the invasion was the result of rockets fired by Hamas into Israel .
Never mind that the rockets actually came after several Israeli incursions into Gaza that left dozens dead during and immediately following five months of ceasefire between Hamas and Israel , or that Israel has imposed a suffocating blockade on Gaza for the last eighteen months , cutting off desperately - needed humanitarian relief to the million and a half people living in the open air prison , or that Israel 's invasion of Gaza has done far more damage to civilians and critical infrastructure than Hamas 's rockets could ever do in Israel .
It 's all the fault of Hamas .
Canada has been unwavering in its support for Israel 's brutal assault on Gaza , as if Israel were the David facing off against a Palestinian Goliath .
Such a position is an obvious absurdity , as is made plain by any superficial accounting of the balance of forces between Israel and the Palestinians ( one being armed to the teeth as a regional hegemon by the Americans , the other being occupied for sixty years and with little economy to speak of ) , or by the death and destruction currently being rained down on Gaza .
In his only statement on the invasion - a press release issued back on January 4 - Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon put the blame for the violence squarely on the Palestinians : " We urge renewed international diplomatic efforts to achieve a sustainable and durable ceasefire , starting with the halting of all rocket attacks on Israel .
Canada maintains that the rocket attacks are the cause of this crisis . "
When the Israeli military bombed a UN school on January 6 , in which at least 40 Palestinians seeking shelter from the unrelenting aerial assault were killed , the Tory government blamed Hamas .
While the UN and other Western governments criticized the flagrant violation of international law and began calling more strongly for a ceasefire , Canada remained steadfast in its support for Israel .
Expressing the Canadian position this time was Peter Kent , former Canwest journalist and now Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the Americas ( yes , that 's right , for the Americas ) .
According to Kent , " We really do n't have complete details yet , other than the fact that we know that Hamas has made a habit of using civilians and civilian infrastructure as shields for their terrorist activities , and that would seem to be the case again today . "
So while acknowledging he does n't actually have the details , he sees fit to blame Hamas with no evidence offered .
As it turns out , Hamas was n't hiding behind civilians in the school .
Israel can do no wrong , even if it bombs a UN school .
" In many ways , " Kent continues in an apparent effort to raise the level of absurdity coming from the Tory government , " Hamas behaves as if they are trying to have more of their people killed to make a terrible terrorist point . "
One can only imagine the hysterics the corporate media or the Tories would go into if such a claim were made against the Israeli government when its civilians are killed .
But such claims against Hamas , despite Gaza being one of the most densely populated places on earth and the long history of Israel killing civilians , is perfectly reasonable .
Kent also went so far as to suggest that Canada would only support a ceasefire if Hamas not only ends its rocket attacks but disarms .
Despite being the aggressor , occupier and advanced military power , Israel has no such conditions imposed on it , and is instead given carte blanche to prosecute its war on Palestinians and kill civilians .
The Tories are n't alone in their support for Israel .
Newly anointed Liberal leader and Iraq War and imperialism proponent , Michael Ignatieff , also strongly backs Israel 's invasion of Gaza .
" Canada has to support the right of a democratic country to defend itself , " he maintains .
Obviously , for Ignatieff , as for the Tories , that right does n't extend to Palestinians , whose democratically elected government was subject to sanctions by Canada almost immediately following its election in 2006 .
Ignatieff and his Tory allies have also remained conspicuously silent on the recent banning of Arab parties from running in next month 's elections by the " democratic " Israeli government , among other patently undemocratic measures imposed on the country 's Arab citizens .
For its part , the NDP 's position is n't much better than that of its electoral competitors .
While criticizing the Tory 's one - sided response to the war , it nevertheless treats Israel and Palestine as equal combatants sharing an equal amount of responsibility for the conflagration .
This is the party , we should recall , that punished Svend Robinson in 2002 ( with then leader Alexa McDonough removing him as parliamentary critic for the Middle East ) after he referred to Israel 's killing of Palestinian civilians as terrorist actions , and criticized the erstwhile imperial ally for engaging in murder and torture .
An uncritical supporter of Israel
While Canada has always supported Israel 's occupation of Palestine , it used to be less blunt about it , and would offer some modest public efforts to pass itself off as more balanced than it really was in practice .
This strategy began to shift under the Paul Martin Liberal government in 2005 , to the pleasure of the country 's influential Israel lobby , when Canada started voting with the small minority of the UN's Israel supporters against General Assembly resolutions criticizing its occupation of the Palestinian territories and its military targeting of civilians .
This decisively pro-Israel shift was followed up by the Harper Tories ' uncritical support for Israel 's bloody war against Lebanon in the summer of 2006 , in which over 1,000 people were killed , most of whom were Lebanese civilians .
Among the non-combatants killed by Israel was a Canadian peacekeeper stationed at a UN post in the town of Khiam in south Lebanon .
Israel claimed it did n't know the peacekeepers were located there , but the UN insists Israel was notified several times of the peacekeepers ' position .
Despite this , the Tories continued to uncritically support Israel , going so far as to work with the United States and Britain to undermine the efforts of European and Arab leaders to broker a ceasefire in order to allow Israel 's attack on Lebanon and Hezbollah positions to continue .
Firming up its pro-Israel credentials , Canada was also the first state to withdraw funding from the Palestinian Authority after the democratic election of Hamas in 2006 , in an effort to punish the Palestinians for electing a party that is less than compliant towards imperialism in the Middle East .
Building on its diplomatic support for Israeli aggression , Canada subsequently announced in the fall of 2007 that it 's negotiating a counter - terrorism and homeland security agreement with the Zionist state .
The agreement promotes greater cooperation on technology , counterterrorism efforts , border - crossing security and biometric identification among other things .
Contrary to its own export policy , which prohibits Canadian military exports to governments engaged in war or human rights violations , Canada also acts as an arms supplier to Israel .
Canada is in fact consistently in the top ten of the world 's biggest military exporters .
As the Coalition Opposed to the Arms Trade reports , Canadian companies have provided Israel with important high tech electronic components for its primarily U.S. - made weapons systems .
These include components for Israel 's AH - 64 Apache attack helicopters , F - 15 Eagle tactical bombers and F - 16 Fighting Falcon bombers .
Taking a more aggressive role in the world
Canada 's stance on Israel should n't be taken in isolation .
It needs to be situated within Canada 's overall foreign policy , which is becoming more belligerent .
Since the early 1990s , Canadian corporate investments have spread at a considerable pace around the globe and into the developing world .
Canada ranked eighth among the top foreign investor nations in the world in 2007 , and has consistently ranked in the top ten in the last several years .
Controlled for the size of its economy , Canada is the second largest investor among G7 nations in the global South .
And income earned by Canadian multinationals off of their developing world investments has increased steadily over the last few decades , rising by 535 per cent from 1980 to 2007 , for a total of $ 23.6 billion in earnings in the latter year .
And just like the third world investments of other rich nations , Canada 's are mired in human rights violations and environmental catastrophe .
From mining , to oil and gas development , to sweatshop manufacturing , to banking , Canadian companies are systematically engaging in displacement of indigenous peoples from their land , destruction of ecosystems , targeted violence against local resistance to their investments and union busting .
All this is done with the support of the Canadian government , whether headed by Liberals or Tories .
The government has facilitated the global expansion of Canadian capital through its aggressive pursuit of structural adjustment policies , one - sided trade and investment agreements and an aid policy designed in large measure to liberalize foreign markets .
We also should n't forget Canada 's absolute refusal to establish human rights legislation to govern the foreign activities of its corporations , many of which receive government funding for their predatory activities .
Canada has also sought to undermine the UN's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
Canada 's view of the world , in other words , is one in which the South is subordinate to the whims and predilections of the North .
Militarism and needs of capital go hand - in - hand
This international expansion of Canadian capital is being accompanied by a more aggressive security posture .
Militarism goes hand in hand with imperialist ambitions , and Canada is no different than other major powers .
Canada 's military spending is projected to increase by just over $ 18 billion from 2005 to 2010 alone , and by upwards of $ 50 billion over the next two decades .
Whether it 's defending investments , challenging rogue states or intervening in failed states , the Canadian ruling class , as military and political leaders make clear , is preparing for ongoing asymmetric conflicts and clearly identifies the third world as the main source of instability and insecurity threatening Canada and its Western allies , often deploying the highly flexible concept of " terrorism " to make its case .
In the last five years the Canadian military has played a lead role in the occupation of Afghanistan , propping up one group of terrorists against another , and participated in a coup against a democratically - elected government in Haiti .
As a member of the group of most powerful nations in the world , and with growing international interests , Canada along with its allies supports the status quo between North and South and actively pursues policies that promote imperialism 's desired form of global stability .
This entails support for countries that are openly compliant with the West and enforce on a regional level imperial " order " against those enemies - be they " terrorists " , " rogue " states or " failed " states - seeking some measure of self - determination .
Thus since the 1990s Canada has become a stronger and more open supporter of Israel than it has in the past , just as it has strengthened its ties with Colombia in recent years ( being a major investor in the Andes ) .
Canadian support for Israel , then , however much it 's promoted by a powerful Israel lobby or opportunist politicians , is nevertheless rooted in a broader outlook on the world order that involves a more generally belligerent attitude toward the South .
This attitude is as Canadian now as maple syrup , and so we should n't expect it to change anytime soon .
That will require a sustained movement for global social justice with a clear anti-imperialist focus .

Citigroup on Monday joined a growing list of financial institutions offering to modify the terms of mortgages for distressed borrowers , unveiling a program to help thousands meet their monthly payments while reducing the bank ’s potential for larger losses as the economy erodes .
About 130,000 mortgage customers are expected to qualify for the program , resulting in the workouts of over $ 20 billion of loans .
Bank executives said they believed it would reduce losses by hundreds of millions of dollars , and possibly more .
Like some of its competitors , Citi will also hold off foreclosing on troubled borrowers who have income enough to make their monthly payment and who make a good - faith effort to work out their loan with the bank .
Several of the nation ’s largest banks have made similar offers to hundreds of thousands of homeowners with plans that may wind up helping a larger pool of troubled borrowers than the government ’s plan to partly guarantee home loans .
Roughly 1.5 million homes were in foreclosure at the end of June , the last month for which data is available , and economists expect more borrowers to default in the coming months as unemployment rises and home values fall even more .
JPMorgan Chase , which acquired Washington Mutual and its troubled loan portfolio , announced plans in late October to cut monthly payments by lowering interest rates and temporarily reducing loan balances for as many as 400,000 homeowners .
Bank of America , which acquired the large mortgage lender Countrywide Financial , announced a similar program aimed at 400,000 borrowers as part of a settlement with state officials a few weeks earlier .
And HSBC ramped up its mortgage modification effort in January , and has adjusted 61,000 mortgages so far this year .
I remember when $ 3.9 trillion sounded like a lot of money .
Just weeks after that unfathomable figure dropped my jaw to the ground as I added up the total cost of the financial crisis , I regret to inform you that the sum has promptly doubled .
That 's right :
While the nation was mired in contentious debate over a measly $ 25 billion bailout for the likes of General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) and Ford ( NYSE : F ) , my Foolish running tally grew by more than 188 times that amount !
Drawn from independent research and diverse published sources , the following table seeks to provide as precise an accounting of the crisis as the public record currently permits .
By my calculations , the combined total of existing and announced outlays from the Federal Reserve and from U.S. government agencies that are directly attributable to the financial crisis has ballooned to more than $ 8 trillion .
Item Issuer Amount of Outlay Commercial Paper Funding Facility Federal Reserve $ 1.8 trillion Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program FDIC $ 1.4 trillion Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) Federal Reserve $ 900 billion Fannie Mae ( NYSE : FNM ) , Freddie Mac ( NYSE : FRE ) , and Ginnie Mae U.S. Treasury / Federal Reserve $ 800 billion Treasury Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) U.S. Treasury $ 700 billion Total USD International Currency Swap Lines Federal Reserve $ 688 billion Money Market Investor Funding Facility Federal Reserve $ 540 billion Other Loans : Primary Dealer Credit , etc. Federal Reserve $ 288.7 billion Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) Guarantee U.S. Treasury / FDIC $ 306 billion Hope for Homeowners Act of 2008 U.S. Treasury $ 304 billion Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) Federal Reserve $ 225 billion Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) U.S. Treasury $ 200 billion Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 U.S. Treasury $ 168 billion Paid to JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) to Settle Lehman Brothers Debt Federal Reserve $ 138 billion AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) Bailout Federal Reserve $ 112.5 billion Bear Stearns Brokered Sale Federal Reserve $ 26.9 billion I 'm afraid to look … Total : $ 8,597,100,000,000
* " Other loans " total from the Fed 's statistical release as of Nov. 19 , 2008 , which includes discount window lending to banks and brokerages , and the Asset - Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Liquidity Facility .
Before we use some known quantities to place that sum in perspective , please note the following :
In some cases , relatively small portions of the pledged amounts have thus far turned into actual loans .
Virtually all of these outlays are considered temporary in nature , although in many cases we have no way of knowing just how temporary they will be .
Some of the amounts indicated above could grow larger still .
The ultimate value of all U.S. dollar international currency swaps , for example , cannot be known precisely , since the Federal Reserve established some unlimited swap lines last month .
The ultimate numbers game
This enormous debt is no joke , but that does n't mean we Fools can't have fun crunching the numbers down into bite - sized pieces .
With the holidays approaching , consider that $ 8.6 trillion is enough to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony , buy the world a Coke , and still have more than enough left over to buy every single person in the world a 50 - inch plasma TV .
For Fools wishing to know what they 're on the hook for , the $ 28,119 share for every soul in the U.S. would keep all Americans super - sized with a McDonald 's double cheeseburger every day for 77 years .
Alternatively , the ghastly sum could have subsidized the winter heating expenses for all American households for 79 years at 2007 prices .
The Yucca Mountain of debt
At some point , we must concede that the scale of these outlays calls into question the collective ability of the borrowers to repay these loans .
How long will it take for a struggling economy to repay $ 8.6 trillion ?
Clearly , we just do n't know .
We do know that both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are amassing debt securities as collateral that no private entity will touch right now , and we know that the Fed is refusing to disclose related details despite a pending lawsuit from Bloomberg .
The continuing indications from Washington that dollars will be hurled at this crisis in any quantity deemed necessary raises legitimate concerns about the future purchasing power of the dollars in your wallet , your CD , Treasury bonds , or other dollar - denominated instruments .
Occurring in a vacuum , a deleveraging event like this one would be decidedly deflationary .
In the context of these outlays , however , I believe " stagflation " and " hyperinflation " will instead be among the words historians use to describe this period .
Thankfully , one need not convert out of the currency to find some protection from a falling dollar .

Many of the 40 million American adults who suffer from anxiety disorders also have problems with balance .
As increasing numbers of children are diagnosed with anxiety , Tel Aviv University researchers have discovered that the link between balance and anxiety can be assessed at an early age and that something can be done about it before it becomes a problem .
Dr. Orit Bart at Tel Aviv University ’s School of Health Professions , and her colleagues , have found that a simple course of physical treatment for balance problems can also resolve anxiety issues in children .
Her work offers new hope for normal social and emotional development for children with both disorders .
Establishing the Connection
Anxiety has a significant impact on children ’s personal and academic well - being .
While not all kids with anxiety have balance problems , all those with balance problems do exhibit symptoms of anxiety , pointing to a link between the two conditions .
“ This is a breakthrough in the field of occupational therapy , ” says Dr. Bart .
Her study — done in collaboration with TAU researchers Yair Bar - Haim , Einat Weizman , Moran Levin , Avi Sadeh , and Matti Mintz , and to be published in Research in Developmental Disabilities — investigated the anxiety - balance connection in young children for the first time .
Dr. Bart tracked children between the ages of five and seven who had been diagnosed with both problems to see how treatment would affect each disorder .
After a 12 - week intervention of sensory - motor intervention , the children in Dr. Bart ’s study improved their balance skills .
The therapy also reduced the children ’s anxiety to normal levels , she reports .
As their balance and anxiety issues improved , the children ’s self - esteem also increased .
Treating the Mind Through the Body
“ You ca n’t treat children with anxiety in a cognitive way because of their immaturity and lack of operational thinking .
Working with the body may be the answer , ” Dr. Bart explains .
The treatment therefore focused on letting the children use equipment to experience their environment and move in space .
Dr. Bart found that by working with their bodies , children could work through their emotional problems , including anxiety .
Dr. Bart is now working on expanding the initial results through a larger study with more control groups .
The goal is to explore the exact nature of the relationship between balance and anxiety in children , and to focus the results on more specific treatment types .
“ Young children who have anxiety should first be assessed for balance issues to see if that is the source of the problem , ” says Dr. Bart .
“ We can now treat these children because we have a better understanding of the relation between these disorders . ”

According to the 1998 census , the population of Lahore was 6,319,000 ( 6 million ) inhabitants .
According to today ’s Daily Times , these inhabitants managed to make 9,580,902 ( 9.5 million ) crank ( prank or hoax ) calls to the emergency 15 number in 2008 ( how many cranck calls were made to other numbers remains unknown , but is likely to also be an obnoxiously large number ) .
No matter what the current population of Lahore might be , if these numbers are true it means that on average each Lahori man , woman and child made more than one crank call of Emergency 15 in 2008 .
We are , in fact , an emergency - prone people , as evidenced by the fact that there were an ( additional ) 52,486 calls that were in fact legitimate calls to Emergency 15 .
This means that only about one - half a percent ( of 1 in every 200 ) of calls received by Emergency 15 were legitimate .
In case you are wondering , the Mujahid Squad police did register some cases against these stupid pranksters .
How many , you ask ?
As many as 23 .
That means only 0.0002 of the pranksters were charged ( or 2 out of every one million ) .
And how many were actually arrested or prosecuted .
Sifra . Zilch .
None !
Some of these pranksters are sitting somewhere smirking and patting themselves at how smart and funny they are .
Although I hope this is not so , statistically one would assume that some would also be reading this .
Unless they are 5 - year olds , here I am to let them know that what they have been doing is not funny .
Its stupid !
I am a proud Lahori .
I believe ‘ Lahore , Lahore Aye . ’
I love Lahore , Lahoris and fabled Lahori humor .
But there is nothing funny about these numbers if they are true .
As I tell my 11 - year old , if the other person is n’t laughing with you , then its not funny , just mean .
I doubt if those at the receiving end of these calls were laughing .
Those making them might think they are free .
But they are not free to the citizens who have to pay for the people and time used in answering and responding to these calls .
Most importantly , they are not free to the other real emergencies that might be missed becasse either those calls did not go through , or the folks taking the calls got so frustrated that they failed respond to real emergencies .
They are also not free to the people making the calls themselves .
Assuming that each call takes only one minute ( in thinking about , making , and then idiotically laughing at the call ) of the caller ’s time , that would mean 9,580,902 minutes or 159,682 hours , or nearly 20,000 work days ( at 8 hours per day ) of Lahori time .
Please tell me what is either so smart or so funny about wasting 20,000 work days of time !
What bugs me most of all is the callousness and hard - heartedness of the callers who , according to the news report , “ capitalised on widespread suicide attacks in 2009 , and disseminated wrong information about planting of explosive material at various important sites in the city to create panic . ”
Have people lost all sense of just plain human decency !
The relevant details from the Daily Times story are :
Those playing pranks have kept the police busy by recording 9,580,902 fake emergency calls in the city , sources told Daily Times on Friday .
The Mujahid Squad police registered 23 cases with Civil Lines Police Station against these prank callers , however , not a single caller was arrested in 2008 .
Meanwhile , the Mujahid Squad has dismissed 71 officers and has punished their juniors 2,176 times for showing negligence in duty in 2008 .
Prank callers : Sources said the emergency number 15 received a total of 9,633,388 calls in 2008 , adding that only 52,486 of these were true emergencies .
They said the Mujahid Squad had identified about 650 prank callers , who kept the system busy and created trouble for the police as well as the people .
However , the Investigations Wing failed to arrest any prank caller against the Mujahid Squad registered cases .
Sources said the prank callers capitalised on widespread suicide attacks in 2009 , and disseminated wrong information about planting of explosive material at various important sites in the city to create panic .
Mujahid Squad Superintendent of Police Syed Nasir Ali Rizvi said he had taken charge of the Mujahid Squad recently and had thought of several steps to improve the squadâ€™s working .
He said they would try their best to trace the prank callers .
He said they would find crime pockets in every division , and would set up a response squad for them .
He said the response squad would include an upper subordinate and seven constables .
He said he would order the patrolling Mujahid Squad vehicles to select a point for checking of all passing vehicles .
He said he had already ordered the Mujahid Squad to keep a vigilant eye on robbers , especially at weddings , which continued until late night .
Although the precision of the number suggests that it is a real one , even if it were off by a full order of magnitude this would be a really disturbing number ; and one possibly pointing to a disturbed state of mind amongst too many .
I may be over - reacting here , but my reaction is not just to this artifact , it is to an attitude of wastefulness and callousness that seems to have become acceptable .
As if our institutions , our society , and even this country is not our own , but itself a big joke to laugh off in friviluousness .
Ultimately , we are the only ones who pay for these things – one way or the other .
And the fact that they would make calls that would increase public panic and find that funny , is a harrowing thought .
Can one of these people please click on this link , see the picture there ( or here , or here , or here ) and please tell me what they find funny about that !
The more I think about this the more I think that by putting the headline I have I am not being too harsh , but not harsh enough on those who would do this .

Advertisement A Glasgow team is to launch a major trial to assess whether stem cells can be used to treat stroke patients , the BBC has learned .
They hope it will put the UK at the forefront of developing stem cell therapy for incurable disease .
Cells made from a human foetus will be injected into patients ' brains .
It is hoped the cells will regenerate areas damaged by stroke , and increase patients ' movements and mental abilities .
However , the idea has in the past been described by anti-abortion groups as a " sick proposal " .
Europe is going to be the centre in stem cells and regenerative medicine and that is very exciting
Dr John Sinden
Reneuron
The trial , due to start in the middle of this year , will initially involve four groups of three patients over two years .
Doctors are primarily testing the safety of the procedure but there is the possibility that some patients may benefit from the treatment .
The first group will receive a low dose of two million foetal stem cells .
The dose will be gradually increased over the trial period and the final group will receive 20 million cells - which doctors think might be enough to begin regeneration .
Keith Muir , the consultant leading the trial at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow , said he was " very excited at the prospect of a genuine world 's first " .
He said : " If it works , as it has done in animal model systems , it may allow new nerve cells to grow or regeneration of existing cells and actual recovery of function in patients who would not otherwise be able to regain function . "
Disability common
A third of stroke patients make a full recovery , but the rest either die or are left permanently disabled because their brain has been so damaged .
It is unethical in every way - killing one member of the human race to help another .
We are totally opposed to this
Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Currently the only treatment is physiotherapy to restore movement and brain function .
But Dr Muir believes the new therapy has the potential to benefit those for whom physiotherapy has been of limited help .
He said : " For the high proportion of patients who make an incomplete recovery it has the potential to put in new cells which will allow new growth .
" Otherwise you are trying to make the most of recovery in an area that is fundamentally damaged and cannot regenerate beyond a certain fundamental level .
" You can reorganise the brain , you can help that reorganisation with physiotherapy but you cannot cause new nerve cells to grow .
" The hope with stem cell therapy is that by putting in new cells and new tissue that you can further improve on that recovery . "
Regulator satisfied
The company which developed the cells , Reneuron , first applied to begin trials in the US two years ago .
But it did not get the go - ahead from the US Food and Drug Administration .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Reneuron has , however , now satisfied the UK regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency - that the therapy is safe enough to try out on stroke patients .
Dr John Sinden , Reneuron 's chief scientific officer , said the FDA has been very cautious , and had not given the go - ahead to a single trial involving stem cells .
But he said the attitude in the UK - both from the public and the regulators - was more positive .
Dr Sinden believes his success will mean that other companies frustrated by the FDA 's slow processes will make applications in the UK and other parts of Europe for their stem cell trials .
He said : " Europe is going to be the centre in stem cells and regenerative medicine and that is very exciting . "
Opposition
However , the use of an aborted human foetus to create the stem cells will disturb campaign groups who have opposed the use of embryos in this kind of medical research .
When Reneuron first announced that they would apply to the FDA for clinical trials the Society for the Unborn Child described the proposal as " sick " .
A spokeperson said : " It involves cannibalising an unborn child .
" It is unethical in every way - killing one member of the human race to help another .
We are totally opposed to this . "
In response , Dr Sinden said : " We have only taken one donation of tissue to make this product .
" We have a technology that is able to scale up an individual cell into all of the cells that are required to treat thousands of patients .
We think this is a major plus in the technology we have and really negates the ethical concerns about the original use of foetal tissue .
" It would be ethically wrong to deny treatment . "

It 's at this point each December where I begin to feel as if I 'm being haunted by the ghost of Christmas dilemmas past .
Every year most of us go through the ritual of worrying about which Christmas tree to buy , or indeed whether to buy one at all .
Are n't they just a colossal waste of money ?
Can such a decadent waste of resources be justified in our ( supposedly ) eco-aware times ?
( Such cries have been heard for centuries – Oliver Cromwell banged on about the " heathen tradition " of decorated trees , but he had his own all - together - different reasons . )
And then we buckle and relent as the children at our feet whimper and plead with us to get one .
So what are the options for those of us who still want to follow this once - pagan yuletide tradition ?
Buy a real tree
This is still considered the only true option by most tradition - loving followers of Proper Christmas .
There 's something magical , they say , about the aroma of those pine needles and the presence of a just - felled , real tree in their home .
Christmas just would n't be the same without one .
The reality is a little less romantic : the vast majority of the trees we buy from garden centres and garage forecourts are intensively farmed on an industrial scale , sometimes beyond these shores .
As with most monocrops , Christmas trees are typically sprayed with potent fertilisers and herbicides such as Monsanto 's Roundup ( glyphosate ) .
Just how much Christmas cheer does that spread to local biodiversity and the seasonal workers hired to harvest the trees ?
Erase from your head any idyllic notion that these trees are carefully scythed from a snow - laden forest floor ready for your home .
In many ways , though , this is a positive .
If Christmas trees were gathered this way they would be responsible for deforestation on an epic scale considering that we get through millions of things each year .
They also offer some farmers a profitable harvest for otherwise unproductive fields positioned on steep hills .
There are some basic things to look out for , though , when sourcing a real tree .
The Soil Association has details of retailers selling organic Christmas trees .
And the Forest Stewardship Council has a list showing you how to get hold of an FSC - approved tree .
Between them , these standards offer a guarantee that your tree has been farmed sustainably .
And try to find a tree that 's been grown as close to your home as possible – for anyone living outside a large conurbation this usually is n't too tricky as it's usually easy to find a local farmer who sells Christmas trees .
Whether they are grown sustainably or not is another matter that only your questioning will uncover .
It is also worth considering getting a potted tree , rather than one that has been felled , so that you can use it again , following a wee trim , in subsequent years .
The problem , of course , is storage .
Not everyone can host a living Christmas tree at home throughout the year even if they are blessed with some outside space .
If you do have to buy a cut tree it is worth finding out first from your local authority whether it offers a Christmas tree collection service whereby it chips up all the trees into mulch .
Many local authorities still do not offer such a service which could leave you with the headache of working out what to do with the tree come the twelfth day .
Streets strewn with naked trees in early January is usually a good sign you do not live within a progressive local authority .
Buy a plastic tree
This option is often presented as the eco alternative to buying a real tree , but such claims fail to stack up in my view .
First , there 's the canard that a plastic tree is " for life " , whereas most plastic trees are used little more than a handful of years before being discarded .
There 's also the claim that a plastic tree prevents a real tree from being cut down , whereas , as has already been mentioned above , Christmas trees are no different from any other farmed crop and are only planted with harvesting in mind .
And do we really want to encourage the production of yet another piece of plastic tat being produced thousands of miles away and shipped around the planet for our seasonal gratification ?
Decorate an existing tree / plant
You may well get a nasty neighbour shouting " Scrooge ! " at you through your front window , but some families just decorate a large house plant instead of buying in a cut conifer , as tradition dictates .
Decorating a tree in the garden is also an option , although this could leave the presents underneath a tad soggy .
Do nothing
How about just foregoing the whole tradition altogether ?
( Granted , this is probably a little easier to pull off in child - free homes . )
Some charities try to exploit – in the nicest sense – the fact that some of us just do n't like to suffer the guilt of excess that comes with Christmas .
The Woodland Trust , for example , offers its Plant a Tree for Christmas gift .
For £ 25 , the price of a modest Christmas tree , you will be able to dedicate three trees in a wood of your choice .
And if you want a valid excuse to supply to exasperated family members that explains to them why you have not bought a Christmas tree this year , show them this frankly quite scary clip of a Christmas tree fire :
In a recently introduced piece of bureaucracy , the Metropolitan police have started requiring live event producers across London to fill in the innocuous sounding " Form 696 " .
Here 's the catch : it requires four pages of information from event organisers 14 days before it takes place .
If you need to make last - minute changes – tough luck , the event can't go ahead .
The Met police not only want to know the type of music to be played , but also names , aliases , phone numbers and addresses of performers .
It will not only make putting on live bands very difficult for small venues , but also spell the end of impromptu open mic sessions .
This latest incarnation of police bureaucracy has n't come out of nowhere .
It even asks event promoters to provide details of their target audience , a further sign of the way it 's been racialising music across London for a while .
I was , until recently , a regular at a monthly club night before the police suddenly started strictly enforcing ID checks .
This was n't merely to ensure I was above the required 18 years of age .
Not only was everyone required to provide visual identification , but they also had to be logged in a computer database – otherwise none of us could go in .
Everyone 's driving licences were scanned through a machine and recorded on a computer , with no indication of how long the police would store the information for .
When I objected , the ( white ) club promoter was quite frank with me .
He said the police had said they were " concerned " that the venue played " black and Asian music " and hence wanted added security .
Any sort of trouble is extremely rare at this night .
Yet their reasoning was that if any fight broke out , they could track everyone at the event if necessary .
Form 696 explicitly singles out musical styles such as R&B , bashment , garage or styles including MCs / DJs as examples of genres that have to be stated if put on .
It also required event producers to state the likely racial profile of people attending .
When accusations of racial profiling were inevitably raised by the music industry , the Met changed the wording to ask who it was targeted at .
One London council has already invoked prevention of terrorism in its licensing guidelines for live events .
Will people speak out only when live event - goers are asked for fingerprints and retina scans – all maintained on a database for " their own security " ?
UK Music chief Feargal Sharkey recently told a Commons select committee that this policy had already been used to pull the plug on an afternoon charity concert of school bands in a public park , organised by a local councillor : " Live music is now a threat to the prevention of terrorism . "
As Martin Rawlings , director of the Pub and Beer Association , rightly told a newspaper a couple of months ago :
" I know of licensees faced with this saying they are just not going to put live music on .
Form 696 is being used only in London so far , but there are similar things going on around the country , where the police are asking publicans to sign various protocols .
It has gone too far , frankly . "
It has .
You can sign the No 10 petition ; write to your MP about it ; or join the Facebook group .
Save live events , oppose police authoritarianism !
You know it makes sense .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) is asking for the public 's help in its new campaign to free cell phones from the software locks that stifle competition and cripple consumers .
The campaign 's website is FreeYourPhone.org .
Hundreds of thousands of cell phone owners have modified their phones to connect to a new service provider or run the software of their choosing , and many more would like to .
But the threat of litigation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) has driven them underground .
The DMCA prohibits " circumventing " technical protection measures used to protect copyrighted works .
But many cell phone manufacturers and service providers build these software locks to protect their business models instead of copyrighted material .
" Apple locks its iPhone to AT&T and prevents users from installing any software that has not been pre-approved by Apple , " said EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney Fred von Lohmann .
" Consumers need a DMCA exemption to lift the cloud of legal risk that otherwise serves only to reduce competition and consumer choice . "
Every three years , the U.S. Copyright Office convenes a rulemaking to consider granting exemptions to the DMCA 's ban on circumvention to mitigate the consumer harm .
EFF has already filed exemption requests with the Copyright Office addressing the issues , but the rulemaking proceeding also accepts public comments about the proposals .
" Companies are using the DMCA to threaten customers out of exercising their consumer rights , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick .
" The Copyright Office needs to hear real stories about how these software locks frustrate consumers and developers . "
On FreeYourPhone.org , people can sign EFF 's petition to the Copyright Office and share their stories about cell phone frustrations .
EFF will also help people officially submit those stories to the Copyright Office before the February 2 deadline .
The Copyright Office will hold public hearings on the DMCA exemption requests in Washington , DC , and California in the spring , and the final rulemaking order will be issued in October .

What ’s up with the Republicans ?
Have they no sense that their policies have sent the country hurtling down the road to ruin ?
Are they so divorced from reality that in their delusionary state they honestly believe we need more of their tax cuts for the rich and their other forms of plutocratic irresponsibility , the very things that got us to this deplorable state ?
The G.O.P. ’s latest campaign is aimed at undermining President Obama ’s effort to cope with the national economic emergency by attacking the spending in his stimulus package and repeating ad nauseam the Republican mantra for ever more tax cuts .
“ Right now , given the concerns that we have over the size of this package and all the spending in this package , we do n’t think it ’s going to work , ” said Representative John Boehner , an Ohio Republican who is House minority leader .
Speaking on NBC’s “ Meet the Press , ” Mr. Boehner said of the plan : “ Put me down in the ‘ no ’ column . ”
If anything , the stimulus package is not large enough .
Less than 24 hours after Mr. Boehner ’s televised exercise in obstructionism , the heavy - equipment company Caterpillar announced that it was cutting 20,000 jobs , Sprint Nextel said it was eliminating 8,000 , and Home Depot 7,000 .
Former Doctor Who Peter Davison reveals how his only daughter fell in love with David Tennant
When Peter Davison first referred to David Tennant , otherwise known as Doctor Who , as his 24 - year - old daughter Georgia Moffett ’s boyfriend , she denied it .
‘ Georgia barked at me : “ No he is n’t ! ” But then I noticed that she had started referring to him as exactly that and bemoaning the fact that “ her boyfriend was away ” when David had to go off filming . ’
Peter , married to actress Elizabeth Morton , his second wife , by whom he has two sons , Louis , nine , and Joel , seven , admits that the fact his daughter has a Doctor Who for a dad — and for a boyfriend — is unusual .
Doctor , doctor : Peter Davison and David Tennant have both played Dr Who
‘ It can be odd when David comes round for Sunday lunch and we all sit at the table — me , an ex-Doctor Who , with my wife , and David , another Doctor Who , with my daughter .
‘ We were recently invited round for dinner by producer Steven Moffat — who is going to be head writer and executive producer on the show when Matt Smith takes over from David in 2010 — and among those present there were me , my wife , David , Georgia , my two sons and , of course , Steven himself .
‘ Halfway through the meal , Joel said : “ Dad , should I hang a sign on the front door saying ‘ Knock if you want an autograph ’ ? ”
And he was right — there would have been Doctor Who fans queuing round the block if they ’d known we were there .
‘ But it ’s great because David is a genuinely nice guy — and also a very fine Doctor Who .
I think he ’s benefited from the advances in technology there have been since my time in the early Eighties , when the sets used to wobble about .
‘ But he has done a fantastic job , and it ’s sad that he has decided to move on . ’
Peter racked up 70 episodes as the legendary Time Lord , between 1981 and 1984 .
‘ I ’m flattered that David considers me to have been his Doctor , the one he watched when he was growing up . ’
Tennant , 37 , who has always kept his private life under wraps , met Georgia while working on the show — she played his character ’s daughter , Jenny , in an episode shown last year .
Then , as Peter , 57 , says , ‘ things moved on between them ’ .
‘ I ’m delighted Georgia has found happiness because she has n’t always had an easy life , ’ he adds , referring to the fact that his marriage to her mother — U.S. actress Sandra Dickinson — ended acrimoniously in 1994 after 16 years ; and that Georgia gave birth to her son Ty — now six — aged 17 and still at school .
‘ I admire Georgia enormously for the way she ’s dealt with what life has thrown at her .
I know I am biased , but I believe she is a very fine actress who may well have drawn on difficult experiences to develop her talent .
‘ So watch this space .
When she makes it big in Hollywood she has promised me a job as her pool boy !
She is also — aside from her work — a good mother and a determined , courageous person . ’
Much the same can be said of Peter ’s character in the ITV1 drama Unforgiven , which was shot in Yorkshire .
It stars former Coronation Street actress Suranne Jones in the lead role of ex-convict Ruth Slater .
Peter plays a lawyer determined to help Ruth , a woman in her 30s recently released from prison for the murder of two policemen .
Who 's a lucky girl !
Georgina Moffett is the daughter Peter and Sandra Dickinson
‘ My character , John Ingrams , believes Ruth should be given a second chance , and wants to help rehabilitate her back into society .
‘ And I absolutely support his intentions .
I do n’t think you should cast aside a person ’s life on the basis of one incident , however serious that incident may have been .
I admire Ingrams for sticking up for her — for having the determination to stand up for what he believes in . ’
Peter has also been prepared to stand up and be counted .
Although initially reluctant to tell this story — he finally does so only to illustrate his affinity with his character — he recalls the time he took on the police rather than see an injustice go unreported .
Emerging from a restaurant in Windsor , Berkshire , with his wife , Peter could hardly believe what he was witnessing : a car containing four police officers deliberately running down a member of the public in the middle of a pedestrian precinct .
Then , when the injured man vented his anger at being assaulted by banging on the bonnet of the police car , the four officers got out , pinned him to the bonnet and arrested him for being drunk and disorderly .
‘ When I asked the officers what they were doing , one of them said : “ Stay out of this , it ’s none of your business ” , ’ remembers Peter .
‘ I was so shocked by what I had seen that I could n’t just leave it at that .
So I found out the police station they took this guy to , contacted his solicitor and agreed to appear in court to give my version of events .
‘ What happened then was even more shocking : I heard all four police officers lie through their teeth in court , claiming that the man had been violent towards them first .
‘ When I was asked if I had taken my eye off what was happening , I admitted that I had looked away , just for a moment .
‘ That was enough doubt to allow the policemen to get off scot - free .
It was sickening and disillusioning .
‘ I ’m aware there are two sides to any story and the guy in question may have been inebriated for an appreciable part of the evening .
I also know that most police officers are decent , law - abiding souls who do a good job .
But this was wholly wrong .
‘ It all happened a few years ago , but I still feel aggrieved .
I find that kind of behaviour — by people we are supposed to trust 100 per cent — totally unforgivable . ’
Dr Woo : David and actress Georgina began dating when she played his daughter
Peter has also been prepared to take the law into his own hands in the interests of justice .
Seven years ago , he raced after a thief in North - West London who had stolen a video camera from his car , containing pictures of his infant son , Joel , born just 24 hours earlier .
Peter cornered him in a cul - de- sac , pinned him to the ground and then , with help from customers of a nearby pub who rang the police , sat on the man until he was arrested .
‘ People have said to me that I must have been awfully brave to have chased after this guy and apprehended him .
But that was n’t the thought running through my head when the incident was taking place .
‘ I was just thinking : “ That guy ’s run off with a video of my newborn son — I want it back . ”
‘ I ’m not sure I ’d do the same thing now because you hear about cases in which victims who have fought back end up being killed or seriously injured — but I hope I would . ’
He is certainly no shrinking violet when it comes to expressing his views .
On the Jonathan Ross / Russell Brand scandal — which led to Brand ’s dismissal from the BBC and Ross ’s suspension — he comments : ‘ I thought Ross ’s suspension , in particular , was utterly ludicrous .
Why punish all the people who enjoy tuning into his programmes ? ’
Ross will return to TV tonight and radio tomorrow , while Peter — once the final episode of Unforgiven has been broadcast on Monday — will disappear from our screens , possibly for some time .
His career is going through one of its occasional fallow periods .
He suffered a similar downturn in the early Nineties , after hitting TV heights with Doctor Who , All Creatures Great And Small and A Very Peculiar Practice .
An appearance in the Lenny Henry drama Hope And Glory in 1999 got him back on track — the then head of drama at ITV , Nick Elliott , was so impressed by Peter ’s performance that he asked writers to find parts for him .
He subsequently appeared in At Home With The Braithwaites , Distant Shores and The Last Detective .
Time Lord : The fifth Doctor Peter Davison with Janet Fielding and Mark Strickson
But all those series have finished , while two TV sitcoms starring Peter , Fear , Stress And Anger and The Complete Guide To Parenting , were short - lived .
But he still likes to pick and choose his parts .
‘ I ’ve turned down the chance to appear in a number of dramas over the past year that are not quite soaps , but getting that way , ’ he says , wriggling a little in his chair when it ’s suggested he is referring to Casualty and Holby City .
Might he have to tighten his belt if he does n’t start landing regular work in the not - too - distant future ?
‘ I ’m hoping I can hold out for that really exciting part rather than having to do something I simply could n’t bear for six months or a year .
‘ I ’m off to Australia in March for some Doctor Who conventions .
And I get residual payments from old shows such as Doctor Who when they ’re sold to a far - flung part of the world .
‘ If David Tennant ’s successor , Matt Smith , wants to hand over the Doctor Who reins to an actor pushing 60 in a few years ’ time , I ’ll be ready and waiting .

Goals of this resume : 1 . Must be printable in black & white on one page .
2 . Make visual sense of non-traditional job & education patterns .
A resume for the 21st century .
Benefits : 1 . It 's easy to compare the length of time you 've spent in various professional & educational pursuits .
2 . Your cross-cultural / global work experience is put in visual context .
3 . Your educational activities are grouped visually to emphasize their duration and content , and de-emphasize ceremonial end - points ( " the degree " ) .
This is just a first attempt , to get feedback and new ideas .
I expect the best solutions to be anticlimactic : simple designs that attract as little attention as possible .
As Edward Tufte says , " The resume is a document , not a design statement .
The design should not attract attention ; the design of a resume should be straightforward and harmless .
That is the best that resume design can do : straightforward and harmless . "
Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest , and often demanding , film directors of all time , making movies from Spartacus to Full Metal Jacket .
And if it had not been for his friend Steven Spielberg , there may also have been one called Aryan Papers , set in the Nazi- occupied Warsaw Ghetto .
The story of the movie Kubrick never made – despite investing enormous energy into it – is to be told through a new art installation at the British Film Institute in London by the Turner - prize nominated artists Jane and Louise Wilson .
The twin sisters were invited to delve into the Stanley Kubrick archives at the University of the Arts in London and come up with a piece of work to coincide with a major Kubrick season on the South Bank this year .
What they alighted on was the fascinating story of Aryan Papers , a film that he was adapting from Louis Begley 's 1991 novel , Wartime Lies .
It tells the story of a young Jewish boy hidden as a Catholic by his aunt .
The Wilsons had a wonderful time in the archives .
" We did feel a bit like kids in a sweetshop and there is so much there you could easily spend days in there , it really is incredible , " said Louise .
" Of course the films he has made are so well known we wanted to concentrate on something he had n't done . "
Kubrick , a secretive obsessional perfectionist by any standards , spent months on preproduction for Aryan Papers , even casting the Dutch actor Johanna ter Steege in the lead role .
The Wilsons came across intriguing stills of Ter Steege in different costumes , shot at different angles and in different lights and , taking these as a starting point , then approached the actor herself .
The resulting film will cut between the stills and their interview with Ter Steege .
" It is a sort of bittersweet story , " said Louise .
" The film would have been a major thing to happen for her , or for anyone .
It was memorable for her to meet [ Kubrick ] and work with him , she had to keep the whole thing quiet for eight months .
It was obviously a tremendous blow that the film never happened .
She had never had that kind of rigour from a director . "
Kubrick put an awful lot of effort into Aryan Papers : writing the screenplay , casting Ter Steege and travelling to the Czech town of Brno as a possible location for wartime Warsaw .
That the film was never made seems to be due to a combination of factors .
Spielberg 's Schindler 's
List came out in 1993 and Kubrick may have felt beaten to the line .
He may also have got sidetracked by his project to make the film AI – which Spielberg ended up making after Kubrick 's death .
Or the whole project may have been too much for him .
Louise said : " Having spoken to Johanna , it sounds like he got very depressed .
He was so immersed in this research I think he found the process quite disturbing and upsetting . "
• Jane and Louise Wilson 's installation will be at the BFI Southbank , London , from 13 February to 19 April .

A university professor ( 62 ) , who taught logic , over a twenty year period called over a thousand of his female students to his office , where he would beguile them with logic into allowing him to fondle their breasts .
He used the same argument each time , and only recently did a student manage to see through it , resulting in his arrest .
His technique was bizarre , but highly logical :
First the professor would call his chosen students to his office , for a lesson in logic :
“ I can touch you without laying so much as a finger on you ” he would say .
The perplexed students would naturally tend to respond “ Impossible . ”
If they did , he would follow through with “ If I ca n’t do it , I ’ll give you ¥ 1,000 . ”
If the student agreed to the “ wager ” , he would immediately pull out his wallet , hand them a ¥ 1,000 note , and then begin brazenly fondling their breasts .
Those students who complained of sexual harassment or worse , he would silence with the following line of argument : “ As you in fact gave verbal assent to the contract and accepted the ¥ 1,000 fee , the contract is complete .
It ’s meaningless to try to take this to court . ”
He continued this same tactic for some 20 years without issue , and his victims are thought to number over a thousand .
None it seems could overcome his logical arguments , or possessed knowledge of the fact that illegal contracts are unenforceable .
Only recently it seems did a student actually bring this to the attention of the proper authorities ; he was soon arrested on charges of indecent assault .
Police are scathing , and are look at adding as many charges as they possibly can :
“ He abused his knowledge of logic to undertake this dastardly scheme . ”
Via ( the very dubious ) Kyoko .
This unfortunate career of minor infamy certainly place the professor ’s reputation in the gutter , but we must also wonder at either the intelligence , or the virtues of his student victims .
Buying his line says little about their wits , whilst settling for a bargain basement groper ’s fee of 1,000 also says even less about them …

Once there was just Newtonian physics and the world seemed neat and mechanical .
Then quantum physics came along and revealed that deep down things are much weirder than they seem .
Something similar is now happening with public policy .
Once , classical economics dominated policy thinking .
The classical models presumed a certain sort of orderly human makeup .
Inside each person , reason rides the passions the way a rider sits atop a horse .
Sometimes people do stupid things , but generally the rider makes deliberative decisions , and the market rewards rational behavior .
Markets tend toward efficiency .
People respond in pretty straightforward ways to incentives .
The invisible hand forms a spontaneous , dynamic order .
Economic behavior can be accurately predicted through elegant models .
This view explains a lot , but not the current financial crisis  how so many people could be so stupid , incompetent and self - destructive all at once .
The crisis has delivered a blow to classical economics and taken a body of psychological work that was at the edge of public policy thought and brought it front and center .
We 've already seen an early version of Windows 7 installed on a MacBook Pro , but with a brand new , more widely available beta now flooding the internets , there 's no doubt quite a few more folks ready to give it a try themselves and , naturally , some have already done just that .

The government attempted to prevent same - sex couples in other countries from gaining the right to enter into civil partnerships , the Guardian has learned .
Despite the fact that civil partnerships are recognised under UK law , the government made legal submissions to the European court of human rights arguing that Austria should not have an obligation to provide the same rights to same - sex couples there .
The move is at odds with its own professed commitment to equality for lesbians , gay and bisexual people , which saw the UK become one of only three European countries to recognise same - sex relationships under the 2004 Civil Partnership Act .
The government was challenging the claim of an Austrian couple , Horst Schalk and Johann Kopf , that Austria has violated their right to a private and family life , the right not to suffer discrimination , and the right to marry .
It argued that the UK's civil partnership legislation was " a natural progression towards its goal of developing a more inclusive society " , but defended the right of other European countries not to follow suit .
" There is no positive obligation to create a structure for legal recognition or registration of same - sex relationships , " it said , claiming that in other countries any such obligation may be out of keeping with the social , cultural and religious norms and traditions .
" This was a very peculiar intervention for the UK to make , " said Nuala Mole , director of the Aire Centre , a human rights group also intervening in the case .
" Given that the UK recognises civil partnerships and has given civil partners practically all the advantage of marriage , it is strange that they should be intervening to prevent another country from doing the same . "
The government has now abandoned its challenge to the Austrians ' claim that they are entitled to legal recognition for their relationship , after coming under pressure from questions raised in the House of Lords .
Lord Lester , who opposed the government 's intervention in the Austrian case , said : " I am delighted that the government is clarifying its position with the Strasbourg court .
This means that the UK is advising the court not to feel inhibited in developing its case law on protection for same - sex relationships . "
However , the government is still arguing that the court should not require European states to allow marriage for same - sex couples .
It has told the court that the right to marry refers to " the traditional marriage between persons of the opposite biological sex ...
There is not an evolving convergence to the effect that persons in a same - sex relationship should be allowed to contract a marriage . "
UK law on civil partnerships provides legal recognition that is " very similar " to marriage , Lord Bach told the House of Lords last month , " but [ the law ] did not call those partnerships marriage , and that remains government policy " .

Daily Show : ' You Do n't Know Dick ' Cheney indictment quiz David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This
It was announced this week that Vice President Dick Cheney and former Attorney Alberto Gonzales have been indicted in Texas in connection with a prison scandal .
" What the hoo ? " exclaimed The Daily Show's Jon Stewart , as his audience cheered at the news .
" We can do that ?
And we 're just thinking of it now ? "
News reports indicate that the indictment involves a " money - trail of Cheney 's prison - related businesses . "
" Dick Cheney has prison - related business , " marveled Stewart .
" Is there any unpleasant aspect of our society that Dick Cheney is n't making money off of ? "
Stewart then offered a multiple - choice quiz , asking , " What prison - related business is Vice - President Cheney in trouble for ? "
He suggested such possibilities as " exploitative conditions at Cheney 's ' Chain Gang Experience 4 Kids ' " or " tax evasion at ' Halliburton Dick 's Water Board Park and Bad Time Jailateria . ' "
However , Stewart eventually disappointed his audience by admitting that the basis of the indictment is merely that Cheney " has an investment in a company that has an investment in a company that runs some prisons where there have been allegations of inmate abuse . "
According to more formal accounts of the charges , which stem from a complex legal battle in a South Texas county , " The three - page indictment alleges that Mr Cheney profited from the abuse because he invested [ $ 85 million ] in the Vanguard Group -- an investment management company that reportedly has interests in the prison companies in charge of the detention centres .
It said this was a ' direct conflict of interest ' because Mr Cheney had influence over the federal contracts awarded to the prison companies . "

A new documentary — and new revelations triggered by it — have Ted Haggard in the news again .
The HBO film by Alexandra Pelosi , The Trials of Ted Haggard , premieres Thursday .
The revelation it unintentionally triggered is that Haggard had a previously undisclosed “ consensual sexual relationship ” with a twenty - something male volunteer that “ went on for a long period of time … it was n’t a one - time act . ”
And , it turns out , New Life Church paid the young man off to keep silent .
( New Life claims , “ It was not a payoff .
It was compassionate assistance . ” )
All of this will raise ratings for Pelosi ’s documentary .
And make Haggard ’s Larry King Live appearance set for Thursday a far more difficult one .
( His upcoming appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show was apparently taped prior to the revelations . )
The SF Chronicle talked to Pelosi about how the film was made :
[ T ]he 41 minutes that filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi creates out of a series of moments with Haggard shot during his exile has a more ambitious aim .
The Emmy - nominated ( “ Travels With George ” ) documentarian and San Francisco - raised daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi aims for a tale of forgiveness and understanding , and an examination of the duplicity of the church ’s teachings of forgiveness .
“ Why the gay men and women of S.F. should forgive Ted Haggard is because there ’s nothing wrong with being gay , ” says Alexandra Pelosi , 38 .
“ The Christians are condemning him for being gay and that ’s not who we are .
We liberals are supposed to forgive that and say it ’s OK . ”
She ’s exactly right .
There ’s nothing wrong with being gay !
She ought to tell that to Ted .
Speaking as a gay liberal , I could forgive have some compassionate understanding for Haggard if he were to stop living a lie .
He has not :
The point , Pelosi said , is n’t whether Haggard is gay or not .
( She says she thinks he is “ somewhere in between , and I know my gay friends hate when I say that . ” )
It is that while organized religion preaches forgiveness , at Haggard ’s darkest hour , they turned their back on him .
I ’m with those gay friends .
I ’m old enough to remember Harvey Milk ‘s message that we must come out of the closet .
As true today as it was in the 1970 ’s , it is the closet that leads to hypocrisy , shame and disgrace .
The proud and still all too difficult embrace of a gay identity could free Haggard , and his family , from his demons .
The fact that coming out wo n’t bring him good standing in his community of faith is indeed sad .
But I ’d like to see him leave insurance sales behind and devote himself to something far more meaningful .
Say , for example , advocating for a Christian embrace of lgbt people .
He could even start a gay evangelical Baptist church ( there ’s one here in rural Georgia ) .
Then the lgbt community might embrace him .
He could write a best - selling book .
And be comfortably back in the spotlight .
There ’s no question his media appearances would be far easier as an out proud gay man than as the shame - filled “ first - class loser ” he looks at the camera and claims to be in Pelosi ’s film .
LATER : This Newsweek interview — his first magazine interview since the scandal but before the latest revelations — confirms the lying denial the man still lives in :
Haggard now thinks that he lashed himself too hard .
“ I understand why when a criminal is caught they will sometimes admit to things they did n’t do , ” he says .
“ I wanted to overrepent , and I think I did overrepent .
In my [ resignation ] letter to the church I said I was a deceiver and a liar , but I had n’t lied about anything except to keep quiet about what was going on inside me . ” [ … ]
He says he has never had an adult same - sex encounter with anyone other than Jones .
The lies are so bold - faced they make me sympathetic for the church , not Haggard .
He ’s living a cowardly lie and deserves no sympathy from anyone until he repents , comes clean and comes out !

The majority of people who are getting canned right now did n't even , as the UAW workers had , get some small vote on how they would effect the shape of their industry .
Structured finance and investment funds are only a small part of what investment banks do .
Strufin and the mortgage desk are out on their ass , of course -- but so are lots of people in M&A ; and various investment banking groups that specialized in equity and corporate bonds and would n't have known a CDO if it bit them on the ass ; corporate and muni bond traders ; cap markets guys , and so forth .
All their markets dried up because of a credit crisis that they cannot even arguably be credited with creating .
It 's no more fair that they have to sell their house , move in with the in - laws , and try to figure out what the hell they 're qualified for , than that autoworkers have to .
Less , maybe , because the autoworkers have had a lot of warning that their companies are on shaky ground .
What sort of moral hazard are we reducing by destroying their lives ?
That 'll teach them to play by the rules all their lives , get a lot of education , and go to work for a bank !
Apparently the message we want to send is " Do n't go look for a high - paying job ; get a picturesque one . "
No one in the financial industry declared that their salaries and perks were n't on the table until some vague and unspecified date in the future , as the UAW has .
Actually , from what I understand , the CEO of Lehman tried to , and he was rightly told to go piss up a rope .
The executives of the failed banks had a huge portion of their net worth tied up in said banks , and have now lost most of their assets .
That is not to say that we should feel excess sorrow for them , or try to preserve their jobs , or the gargantuan sums that they were paid five years ago .
The financial industry was bloated , the salaries out - of - whack with any possible real economic value they could be argued to have provided to anyone , and that will have to change -- but we do n't need the government to ensure that , because the industry is contracting rapidly , and the worst - hit parts are exactly the places that were most out of line with economic reality .
We might like to go back and seize everything they made over the last five years , but for various practical and legal reasons ( and arguably even moral ones ) , we can't , so the pointless fantasizing is n't getting us much of anywhere .
Any CEOs who tried to pay themselves bonuses out of TARP are cretins who should not have been permitted to do so .
But aside from John
Thain , who did n't create the mess at Merrill - - he took over in December 2007 to clean up the destruction , and lost his job less than a year later when he had to merge the bank with BofA to save it -- I 'm not aware of any CEOs who have been paid any bonuses out of TARP .
That 's not to say that there are n't any .
But the AP 's infamous report on outrageous compensation mostly seems to be 2007 funds that we can't claw back because , er , they lost it all in the collapse , or stock options that will only pay off if the firm does well .
Last week the Supreme Court handed down a decision that a man with schizophrenia did not have the right to represent himself in court without an attorney .
Indiana v. Edwards raises questions about whether the legal standard conferring competence to stand trial differs from competence to represent oneself .
The 7 - to - 2 opinion upheld an Indiana 's judge 's decision not to allow Ahmed Edwards to conduct his own self - defense .
Edwards spent three years in the hospital before he was deemed competent to stand trial .
The New York Times reported in March that when he was representing himself portions of motions Edwards submitted to the judge were incoherent .
An attorney was assigned but he and Edwards disagreed on the strategy for a defense .
An analysis in Scotusblog , notes that " states may now have one standard of mentally competency for putting a mentally impaired person on trial , and a higher standard that such a person would have to meet in order to be allowed self - representation . "
But the courts did not address that standard for self - representation in light of a ruling of mental competence .
Some expect this issue , which qualifies the Sixth Amendment , to be revisited .

For the eXile 's 250th issue celebration , I 've decided to step back a bit and take a look at modern warfare , a sort of mid-term summary of everything I 've been trying to teach you folks over the past hundred or so issues I 've been writing for this paper .
I 'll give you the bad news first : no 21st century war is " purely military . "
The days when countries duked it out on the battlefield are over for the foreseeable future .
What we have now is something very strange .
It goes by a lot of names , from " terrorism " to " asymmetrical warfare " to " fourth - generation warfare , " depending on whether you 're for it , against it , or just trying to sound cool .
But whatever you call it , the key factor is that it never involves WW - II style conventional war between nation - states .
Oh , there 'll be a few good old - school conventional wars from time to time .
My favorite is the Ethiopia vs. Eritrea war of the 1980s .
And you could include the Iran - Iraq War from that same decade .
But those wars are rare , and going to get rarer .
Because there 's a much cheaper , easier way to make war .
This way does n't require any of the building blocks of conventional war : you do n't need industry , aircraft , armor or massive armies .
In fact , this kind of war can be played by any group of wackos that can round up a dozen or so bushwhackers .
All you need is small arms and a grudge -- and those are the only two commodities most of the world has a surplus of .
It 's a heartbreaker for you hardware freaks , this idea that it just does n't matter whether our tanks are better than their tanks ( or planes or artillery or whatever ) .
But it 's time you grew up , guys : have n't you kind of noticed that in most wars , the other side does n't even use tanks , or planes , or artillery ( except mortars , which are so portable they can be considered small arms ) ?
You guys are stuck in the dream about a classic NATO / Warsaw Pact Sumo match in Central Europe , and you just do n't want to think about all these brush wars .
Well , time to wake up .
The Warsaw Pact does n't exist any more , so that war is never going to happen .
The fact is , it never was .
If the Soviets had sent the tanks into the Fulda Gap , it would have been a nukefest , not a tank battle like Kursk .
Not exactly a wargamer 's dream : before you can even get your corps deployed , the whole playing field would melt down .
So I 'm preaching real war here .
If you want tank duels , go replay the Kursk Salient or project yourself fifty years into the future , where maybe , just maybe , the Asian powers will have a good all - out war .
If you want to know about war now , then you have to jump into the weird world of " asymmetrical war . "
And I 'll tell you : once you make that jump , you find this kind of war is just as interesting , just as satisfying as setpiece battles .
I made the jump ten years ago , when I realized my hardware research was n't helping me understand the wars that were actually happening in Africa and Asia .
And I 'm glad I did , because I understand the world way better than most people .
I knew Iraq would go bad because I 've studied this kind of war .
I wish more people had .
Maybe we would n't have jumped into this mess .
To get your head around this kind of war , you have to delete most of your ideas about warfare .
That 's right : get your Black & Decker out of the garage , charge that puppy up , and do some brain surgery on the part of your cortex that stores your favorite ideas about war .
Here 's a list of War Myths , so you 'll know where to drill : 1 . War involves battles .
Wrong !
Most of the " armies " in the world right now avoid battle and focus on killing civilians .
This is the hardest thing for Americans to understand : armies that do n't aim at victory and actually avoid battle .
So many war buffs who ought to know better just wo n't see this .
If you read military blogs , you know the type : guys who say " we won every battle in Nam ! " as if that proves we should have won .
Boneheads !
The NVA / Viet Cong strategy was classic irregular warfare stuff , based on outlasting the enemy , not defeating him in battle .
When they did go for military victory , like in the Tet Offensive , it was a near - disaster , saved by the other key fact about this sort of war : 2 . You win by killing the enemy .
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
In this kind of war the enemy wants you to kill a lot of people .
A lot of irregular warfare groups start their campaigns with a suicide raid , where they expect to be slaughtered .
3 . Hi -tech beats lo-tech .
Not lately it does n't .
Here again it 's a matter of you hardware freaks facing hard facts .
If we take Iraq 2003 as a familiar and painful example , you saw a classic outcome : our hi-tech beat their wanna - be hi-tech in the conventional battles .
Then we started getting picked off by low - tech ambushes where the insurgents used homemade IEDs in combination with old , rugged Soviet weapons like the RPG - 7 and Kalashnikov .
After two years , those simple weapons are still effective -- and they 're actually getting lower - and lower - tech !
Take IEDs : when the Iraqi insurgents started using them , they'd hook the detonator up to a garage - door opener or cell phone so they could be set off by remote control signals .
Our convoys started using jammers to stop those signals from getting through to the detonators .
So now the insurgents are using wires or even string to set off the IED .
You can't get much lower - tech than a string .
And that 's why it works , because you can't jam a string either .
4 . " Overwhelming force !
Hit the insurgents hard enough , and they 'll quit . "
Wrong .
Americans are pretty well anti-death , but lots of other tribes are in love with the idea of the martyrdom thing .
Like the Shi'ites , whom I 've written about already , some might say with admiration .
People who woof about " hittin ' 'em hard " have n't thought cold and hard enough about what they mean .
We have a problem with the Iraqi Sunnis .
There are about seven million of them .
All you need for an effective insurgency is a few hundred urban guerrillas ( with a much bigger base of civilian supporters ) .
So they 're never going to run out of young men .
And no overwhelming force short of neutron bombs will solve the problem .
Which brings us to another very interesting question , the future of genocide and nuclear weapons .
But as long as we 're wimping around with this " no nukes " rule , there just ai n't no kind of overwhelming force that can convince every testosterone - poisoned Sunni kid to join the Pepsi Generation .
Consult your own experience , remember what young males are like !
Remember high school PE !
How hard would it have been to get those guys , Beavis and Butthead times 80 , to plant a bomb or shoot a sentry if they thought they could get away with it , or better yet , be seen as heroes by their fellow countrymen ?
Teenage boys are the cannon fodder of any guerrilla war , and teenage boys are nothing but weasels who stand on their hind feet sometimes .
Keep that in mind when media types try to hand you our next piece of total crap :
5 . People want democracy and peace and all that kind of stuff .
No .
In fact , HELL no !
Let me repeat your first lesson : consult your own experience instead of believing the talking heads .
Do you care about those things -- I mean , compared to money and sex and taking revenge on the MR2 that cut you off a couple of blocks back ?
The only ideology I see around me is God .
Most people in Fresno have a bad case of God .
It takes up all their brain power trying to read the Bible and mind everybody else 's business .
They would n't care if Charles Manson took power as long as he said God and Jesus every few seconds .
Out of all the people I 've met , I can only think of one who cared about democracy : my Social Studies teacher .
But he was one of these decent old Minnesota Swedes , goodhearted , too soft for Bakersfield , committed to ignoring reality .
His wife , another big Secular Humanist , left him for a dyke , his students called him " Gums " and he admitted once to our class that he'd lost his Faith .
That made him Public Enemy # 1 with the Christians and he had to transfer to another school district .
That 's what believing in that stuff 'll get you .
If this is a democracy , it 's weird how the only people who go in for it are conmen and closet cases like Rove .
No normal American would go near it .
They know better .
We all know local politics belongs to real estate developers at civic level and to the corporations at Federal level .
Which is fine with me , and with most Americans , but why call it democracy ?
And as for peace , I was always against it .
Peace is for people who have satisfying lives .
The rest of us want that flood , that real rain .
Like the man said , " Bring it on . "
Look around the world and you 'll see that people are divided into ethnic gangs , like the planet 's one big San Quentin .
All they want is for their gang to win .
If they have any ideology beyond that , it 's more of the God stuff , and you need Thorazine to cure that .
Godfearing gangbangers , that 's exactly what we ran into in Somalia , 1993 .
Half the population of Mogadishu turned on our guys who were trying to provide aid for the starving .
They did n't want peace , democracy or any of that shit .
They wanted their clan to win and the other clans to lose .
And if stopping the aid convoys from getting food to those enemy clans was the only way to win , they were ready to make it happen , ready to die fighting our best troops backed by attack helicopters and APCs .
We killed maybe a thousand of these " civilians " and lost 18 Rangers and Delta operators .
And the Somalis made the anniversary of that fight a national holiday .
It 's worth giving a moment to let that sink in : these people fought to the death against overwhelmingly superior US forces , because they wanted their clan to win by starving rival clans to death .
Yes , Grasshopper , you must meditate on the fact that People are superstitious tribalists .
Democracy comes about 37th , if that .
Nobody wants to face that fact : we 're tribal critters .
We 'll die for the tribe .
More to the point , we 'll kill for it .
We do n't care about democracy .
And I 'm not just talking here about people in tropical hellholes like Somalia , I mean your town , your street .
Most Americans are just like me : old - school nationalists .
We want America to be Roman , to kick ass .
The rest is for Quakers .
Just remember , everything they told you is wrong .
Here 's a quick list of the main points .
Go and meditate upon them .
Memorize them while I whack you with this stick like a good Zen teacher should .
1 . Most wars are asymmetrical / irregular .
2 . In these wars , the guerrillas / irregulars / insurgents do NOT aim for military victory .
3 . You can NOT defeat these groups by killing lots of their members .
In fact , they want you to do that .
4 . Hi-tech weaponry is mostly useless in these wars .
5 . " Hearts and Minds , " meaning propaganda and morale , are more important than military superiority .
6 . Most people are not rational , they are TRIBAL : " my gang yay , your gang boo ! "
It really is that simple .
The rest is cosmetics .

LONDON 
When works by the British artist Damien Hirst sold for a record $ 127 million on the same day in September that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection , it seemed the art market might escape the economic crisis .
But a string of disappointing auctions over the last four months showed that the art market had no such immunity , prompting Christie ’s International , the large auction house , to start a cost - reduction effort on Monday that will include job cuts .
“ We have begun to implement a companywide reorganization , which includes significant staff reductions , not renewing many consultants ’ contracts and the continuation of other cost - reduction initiatives , that will ensure we remain competitive and profitable in 2009 , ” Christie ’s said in a statement on Monday , without saying how many positions might be cut or giving any further details .
In the last months , auction prices dropped together with financial markets , ending a decade - long boom in the art market that was buoyed by record bonuses paid to financial executives .
And for my next trick ... a near death experience
Pinochet stripped of immunity in torture , kidnapping cases SANTIAGO , Chile ( AP )  Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was stripped of immunity from prosecution Friday in 59 cases of torture and kidnapping at a secret detention center where hundreds of dissidents were held — including President - elect Michelle Bachelet and her mother .
The president of the Santiago Court of Appeals , Juan Escobar , said the justices voted 13 - 5 to lift Pinochet 's immunity , but the ruling must be upheld by the Supreme Court before the 90 - year - old former strongman can be tried .
AP Pinochet Pinochet 's defense team said it will appeal .
Bachelet and her mother , Angela Jeria , were arrested 15 months after the 1973 coup led by Pinochet and taken to Villa Grimaldi , where both were tortured .
Their cases are not among the 36 kidnappings and 23 incidents of torture that led to the removal of the legal immunity Pinochet enjoys as former president .
Villa Grimaldi was one of the most notorious detention centers used by Pinochet 's feared security services .
The site , in a southern suburb of the capital , Santiago , has been turned into a memorial to victims of repression under Pinochet , who ruled in 1973 - 1990 .
Pinochet has been stripped of immunity and may face trial in three other cases — two on human rights charges , one for tax evasion and corruption — and is free on bail .
The previous cases included killing and kidnapping , but this was the first time torture was mentioned .
Previous attempts to bring Pinochet to trial have been blocked by the Supreme Court for health reasons .
He has been diagnosed as suffering from mild dementia , diabetes and arthritis , and he has a pacemaker .
But court - appointed doctors who examined him three months ago determined he was fit to stand trial .
Friday 's ruling came at the request of Judge Alejandro Solis , who said he decided to seek Pinochet 's trial after a report by an independent commission on torture and illegal imprisonment at Villa Grimaldi .
Solis also questioned some former agents of the secret police , and one of them , Ricardo Lawrence , told him that Pinochet was aware of what happened at Villa Grimaldi and even visited it once .
That claim had been mentioned before but never confirmed .
In his request to the court to lift Pinochet 's immunity , Solis wrote that the agents involved in the abuses were following " clear and specific orders from the director of the service , who was on its turn following orders from his superior , the President of the Republic and commander in chief of the army , Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . "
Bachelet , elected Jan. 15 as Chile 's first female president , usually avoids being specific about her time at Villa Grimaldi but has said that she and her mother were kept blindfolded for long periods and were physically mistreated .
She has gained widespread praise for showing no rancor for what happened to her .
The head of Chile 's Catholic Church , Monsignor Alejandro Goic , called her " a symbol of reconciliation among Chileans . "
Bachelet 's mother has called Villa Grimaldi " one of the worst houses of torture in Santiago " under Pinochet , a description also used by Solis .
" I was kept for a week in a box , blindfolded , tied up , without food , " she once told the Santiago daily Las Ultimas Noticias .
Bachelet 's father , air force Gen. Alberto Bachelet , was jailed for opposing the coup .
He died in prison of a heart attack , which the president - elect suggested was a result of torture .

The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is denying it heard about a radioactive leak at the Chalk River nuclear facility days after it happened .
Instead the organization is saying it heard about the incident " within hours " of it happening .
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited has confirmed a radioactive leak occurred at the Chalk River , Ont. plant in early December .
The details were included in a detailed report from AECL that was provided to CTV.ca .
According to the AECL report it was n't until Dec. 9 that the leak was reported to the CNSC -- four days after it occurred .
The CNSC contradicted that remark in a statement to the media .
The AECL report states that radioactive tritium gas was released during the incident , along with 47 kilograms of " heavy water loss . "
The leak was never mentioned in a news release about the shutdown that resulted from the spill .
The release only cited " unanticipated technical challenges " in describing why the stoppage was necessary .
The AECL report suggested the incident was n't serious .
" Heavy water leaks and discharge of elevated tritium wastewater to waste management have occurred in the past .
Actions taken are specific to the event with goals to locate the leak , stop it , and prevent recurrence , " it stated .
While workers at the facility were able to stop the leak , they were unable to determine its cause .
The report states that the heavy water , which had higher than normal tritium levels , was transferred to storage drums and will eventually have to be disposed of .
The leak occurred soon after medical isotope production levels were ramped up at the plant .
Several months earlier , the plant had increased its production of isotopes , which are used in radiation therapy as well as for medical diagnostics .
About 70 per cent of the global supply currently comes from the Chalk River facility .
By mid-December the plant was producing almost double its normal amount of isotopes to meet world demand .
But it has only recently been revealed that the spill occurred in early December at the aging facility , which was built in 1958 .
' Canadians deserve truth '
The CNSC insisted the public and the environment are not at risk as a result of the leak , saying that they have on - site staff consistently monitoring the NRU in order to ensure that it is operating safely and in compliance with its licence conditions .
" Releases to the environment are closely monitored and in this case were well below regulatory limits , " the organization said in a statement .
" The site has mitigation measures to protect against releases to the public and the environment . "
The CNSC also praised AECL , saying it " acted appropriately by keeping the reactor shutdown to investigate even a very small leak . "
AECL continuously monitors for leaks from NRU 's cooling system , the CNSC added .
" ( They are ) required take prompt action if a leak , as well as any other event , is detected , as part of standard reporting requirements . "
The group also said the AECL submitted both a preliminary and final report within their regulatory timeframe .
Meanwhile , Halifax West Liberal MP Geoff Regan demanded answers from the Conservatives at Tuesday 's question period session .
" Canadians deserve truth and transparency when it comes to nuclear safety oversight but they have a government that interferes with independent regulators and keeps them in the dark , " he said .
" What is being done to solve this and why has n't the public been informed ? "
Lisa Raitt , the minister of natural resources , said she has asked for a written report on the incident .
" At no time did any of the events that took place at Chalk River deem to have an adverse affect on human health or on the environment , " she said .
" The reactor at Chalk River continues to operate consistently and meets all safety regulations and security regulations . "
Raitt also said that the CNSC and AECL were in constant communication throughout the incident and worked together to find a resolution .
" The health and safety of Canadians is always at the foremost of our concern , " she said .
Chalk River controversy
Last year , controversy erupted over the Chalk River plant when Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government overrode a decision by Linda Keen , then head of the CNSC , to close the plant for safety upgrades to the water pump system .
Parliament issued an emergency order to restart the reactor , despite Keen 's objections .
Keen was eventually fired over the controversy , but has always maintained she was simply doing her job .
She says her firing was politically motivated , with the government responding to fears over a potential isotope shortage .
Keen was removed from her role as president and CEO of the CNSC , and was moved to a position as a full time Commission member
She eventually resigned , claiming she had been " demoted . "
There are only two days left until the third Alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) will be available ( for testing ) , and ... we could n't resist the temptation to take the current daily build for a test drive , before our usual screenshot tour , and taste the " sweetness " of that evolutionary EXT4 Linux filesystem .
Announced on Christmas Eve , the EXT4 filesystem is now declared stable and it is distributed with version 2.6.28 of the Linux kernel and later .
However , the good news is that the EXT4 filesystem was implemented in the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha 3 a couple of days ago and it will be available in the Ubuntu Installer , if you choose manual partitioning ( see the screenshot below for details ) .
The bad news is that EXT4 will not be the default filesystem for the Ubuntu OS until version 9.10 , due for release in late October this year .
OK , OK ... so how will the end user benefit from this EXT4 filesystem ?
Well , first of all , the whole system will be much faster and more reliable compared to one with EXT3 ( I guess that some of you still remember the Firefox / Ext3 issue ) , it will boot faster ( the current article proves that ) and it's able to handle files with sizes of up to 16 TB ( terabytes ) .
But these are just a few of the features brought by the fourth extended filesystem , for more details you can check the Wikipedia entry for EXT4 .
We 've tested the boot process of a default Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) installation on two machines , an AMD Sempron 1.8 Ghz , 80 GB IDE hard drive with 512 RAM DDR and an Intel Core 2 Duo E4300 running at 2.2 Ghz , 250 GB SATA hard drive with 4 GB RAM DDR2 .
Here are the results of our tests :
· Ubuntu 8.10 with EXT3 filesystem boots in 31.8 seconds ( on the AMD Sempron system ) ; · Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) with EXT3 filesystem boots in 28.3 seconds ( on the AMD Sempron system ) ; · Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) with EXT4 filesystem boots in 23.1 seconds ( on the AMD Sempron system ) .
· Ubuntu 8.10 with EXT3 filesystem boots in 26.8 seconds ( on the Intel Core 2 Duo system ) ; · Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) with EXT3 filesystem boots in 24.5 seconds ( on the Intel Core 2 Duo system ) ; · Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) with EXT4 filesystem boots in 21.4 seconds ( on the Intel Core 2 Duo system ) !
The boot times were calculated from the moment the GRUB boot loader appeared on the screen and until the login manager was displayed .
As you can see , there is an approximately 8.7 second difference between an Ubuntu 8.10 ( Intrepid Ibex ) installation and an Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Jaunty Jackalope ) one on the first system and 5.4 second difference on the second system .
But this does not stop us from hoping that the boot times will decrease even more until the final version of Ubuntu 9.04 hits the streets .
Currently , EXT4 can only be applied from the text mode installation of Ubuntu 9.04 ( the Alternate CD ) .
Do n't forget to check our website on Thursday for the screenshot tour of Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) Alpha 3 when we will reveal even more goodies from the Ubuntu land .
Later Edit :
We apologise for not having listed all the results of our tests .
Therefore , we 've added the missing two tests : Ubuntu 8.10 and Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha ( Build 20090112.1 ) with EXT3 on the Intel Core 2 Duo system .

BOSTON - Law enforcement officials say there are many loopholes , unintended consequences and other problems in the new law that decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana .
The law replaces criminal penalties for possessing an ounce or less of marijuana with a civil fine of $ 100 , about the same as getting a traffic ticket .
Sixty - five percent of Massachusetts ' voters approved the ballot law on Nov. 4 , and it takes effect on Jan. 2 .
Law enforcement officials still have many doubts about the law .
Among the concerns are that some people will not be required to identify themselves if stopped for marijuana , that police officers cannot be disciplined for possessing an ounce of less of marijuana , and that state laboratories which test narcotics for criminal cases will no longer test small amounts of marijuana seized in a civil matter .
In addition , guidelines issued by the state for the law 's enforcement say possession of an ounce or less of THC - the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , hashish or hash oil - may now be decriminalized as well .
" The law is very confusing , " said Holyoke Police Chief Anthony R. Scott this week .
" The law presents a lot of problems for law enforcement . "
Street dealers now will probably carry less than an ounce to elude arrest , he predicted .
Under the new law , he said , police will no longer be able to arrest people for possessing an ounce or less and use them for information to go after dealers .
Berkshire District Attorney David F. Capeless , who is president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association , said the sponsors of the law hoodwinked the public .
" It 's a disaster , and it was unfortunately a hoax perpetrated on the public , " he said .
One loophole in the new law is that police have no authority to ask an offender for identification , said Capeless .
There is a specific law which says residents must carry identification if they are driving , but there is no similar provision in the marijuana law , he said .
Jack A. Cole , the executive director of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and a former 26 - year member of the New Jersey State Police , said the new law should not be difficult to enforce .
Police know how to issue citations , he said .
" There should n't be any trouble at all with implementation , " Cole said .
" It 's a very simple thing to do . "
Terrel W. Harris of the state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said his agency is moving forward to put the law into effect .
Guidelines for law enforcement and others were to be in the hands of all police agencies this week .
All law enforcement officers with civil enforcement powers - including campus officers - have the authority to issue the new $ 100 tickets , under the guidelines .
According to the ballot law , people under 18 must complete a drug - awareness program , including 10 hours of community service , within one year of being cited for possessing an ounce of less of marijuana .
If the offender fails to complete the program , the fine could jump to $ 1,000 and parents could be liable .
The Committee for a Sensible Marijuana Policy spent about $ 1.5 million to win approval of Question 2 .
George Soros , a liberal hedge - fund manager , donated $ 400,000 toward the effort .
Supporters argued that approval of the law would mean that people who possess small amounts of marijuana would no longer be weighed down with criminal records .
Gov. Deval L. Patrick , the district attorneys ' group , chiefs of police , and county sheriffs all opposed the question .
Opponents said it would increase teenage drug use , be difficult to enforce , and boost use of a drug that creates many health problems .
Judge Lynda M. Connolly , chief justice of the state 's District Court Department , issued an eight - page memorandum to court officials on Dec. 23 , spelling out the effects of the law .
The memorandum said that municipalities may need to adopt ordinances and bylaws to ban the public use of marijuana .
Such bylaws had been unnecessary previously because possession of any amount of marijuana was illegal .
Under the law , violators aged 18 and above must pay the $ 100 civil penalty to a city or town clerk .
Or , offenders can appeal the citation to a clerk magistrate for a civil hearing , Connolly wrote .
Offenders must also forfeit any marijuana , she wrote .
The state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security has determined that a civil violation for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana after Jan. 2 cannot be used to disqualify an applicant for a license to carry a firearm , Connolly wrote .
Whitney A. Taylor , campaign manager for the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , said many of the concerns of prosecutors and police are red herrings .
Possession of small amounts of marijuana have been decriminalized in 11 other states , she noted .
" We have a system I 'm very confident can handle this , " she said of the new law .
John M. Collins , general counsel for the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association in Grafton , said people voted with their hearts and were unaware of some " bizarre consequences " of the law .
One such unintended consequence , he said , is that the state cannot discipline public employees , including police officers , for use or possession of an ounce or less of marijuana .
The law specifically says that public entities cannot impose any form of penalty for such possession , Collins said .
The new law could also cost the state a lot of money , he said .
The law created a diversion program for people under 18 , but did not fund it , Collins added .
Two state laboratories that test illegal drugs are unlikely to continue testing for small amounts of marijuana once it is decriminalized , he said .
" They are not going to test it any more , " Collins said .
Officials have said the laboratories are already backed up .
Also , a couple of important public health rules go into effect with the new year .
Under a state Department of Public Health rule , emergency rooms in hospitals may no longer reroute ambulances to other hospitals .
Some emergency rooms divert ambulances to other hospitals if they are overcrowded .
As of Jan. 1 , hospitals must stop these temporary closures of emergency rooms in almost all cases .
Also starting next month , tax penalties will increase for people who can afford health insurance but refuse to obtain it .
A 2006 health - care law established the penalties and the requirement for purchasing health insurance .
In 2008 , the fine for an individual making more than three times the federal poverty level - $ 31,212 a year for singles - was $ 76 a month or $ 912 a year .
Draft regulations released on Dec. 22 , however , showed that beginning on Jan. 1 , fines will climb to $ 89 a month or $ 1,068 for an entire year if an individual remains uninsured .

The upper Midwest has been besieged by a bitter cold front for the past several days .
Chicago recently reported wind chills of 30 degrees below zero , and several locations in North and South Dakota posted high ambient air temperatures of several degrees below zero , without wind chill .
Though not exactly what most would consider desirable temperatures , cold temperatures , and more specifically hypothermia , have played an interesting role in health care .
In its infancy , induced hypothermia was used primarily for amputations , in the hopes of providing some pain relief before the era of anesthesia .
More recently , hypothermia has shown benefit in several areas , including the following :
Cardiac arrest : Mild to moderate hypothermia has been shown to preserve neurologic function following a cardiac arrest , during which the heart stops pumping and the brain is deprived of oxygen .
In addition , recent studies have shown that hypothermia may also help improve short - term survival and minimize damage to the heart following such an injury .
There are multiple theories as to why this is the case , including alteration of inflammation , slowing of metabolism , and reduction in cell death .
It is apparent , however , that hypothermia can be a major benefit to victims of cardiac arrest .
Traumatic brain injury in children :
Although hypothermia has been studied in adults with traumatic brain injury , its benefit may be especially prominent in children .
As children ’s brains are developing rapidly , any significant injury has the potential to cause serious long - term effects .
Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce neurologic dysfunction as well as improve mortality .
Neonatal ischemic encephalopathy : Newborn infants who experience decreased oxygen flow to their brains are at great risk of developing brain damage .
Hypothermia has been shown to improve not only their brain function but also their survival .
Stroke :
There are some promising studies indicating that hypothermia may help improve recovery in stroke victims .
At present , these studies are simply promising , but if validated by larger studies , the use of hypothermia for stroke victims may become more widespread .
Typically hypothermia is induced by using cool intravenous fluids and cooling blankets , but if only local hypothermia is needed the body part of interest can be packed in ice .
Patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia may experience electrolyte disorders and may be at higher risk for pneumonia .
Overall , however , in specific situations hypothermia can be useful adjunct medical treatment .

In 1998 two teams of researchers made a milestone cosmological announcement :
The universe , long known to be expanding , was not slowing down in its expansion as expected but was in fact accelerating .
Both groups had been studying exploding stars , or supernovae , and used the objects ' movement to show that the universe is speeding up .
The culprit was labeled dark energy — a hypothesized presence that pervades space and pushes the pieces of the universe apart .
A new study that examines the growth of galaxy clusters rather than the movement of stars independently confirms the presence of dark energy .
Researchers , led by Alexey Vikhlinin of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) , found that dark energy seems to restrain the growth of clusters over time , hindering the gravitational clumping of matter that would allow them to grow even more massive .
Vikhlinin called the findings , which are set to be published in The Astrophysical Journal , " an unambiguous signature of dark energy . "
Such an effect is not entirely surprising : Astrophysicist Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham in England raised this as a likely role for dark energy in a 2007 Scientific American article .
The researchers said in a teleconference this week that the new look at dark energy is akin to sports referees making calls based on multiple vantage points .
Whereas the existence of dark energy has been well supported for a decade , this new study helps to confirm its presence and to place constraints on just how strong its effects can be .
Mario Livio , an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , says that it does not overturn dogma , but " it is nevertheless an observation that had to be made . "
Because so many of the early results came from the supernova approach , Livio says , it is important to verify the phenomenon with " a completely independent method . "
By studying far - flung galaxy clusters , astronomers are able to look back in time at the state of those objects millions or even billions of years ago , when the light just now reaching us was emitted .
By comparing relatively close clusters with those more distant , the physical evolution of these gargantuan structures can be traced over time .
Their observed development is " exactly what 's expected for a universe with a low density of matter and a high density of dark energy , " Vikhlinin said .
( By current estimates , dark energy makes up nearly three quarters of the universe , dark matter comprises another 20 to 25 percent , and ordinary matter — all that we can see and touch — constitutes a mere 4 percent . )
What Vikhlinin and his co-authors observed is also what was expected for a universe described by Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , the reigning theory of gravity .
At the news conference , Princeton University astrophysicist David Spergel , who did not contribute to the research , called this further confirmation of dark energy " a triumph of general relativity . "
Study co-author William Forman , a CfA astrophysicist , noted that although general relativity fit well with his team 's observations , Einstein 's vision may still require future adjustments .
Livio agrees , but believes that the galaxy - cluster result nonetheless provides an important test for relativity .
" There was the potential here , with this method , " he says , " to tell us whether we had to modify our theory of gravity . "

One of the best and most well read investment bloggers , Mish of Mish ’s Global Economic Trend Analysis , ripped into Peter Schiff last night in a lengthy tirade on his blog titled “ Peter Schiff Was Wrong ” .
One thing that Mish gets right and many Schiff fans might not know is that Schiff ’s portfolios did not perform well in 2008 .
EuroPacific does n’t post performance data but the anectdotal evidence suggests that many of Schiff ’s clients were down substantially last year .
Fortune Magazine substantiated this in an article from Friday writing :
Ironically , though , the year that Schiff became a star prognosticator on TV was also one of the worst periods ever for his clients .
In most cases the foreign markets he likes got hit even harder than the U.S. in 2008 ( Australia ’s ASX 200 , for instance , fell 41.3 % , vs. 38.5 % for the S&P 500 ) , and even more surprising to Schiff , the U.S. dollar rallied strongly as investors rushed to the perceived safety of Treasuries .
The reason is pretty obvious .
Schiff subscribed to the decoupling theory , the idea that emerging markets like China and Latin America would be somewhat immune to the problems in the US .
As we all know now , this was dead wrong .
I said it was wrong my “ How To Invest In The Coming Bear Market ” Report ( Jan 9 , 2008 ) and noted the beginning of its unravelling back in January : “ Recoupling : The Real Significance Of This Week ’s Action ” , Top Gun FP , Jan 24 , 2008 .
So did Mish : “ Global Decoupling Myth Shattered In Equity Selloff ” , Global Economic Trend Analysis , Jan 22 , 2008 .
Schiff recommended large exposures to foreign equities , with a particular emphasis on commodity stocks linked to global economic growth , and these got crushed even worse than US equities overall .
Mish also rips into Schiff for his hyperinflation call .
Mish points out that the dollar has recently been one of the best performing currencies .
Mish is also in the school calling for deflation rather than inflation .
So he says Schiff was big - time wrong on this score as well .
Here I ’m going to have to side with Schiff .
The dollar is benefitting for now as a safe haven in a time of fear and crisis .
( Even so , gold , which Schiff recommends , continues to perform well and this dissonance will likely be resolved at some point ) .
But I do believe Schiff is right about the long term trends .
The Fed is printing so much money and the Federal government running such huge defecits that serious inflation is almost surely going to be the long term result .
In the Fortune piece , Schiff himself makes this same argument , that he is early , not wrong :
None of this shocks me .
Oftentimes in the short run markets are irrational .
And my problem has always been that I see things too clearly and too far in advance .
Other people do n’t understand what I do , so the markets might not validate what I ’m saying right away .
But they will eventually .
In the end the fundamentals are going to prevail , just as they did in the housing market .
I also believe that , longer term , the decoupling thesis is correct .
The big trend is economic vibrancy and growth moving away from the US and Western Europe and towards Asia , Latin America and other emerging markets .
The timing is important for investment performance , but longer term I do think Schiff has this one right as well .
( On this see , for example , “ American Power Is On The Wane ” ( subscription required ) , Paul Kennedy , The Wall Street Journal , January 14 , 2009 – anyone who wants to read this e-mail me and I ’ll send you a link ) .
That ’s why I think that even though it ’s useful to point out that Schiff ’s clients have been hammered in 2008 and he has gotten some things wrong , for the most part he ’s been money and he deserves most of the praise and recognition he ’s been receiving .
He made his points loud and clear and in a very public way when very few others shared his sentiments and some even went so far as to laugh and mock him on public television ( see the YouTube Video “ Peter Schiff Was Right ” ) .
Peter Schiff never backed down and the course of events has proven him right .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President - elect Barack Obama , as part of the effort to revive the economy , has proposed a massive effort to modernize health care by making all health records standardized and electronic .
Here 's the audacious plan : Computerize all health records within five years .
The quality of health care for all Americans gets a big boost , and costs decline .
Sounds good .
But it wo n't be easy .
In fact , many hurdles stand in the way .
Only about 8 % of the nation 's 5,000 hospitals and 17 % of its 800,000 physicians currently use the kind of common computerized record - keeping systems that Obama envisions for the whole nation .
And some experts say that serious concerns about patient privacy must be addressed first .
Finally , the country suffers a dearth of skilled workers necessary to build and implement the necessary technology .
" The hard part of this is that we can't just drop a computer on every doctor 's desk , " said Dr. David Brailer , former National Coordinator for Health Information Technology , who served as President Bush 's health information czar from 2004 to 2006 .
" Getting electronic records up and running is a very technical task . "
It also wo n't come cheap .
Independent studies from Harvard , RAND and the Commonwealth Fund have shown that such a plan could cost at least $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion over the ten years they think the hospitals would need to implement program .
That 's a huge amount of money -- since the total cost of the stimulus plan is estimated to cost about $ 800 billion , the health care initiative would be one of the priciest parts to the plan .
The biggest cost will be paying and training the labor force needed to create the network .
Luis Castillo , senior vice president of Siemens Healthcare , a company that designs health care technology , said the laborers will have the extremely difficult task of designing a a system that " thinks like a physician . "
" Doctors cannot spend hours and hours learning a new system , " said Castillo .
" It needs to be a ubiquitous , ' anytime , anywhere ' solution that has easily accessible data in a simple - to - use Web - based application . "
But highly skilled health information technology professionals are as rare as they come , and many IT workers will need to be trained as health technology experts .
Early government estimates showed about 212,000 jobs could be created from this program , but Brailer said there simply are n't that many Americans who are qualified .
Furthermore , ensuring the privacy of patients ' records in a nationalized computer network will be tricky .
There are obvious concerns about hackers and system failures .
And new online health record systems , such as Google Health are not currently subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , the national health privacy law .
" HIPAA was never intended for the digital age , because the laws never anticipated the emergence of Web - based records , " said Brailer .
" Congress can pass one of numerous policy proposals for change , it 's just a question if they have the will to do that . "
Jobs and savings for the future
The Obama transition operation declined a request to elaborate on Obama 's proposal .
The president - elect said Thursday in a speech on the economy that the benefits of a modernized national health record system go beyond just cost savings .
" This will cut waste , eliminate red tape , and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests , " said Obama .
" It just wo n't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs -- it will save lives by reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system , " he added .
Still , compared to the $ 2 trillion a year that the industry spends , the $ 100 billion experts say it may cost to implement Obama 's plan is a drop in the bucket .
" We must reduce waste to become more efficient " said Brailer .
The savings of such a plan could be substantial .
Brailer estimates that a fully computerized health record system could save the industry $ 200 billion to $ 300 billion a year .
That could ultimately slow the rapid rise of health care premiums , which have cut into Americans ' paychecks .
While wages are rising at a rate of around 3 % a year , health care costs are growing at about three times that rate .
" Obama 's support for electronic medical records is one of the key efforts of health reform that actually will deliver lower costs for hard - working American families , " said Larry McNeely , a health care advocate at U.S. Public Interest Research Group .
" Long - term savings can't happen unless we have 21st century health information technology . "
Massachusetts has developed a plan to fully computerize records at its 14,000 physicians ' offices by 2012 and its 63 hospitals by 2014 .
After a pilot program , the state legislature estimates it will cost about $ 340 million to build the statewide computer system , with a cost of about $ 2 million per hospital .
" [ Obama 's ] timeframe is very ambitious , but there is a need to be able to track data on patients and talk across providers and health care systems , " said Dr. JudyAnn Bigby , Secretary of Health and Human Services for Massachusetts .
" The program will allow for greater patient safety . "
Some say some of the hard work has begun .
The Bush administration laid much of the groundwork for the program , leading to several pilot programs in a handful of states , as well as a standardization of medical records .
" The whole structure has already been developed , " said Stephen Schoenbaum , executive director of The Commonwealth Fund 's commission on a high performance health system .
" It 's feasible to at least make a lot of progress on this in the next five years . "
Today ’s Boston Globe has a story about the Downeaster Amtrak service between Boston and Portland , Maine .
The Downeaster is Amtrak ’s fastest growing rail line , with ridership increasing this year 36.7 % , compared to a 17.5 % average for Amtrak ’s other so - called short - distance routes , and 10.3 % for Amtrak ’s long - distance routes .
Commuters make up about a third of the train ’s passengers .
The state of Maine , which contributes $ 1.5 million to the line ’s $ 13.5 million annual budget views the train as an economic engine for the state , allowing commuters to live in Maine and drawing vacationers up from southern New England ( the federal government provides a $ 6 million subsidy to the service , ticket sales make up the remaining $ 6 million , Massachusetts and New Hampshire provide no subsidies ) .
The state of Maine is currently planning a northward extension from Portland to Brunswick to serve more vacationers and daytrippers .
As successful as the line is , the federal subsidy runs out in July , Maine Governor Balducci has proposed $ 8 million in next year ’s state budget to make up for the subsidy loss , and the rail authority plans a fare increase .
In the comments section to the article published on Boston.com , one commuter from Maine points out why he takes the Concord Trailways bus rather than the Downeaster .
His reasoning boils down to cost and time .
One - way service on the Downeaster costs $ 24 ( there are discounts for booking early or if you by a multi- ride pass ) , one - way service between Boston and Portland on Concord Trailways is $ 8 .
The bus ride takes slightly under 2 hours ( dependent on traffic and weather conditions ) and the Downeaster takes 2 hours 30 minutes .
And there you have the problem with transit in New England .
We have short distances , high population density , and a population that is willing to leave their cars at home when there is a viable option , our options are just not terribly viable .
Currently the Downeaster ’s top speed is 79 miles per hour , frequent station stops , at grade crossings , and areas where the tracks cannot support that speed mean the Downeaster ’s average speed between Boston and Portland is 45 miles per hour .
Trains can and do move faster , France ’s TGV travels up to 200 miles per hour in regular commercial use ( average speed is 173 miles per hour ) .
Even if the Downeaster ’s average speed was boosted just to the paltry “ high speed ” levels of Amtrak ’s Acela ( average speed of 86 miles per hour ) , Downeaster would start to be the obvious choice over driving or the bus .
However , there are still gaps .
Try taking the train from Providence to Portland .
Seems a reasonable request , right ?
In order to ride the rails between here and there takes two transfers .
Amtrak or MBTA Commuter Rail to Boston Back Bay Station , orange line subway to North Station , then Amtrak to Maine .
Or , you could just spend 2 hours and 48 minutes in the comfort of your own car driving there rather then rushing from train to train to train .
Let ’s try another , Providence to Cape Cod. Kennedy Plaza to Hyannis via Peter Pan Bus Lines is 2 hours and 25 minutes and $ 30.00 one - way .
According to Google Maps it should take 1 hour and 26 minutes to drive that ( personal experience says it can be safely done in just over an hour , holiday / weekend traffic can make it upwards of 4 hours , but the bus sits in that traffic too ) .
Considering a round - trip for two costs $ 120.00 and the travel time is atrocious , it is cheaper and saner for me to rent a car to visit my family down there , if I owned a car already I ’d be kookoo bananas to leave it at home and take the bus .
Providence to Hartford ? 75 miles , a 1 hour and 32 minute drive … 3 hours and 50 minutes on the bus !
Providence to New Bedford ? 30 miles , 35 minutes to drive … 1 hour and 20 minutes on the bus ( ridiculously , the bus from Kennedy Plaza goes up to the bus yard off North Main , then back south and out to New Bedford ) .
Living car - free as I do , I could go on .
Oh hell , one more : Kennedy Plaza to Rhode Island Mall , 10 miles 14 minutes by car … 46 minutes via RIPTA .
So what do we do ?
We take advantage of this moment in history .
In January we will have a new administration in Washington looking to boost the economy , invest in cities , reduce our reliance on foreign oil , and improve our environment .
Transit investments in New England touch on all those goals .
We take advantage of our political capital , all but one or New England ’s counties ( Penobscot County in northern Maine ) voted blue last week .
Our Governors , Senators ( Republican and Democrat ) , and Representatives have to stop with the provincialism and come together to work on what ’s best for the region , not just their own states and districts .
We have to stop with the tax breaks to poach businesses from each other and set ourselves up , as a region , to be competitive nationally and globally .
Would it be too cheese ball for me to wrap this up by saying , “ Yes we can ? ”
Tests find older Tasers may fire ' fatal ' current Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Stronger current detected in some tested stun-guns Independent tests of stun-guns manufactured by Taser International , which provides virtually all the weapons to police forces , shows some older models of the weapons fire currents that are up to 50 percent stronger than the company says , and medical experts say such a strong shock could be fatal .
The Canadian Broadcasting Company and Radio - Canada commissioned a US laboratory to test 41 Tasers .
The tests showed nearly 10 percent of the tested weapons fired a stronger current than the company claims .
The tests ' designer , University of Montreal biomedical engineer Pierre Savard , says they provide a rare glimpse at the effectiveness of Taser 's weapons , which are not subject to rigorous independent examination .
" I think it 's important because Taser is not subjected to international standards , " Savard told CBS .
" When you use a cellphone , well , cellphones have to respect a set of standards for the electric magnetic field that it emits .
The Taser , well , nobody knows except Taser International . "
The four faulty stun-guns were all manufactured before 2005 , raising concerns that the weapons deteriorate with age .
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police tell CBC they will be pulling a sample of their own Tasers for testing based on the results .
Savard says weapons that fire a too strong current present a dangerous situation because officers are trained to fire the Tasers directly at a target 's chest .
" When you combine an increased current intensity with a dart that falls right over the heart for somebody who has cardiovascular disease or other conditions such as using drugs , for example , it can all add up to a fatal issue , " he told CBC .
Since 2001 , according to the Arizona Republic , more than 380 people in the US and 26 in Canada have died after being struck by a Taser .
In 30 of those deaths , the Taser was " a cause , contributing factor or could not be ruled out , " the paper reports .
Taser International , based in Arizona , dismissed the study as flawed .
The company maintains that its weapons are safe .
Chinese authorities have already had to deal with workers ' protests
" The redistribution of wealth through theft and robbery could dramatically increase and menaces to social stability will grow , " Zhou Tianyong , a researcher at the Central Party School in Beijing , wrote in the China Economic Times .
" This is extremely likely to create a reactive situation of mass - scale social turmoil , " he wrote .
His views do not reflect leadership policy but highlight worries in elite circles about the impact of the economic slowdown .
Mr Zhou warned that the real rate of urban joblessness reached 12 % this year and could reach 14 % next year as the economy slows .
China 's annual GDP growth has already slowed to 9 % in the third quarter , from 10.1 % in the second .
Some forecasters see growth slowing to 7.5 % next year .
The government has launched a stimulus package and cut interest rates to boost the economy .
Unrest warning
Last month , China 's top planner warned that the economic slowdown in China could fuel social unrest .
Zhang Ping , head of the National Development and Reform Commission , said the impact of the global crisis on China 's economy was deepening .
" Excessive bankruptcies and production cuts will lead to massive unemployment and stir social unrest , " he said .
O'Reilly : Some Fox ' pinheads ' do n't get insult to Christmas David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Since Washington State accepted an atheist message calling religion " myth and superstition " as part of its official holiday display , requests have been pouring in from additional groups that would like to get in on the fun .
The hosts of Fox & Friends have been following the story closely , and Gretchen Carlson was particularly outraged on Wednesday morning at the prospect of a display for Festivus -- a fake holiday popularized in the 90's by the Seinfeld show .
" That is the biggest insult ever to the season of Christmas , " Carlson complained .
" What is going to be next ? "
While co-hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade seemed to find the idea of a Festivus display a good excuse for kidding around , Carlson was appalled .
" I 'm for humor and I 'm all for telling jokes ... but this is an insult to Christianity , " she insisted .
Carlson did n't get much support on Fox & Friends , but she later found both sympathy and an opportunity to present her point of view over at Fox 's The O'Reilly Factor .
" I was watching your program this morning with those pinheads , Doocy and Kilmeade , " O'Reilly began , " and they 're not getting this thing . "
" It 's a mockery of a religion that more than 85 % of the American public believes in , " Carlson replied .
" I 'm just waiting for Jesus Christ to be in the back seat somewhere where I can't see him in the creche anymore . "
" You hit the word , that 's ' disrespect , ' O'Reilly remarked .
He then went on to express nostalgia for the good old days of twenty years ago when " none of this existed .
...
There was no controversy over Christmas .
There were no atheist signs .
... Jewish people said ' Merry Christmas . '
Everybody said it . "
" What really got me was today , when they wanted to do Festivus , " Carlson commented .
" That was the final straw , today .
Bill , what is going to be next ? "
O'Reilly responded that he expects that next " they are going to try to revoke the federal holiday " by arguing that " ' you ca n't have a federal holiday based on religion . ' "
" You wait and see , " O'Reilly warned .

So the U.S. Senate on Thursday passed by voice vote a resolution blindly supporting Israeli attacks on Gaza and heaping derision on Hamas .
This craven display should awaken anyone who sanguinely assumed that “ everything changed ” on November 4 .
The resolution contained numerous twists of history , but the most glaring absurdity is the following :
“ Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying Israel … ”
Perhaps the senators were in a rush to collect campaign contributions , so they did not have time to glance at the history of how Hamas arose to power .
Hamas was created with massive aid from the Israeli government .
Following is an excerpt from my Terrorism & Tyranny ( 2003 ) :
Perhaps the single largest mistake in the history of the Israeli governmentâ€™s long war on terrorism was its covert financing , cosseting , and arming of Hamas , the Islamic resistance movement .
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon denounced Hamas as â€ œthe deadliest terrorist group that we have ever had to face .â€ 
But the Israeli government is reticent about admitting its role in creating this Frankenstein .
Beginning in the 1970s Israel began pouring money into Islamic organizations â€” especially the Moslem Brotherhoodâ € ” hoping that religion would distract the Palestinians from political activism and the radical left - wing Palestinian Liberation Organization .
Hamas was a late offspring of the Moslem Brotherhood .
Prior to 1988 Moslem Brotherhood activists â€œhad refrained from openly anti-Israel activities .â€ 
But with the outbreak of the first Intifada ( uprising ) in late 1987 , the Israeli government was stunned to see how fast Hamas became the primary source of deadly attacks against Israelis .
Anthony Cordesman , a former State Department and Defense Department intelligence officer and currently a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , stated that the Israeli government â€œaided Hamas directlyâ € ” the Israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the PLO.â€ 
A United Press International analysis reported , â€ œAccording to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials , beginning in the late 1970s , Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years .
â€ UPI noted that , according to documents provided by Israeli terrorism experts , â€ œHamas was legally registered in Israel in 1978 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the movementâ€™s spiritual leader , as an Islamic Association by the name Al - Mujamma al Islami.â€ 
The Jerusalem Post reported on May 29 , 1989 , that , until the late 1980s , the Moslem Brotherhood â€œorganizations in Gaza and the Islamic University received much encouragement from the [ Israeli ] military government .
. . .
The military government believed that their activity would undermine the power of the PLO and of leftist organizations in Gaza .
They even supplied some of their activists with weapons , for their protection .
â€ 
During the first Intifada ( uprising ) , the PLO and Hamas openly clashed over how to resist the Israeli occupation .
The Jerusalem Post noted : â€ œThe [ Israeli ] security forces greeted this tension [ between Palestinian groups ] with satisfaction , in line with the principle of divide and conquer .
In several cases , Palestinians noticed that troops stood by quietly during Hamas street activity , but did interfere when PLO activists engaged in the same activity .
â€ 
The Israeli government assumed that if the PLO could be thwarted , the Palestinian problem would be solved .
But Hamas was far more bloodthirsty and radical than the PLO .
The PLO effectively recognized Israelâ€™s right to exist in 1988 , while Hamas devoted itself to seizing all of Palestine for an Islamic state .

As many of you know , it is difficult to obtain good exposure in both the highlights and shadows of scenes that exhibit a high dynamic range of light .
Often , photographers will post - process using an HDR converter to achieve the desired exposure .
However , there is another way to achieve correct exposure in both the highlights and shadows without using HDR .
This technique begins in the camera .
Using a tripod , take two exposures of the same scene .
Expose your first image to capture detail in the highlights .
Expose your second image to capture shadow detail .
( Image 1 above contains the shadow detail , Image 2 below contains the highlight detail )
Note : Unlike most HDR processing methods , this technique works better when there is a large difference in light between shadow and highlight .
For example , a sunrise or sunset shot would work better than a shot taken in overcast conditions .
Once back at your computer , upload your images making sure to label the images in the order they were taken .
Select two sequential exposures , one for highlights and one for shadows .
Open them both in Adobe Camera RAW .
( Note : CS3 Camera Raw is now an option for both TIFF and JPEG files ) .
Select your shadows exposure and make adjustments that enhance the shadow details .
Then select your highlights exposure and make adjustments that enhance your highlight details .
Once you are happy with these adjustments save them and then open both images in Photoshop .
With both images open in Photoshop , hit the ‘ F ’ key to toggle through the screen modes until you are in Standard Screen Mode where you are able to see each image with a menu bar at the top .
Select the Move tool and click on one of the images .
Then hold down the Shift key and click - and - drag that image into the other one so that the two are now part of the same document .
By holding down the Shift key you are ensuring that both images will line up properly .
However , since a perfect set of exposures is often hard to capture in the field , I often follow this step by using CS3s new Auto - Align Layers tool .
To take advantage of the Auto - Align tool , the first thing you will need to do is double - click on your background layer and make the background an editable layer .
Now you have two editable layers .
Next , select both layers by holding down the Shift key and clicking on both .
Then , go to the Edit menu and select Auto - Align Layers from the drop down menu .
( Use the ‘ Auto ’ Projection option )
Now you have two perfectly aligned exposures .
Again , select both layers in the Layers palette and drag them down to the New Layer icon .
This will produce two copies of your active layers .
Hide your two newly - created layers by clicking the Eye icon next to them in the Layers Pallete .
Next , blend the two layers together .
Select the top layer , in this case the highlight detail , and select Blending Options from the Layers Style menu inside the Layers drop - down menu .
Inside the Blending Options menu , at the very bottom , you will see two sliders underneath a “ blend if ” dialog .
Move the menu box to the side , making sure you can see your image clearly .
Then holding down the Alt key ( Option on a Mac ) grab the white arrow at the end of the top slider .
Holding down the Alt key will split that white arrow in half .
Move that half of the arrow toward the black end of the slider .
You will notice your image begin to blend .
Move the arrow until you feel the correct amount of blending has occurred .
Keep in mind the image will appear very flat .
Do n’t worry , that will be corrected later .
Now that you have partially blended the original layers , move back to your unblended layer copies .
Make both visible again by clicking to the left of the thumbnail and bringing back the Eye icon .
Next , make sure these layers are above your masked layers .
One at a time , select the layer , hold the Alt key ( Option on a Mac ) and click the Add Layer Mask icon .
Holding down the Alt key fills the layer masks with black .
Add a black layer mask to both of the unblended layer copies .
You have just hidden these layers again .
However , this time you are able to selectively bring them back .
Selectively go through your image adding back pieces of the original exposure where you deem necessary .
( I like to use a very low opacity brush , 40 or 50 percent usually works fine . )
Make sure to use a large , soft - edged brush to help prevent obvious brush lines in your image .
Notice that by gently adding pieces of the original exposure you have already helped add contrast to the scene .
Now we are going to create what I like to call a ‘ working layer ’ .
Once you have blended the layers to your liking , select all the layers using the Shift key and make a copy of each .
Select these newly - created copies and use the Fly Out menu at the upper right of your Menu Pallet to select Merge Layers .
You have just created a working layer .
It is from this layer that dust removal and / or lens corrections are made .
Now is the time that you add contrast to your final image .
Select a soft - edged brush and go into the Quick Mask mode by pressing ‘ Q ’ .
Select portions of the image where you want to add contrast by painting on the image .
The areas will show uup red in Quick mask mode .
When you have selected the areas that need a boost in contrast , hit ‘ Q ’ again and go back to regular view .
You will see all of the areas that you painted in red are now selected .
In most cases I find a simple curves adjustment layer is all that is necessary .
However , this is a good place to experiment with levels as well .
Apply your adjustment layer and tweak the settings to your liking .
Finish things up with a global curves and levels adjustment to your working layer .
Voila !
You have yourself a natural High Dynamic Range image without using an HDR converter .
At a former company , a cow - orker of mine had cobbled up a set of date and time classes that he declared “ general purpose ” and “ bug free . ”
About three months later , and after he had left the company , I had to do an 11th hour re-write of the code , just prior to releasing our company ’s first product .
Some of the bugs I found :
The classes had a pretty interface with lots and lots of range , but internally the code used the Unix epoch of 1970 ( so no birthdays before then , for instance ) .
It was round - tripping the 1970 epoch through the standard Unix 1970 - based routines as well
Did n’t handle 400 - year cycle of leap years
Fell apart in 2038 , like everything else will ( Unix epoch , natch )
Fell apart in 2008 , 2010 , 2012 , and some other years , as I recall .
One failure was like some random day in March 2007 , I forget why
Obviously did n’t handle screw cases like the calendar skipping that happened in 1582
Forget about supporting astronomy or geology applications …
… and other things .
I recall writing unit tests that stepped through the ranges that we definitely cared about ( several tens of thousands of years around the current epoch ) , and also stepped plus - and - minus in the billions of years ranges ( by millions or thousands , I think ) .
Random tests , too .
I also recall spending a lot of time reconciling OLE ’s idea of date - and - time .
( Do n’t ever let me catch you using floats for something like this .
Really .
I ’ll find you ) .
This stuff is not easy to get right , but everyone thinks that it is .
Maybe that ’s why people get it wrong so often ( “ Oh , it ’s just same date / time code , I ’ll just whip this out and go to lunch .
Umm , ’30 days hath November , except September , May , and , uh … ' ” )
Required reading : Calendrical Calculations .
Unless you write stuff used by archeologists can probably ignore the Mayan ( etc. ) calendars , but they ’re fun to read about .
Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Friday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown is disappointed by Obama 's moves to make William Lynn deputy defense secretary .
( CNN ) --
Just a couple of nights ago , we heaped praise on the new president for announcing what he called a new era of openness , where in his administration , transparency would rule the day .
And the lobbyists that he was so critical of during the campaign ?
Well , he told us they will now face even tougher new restrictions .
President Obama :
" The executive order on ethics I will sign shortly represents a clean break from business as usual .
As of today , lobbyists will be subject to stricter limits than under any other administration in history .
If you are a lobbyist entering my administration , you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on , or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years .
When you leave government , you will not be able to lobby my administration for as long as I am president . "
That 's what he said two days ago .
But as we first told you Thursday , and sadly we are learning more about this Friday , President Obama already wants an exception to his own rule .
You see , what happened is , there is this former lobbyist for a big defense contractor called Raytheon .
His name is William Lynn .
President Obama wants him to be deputy defense secretary .
So , the Obama administration wants a waiver to its own rule .
That basically means they are saying , we will mostly put tough new restrictions on lobbyists , except when we wo n't .
Really ?
Is this how it is going to be ?

MOSCOW -- Human - rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov told reporters
Monday he would use all legal means to overturn the early release of the most senior Russian military officer ever convicted of war crimes in Chechnya .
After walking out of the news conference , he was shot dead .
A journalist with him was also killed .
The murder on a downtown Moscow street drew comparisons to the 2006 slaying of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and threatens to stir anti-Kremlin sentiment in Chechnya , where Russia fought two military campaigns in a decade to quell separatist sentiment .
Mr. Markelov , 34 years old , represented the family of an 18 - year - old Chechen girl , Elza Kungayeva , who was strangled to death in 2000 by Col. Yuri Budanov .
Mr. Budanov was found guilty of the murder in 2003 and sentenced to 10 years in prison , including time served .
The former colonel , who was stripped of his rank , was released for good behavior Thursday , 1½ years early .
After Ms. Kungayeva 's murder , Mr. Budanov swiftly became a symbol to Chechens of Russian military brutality .
Convicting him and making sure he served his full term became a matter of honor for Chechnya 's pro-Kremlin leadership and tangible proof of the limited justice Russia grudgingly meted out to its own army .
Russian nationalists and many fellow servicemen saw Mr. Budanov as a hero who was unfairly persecuted for a crime committed in a war against a people guilty of similar atrocities against Russians .
Mr. Budanov had said he thought the 18 - year - old girl was a rebel sniper and that he killed her in a moment of insane rage .

It has been a major roller coaster of a month .
So many wonderful things happening yet all of it clouded by the simple fact that Hannah should have been turning 5 a week or so ago .
We had Hannah ’s 2nd annual “ Little Miss Hannah ’s Rainbows in the Wind ” event , and the turnout we had was phenomenal .
Not only did we raise more money that last July ’s event , but we had such an amazing group of organizations and companies who donated their time , energy , and resources to make this night special .
From top
Vegas children ’s entertaining groups to our amazing DJ and photographer to over 2 dozen volunteers who came out just to help make our event run smooth !
The outpouring of love and friendship that came to support us at this event … so many wonderful family , friends and colleagues including 4 of Hannah ’s awesome nurses , a number of her therapists , and friends we have met in the 3 years we have lived in Las Vegas .
( We should be getting pictures next week from the event – our photographer does amazing work ) .
The morning after the event , we surprised Ethan and Abby with a trip to visit Hannah ’s favorite characters ever – we went to Disneyland !
We had a fantastic time as a family , letting loose and just enjoying ourselves .
We did two special things that I had wanted to do at Disneyland to celebrate Hannah ’s birthday – we did a balloon release from the park to her , and we had brought her Minnie Mouse with us to take our family picture .
The kids had so much fun , we hope to go each year to celebrate Hannah .
We needed to get away and decompress from everything – the stress from the event , the overwhelming sadness we were all starting to feel as her birthday approached , to regroup as a family .
At Disney , we all talked about Hannah quite a bit ( especially Ethan , which was unusual since he is usually quiet ) , and it felt like she was there with us many times .
Today , we did a delivery to another Little Miss Hannah family .
It was the same little therapy chair that we wanted so desperately to get for Hannah .
We actually were given a loaner for a while for Hannah , but we never could afford it because it was n’t medically necessary .
But today I got to give this chair to a special 3 - year - old little girl who I just instantly fell in love with .
She reminded me of Hannah at times , especially how she was instantly hooked on her favorite television show !
We ( my hubby , kids and I ) all walked away from this delivery today feeling absolutely wonderful .
Ethan was proud because he was the one who assembled the chair so we could deliver it ready - to - go ( He has become our master builder ! ) .
We were able to give this little girl something we were never able to give Hannah , and by doing that , we all felt like Hannah was right there with us .
I know this little girl will get so much use out of this chair and tray set , and because of my Hannah , we did what we set out to do — enhance the quality of life for kids like Hannah in our community .
I read something tonight that completely nails it on the head of why I am so passionate about what we do with our Little Miss Hannah Foundation .
It is because THIS is how I am able to continue to be a mom to Hannah , to parent Hannah .
This is how I get to do things for her even though she is n’t here anymore .
Hannah lives on in the hearts of so many people , even those who did n’t know her when she was here with us .
I am proud of my children , all three of my children .
Ethan and Abby ’s lives are immersed with the concept of giving , volunteering , and taking care of special children .
I truly believe that this lifestyle we live along with their schooling , sports , friends , and other activities will really get them prepared for their futures .
And I am most proud of Hannah – for being who she was , fighting as hard as she did , and for making me a much better person than I was just 5 short years ago .
I think back to the eulogy I gave at her funeral , and I hope she is as proud of me as I try to live up to my promise to her .

Advertisement Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo has written off his Ferrari in a crash near Manchester Airport .
The 23 - year - old winger was driving the sports car through a tunnel beneath the runways when he smashed into a barrier .
Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) said his team - mate Edwin van der Sar was following in his Bentley , but the Dutch keeper was not involved in the crash .
Pc Nigel Snell said that given the damage to the car , it was " fortunate " that Ronaldo was not injured .
In pictures : Ronaldo 's car crash " We are trying to establish exactly what happened and I would appeal to anyone that may have witnessed the collision to contact police , " he added .
The accident happened on the A538 Altrincham Road , between Wilmslow and Hale , Cheshire , at about 1020 GMT .
The footballer 's red Ferrari was badly damaged in the crash , with the front edge of the vehicle completely demolished .
One of the wheels came off , ending up about 200 yards behind where the vehicle came to rest .
' Obviously shaken ' Onlooker Jody Lomax was driving behind Ronaldo when the crash happened .
" The Ferrari went straight into the wall , his front left - hand wheel came off and then Ronaldo got out of the car , " he said .
" I was shocked .
Anyway he was all right , he was walking - he was a bit shaken . "
The player was unharmed and attended training on Thursday Mr Lomax added : " Obviously I was stunned at seeing a Ferrari go in the wall and seeing Ronaldo .
" He was obviously shaken - who would n't be ? - but it 's a shame about the car as well . "
Manchester United confirmed that Ronaldo was not hurt .
A club spokesman said : " He was involved in an incident this morning .
No other cars were involved .
" He 's fine and is training as normal with the team this morning . "
Police said the Portuguese international gave a negative breath test to officers at the scene .
Ronaldo came on as a substitute when Manchester United lost at Derby County on Wednesday night and is due to play for the club against Chelsea on Sunday .

Yoo : Bush okayed torture to outwit defense lawyers Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday January 29 , 2009
Print This Email This
It comes as no surprise that the Bush administration had little love for lawyers .
Long before the " Attorneygate " scandal developed around the firing of nine US Attorneys in his second term , former President George W. Bush spent a good amount of the time bashing trial lawyers whenever he had the opportunity .
And it was just recently revealed that Bush appointee Bradley Schlozman , who supervised civil rights and voting rights lawyers from 2003 to 2006 , thought his charges were little more than a bunch of " mold spores , " " commies " and " crazy libs . "
But now , in a Thursday editorial published by the Wall Street Journal , John Yoo , the former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel , explained that the Bush administration 's torture programs , for which he co-authored the legal justifications , were initially designed to outwit crafty defense attorneys .
" The first thing any lawyer will do is tell his clients to shut up , " writes Yoo .
" The [ Khalid Sheikh Mohammeds ] or Abu Zubaydahs of the future will respond to no verbal questioning or trickery -- which is precisely why the Bush administration felt compelled to use more coercive measures in the first place . "
Yoo neglects to mention , however , that before the Supreme Court stepped in , terror defendants were using military lawyers .
Nor does he mention that that judge advocate generals ( JAGs ) for the Army , Air Force and Marines later " said they expressed their concerns as the policy was being hashed out at the Pentagon in March and April 2003 . "
" Though their letters to the Defense Department 's general counsel are classified , sources familiar with them said the lawyers worried that broadly defined , tough interrogation tactics would not only contravene long - standing military doctrine -- leaving too much room for interpretation by interrogators -- but also would cause public outrage if the tactics became known , " Josh White wrote for The Washington Post in 2005 .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , who chaired the 2005 Armed Services subcommittee hearing , told the top military lawyers then , " If they had listened to you from the outset , we would n't have a lot of the problems we 've dealt with . "
Evidently , the Bush administration never did listen to them .
In his time with the Department of Justice , John Yoo co-authored the Patriot Act and helped craft legal justifications for the Bush administration 's torture programs and the NSA 's full - spectrum spying apparatus .
" Relying on the civilian justice system not only robs us of the most effective intelligence tool to avert future attacks , it provides an opportunity for our enemies to obtain intelligence on us , " continued Yoo .
" If terrorists are now to be treated as ordinary criminals , their defense lawyers will insist that the government produce in open court all U.S. intelligence on their client along with the methods used by the CIA and NSA to get it .
A defendant 's constitutional right to demand the government 's files often forces prosecutors to offer plea bargains to spies rather than risk disclosure of intelligence secrets . "
In the piece , titled Obama Made a Rash Decision on Gitmo , Yoo also directly states that President Bush ordered waterboarding " three times " after 9/11 .
" Mr. Obama is returning America to the failed law enforcement approach to fighting terrorism that prevailed before Sept. 11 , 2001 , " he opined .
Yoo argues Obama 's order banning torture " amounts to requiring -- on penalty of prosecution -- that CIA interrogators be polite , " and even parrots a Rove talking point : the claim that Obama 's ban of torture somehow " prohibits " good - cop , bad - cop interrogation routines with prisoners .
" The Army Field Manual , for example , prohibits you from using good cop-bad cop in interrogating , " Rove said on Fox News ' Hannity on Monday .
" The CIA must now conduct interrogations according to the rules of the Army Field Manual , which prohibits coercive techniques , threats and promises , and the good - cop bad - cop routines used in police stations throughout America , " writes Yoo Thursday .
Of course , it does n't .
" In fact , the Army Field Manual explicitly permits good cop-bad cop interrogations under the name of ' Mutt and Jeff ' interrogations , which involve two interrogators ' display[ing ] opposing personalities and attitudes toward the source , ' " reported Media Matters , on the instance of Rove introducing the manufactured " fact . "
" The Field Manual says the ' goal of this technique is to make the source identify with one of the interrogators and thereby establish[ ing ] rapport and cooperation . ' "
After stating unequivocally that the new interrogation rules will completely cut off any further intelligence from captured al - Qaeda members , he goes so far as to imply that President Obama is " naïve . "
" It is naïve to say , as Mr. Obama did in his inaugural speech , that we can ' reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals , ' " opines Yoo .
" That high - flying rhetoric means that we must give al - Qaeda -- a hardened enemy committed to our destruction -- the same rights as garden - variety criminals at the cost of losing critical intelligence about real , future threats . "
His opinion seems to be that suspected terrorists should be given no rights , and the government should not be burdened with needing to provide legitimate evidence against the accused .
" Zacarias Moussaoui , the only member of the 9/11 cell arrested before the attack , turned his trial into a circus by making such demands , " his screed against the American justice system concludes .
" He was convicted after four years of pretrial wrangling only because he chose to plead guilty .
Expect more of this , but with far more valuable intelligence at stake . "
This , coming from the man who once refused to say whether , under his definition of executive power , the president could order a man buried alive .
Speaking with a reporter , Yoo also agreed with an analysis of executive power which posited the hypothetical situation in which Bush might order a boy 's testicles " crushed " in order to affect a response from his parents .
On the legality of such an order , Yoo said , " I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that . "
" The real reason John Yoo wrote this foolish , inaccurate piece is in the hopes of gathering around him some support for his illegal actions , " writes RAW STORY investigative news editor Larisa Alexandrovna on her blog , at - Largely .
" You may wish to read his latest epic verbiage festival , but I would urge you not to waste your time , " she writes .
" The man is a liar , a coward , and now defends his illegal actions by using lies and discredited propaganda to justify the unjustifiable . "

Terms of use
Some motherboards get the job done efficiently .
Others go above and beyond the proverbial call of duty and offer bells and whistles and dual - tub kitchen sinks with detachable sprayer faucets .
The latter tend to cost a lot of money , appeal to hardcore enthusiasts , and feature the word extreme in their monikers .
Here at , ahem , ExtremeTech we ’re not really in a position to criticize the use , or overuse , or homogenization of the word extreme .
We did recently find it amusing to receive a couple of motherboards , one from ASUS and one from Gigabyte , that come in huge , deep boxes and blare Extreme in striking , bold lettering .
What else was there to do besides pit them against each other in a head - to - head shootout to see which one is more extreme than the other ?
Of course , we took lots of things into account , such as performance , features ( especially unique , special features ) , and extra goodies included .
In the end , which of these boards with the huge packaging out - extremed the other one ?

It was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s : an English - language biopic of the prophet Muhammad that was bankrolled by Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy and went on to trigger a fatal siege ahead of its US premiere .
Now The Message could be scheduled for a grand return to the fray courtesy of a remake .
Oscar Zoghbi , a producer who worked on the 1976 original , has announced that a new version is to be filmed around the holy cities of Mecca and Medina .
" We have only the utmost respect for [ the original film ] but technology in cinema has advanced since the 1970s , " Zoghbi said yesterday .
" This latest project will employ modern film techniques in its renewal of the first film 's core messages . "
The new film , The Messenger of Peace , is being scripted by Ramzi Thomas , whose credits include Some Call it Loving , Halloween 5 and Appointment with Fear .
Thomas said : " In the 21st century there is a real need for a film that emotionally engages audiences on the journey that led to the birth of Islam . "
A spokesman for the producers suggested to Reuters that the film 's funding and production schedule had yet to be finalised , promising that details would be announced " in due course " .
The Message prompted controversy in the US when it was rumoured that Anthony Quinn was starring as Muhammad .
In March 1977 , a dozen Muslims stormed three civic buildings in Washington , taking 149 people hostage and demanding the film be destroyed .
The now notorious Hanafi Muslim
Siege resulted in the deaths of a police officer and a radio reporter , while council member , and future mayor , Marion Barry was wounded by a shotgun pellet .
The hostages were eventually released after a 39 - hour standoff .
While the Qur'an does not explicitly forbid images of Muhammad there are some that discourage the visual representation of any living creature .
The concern about depicting Muhammad is that it will lead to idolatry , which is forbidden in Islam .
Most Muslims follow convention and avoid images of the prophet and choosing an actor to play him could be problematic , so would filming in Mecca and Medina .
Both cities are strictly off - limits for non-Muslims , so all the cast and crew would have to be Muslim , and the project would need approval from the Saudi government .
The 1976 film , starring Quinn as an Arab follower of Muhammad , was funded by Gadafy .
The prophet is not seen or heard in the film .
Instead the director , Syrian - born Moustapha Akkad , signified Muhammad 's presence with light organ music and occasionally framed the film from the prophet 's point of view as he observed the actions of his followers .
Two versions of the picture were shot , one in Arabic and the other in English .
Speaking at the time , Akkad claimed he made The Message because he wanted to explain Islam to a western audience .
" I think there was something personal , being Muslim myself who lived in the west , I felt that it was my obligation , my duty , to tell the truth about Islam , " he said .
Portraits of key Islamic figures have prompted protests around the world and the film is likely to renew debate about freedom of expression and self - censorship .
Random
House recently cancelled the publication of The Jewel of Medina , a book about one of Muhammad 's wives , after fears that it would offend Muslims .
It was also pulled in the UK , when the publisher 's London home was firebombed .

NASA Scientists Closer to Timely Space Weather Forecasts
Scientists funded by NASA have made big strides in learning how to forecast " all clear " periods , when severe space weather is unlikely .
The forecasts are important because radiation from particles from the sun associated with large solar flares can be hazardous to unprotected astronauts , airplane occupants and satellites .
" We have a much better insight into what causes the strongest , most dangerous solar flares , and how to develop forecasts that can predict an ' all clear ' for significant space weather , for longer periods , " said Dr. Karel Schrijver of the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center ( ATC ) , Palo Alto , Calif .
He is lead author of a paper about the research published in the Astrophysical Journal .
Solar flares are violent explosions in the atmosphere of the sun caused by the sudden release of magnetic energy .
Like a rubber band twisted too tightly , stressed magnetic fields in the sun ’s atmosphere ( corona ) can suddenly snap to a new shape .
They can release as much energy as one , 10 billion megaton nuclear bomb .
Predicting space weather is a complicated problem .
Solar forecasters focus principally on the complexity of solar magnetic field patterns to predict solar storms .
This method is not always reliable , because solar storms require additional ingredients to occur .
It has long been known large electrical currents must be present to power flares .
Insight into the causes of the largest solar flares came in two steps .
" First , we discovered characteristic patterns of magnetic field evolution associated with strong electrical currents in the solar atmosphere , " said ATC's Dr. Marc DeRosa , co-author of the paper .
" It is these strong electrical currents that drive solar flares .
" Subsequently , the authors discovered the regions most likely to flare had new magnetic fields merge into them that were clearly out of alignment with the existing field .
This emerging field from the solar interior appears to induce even more current as it interacts with the existing field .
The team also found flares do not necessarily occur immediately upon the emergence of a new magnetic field .
Apparently the electrical currents must build up over several hours before the fireworks start .
Predicting exactly when a flare will happen is like studying avalanches .
They occur only after enough snow built up .
Once the threshold is reached , the avalanche can happen anytime by processes not yet completely understood .
"
We found the current - carrying regions flare two to three times more often than the regions without large currents , " Schrijver said .
" Also , the average flare magnitude is three times greater for the group of active regions with large current systems than for the other group .
"
The researchers made the discovery by comparing data about magnetic fields on the sun ’s surface to the sharpest extreme - ultraviolet images of the solar corona .
The magnetic maps were from the Michelson Doppler Imager ( MDI ) instrument on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) spacecraft .
SOHO is operated under a cooperative mission between the European Space Agency and NASA .
The corona images were from the NASA Transition Region and Coronal Explorer spacecraft ( TRACE ) .
The team also used computer models of a three - dimensional solar magnetic field without electrical currents based on SOHO images .
Differences between images and models indicated the presence of large electrical currents .
" This is a result that is more than the sum of two individual missions , " said Dr. Dick Fisher , Director of NASA 's Sun-Solar System Connection Division .
" It 's not only interesting scientifically , but has broad implications for society .
