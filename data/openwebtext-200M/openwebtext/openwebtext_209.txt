WASHINGTON , Oct. 29 — State Department investigators offered Blackwater security guards immunity during an inquiry into last month ’s deadly shooting of 17 Iraqi civilians , government officials said today , calling it a potentially serious investigative misstep that could complicate efforts to prosecute the company ’s employees involved in the episode .
The State Department investigators from the agency ’s investigative arm , the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , offered the immunity grants even though they did not have the authority to do so , the said the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
Prosecutors at the Justice Department , who do have such authority , had no advance knowledge of the arrangement , they added .
Most of the guards who took part in the episode were offered what officials described as limited - use immunity , which means that they were promised they would not be prosecuted for anything they said in their interviews with the authorities as long as their statements were true .
The immunity offers were first reported today by the Associated Press .
State and Justice Department spokesmen would not comment on the matter .
“ If there ’s any truth to this story , then the decision was made without consultation with senior officials in Washington , ” one State Department official said .
Today , in New York Supreme Court , in response to Dan Rather ’s civil lawsuit , CBS filed a lengthy 30 - page motion to dismiss the case .
CBS executives also released a statement today , noting that they are " mystified " by Rather ’s " bizarre allegations " but will " vigorously " defend themselves in court if need be .
" Dan Rather is one of the most important figures in the history of broadcast journalism , and for more than 40 years was one of our most valued colleagues , " CBS said in the statement .
" That is why we at CBS are mystified and saddened by the baseless and self - serving allegations and distortions of fact raised in his lawsuit . "
" Today we are filing a motion to dismiss , " added the statement .
" If we are required to proceed beyond this point , we will defend the case vigorously and demonstrate that the lawsuit is wholly without merit , and that the bizarre allegations by Mr. Rather are untrue . "
UPDATE : In the motion , CBS lawyers argue that Mr. Rather ’s lawsuit is a " thinly - disguised " defamation suit and therefore is time - barred because of a one - year statute of limitations .
To wit :
They point out that the last " allegedly wrongful act " took place on June , 16 2006 , and that Mr. Rather did not file suit until September 19 , 2007 , roughly 15 months later .
Furthermore , CBS lawyers argue that Mr. Rather ’s actions are motivated not by any wrongful actions on the part of the defendants but , instead , by Mr. Rather ’s desire to stay in the limelight .
" This lawsuit is a regrettable attempt by plaintiff Dan Rather to remain in the public eye , and to settle old scores and perceived slights , based on an array of far - fetched allegations , " the lawyers write .
" The Complaint is predicated on allegations of a bizarre ‘ scheme ’ extending from the White House to an array of CBS executives including Sumner Redstone , CBS ’s Executive Chairman , Leslie Moonves , CBS ’s Chief Executive Officer , and Andrew Heyward , formerly president of CBS News , all of whom , according to Rather , colluded to harm Rather ’s reputation and keep him off the air , " add CBS lawyers .
" Of course , there was no such nefarious scheme , and Rather ’s allegations bear no resemblance to reality .
CBS and its executives are not now , and never have been , out to get Dan Rather . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - If Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N ousts Chief Executive Stan O'Neal , his company holdings , retirement benefits and severance package would easily top $ 200 million , U.S. regulatory filings show .
Merrill Lynch President and Chief Operating Officer Stan O'Neal announces an agreement with New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to reform investment practices , in New York on May 21 , 2002 .
The anticipated departure of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc Chief Executive Stan O'Neal would mark a surprising flameout in a career that had been impressive in its ascent .
REUTERS / Chip East
In the absence of a takeover , Merrill Lynch says it does not have severance agreements with senior executives .
For O’Neal , any severance package would come at the discretion of the board ’s compensation committee , which includes two directors who have been strong allies .
The chairman of Merrill 's five - member compensation committee is Chubb Corp CB.N CEO John Finnegan , a former O'Neal colleague from their days at General Motors .
Alberto Cribiore , founder of private - equity firm Brera Capital Partners , also is on the committee and has been a strong supporter of O’Neal , according to people familiar with their relationship .
O’Neal ’s tenure is at risk because of an $ 8.4 billion write - down in the third quarter , mostly because of bad bets on securities tied to risky subprime loans .
As a result , O’Neal presided over the biggest quarterly loss in the company ’s 93 - year history .
“ Even if he ’s pushed out , the board will feel that some kind of severance would be in order , ” said compensation expert Arthur Kroll , chief executive of KST Consulting Group .
“ There are certain things that the company will want from him in return , ” Kroll said .
“ They like to have these things done in an orderly fashion , with joint announcements and no one suing one another . ”
Even without a severance package , O’Neal has amassed a large sum in the form of common stock , stock options , restricted stock , incentive - based pay , pension benefits and deferred compensation , regulatory filings show .
O’Neal ’s stock holdings alone total about $ 90 million .
His unexercised stock options are worth about $ 39.3 million and unvested restricted stock is worth about $ 76 million , the filings show .
Once a top executive leaves a company , vesting is typically accelerated , giving the executive ownership of the shares .
“ I have the same beef with Merrill that I have with most investment banks , which is that CEOs receive bonuses for meeting short - term targets , ” said Paul Hodgson , a pay expert and senior researcher at corporate watchdog The Corporate Library .
Not included in those figures are unearned shares -- estimated at a maximum value of $ 33.9 million earlier this year by Merrill -- that have not vested and are pegged to the company ’s return on equity , regulatory filings show .
With Merrill losing $ 2.3 billion in the third quarter , the value of those incentive - based shares could be hurt .
In addition , the value of O’Neal ’s pension benefits for 20 years of service were estimated at $ 12 million to $ 24.8 million , depending on his retirement age .
He also had nearly $ 5 million in a deferred compensation plan at the end of last year , filings show .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - A Chinese woman who killed her lover with a rat poison - laced kiss when she suspected him of being unfaithful has been sentenced to death , a newspaper said Thursday .
Xia Xinfeng , from Maolou in the central province of Henan , passed a capsule with rat poison from her mouth to her long - time lover , Mao Ansheng , during a kiss , the Shanghai Daily said .
Mao swallowed the capsule and died soon afterwards .
“ The couple had said that if either one of them cheated on the other , he or she would have to die , ” the paper said in explaining the mouth - to - mouth assault .
Xia found Mao had been “ talking ” with another woman and deemed that he had broken their promise .
You might think I ’m being facetious , but I ’m dead serious .
Let ’s select one day per year to remind people to regularly back up their computer data .
I am utterly completely and bewilderedly tired of hearing people tell me “ I lost all my data , songs and photos because my computer hard drive died . ”
No , fool .
You did n’t lose your data because your hard drive broke .
You lost it because you had no data backup .
You did n’t have a backup because you ( YOU ) did n’t back up your data .
If you want to know who to blame for your broken hard drive , it might be the hard drive manufacturer .
If you want to know who to blame for your loss of data , just go look into a mirror .
Yesterday , I heard my most recent loss - of - data story .
A friend claimed he “ lost all my photos . ” I asked whether he had a backup .
He said yes , the data was on the backup hard drive .
I then asked him why he did n’t just access the photos from his main hard drive , but then the sanity left our conversation :
He admitted that he transferred all of his photos over from his laptop to his “ backup hard drive . ”
He deleted the original data after creating his “ backup . ” I was flabbergasted .
I told him , “ That ’s not a ‘ backup . ”
Another friend of mine is a network consultant .
Especially following storms he gets a service call and goes out to find out that a business ’s hard drive is fried .
He asked the business owner for the most up to date backup and he ’s often handed one from two weeks ( or two months ) earlier .
Invariably he ’s then asked whether they “ can get all of the data back . ”
When my friend ( the consultant ) originally sets up a system he always gives the business a lecture to back up their data every day .
It ’s just incredible how often they do n’t listen , especially given the large sums of money a business loses when it loses data .
The reason I ’m especially frustrated with these stories is that people simply refuse to understand .
The advice is not hard to understand , but it goes in one ear and out the other .
Sometimes I tell friends that I ’ll give them computer advice but they first need to put one of their fingers in one of their ears “ so it does n’t go out the other side . ”
Then I tell them the secret of not losing data :
Keep relatively fresh copies of your data in at least two places .
At least one of those copies should not be kept on the same premises as the computers that contain the original copies .
This constant stream of “ loss of data ” stories really aggravates me because I make a habit of asking friends about their back up procedure and I almost never get a satisfactory answer .
Instead , I get a glazed - over look and a reassurance that they do n’t need to back up their data because their computer is working fine .
I do n’t know why I still give the advice given that the advice is so rarely taken .
People !
Listen up !
Your hard drive is guaranteed to break within ten years , maybe a lot sooner .
When will it break ?
We do n’t KNOW .
That ’s why you need to practice good backup hygiene .
It ’s a lot easier than it ever was , now that portable external USB hard drives are so incredibly cheap .
Just get yourself a portable USB hard drive .
It will cost you about $ 100 for 250 GB .
That ’s probably enough to hold your valuable data several times over .
If that size drive is not big enough for you , buy a Terabyte drive for $ 300 .
If your data is n’t worth that kind of money , then you ’ve just been screwing around with your computer and not doing anything worthwhile .
For example , in the past year I ’ve likely put ten thousand hours of work into the digital versions of the writings , music and videos I ’ve created .
$ 100 divided by 10,000 hours = ONE CENT per hour worked to insure my work .
It ’s one of the best deals on the planet .
USB hard drives usually come with their own backup program for free ( or just drag your important files over using Windows , use the Windows XP backup utility ) .
You do n’t have to back up your entire hard drive–focus on your data ( You can always reload your applications ) .
Wikipedia has a more technical article pertaining to backups here .
You do n’t have to stand there and wait for the data backup — it does n’t go any faster just because you ’re watching it .
Just start the process and leave — go watch a movie or go to bed .
It will all be done by the time you wake up in the morning .
Truly , there are no excuses for failing to back up your hard drive .
Nope , I ’m not listening .
NO excuses .
Hence , my plea to establish one day each year as a Day everyone backs up the data on their hard drive .
Is one backup per year enough ?
Hell , no .
But it ’s a lot better than most people seem to be doing .
There .
I ’m done with my rant , except to say this :
Good friends will continue to remind their friends to back up their computer data .
And if they ’ve warned their friends , but their friends still lose data , they nonetheless try to be sympathetic .
Back pain is something that nearly everyone can relate to ; according to
statistics from the Mayo Clinic , four out of five people will experience
some form of back pain in their lifetimes .
Treatment for such pain can
vary greatly in modern medicine .
Many who experience it are told
by a medical professional to use heat , take over the counter
anti-inflammatory medicines , or for more severe pain , attend physical
therapy sessions .
If these " simple " treatments do not work , there is
the option for more powerful pain medicine , to direct spinal steroid
injections , all the way up to surgery that fuses multiple vertebrae
together .
If one chooses an alternative treatment , acupuncture is
common for treating back pain .
Given all these options — conventional conservative techniques , surgery , and alternative measures — which is best ?
A new study by a German team of researchers and physicians asks whether acupuncture is a worthwhile treatment for lower back pain , the details and results of which will appear in an upcoming issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine .
To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture at healing back pain , the researchers carried out a randomized clinical trial that consisted of over 1,000 patients .
Each participant had experienced chronic back pain for a minimum of eight years and underwent a series of ten 30 - minute sessions for treatment of their pain .
The participants received one of three types of treatment — 387 received verum acupuncture , 387 received sham acupuncture , and 388 received conventional therapy .
Verum acupuncture is based on placing the needles at points and depths specified by traditional Chinese techniques .
Conversely , sham acupuncture was just that , a sham , needles were placed away from known verum points and meridians and were only sunk to a superficial depth .
The conventional therapy included a combination of medicine , physical therapy , and exercise .
To quantify the effectiveness of the therapies , the researchers measured the response rate , which is defined as a patient reported 33 percent reduction in pain or a 12 percent increase in functional ability .
Six months after treatment , the response rate for the verum acupuncture group was 47.6 percent , for the sham acupuncture it was 44.2 percent , and for the conventional therapy group it was a mere 27.4 percent .
The authors conclude that " the superiority of both forms of acupuncture suggests a common underlying mechanism that may act on pain generation , transmission of pain signals or processing of pain signals by the central nervous system and that is stronger than the action mechanism of conventional therapy . "
Whether or not this is indeed the case , or this is an example of the placebo effect , it suggests another viable option for those suffering from back pain .

As a teenager 's father and uncle are found guilty in ' honour killing ' case , police face an investigation for failing to respond to her desperate warnings .
These reports from Fiona Barton and Stephen Wright .
Five police officers are under investigation after a series of terrible blunders left a young Muslim woman at the mercy of killers in her own family .
Banaz Mahmod , 20 , was strangled with a bootlace on the orders of her father and uncle , both Iraqi Kurds who ruled their families with violence and fear .
At the Old Bailey yesterday , Mahmod Mahmod , 52 , and Ari Mahmod , 51 , both from Mitcham , South London , were convicted of Banaz 's murder after a three - month trial and will be sentenced later .
The jury heard that she died on the orders of a sinister " court " because she had left an abusive arranged marriage and fallen in love with an " unsuitable " man , Rahmat Sulemani , bringing shame on the family .
VIDEO : View Banaz 's desperate plea here
It also emerged that in the two months before her death she had warned police four times that she believed her family wanted to murder her .
On one occasion she even recorded a chilling video message on a mobile phone - played to the jury - revealing her terror .
In addition , she wrote a letter naming those she thought would do it , and deposited it with detectives , " in the event of her death " .
The police , however , dismissed her desperate warnings , with one female officer saying she thought she had made up the story to get her boyfriend 's attention .
On New Year 's Eve 2005 , Banaz was found bleeding and terrified after her father tried to kill her .
But PC Angela Cornes simply dismissed her as " dramatic and calculating " .
Instead of protecting the victim , the officer even considered charging the young woman with criminal damage because she had broken a window to escape .
PC Cornes admitted in court she might have made " a dreadful mistake " and Scotland Yard has launched an internal review into its handling of the case .
She is one of the five officers facing an internal disciplinary investigation over the Metropolitan Police 's handling of the case .
The court heard that three weeks after that contact , Banaz was deliberately left alone in the family home by her parents and the assassins were given the go - ahead .
Following the murder , before which she is believed to have been raped , her body was stuffed into a suitcase and driven to Birmingham by one of the killers , Mohamad Hama .
Two other suspects are believed to have fled to Iraq .
The unnamed men are said to have boasted about raping Miss Mahmod in her home before they garroted her with a bootlace and stuffed her body in a suitcase .
One is a rebel fighter who is believed to have killed several people in his homeland of Iraqi Kurdistan .
Banaz was buried in the garden of a house rented by an associate of Ari Mahmod and the Kurdish community immediately began to cover up the crime , telling police that Banaz was not missing and the Mahmods were a liberal family .
The truth was revealed when Banaz 's body was found three months later and her sister , Bekhal , agreed to give evidence against her relatives .
Neither Mahmod nor Ari showed any emotion as the guilty verdicts were delivered .
Mohamad Hama , 30 , of South Norwood , had already admitted the killing .
Bekhal , 22 , wept with emotion when her father and uncle were convicted .
She had also been the subject of a murder plot .
Her " crime " ?
Smoking and wearing hairspray like a " Westerner " .
Bekhal says she was beaten with shoes and sticks as a teenager and banned from leaving the house .
Her uncle Ari threatened her , saying : " If I was your father , I would have done it by now .
I would have killed you .
You would have been turned into ash by now . "
Bekhal went into voluntary foster care but she told the jury that she was sent a tape , warning that she would be killed , and was lured to a meeting in a pub car park by her brother , who hit her on the side of the head with a dumb bell .
He then broke down in tears and confessed their father had paid him to carry out the attack , saying : " Do n't make this harder than it already is .
I have to do it .
It is my duty to finish you off . "
Official police figures show 19 confirmed " honour killings " in the last decade , but the British courts are dealing with a further eight cases .
One charity claims at least eight women have deposited statements , DNA evidence and video interviews with police in different parts of the country , in case they are killed .
Politicians have also pointed out that the astonishingly high suicide rate among Asian women in Britain - three times the national average - could hide other casualties .
Commander Simon Bray , of the Metropolitan Police , said : " Banaz and her boyfriend had contact with the police on five occasions .
" The question for the internal review is what was a reasonable response for these officers based on what they knew and she was prepared to tell them . '
Asked whether the Met had blood on its hands , Commander Bray said : ' Clearly the police were not responsible for her murder .
There were people determined to punish and kill her .
" The question is whether there were ways we should have stopped what happened . '

Banaz fell in love at 19 ...
So her family decided she had to die
By Fiona Barton
As one of five daughters in a strictly - traditional Kurdish family , Banaz Mahmod 's future was ordained whether she liked it or not .
She was kept away from Western influences , entered an arranged marriage at the age of 16 with a member of her clan and was expected to fulfil the role of subservient wife and mother .
But Banaz , a bright , pretty 19 - year - old , fell in love with another man .
And for that , she was murdered by her father , uncle and a group of family friends .
The very people who should have protected her from harm plotted her killing , garrotted her with a bootlace , stuffed her body in a suitcase and buried her under a freezer .
Banaz 's crime was to " dishonour " her father , Mahmod Mahmod , an asylum seeker from Iraqi Kurdistan , by leaving her abusive marriage and choosing her own boyfriend - a man from a different Kurdish clan .
Her punishment was discussed at a family " council of war " attended by her father , uncle Ari and other members of the clan .
In the living room of a suburban semi in Mitcham , South London , it was decided that this young woman 's life was to be snuffed out so that her family would not be shamed in the eyes of the community .

Banaz was only ten when she came to Britain with her father , who had served in the Iraqi army , her mother Behya , brother Bahman and sisters Beza , Bekhal , Payman and Giaband .
The family , who came from the mountainous and rural Mirawaldy area , close to the Iranian border , were escaping Saddam Hussein 's regime and were granted asylum .
But Banaz 's move to a western country changed nothing about the life she was made to lead .
She had met her husband - tobe only three times before her wedding day , once on her father 's allotment .
He was ill - educated and old - fashioned but her family described him as ' the David Beckham of husbands ' .
The teenage bride , who was taken to live in the West Midlands , was to tell local police in September 2005 that she had been raped at least six times and routinely beaten by her husband .
In one assault , she claimed , one of her teeth was almost knocked out because she called him by his first name in public .
To leave the arranged marriage would have brought dishonour on the Mahmod family and Banaz 's parents apparently preferred their child to suffer abuse rather than be shamed .
But after two years of marriage , she insisted on returning home to seek sanctuary .
It was there , at a family party in the late summer of 2005 , that she met Rahmat Sulemani .
For the first time in her blighted existence , Banaz fell in love .
She was besotted with Rahmat , 28 , calling him ' my prince ' and sending endless loving text messages .
Her father and uncle Ari were furious ; the young woman was not yet formally divorced by her husband and her boyfriend was neither from their clan nor religious .
More importantly , perhaps , he had not been chosen by her family .
Mahmod became enraged when his daughter refused to give up her boyfriend and talked of being in love .
The threat to family honour was immense and made worse by the fact that Banaz 's elder sister , Bekhal , had already brought " shame " on the family by moving out of the house at the age of 15 , to escape her father 's violence .
Bekhal 's defiance meant that Mahmod lost status in the community because he was seen to
have failed to control his women and his younger brother Ari , a wealthy entrepreneur who ran a money transfer business , took over as head of the family .
It was he who telephoned Banaz on December 1 , 2005 to tell her to end the affair with Rahmat or face the consequences .
The following day , Ari called a council of war to plan her murder and the disposal of her body .
She was secretly warned by her mother that the lives of her and her boyfriend were in danger , and she went to Mitcham Police Station to report the death threat .
But she was so terrified of her family 's reaction that she asked police to take no action and refused to move to a refuge .
The next day , an officer called at the family home but Banaz would not let him in .
She believed that her mother would protect her from harm but as an insurance against her disappearance , went back to the police station a week later to make a full statement , naming the men she believed would kill her .
One of the men was Mohamad Hama , who has admitted murder and two of the others named fled back to Iraq after the killing .
On New Year 's Eve 2005 , she was lured to her grandmother 's house in nearby Wimbledon for a meeting with her father and uncle to sort out her divorce .
When her father appeared wearing surgical gloves , ready to kill her , she ran out barefoot , broke a window to get into a neighbour 's house and then ran to a nearby cafe , covered in blood from cuts to her hands and screaming : " They 're trying to kill me " .
The officers who attended the scene and accompanied Banaz to hospital did not believe her story .
However , the distressed and injured victim was able to give her own testimony about the attack to the jury in a short video recorded on Rahmat 's mobile phone at St George 's Hospital , Tooting .
The terrified lovers pretended they had parted but they continued to meet in secret .
Tragically , they were spotted together in Brixton on January 21 and the Mahmods were informed .
Mohamad Hama and three other men tried to kidnap Rahmat and , when his friends intervened , told him he would be killed later .
When he phoned to warn Banaz , she went to the police and said she would co- operate in bringing charges against her family and other members of the community .
The policewoman who saw Banaz tried to persuade her to go into a hostel or safe house but she thought she would be safe at home because her mother was there .
On January 24 , Banaz was left on her own at the family house and her assassins , Hama and two associates , were alerted .
The full details of what happened to her are still not known but two of the suspects , Omar Hussein and Mohammed Ali , who fled back to Iraq after the killing , are said to have boasted that Banaz was raped before she was strangled , " to show her disrespect " .
There followed a " massively challenging " investigation into her disappearance by detectives , fearing the worst .
The family 's appalling crime was finally exposed when , three months after she went missing , Banaz 's remains were found , with the bootlace still around her neck .
The discovery of her body provoked no emotion in her father and uncle .
Even at her funeral , the only tears were from Banaz 's brother .
" She had a small life , " a detective on the case said .
" There is no headstone on her grave , nothing there to mark her existence . "
Yesterday , her devastated boyfriend , who has been given a new identity by the Home Office under the witness protection programme , said : " Banaz was my first love .
She meant the world to me . "
The dead girl 's older sister , Bekhal , urged other women in the same position as her and her sister to seek help before it is too late .
Even today she continues to fear for her life , lives at a secret address and never goes out without wearing a long black veil that covers her entire body and face apart from her eyes .
She strongly rejected the suggestion that Banaz had brought " shame " on her Kurdish family by falling in love with a man they did not approve of , saying her sister simply wanted to live her own life .
" There 's a lot of evil people out there .
They might be your own blood , they might be a stranger to you , but they are evil .
" They come over here , thinking they can still carry on the same life and make people carry on how they want them to live life . "
Asked what was in her father 's mind on the day that Banaz died , Bekhal replied : " All I can say is devilishness .
How can somebody think that kind of thing and actually do it to your own flesh and blood ?
It 's disgusting . "
Bekhal says she is scared whenever she sees somebody from the same background as her .
" I watch my back 24/7 . "
Suppose you lived in a place with an unusually high population of compulsive gamblers , the type who will keep gambling until they are poor .
And suppose you had the resources to open a casino .
Would it be ethical to do so ?
All the gamblers have a choice of resisting , assuming you subscribe to the superstition of free will .
So you ’re not hurting anyone by making it easier for them to go broke .
You ’re giving them new choices .
And some of them might even win big jackpots .
This seems analogous to attending a concert for a struggling musician .
The musician knows he will probably end up poor .
He ’s making his choice , and his addiction to the musician lifestyle is similar to a gambler ’s addiction to gambling .
By attending the live performance , you feed the musician 's habit and make it less likely he will get a higher paying job as an insurance actuary .
You bastard .
Hey , it ’s a holiday weekend , and I am not working too hard on these posts .
Bush advisers urge veto of any bill raising oil company taxes
WASHINGTON — The White House is threatening to veto any energy bill that seeks to raise taxes on oil companies .
President Bush 's senior advisers will recommend he veto any energy bill that raises taxes or uses the tax code to " single out specific industries , " Allan Hubbard , director of the National Economic Council , said in a letter sent late Monday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
Reacting to Hubbard 's letter today , House Democrats vowed not to back down , paving the way for a confrontation over energy policy this fall .
" There the Bush administration goes again — coddling Big Oil instead of developing alternative energy resources that will lower oil prices and save our planet from the worst impacts of global warming , " said Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass .
House and Senate leaders are trying to cobble together a compromise energy package from two different packages passed by the two chambers last summer .
And Hubbard 's letter throws down a challenge on a number of key provisions dear to Democrats .
The House package would saddle the oil companies with $ 16 billion in new taxes .
The companies , for instance , would be excluded from a scheduled rollback in the corporate tax rate for U.S. manufacturers .
The House bill also would require that investor - owned utility companies generate at least 15 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 .
That too is a provision that could prompt a presidential veto , Hubbard indicated .

Other famous names who belong to the think tank include Bill Clinton and Tom Brokaw
Angelina Jolie has been showing her glamorous side lately – walking red carpets from Cannes to Hollywood – but Thursday she was honored for her philanthropic work by joining the Council on Foreign Relations , PEOPLE has learned exclusively .
The prestigious think tank officially approved Jolie ’s membership nomination , adding her to a group whose membership includes presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter , ABC ’s Diane Sawyer , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and journalist Tom Brokaw .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Earlier this year , Jolie , already a UN Goodwill Ambassador , was nominated and recommended for approval by the CFR membership .
“ Angelina Jolie is accomplished in her field and has demonstrated serious interest in issues such as Darfur , international education and refugees , ” says Lisa Shields , vice president of communications at CFR .
“ As such , her profile fits very well with other young professionals we ’ve selected as the next generation of foreign policy leaders . ”
In the new issue of Esquire , Jolie says she wants to be remembered for her humanitarian work , not her acting .
“ When I die , do I want to be remembered as an actress ?
No. ” she tells the magazine .
“ I recently had a column published in a newspaper and at the end it did n’t say I was an actress .
It said that I was a UN Goodwill Ambassador – that ’s all .
And I was really proud . ”
When Bill Clinton left office , he issued a record number of executive orders on the environment and other issues which he'd been unable to legislate through the republican - controlled Congress .
During his two terms , Clinton had averaged about one executive order per week ( over 30,000 pages of new regulations in the last 90 days ) .
Clinton 's last minute EOs included issues like banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in federal hiring , bans on permanent striker replacements , an order to allow poor nations manufacture generic versions of expensive AIDS medicines , and a host of environmental orders which reserved hundreds of acres of federal land as refuges for wildlife and national monuments .
When Bush came into office , he promptly set out to reverse those Clinton orders by issuing his own contradictory ones and advancing legislation which ignored or overturned them .
Many were allowed to stand , but others were challenged in court and in Congress .
For instance , when Bush took office he rescinded Clinton 's EO establishing labor management groups for federal govt .
workers who were in unions with his own EO reversing Clinton requirements that federal contractors follow union standards .
Bush also brought back an order which Clinton had struck down which required unions to inform workers of their right to refunds for dues used for politics .
An EO issued by Clinton to ensure environmental justice for minority and low - income populations was ' reinterpreted ' by the administration and broadened to include ' everyone ' as a dodge on their specific responsibility to the disadvantaged populations who suffer greater exposure to environmental hazards than others .
The Clinton orders on the environment were bypassed in legislation like Bush 's plan to allow coal - fired power plants to buy credits from cleaner plants instead of reducing their own emissions , ignoring the impact of those who still had to live with the offending plants and their hazardous emissions .
On Oct. 1 , 2001 , Bush 's Fish and Wildlife Service reversed a Clinton order to increase Missouri River flow to protect species .
Jun. 9 , 2003 , Bush 's USDA reversed Clinton ban on logging and road building on 58.5 million acres of federal forest land .
Bush has had his own executive order revolution in his two terms and we should brace for many more .
This power - grabbing administration will do more than pilfer a few typewriter keys and abscond with WH furniture and silverware .
In November , Bush signaled that he intended to bypass any opposition which the new Democratic majority might pose to his autocratic ambitions , by ordering agency staff to produce a myriad of executive orders for his consideration .
In January of this year , Bush issued an EO which directed that each government agency must have a regulatory policy office run by a political appointee , to supervise the development of rules and documents providing guidance to regulated industries .
In July , Bush issued a presidential order giving him the authority to confiscate the assets of whoever opposes his Iraq occupation under the pretext of protecting his U.S. sponsored Iraqi regime .
The same month , Bush issued an order broadening the law which had restricted the interrogation methods which can be used on terrorism suspects , absolving and allowing the CIA to resume their activities which were suspended after criticism which accompanied their revelation .
Everything from Bush 's career appointments in Justice , Defense , Intelligence , the Courts , and the myriads of other government institutions he has dominion over , will stand in place and operation until the next administration moves to upend and dissolve them .
At Defense , there is the obvious influence of Bush 's appointments which led us into Iraq and have kept us bogged down there .
Many of the Pentagon 's Bush cabal will be able to shrink back into the military fold when the next administration team takes charge .
A great deal of the transformation of Bush military expansionism will be directed from the Pentagon where there is an institutional support ingrained into a career military which is almost never shy about their eagerness to demonstrate the strength of their forces .
A strong leader will be needed to actually transform their mission instead of merely acquiescing to them because if some inexperience in foreign affairs , or a lack of expertise or influence in managing the military management structure .
In almost all of the agencies which Bush has so thoroughly infected with the influence of his craven political ambitions , there are already effects of the traditional flight of loyalists from lame - duck administrations poised for a reversal of party control .
The NYT has reported on the large number of interim appointments which now exist in many Cabinet positions which would require congressional approval .
The Bush administration has decided , in their interest or because of the opposition of the new Democratic majority in Congress , to leave these positions in the hands of the deputies - in - charge instead of pressing for replacements .
Many of these seconds are appointees which have even more political and operational baggage than their predecessors .
Although there will be a certain flight of these figures from an ascending Democratic Executive , there will still be a need to systematically dismantle the webs of assumed authority Bush has encouraged and allowed .
Who knows just how many of Bush 's political prisoners are still detained in the CIA 's secret prisons around the world ?
Who can actually quantify all of the agents dispatched around the globe who are infected with Bush 's imperious mission to meddle and obstruct in the internal affairs of sovereign nations ?
Like Israel 's use of cluster bombs in their recent assault and invasion of Southern Lebanon , making the previously settled territory uninhabitable because of the deliberate minefield - effect of the residual bomblets left littered everywhere , the Bush administration will leave a legacy and infrastructure at home and around the world which will pose dangerous and pernicious obstacles to any efforts to reform or reverse the effects of Bush 's autocratic constructions .
As we look to the future without Bush and his anti-democratic minions in power and assumed authority , we will still need to remain focused on the malignant and infectious consequences of his unilateral meddling .
One thing is certain ; if we do n't persist in removing these incendiary traces of his legacy that he 's deliberately deposited at home and abroad , the Bush regime will have effectively institutionalized the tyranny they 've so obviously craved and attempted throughout their term .

Former chief United Nations weapons inspector Hans Blix says he fears the United States has a secret plan to keep its troops in Iraq .
Dr Blix , who warned against the invasion of Iraq after his inspectors found no evidence that weapons of mass destruction were being held by Saddam Hussein , is in Sydney to receive the Sydney Peace Prize .
" One fear I would have is that the US has a hidden thought to remain in Iraq , " Dr Blix told ABC radio on Wednesday .
" One reason why they wanted in was that they felt they must leave Saudi Arabia .
" After the Gulf War in 1991 they left their troops in Saudi Arabia to protect pipelines , " he explained .

No , there is one huge difference .
Pakistan has the nukes that we only fear Iran may have some day .
Things are getting bad .
They arrested Bhutto last night .
And we ’ve been supporting the regime for years .
I hope the rumors of us having a contingency plan to grab Pakistan ’s nukes in case of a revolution are true .
Otherwise , we ’re going to have our own revolution here at home if Bush is responsible for letting Islamic fundamentalists get nukes after all – by taking over Pakistan .
Michael Mukasey is certainly qualified to be Attorney General of the United States , if Alberto Gonzales sets any precedent .
And while that may be the least convincing recommendation anyone can ever be given for the job , consider that Mukasey yesterday gave perhaps the least convincing answer to one of the most important questions asked of him -- by Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) -- in his confirmation hearing :
WHITEHOUSE : Is waterboarding constitutional ?
MUKASEY : I do n’t know what is involved in the technique .
If waterboarding is torture , torture is not constitutional .
WHITEHOUSE : " If waterboarding is constitutional " is a massive hedge .
MUKASEY : No , I said , " If it 's torture . "
I 'm sorry .
I said , " If it 's torture . "
WHITEHOUSE : " If it 's torture . "
That 's a massive hedge .
I mean , it either is or it is n’t .
Do you have an opinion on whether waterboarding , which is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position , strapping them down , putting cloth over their faces , and pouring water over the cloth to simulate the feeling of drowning .
Is that constitutional ?
MUKASEY : If it amounts to torture , it is not constitutional .
WHITEHOUSE : I 'm very disappointed in that answer — I think it is purely semantic .
MUKASEY : I ’m sorry .
And Whitehouse is right , of course .
To say torture is not constitutional is -- or should be , in a sane world -- to say nothing at all .
That is the response one might expect from a junior high school civics student , not a nominee for Attorney General .
But Mukasey , and his putative boss , George W. Bush , have a much bigger problem than being able to get away with massive hedges .
The problem is that Bush 's policies have made it impossible for any nominee for Attorney General who hopes to retain any amount of faith with this " administration " to answer these threshold questions with any amount of honesty .
It is simply bedrock truth that no one can answer the torture questions honestly without exposing the fact that the " administration " hinges its entire detainee policy on semantics .
It is similarly unfathomable -- or once was unfathomable in America -- that a nominee for Attorney General of the United States would ever have to say anything other than " no " to the question of " Is waterboarding constitutional ? "
George W. Bush 's detainee policies have , quite simply , rendered honest and conscientious service as an Attorney General impossible .
One simply cannot serve both this president and the law faithfully .
It is a paradox and an impossibility , because this president does not serve the law faithfully .
And what it means , at bottom , is that George W. Bush 's " administration " is an enemy of the rule of law , and has so diminished our capacity to live by it that no honest Senator should permit him the charade of attending to it with the window dressing of confirming an Attorney General .
Anyone who would hold that job in this " administration " will by definition be reduced to serving as a placeholder only -- a mere figurehead to whom everyone will , out of pure habit only , refer to as the " Attorney General , " but who will at the end of the day be prevented from administering the law he will have sworn to uphold .
Home / Career / How to Quit Your Day Job in Six Not So Easy Steps
How to Quit Your Day Job in Six Not So Easy Steps
What ’s the secret to being able to quit your day job ?
Make your own time worth more to you per hour than your employer is paying .
How can you do that , one step at a time : )
Step One – Overcome Naysayers
This is a topic I ’ve been giving a lot of thought to recently .
Actually twice yesterday , first when a fubar project blindsided us at work and then again while seething in snarled traffic on the drive home .
How can I make my time worth more than $ 39 an hour ( around $ 52 an hour including benefits ) ?
This is quite a tall order , daunting to say the least .
I think the first step to quitting your day job is convincing yourself that you can swing it .
It ’s not an easy thing to do , so there will be many naysayers , yourself included .
There are some days when doubt hits me big time the first few minutes after the alarm goes off .
“ What am I doing ” , I think to myself as I recap the previous night working into the early hours of the morning .
“ Why ca n’t I just be happy with the steady job I have ?
Why do I push myself so hard ?
It ’s never going to happen , just give it up . ”
Luckily as I slowly wrap my brain around these thoughts the optimist inside me starts to wake up and I ’m planning my “ work outside of work ” schedule for the day ahead by the time I leave for the office .
You ’ll doubt yourself at times , just keep going !
If you ’re really struggling watching the Pursuit of Hayypness should get you going again .
Step Two – Set Expectations
How I ’d love to give my two weeks notice tomorrow but alas that ’s not realistic with a family and a mortgage .
You have to set a time table for success , decide when you ’ll be ready to strike out on your own .
My date is January 10th 2013 ; 13 years after the day I started work with my current job .
If the day comes sooner that ’d be GROOVY but as of now I ’m planning to give my two weeks notice right around Christmas time 2012 .
Having a D - day not only gives you something to look forward to and work towards but also sets you up for the next step , planning .
Step Three – Plan Backwards
One problem I have with making progress towards my D - Day is that I have too many ideas and get easily distracted from my plans by new projects .
As I recently listened to Simpleology for some tips on staying focused I picked up on the backwards planning method where you begin with your end goal .
You picture yourself achieving your goal and then determine the last step you took just before reaching the goal .
You continue this process of looking back one step at a time until you ’ve reached the current point in time .
I have n’t taken the time to sit down and do this yet .
Once I ’m finished , I think I ’ll have a much better idea of the different things I need to succeed at to reach my goal .
Step Four – Reality Check
Run the numbers from your backwards plan against where you are today .
What are your living expenses now , what do project they ’ll be around your D - day ?
What financial changes do you need to make to accomplish your goal ?
The less you spend , the less you ’ll need to earn .
Does your current financial reality fall in line with your plan , if not what needs adjusting ?
Step Five – Network
I do n’t know where I read it or who said it but I think it ’s true .
One of the best ways to become successful is to help make other people successful .
Surround yourself by like minded people and help them succeed .
Sharing ideas , giving & getting getting feedback , and partnering together on projects will help you both grow .
Another important step is to find good mentors .
Just last night I heard a quote from Tony Robbins something along the lines of how you have to ask the right questions to get the right answers .
If you have an experienced mentor they ’ll not only be full of answers but will hopefully steer you towards asking the right ones .
Step Six – Get Started
Of course , you actually got started with step one but I ’m referring to the work you have to do after the initial steps .
You ’ll have to get started every day and every night .
Luckily , after you get started enough times it becomes a little easier because you create routines and figure out smarter or more efficient ways to do things .
But if you do n’t get started , you ’ll never get where you ’re headed , so get going !
Of course , you should n’t necessarily listen to me .
As you ’ve read , I ’m still at my job .
But I have created the six not so easy steps to leaving it so stay tuned to my progress and see if they really work !

Some TV shows are cut down before their time , and never really get a fair shot ( We are artistically obligated to mention Arrested Development at this point ) .
Other shows live long past their time ( According to Jim will be entering into it 's seventh motherfucking season ) .
But then , every once and awhile , those crazy TV executives get it just right and cut an awful show off after it 's first breath .
Here are six shows that barely got to the credits on their first episode before somebody threw the switch .

6 Emily 's Reasons Why Not Continue Reading Below Advertisement The Show :
Heather Graham 's breasts play Emily Sanders , a successful young publisher who has a knack for giving great advice ... except when it comes to her own relationships .
Emily , armed only with a gay best friend , who works in a tea shop , and a sassy female friend , who tells it like it is , is now on a quest to find the perfect guy , even if it cancels her .
Graham 's breasts ultimately decide that , if they can find five reasons to break up with a guy , they will .
That is what the entire show is based around .
Why It Was Canceled :
ABC reportedly committed to the show and poured millions in advertising and promotion into the show before seeing a script .
They were , one might speculate , impressed by the heartfelt and passionate persuasion of Graham 's talented sweater melons .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Generous critics compared the show to a " severely watered - down episode of Sex and the City , " while many others found it to be " highly offensive " and " fucking stupid . "
One of the most common critiques was that Heather Graham was wholly unlikeable and unwatchable , though her breasts are still widely considered to be Emmy - worthy and , going further , a heaving symbol of artistic integrity .
The clip below pretty clearly demonstrates Graham 's " acting " as well as highlighting where the show goes wrong .
Did you watch that clip ?
Watch it again but , this time , pay close attention to the moments when you can't see Heather Graham 's breasts at all and note how your decreased interest in the show coincides perfectly .
Amazing , right ?
In short , this show needed less stupid plot and Heather Graham 's shrieking Chihuahua head and more shots of her amazingly gifted chest monsters .
Got that , ABC ?
If you greenlight our " 22 Minutes of Heather Graham 's Breasts " pilot , you will have a guaranteed hit on your hands .

Security fix released
Today we 're releasing a fix for a security vulnerability discovered in Django 's internationalization framework .
The complete details are below , but the executive summary is that you should updated to a fixed version of Django immediately .
We are releasing point - releases of all affected Django versions .
You can download them at http://www.djangoproject.com/download/.
Those tracking trunk development should " svn update " as soon as possible .
Please direct any questions about this release to django- users ( http://groups.google.com/group/django-users).
Description of vulnerability
A per-process cache used by Django 's internationalization ( " i18n " ) system to store the results of translation lookups for particular values of the HTTP Accept - Language header used the full value of that header as a key .
An attacker could take advantage of this by sending repeated requests with extremely large strings in the Accept - Language header , potentially causing a denial of service by filling available memory .
Due to limitations imposed by Web server software on the size of HTTP header fields , combined with reasonable limits on the number of requests which may be handled by a single server process over its lifetime , this vulnerability may be difficult to exploit .
Additionally , it is only present when the " USE_I18N " setting in Django is " True " and the i18n middleware component is enabled * .
Nonetheless , all users of affected versions of Django are encouraged to update .
Affected versions
Django trunk prior to revision [ 6608 ] .
Django 0.96
Django 0.95 ( including 0.95.1 )
Django 0.91
Resolution
New versions of Django containing this fix have been released today which alter this caching mechanism to store shortened , normalized values and to reject improperly formatted headers .
These versions are called :
Django 0.96.1 ( replaces Django 0.96 )
Django 0.95.2 ( replaces Django 0.95.1 )
Django 0.91.1 ( replaces Django 0.91.1 )
Anyone using a stable Django release should upgrade to one of these point releases immediately .
These fixed versions have already been provided to maintainers of Django packages for various OS distributions and should be released shortly .
Anyone tracking Django 's trunk development should use Subversion to update to at least revision [ 6608 ] .
Additionally , these fixes have been committed to the various " bugfixes " branches :
* This post originally failed to mention that the i18n middleware component must be enabled to trigger the bug .
BY any conceivable measure , Frank Buckles has led an extraordinary life .
Born on a farm in Missouri in February 1901 , he saw his first automobile in his hometown in 1905 , and his first airplane at the Illinois State Fair in 1907 .
At 15 he moved on his own to Oklahoma and went to work in a bank ; in the 1940s , he spent more than three years as a Japanese prisoner of war .
When he returned to the United States , he married , had a daughter and bought a farm near Charles Town , W. Va. , where he lives to this day .
He drove a tractor until he was 104 .
But even more significant than the remarkable details of Mr. Buckles ’s life is what he represents :
Of the two million soldiers the United States sent to France in World War I , he is the only one left .
This Veterans Day marked the 89th anniversary of the armistice that ended that war .
The holiday , first proclaimed as Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919 and renamed in 1954 to honor veterans of all wars , has become , in the minds of many Americans , little more than a point between Halloween and Thanksgiving when banks are closed and mail is n’t delivered .
But there ’s a good chance that this Veterans Day will prove to be the last with a living American World War I veteran .
( Mr. Buckles is one of only three left ; the other two were still in basic training in the United States when the war ended . )
Ten died in the last year .
The youngest of them was 105 .
At the end of his documentary “ The War , ” Ken Burns notes that 1,000 World War II veterans are dying every day .
Their passing is being observed at all levels of American society ; no doubt you have heard a lot about them in recent days .
Fortunately , World War II veterans will be with us for some years yet .
There is still time to honor them .
But the passing of the last few veterans of the First World War is all but complete , and has gone largely unnoticed here .

FROM the forged “ Protocols of the Elders of Zion ” in the 19th century to the charter of Hamas , the Palestinians ' Islamist movement , a common claim by anti-Semites has been that Jews trick great powers into needless wars .
That is why an article published in March 2006 by two American academics , John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , caused such outrage .
Writing in the London Review of Books , they argued that the activities of Israel and its supporters were the “ critical ” reason for America 's invasion of Iraq .
George Bush , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld may have thought that they were acting in America 's interests , but were in fact acting in Israel's .
Like previous American governments , the Bush administration had been turned by clever lobbying into what Lenin would have called Zionism 's useful idiots .
This startling thesis is , to say the least , provocative .
Since it implies that American boys are dying in Iraq for the sake of Israel , the authors must have known that it would stir up painful questions about the true loyalties of American Jews and therefore attract fiery criticism .
But there is no evidence that Mr Mearsheimer and Mr Walt were motivated by any anti-Jewish prejudice .
They say they want only to discuss a legitimate subject : the influence of the pro-Israel lobby on American foreign policy .
Indeed , now that their article has grown into a book , they claim not only that they are not anti-Semitic but also that they are “ pro-Israel ” , in the sense that “ we support its right to exist , admire its many achievements , want its citizens to enjoy secure and prosperous lives , and believe that the United States should come to Israel 's aid if its survival is in danger . ”
That a powerful pro-Israel lobby influences American policymaking in the Middle East , often for the worse , is indisputable .
This book does a fair job of explaining how AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , along with like - minded lobbying groups and think - tanks , help to shape , and sometimes stifle , American thinking about the region .
The authors have won plaudits for taking on this supposed “ taboo ” and enduring the inevitable opprobrium .
Yet this portion of their argument is hardly groundbreaking : in Washington , the power of the lobby , so far from being a secret , is legendary .
What is new is to accuse Israel 's supporters of dragging America into Iraq .
Here the authors are on much thinner ice .
Their thesis advances as follows .
America and Israel enjoy an extraordinary special relationship .
This cannot be because Israel is a strategic asset .
Although there may have been a time during the cold war when Israel was a help , it has long since become a liability , because by supporting the Jewish state America alienates Arabs and makes itself into a target for terrorists .
Nor , they say , can American support be explained by some moral claim .
Israel 's existence is no longer in danger : far from being an underdog , it is the neighbourhood bully , denying statehood to the Palestinians and discriminating against its Arab minority .
Since Israel is not useful to America and its behaviour is beastly , “ something else must be behind the striking pattern of ever - increasing support ” .
That something , the authors conclude , must be the Israel lobby .
By the same token , the lobby is the something that explains Mr Bush 's otherwise “ deeply puzzling ” decision to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
But for the lobby , “ the war would almost certainly not have occurred ” .
To contend that there can be no strategic or moral reason for Americans to support Israel is controversial on its own , but here at least the authors make a robust case .
The same is not true of their attempt to blame Israel for the invasion of Iraq .
The accusation is plain enough ; but on further reading the clarity dissolves by stages into a muddle .
The muddle begins when the authors concede that those who pushed for the Iraq war genuinely expected it to benefit America as well as Israel .
So the eye - catching implication in the headline — that Israel 's supporters knowingly got America into a war that was in Israel 's interest but not its own — is withdrawn in the fine print .
Next , the authors admit that Israel , considering Iran the bigger threat , did not initiate the campaign for war against Iraq ; it fell into line only after it realised that Mr Bush was already leaning that way , and that he would probably go on after Iraq to clobber Iran too .
As for who persuaded Mr Bush to lean towards war , the authors say in a final confusing twist that the real driving force was not in fact the Israel lobby but “ a small band of neoconservatives ” .
Now if the small band of neoconservatives and the Israel lobby were the same thing , this might begin to make some sense .
But they are not .
At most , the two groups overlap .
Many neocons are Jewish and most are favourable to Israel , but there are some who are neither .
And a lot of the people whom the authors assign to the Israel lobby , such as former Clinton administration officials like Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk , would probably have conniptions on being called neocons .
How plausible , anyway , is blaming the war on the neocons ?
The Walt - Mearsheimer argument is that a lot of the neocons favoured an invasion even before 2001 , but only after September 11th could they talk Mr Bush round , by offering a ready - made approach to the world at a time when he was trying to make sense of an unprecedented disaster .
All the familiar suspects are marched out , among them Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith , then at the Pentagon ; Scooter Libby at the White House ; John Bolton at State ; academics such as Bernard Lewis at Princeton and Fouad Ajami at Johns Hopkins University ; journalists such as Charles Krauthammer and Bill Kristol ; and think - tankers such as Kenneth Pollack at Brookings .
Others did their bit
These people , it is true , argued in favour of the war .
But so did others who were neither neocons nor Jewish nor any part of the Israel lobby — Britain 's Tony Blair , say .
The book makes no attempt to provide the principal actors ' view of how the decision - making unfolded inside the Bush administration .
And without a detailed account of this , the authors have no hard evidence on which to hang their central claim that the neocons ' voices were the decisive ones .
As the Pentagon 's number two , Mr Wolfowitz 's views no doubt counted for something .
But his boss , Mr Rumsfeld , was not a shrinking violet , no neocon and harboured no special love of Israel .
Mr Lewis , a Jewish historian of Islam , may have enjoyed the odd meeting with Mr Bush , but it can be assumed that his vote did not outweigh that of Vice - President Cheney , a hard - headed “ realist ” .
What tipped the balance for the president must be conjecture , but even after 484 pages it is hard to agree with Messrs Walt and Mearsheimer that it was Israel 's interests that did it .
At one point the authors complain that Israel and its supporters in America are now rewriting history “ to absolve Israel of any responsibility for the Iraq disaster ” .
But it was not Israel that invaded Iraq .
Their own book feels like an attempt to absolve America of responsibility for a decision it took by , and for , itself .
A recent study by has characterized an allele that is present in all Native American populations tested .
The allele , 9RA ( 9 repeat - allele ) is a 9 tetranucleotide repeat allele composed of 275 bp at autosomal ( meaning non-sex chromosome ) microsatellite locus D9S1120 ( on chromosome 9 ) .
Microsatellites are small DNA repeats that are typically neutral and are often used as molecular markers for population studies .
According to the report , 9RA was found at an average percentage of roughly 30 % among all the populations .
Although 9RA was found among Chukchi and the Koryaks of Western Beringia ( on the eastern edge of Siberia ) , the allele was not identified in the large number of Asian populations tested ( perhaps because this is a mutation that arose in populations as they approached the land bridge or because the sample size was not big enough to detect it ) .
The study has larger implications for migration theory .
One of the prevailing migration theories is the three - wave hypothesis which proposes that the Na-Dene , Aleut - Eskimo , and Amerind groups migrated into the Americas in three separate waves .
This theory , from Joseph Greenberg , is based on linguistic studies of the three language groups .
The ubiquitous presence of the 9RA allele among all three groups suggests that a single founding population contributed a large percentage of ancestry to all Native American populations .
That single population was most likely located in the eastern portion of Siberia just before the crossing over the Bering land bridge .

This is a post from my blog , with some additional commentary .
The markets had a really bad day today .
The fundamental reasons are a huge writedown at GM of $ 39 billion , China 's plan to diversify it 's currency reserves , and ongoing concern about the credit markets .
Bloomberg : General Motors Corp. , the world 's largest automaker , reported a record $ 39 billion quarterly loss after three money - losing years forced the company to write down the value of future tax benefits .
The loss , excluding the tax writedown , was $ 2.80 a share , more than 12 times analysts ' estimates .
Mortgage - related losses at GM 's partly owned finance unit overwhelmed auto sales that were the highest ever .
GM shares fell 5 percent , giving the Detroit - based automaker a market value of $ 19.4 billion , about half the size of the third - quarter loss .
GM signaled that it wo n't generate enough earnings to use the benefits .
Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner cited concerns about defaults on subprime mortgage loans at GMAC LLC and auto sales in the U.S. and Germany .
Slumping U.S. sales in the past half year ``feel like the conditions we 're going to face , '' Wagoner said .
`` This all suggests that GM thinks that things are so ugly out there that they can't see the possibility of profitability for many quarters , maybe even years , '' Bradley Rubin , an analyst with BNP Paribas in New York , said in an interview .
From Bloomberg :
The dollar fell to a record versus the euro and the lowest since 1981 against the pound after Chinese officials signaled plans to diversify the nation 's $ 1.43 trillion of foreign exchange reserves .
The U.S. dollar also declined to the cheapest versus the Canadian dollar since the end of a fixed exchange rate in 1950 and a 23 - year low against the Australian dollar .
The New York Board of Trade 's dollar index touched to 75.077 , the lowest since the gauge started in March 1973 .
`` The dollar sell - off was sparked by concern that foreign central banks ' diversification away from dollar assets may accelerate , '' said Paresh Upadhyaya , who helps manage $ 29 billion in currency assets at Putnam Investments in Boston .
`` The momentum to sell the dollar still persists and I expect further dollar weakness before year end . ''
The dollar has been reeling since the rate cuts , and this certainly did not help matters any .
There 's more here .
Let 's look at the charts to wee what happened .
This is a very ugly daily chart .
1 . ) The overall direction is down -- big time down .
2 . ) There are three downward gaps that occurred on heavy volume .
That 's not good .
3 . ) The market closed at the low point , on heavy volume just after the third gap down .
That 's a triple whammy of bad events .
Traders did n't want to hold positions overnight because they were concerned something would happen between now and the open that would lower stock prices .
Why are gaps down bad ?
To Quote Bulkowski from Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns , " ... in both cases [ of upward and lower gaps ] some type of exuberance is driving the stock to create a gap ( page 241 ) . "
In other words , there is a strong emotional reason for the change .
It 's safe to say that a downward gap is a sign of extreme concern .
When there are three gaps on a single day , it 's s sign of really extreme concern .
The 9 - day chart shows the SPYs were in a three and a half day consolidation / trading range .
But they broke through support on heavy volume at the end of trading .
Breakdowns indicate a change in sentiment .
When they occur on heavy volume sentiment it's that much more intense .
The SPYs daily chart shows we have broken through support and the 200 day SMA on heavy volume .
Again a triple whammy .
The one day QQQ chart also shows three downward gaps that occurred on heavy volume .
Also notive the index sold - off at the end of trading on heavy volume .
The 10 - day QQQQ chart shows they too were in the middle of a consolidation pattern , but they also broke through support on heavy volume at the close of the market .
This is not good .
The daily QQQQ chart shows the index broke though the support of the 10 and 20 day SMA on heavy volume .
That 's very bad .
In addition , consider these two charts from stockcharts.com .
NASDAQ Breadth
NASDAQ new highs / new lows
Both of these charts tell us that fewer and fewer NASDAQ stocks were responsible for the index 's gains .
That indicates there was a lack of breadth across a wide swath of stocks .
Short version -- this day was terrible .
It did a lot of technical damage .
On top of that , there was a terrible confluence of negative events that just sunk the market .
New liquids capacity with first oil in 2003 as estimated from Petroleum Review MegaProject report in Jan 2004 , and estimate from Wikipedia table as of November 25th , 2007 .
Last week , both Khebab 's piece and mine looked at apparent acceleration in base production decline rates .
This occurs when you combine the increasing new capacity totaled by Petroleum Review 's megaproject reports against plateaued production .
Although we began our analyses separately , we came to roughly the same conclusion .
However , what is not clear is what this means .
In particular , it 's not at all clear that we can make the leap from seeing base production declines accelerate to assuming that actual petrophysical declines are acclerating .
There are a number of confounding factors that potentially complicate life - changes in the amount of spare capacity in the system , restoration of Soviet production capacity that had decayed , effects from the slow ramp - up of some new capacity projects , to mention just a few .
However , a number of people suggested to us in email that an additional confounding factor is that the megaproject lists we were relying on had enough issues that one should hesitate to draw conclusions from them .
Although the jury is still out on this question , there does seem to be some evidence for the idea .
It would be understandable - maintaining a megaproject list is a mammoth task for any one person in their spare time .
As a result , Khebab and I decided last week to start an open megaprojects list .
We 're doing this in the form of a Wikipedia page , since
The Wikipedia already has collaborative editing facilities , allowing anyone motivated to help fix and extend the list
it makes the list broadly accessible , since it's of potentially general and lasting importance
it helps us move in the direction of improving Wikipedia coverage of peak oil ( by enlarging the corpus of TODers that know how to work on Wiki pages something Ransu urged last week ) .
You can see our effort so far over at the Wikipedia .
Be warned that the page is presently in active construction ; it 's incomplete , inconsistent , and changing very frequently .
In particular , at the time of writing , we are ranked # 88 for most actively edited Wikipedia pages at wikirage .
We started from a combination of Rembrandt Koppelaar 's list which he kindly shared , the Skrebowski lists in Petroleum Review , and a spreadsheet of projects I was working on in 2005 .
( Before I gave up on megaproject analysis in disgust at lack of a decent approach to decline rate modeling , I had trawled through a lot of oil company reports and press releases ) .
We 're also receiving sterling help from Ace , and a few other passers - by that happened to notice our efforts .
However , we could use some more help , and part of my hope in writing this post is to get some additional volunteers to get the work to go faster .
If you are
Familiar enough with oil industry terms to be able to read press releases and annual reports ,
Computer literate enough to figure out a simple markup language , and
Have enough spare time to be hanging out at the Oil Drum all the time , and would like the Truth to be Known
then you are a particularly good candidate for volunteering to help the effort .
I 'm hoping that because of TOD 's broad geographic reach , there are folks who are in touch with projects in particular regions , or in particular companies , and can share their knowledge with us in order to make a more perfect list .
I 'll give a tiny tutorial below , but first I want to post a couple of quick graphs , and some examples of issues I 've found with the existing lists .
So far , I 've mainly been working on the years 2003 and 2004 .
I do not claim that the these are perfect yet , but they are much better than they were .
Here 's a graph that compares the preliminary 2003 Wikipedia projects to the 2004 Petroleum Review Megaproject report .
New oil liquids capacity with first oil in 2003 as estimated from Petroleum Review MegaProject report in Jan 2004 , and estimate from Wikipedia table as of November 24th , 2007 .
The biggest issue found so far is that the Haradh II project , which seems to be the largest project of the year , was not listed .
This project was known about in the industry , and used western contractors extensively , with Snamprogetti as prime contractor on the GOSP ( eg see the EIA discussion here , this doc , and the Saudi Aramco Year in Review for 2003 , which lists the GOSP as completed in July , with startup in September . )
Here 's the ( even more preliminary ) situation in 2004 :
New oil liquids capacity with first oil in 2004 as estimated from Petroleum Review MegaProject report in Jan 2004 , and estimate from Wikipedia table as of November 25th , 2007 .
Again , the single largest issue was that the Qatif / Abu'Safah project in Saudi Arabia was not recorded for that year .
Admittedly the facility was inaugurated on December 26th , 2004 , so it only just sneaked under the wire into 2004 , but Petroleum Review does n't list it in 2005 either - it's a " prospective project " in the 2004 report , and then disappears .
Other issues are more understandable in a report from Jan 2004 - the Petrobras Albacora Leste and Roncador II projects turned out to be delayed out of 2004 , but the Barracuda field came in ahead of schedule and managed first oil in 2004 .
Hindsight is 20 - 20 .
Overall it appears that the Petroleum Review totals for these two years are probably understated by a significant margin .
Thus , the absolute value of the base decline rate may have been higher than we thought .
So far , the overall rising trend in capacity is intact , implying the accelerating trend in declines might be intact also .
However , further work is required to confirm that reliably .
Which is where , hopefully , a few of you come in .
If you see issues or errors in the graphs above , or the lists at the Wiki page , here 's what you do .
Above and to the right of each table in the page is a little [ Edit ] link :
If you click on that you get an edit window into the table content .
I 've scrolled down to the section on Norway 's Grane field , currently underresearched :
A quick Google search finds this article , which adds the information that the crude is heavy .
So let 's add the new content :
Now save the page , and the new content shows up :
Hopefully , that gives you a little flavor .

UNIXの代表的なプログラムにcatがある 。Wikipediaから引用すると、
catはUNIXの標準コマンドであり、ファイルを連結させたり表示したりするのに用いる。catは連結することを意味する「catenate」の略である。

UNIXファンの間では、cat(1)はユーザインターフェースデザインのよい手本とされている。catはファイルの内容に空白やヘッダのような余分なものを一切付加せずに提供してくれるためであり、またテキストファイルのみならずどんな種類のデータに対しても正しく動作するためだ。
UNIX嫌いの間では、cat(1)は悪いユーザインターフェースデザインの正統な手本とされている。それはこの悲しげなまでにわかりづらい名称のためである。catは、ファイルの連結（concatenate）に使うよりもむしろ標準出力への出力に使われることの方がはるかに多い。後者の使用法に対するcatという名称は、ちょうどLISPのcdrのように非直感的である。
悪いユーザインタフェースの見本にもなるということだが、本来は指定されたファイルを読み込んで、順に標準出力に出力することで、「catenate」するという単純なプログラムだ。ツールボックススタイル( KISSの原則)を体現していて、名前だってわかりにくいとは思わない*1。

7 Janet Jackson
In 1986 , everything was right with the Jacksons : Michael was a year away from releasing Bad and sister Janet had just released the album Control .
She also happened to be incredibly good looking , and with song titles such as " The Pleasure Principle , " " Control " and " Nasty , " the album seemed to suggest Janet was some kind of child - prodigy dominatrix .
She insisted we call her Ms. Jackson , and as a nation we said , " Yes , ma'am ... you 're over 18 , right ? "

In 1993 , Janet peaked when she appeared topless on the cover of Rolling Stone , looking phenomenal .
In 2000 , the photo was named the " Most Popular Cover Ever , " proving the theory that breasts are something of a crowd pleaser .
And , just in case anyone had n't seen her sweater puppies the first time around , Janet would give America another opportunity in 2004 , this time in full - color .
Keep in mind she was close to 40 during that infamous Super Bowl performance .
No matter how old you are , when you 're getting to second base on national TV with hands that will soon squeeze the chestaloupes of Scarlett Johannson , Cameron Diaz and Jessica Biel , you are hot .
But a mere two years after that Super Bowl performance , Janet Jackson looked like she'd be making her next Super Bowl appearance as an offensive lineman .

Of course , our real reason for tracking these changes is to make us feel better about ourselves , since Janet seemed determined to assume the shape of the average Cracked staffer .
But when it came time to do a movie ( Tyler Perry 's Why Did I Get Married ? ) , she snapped her fingers and magically looked like this again .
How do they do that ?
ExxonMobil ’s projections are based on studies from reputable sources ( the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy ) , and the company has factored in slightly higher automotive efficiency standards — 30 miles to the gallon , rather than the current 27.5 .
But it ’s clear that when ExxonMobil executives look ahead to the next quarter century , they see a world that operates much as it did in the previous quarter century .
Given ExxonMobil ’s profits over the past few years , that ’s a pretty comforting view , and one that does n’t encourage any radical change of course , no matter what people like Patricia Daly say .
Climate change “ is just another risk that we have to understand as best we can and respond to in a way that protects the shareholder value , ” Tillerson would explain at the annual meeting .
“ So I do n’t think it introduces any greater or lesser threat than a whole host of other risks that we manage day to day and that have been part of this business for decades . ”
The fact that a corporation can preoccupy itself with quantifying the financial risks of a global catastrophe while ignoring the human and environmental ones is what inspired a tall , courtly Boston Brahmin named Robert A. G. Monks to begin advancing the notion that shareholders use the power of their proxies to influence corporate behavior .
Monks , who was a founding trustee of the Federal Employees Retirement System during Ronald Reagan ’s administration , responds to Tillerson like this :
“ The notion that a company that creates a problem is exempted from trying to find a solution to that problem is like being in the elephant business but not having anyone in charge of going behind the elephant and cleaning up after it . ”
The son of an Episcopal clergyman , Monks has been a partner in a corporate law firm , a venture capitalist , a oil - and - gas - company executive and a director of 10 publicly held companies .
He is , in other words , a consummate insider , or would be one , had he not happened to stop by the Androscoggin River in 1972 while campaigning — unsuccessfully , as it turned out — as a Republican candidate for a United States Senate seat in Maine .
The surface of the river glistened with a six - foot layer of foam , the effluent of the nearby International Paper Company .
For Monks , the foam came to symbolize all that was wrong with the way the modern corporation functions in society : none of its owners feel responsible for its actions .
The dispersal of ownership through millions of shares , he argues , is the institutional equivalent of the tragedy of the commons : each shareholder is happy to reap his share of the profits , but no one feels responsible for the behavior of the company as a whole .
His solution has been to try to make corporate boards more accountable by encouraging them to have directors who are truly independent , rather than being the friends and associates of management .
He has done this in a variety of ways — by writing books , by pressuring companies from within and by founding various corporate governance institutions , among them Institutional Shareholder Services and the Corporate Library .
In 1991 , he went so far as to run for the Sears board himself , a move that inspired Sears to spend $ 5.5 million to defeat him .
Sears was n’t the first company whose board Monks nominated himself for — he also tried nominating himself for the Exxon board in 1987 .
The company did n’t respond to his letter , and he chose not to pursue the matter .
Yet as time went on , Monks came to believe that Exxon was “ the symbol of a reality that nobody in the reformist area wanted to deal with ” — a company that performed exceptionally well as a business and an investment yet failed to take responsibility for its greenhouse - gas emissions , which Monks sees as the 21st - century equivalent of foam on the river .
Monks ’s solution was to submit a resolution that would separate the positions of chairman and C.E.O. , something that has been done at BP and Royal Dutch / Shell .
Monks argues that an independent chairman would be able to raise questions about ExxonMobil ’s position in the world that will never otherwise be asked , much less answered , questions like , “ Why is our company the one with the bull ’s - eye on its chest ? ”
As it stands , he says : “ The board is just there as the parsley on the fish .
You ’re really talking about , when you have a combined chairman and C.E.O. , a dictatorship . ”
Monks has submitted his proposal six times , but it has gone before the shareholders only four times , having been thrown out the other two by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Nonetheless , it has gotten a greater percentage of the vote each time it has been on the proxy ballot , he says , up to about 35 percent last year .
PRAGUE , Sept. 26 — To understand just how divisive the proposed American missile - defense radar system is here , talk to Josef Rihak .
Better still , talk to both of them .
Josef Rihak , 48 , the father of Josef , 18 , is a member of the Czech Parliament who in 2003 voted to send troops to Iraq .
He is now also mayor of Pribram and coordinator of the League of Mayors Against the Radar , a 35 - member group opposed to the installation of the system on Czech soil .
“ I have not experienced a topic that would divide the Czech population as much as this radar , ” Mr. Rihak said from Pribram , an hour ’s drive south of Prague past yellow fields of rapeseed .
He needs to look no further than his dinner table for evidence .
“ I think my son is the biggest ally of the radar in the entire Czech Republic , ” he said with a smile .
The younger Mr. Rihak looks both in attire and musculature as if he just stepped out of the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog .
He plays American football for the junior national team and would welcome United States troops , especially if they were willing to teach him the finer points of playing defensive end .
“ I want American people in our country , ” he said .

The award to Iran for the construction of a 160 - megawatt power plant in Baghdad 's Sadr City has alarmed the U.S. military in Iraq , Middle East Newsline reported .
Military sources said the U.S. - led coalition was concerned that Iran could use the $ 150 million project to significantly expand its intelligence and military presence in Iraq .
Iran has sought to dominate Iraq 's Shi'ite sector .
Teheran has agreed to provide cheap electricity from its own grid to Shi'ite areas of southern Iraq .
Iran has also offered to build a large power plant without cost to the Baghdad government between the Shi'ite cities of Karbala and Najaf .
The Chinese power plant would be located in the Iraqi province of Wasit .
Officials said the 1,300 megawatt facility , awarded to China 's Shanghai Heavy Industry , would cost $ 940 million .

Lives saved as highways get cable SPRINGFIELD , Mo. 
A relatively low - cost safety device — steel cable strung in highway medians — is proving phenomenally effective at saving lives , perhaps more so than steel - beam or concrete barriers .
Steel - beam , concrete and cable barriers all cut down on accidents in which cars cross over into oncoming traffic .
Cable , however , also cuts down on the number of rebound accidents , in which a vehicle hits a barrier and bounces back into traffic .
North Carolina , Missouri , Texas , Washington , California and Utah are among the nation 's leaders in installing median guard cable , according to the Texas Transportation Institute , a research body at Texas A&M University .
The institute says 27 other states are following suit , including Florida , Wisconsin , Maine and Idaho .
Because cable barriers are considerably cheaper , states can install them in medians where motorists had no protection before .
Cable costs about 30 % less than steel and 50 % less than concrete , says Dave Olson , research manager at the Washington State Department of Transportation .
The low cost and high success rate impressed Utah highway officials .
" Two years ago , we heard about guard cables at a traffic - safety conference , " says Nile Easton , spokesman for the Utah Department of Transportation .
" In a 9 - mile test area , we 've gone from having 12 crossover fatalities ( in a two - year period ) to none since we put guard cables in . "
Kristina Bernskoetter of Columbia , Mo. , says newly installed median guard cables may have saved her life .
Shortly before Christmas last year , she hit a patch of ice on Interstate 70 .
Her Jeep slid out of control into the median and toward oncoming traffic .
" I remember thinking , ' I 'm going to cross into the other lanes , ' " Bernskoetter says .
" I did n't even notice the guard cables .
I did a quick prayer kind of thing before I hit . "
Her Jeep skidded into the steel cable , which snagged the vehicle , cushioned the blow and stopped her from sliding into the oncoming lanes .
She also did n't bounce back into speeding traffic on her side of the highway .
She says she drove away uninjured .
Brian Chandler , a traffic - safety engineer with the Missouri Department of Transportation , says the department recently completed installing 179 miles of median guard cable on I - 70 at a cost of $ 20.5 million .
By the time cable projects are completed on I - 44 and I - 55 , the department will have spent about $ 50 million — all of it from federal highway safety funds that require no matching money from the state .
Most important , Chandler says , median guard cables work .
" When a vehicle hits a concrete barrier , it usually bounces back into traffic , " he says .
" But when you hit the guard cable , it gives 10 to 12 feet and helps absorb the force .
The posts that hold the cable up are designed to break away .
The cable stretches and wraps up the car in it . "
Highway traffic engineers also say that because the cables give when hit , the G - forces on a driver involved in a guard - cable collision are much less than with a fixed barrier , Olson said .
According to the Missouri DOT , I - 70 had 24 median crossover fatalities in 2002 .
In 2005 , after guard cables had been installed , there were only six — four of which happened in spots with no guard cables .
North Carolina was the first to embrace guard cables on all of its interstate highways .
Brian Murphy , traffic - safety engineer with the North Carolina Department of Transportation , says his state has installed about 600 miles of cables .
" We started our big push statewide in 1998 , and we have seen our crossover fatality rates go down 75 % , " he says .
Jim McDonnell , associate program director of engineering for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials , says , " These things do save lives , and more states are putting them in place , where appropriate . "
Dustin Terpening , spokesman for the Washington State Department of Transportation , says his state began installing guard cables in 2000 and will soon have 140 miles installed on interstate highways .
" Cable barrier successfully restrained 95 % of the vehicles that hit it , " he says .
" With cable barrier , you 're far less likely to have a fatality or serious injury , " he says .
" We just ca n't get it in fast enough . "

LAHORE
Pakistan ’s state of emergency declared on 3 November has aggravated the situation for some 100 or so people deemed “ missing ” in the country , according to rights groups .
In the days that led up to the emergency , a full bench of Pakistan 's Supreme Court , headed by the former chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , while hearing a petition on the behalf of 198 people filed early in 2007 by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan ( HRCP ) and 41 other petitions , ordered the government to find and release all the missing people .
In hearings over many months , the court concluded that the “ disappeared ” people were in the custody of intelligence agencies and 99 were ordered to be released .
However , after the announcement of emergency rule by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , many Supreme Court judges have been replaced and there are fears that controversial cases , such as the victims of enforced disappearances , will be buried .
" New , post - emergency laws permit the government to give a cover of legitimacy to disappearances , " said Asma Jahangir , the HRCP chairwoman , in a statement issued from her Lahore home , where she is now under detention .
Setback
For the families of missing persons , the emergency comes as a devastating setback , snuffing out the flicker of hope that had been lit with the tough stance taken by the court .
" We had been optimistic , but now all we can do is wait , " Amina Masood , 35 , told IRIN .
Since 2005 , she has led a brave struggle on behalf of Pakistan 's “ disappeared ” people ; forming a group linking over 150 victims ’ families .
Amina 's own husband , Masood Janjua , who ran a computer college in Rawalpindi , “ disappeared ” in July 2005 while on his way to catch a bus to Peshawar .
His family has heard nothing of him since .
" This waiting is terrible .
I have attempted throughout to keep hope alive for my three children , " said Amina .
Until 2002 , the issue of “ enforced disappearances ” was unknown in Pakistan ; a problem that initially surfaced as part of the country ’s “ war on terror ” , during which dozens of people were picked up by intelligence agencies and taken to secret detention centres .
In direct violation of the law , no records were kept of their arrest , the charges against them , or their whereabouts .
But as the years went by , it was soon revealed that the same tactics were now being employed against many others , most of whom had no connections to militancy at all , say activists .
" Most of those held are from Balochistan Province and are secular - minded young persons , rather than zealots , " Jahangir said .

Dr Safdar Sarki , pictured here with his children , has been missing since February 2006
Intellectuals
The “ disappeared ” from Balochistan , and Sindh which borders it , were in a number of cases leading writers , intellectuals or poets .
They include Dr Safdar Sarki , a well - known Sindhi writer and a US national , who was taken from his flat in the southern port city of Karachi in February 2006 .
Nothing is known of his whereabouts today .
Another victim , Munir Mengal , managing director of a Baloch TV channel , was picked up in April 2006 .
Following the case in the Supreme Court , he was “ found ” a few months ago , but has since again been detained .
Human rights groups point out that men like the middle - aged Sarki had spoken out for the rights of the people of Sindh , but had never been involved in any unlawful activity .
The issue of “ disappeared ” people was taken up internationally only after 2006 , as it became clear hundreds were missing .
" It was only as data was collected that the extent of the problem became apparent , ” said I.A. Rehman , HRCP ’s director .
Hearing cancelled
Amnesty International , which has been campaigning to draw attention to Pakistan 's “ disappeared ” people , said that a hearing of the cases of 485 victims scheduled for 13 November had not taken place as a consequence of the emergency rule .
Meanwhile , the knowledge that at least some of the “ disappeared ” people may have been severely tortured only adds to the families ’ suffering .
Adeela Munir , whose 27 - year - old brother , Imran Munir , went missing from Islamabad in July 2006 , described the terrible state she found him in when she was recently allowed to see him .
" He was hallucinating , disoriented and weak , " she said , and the court , which had been told that Imran had been convicted on a spying charge , ordered he be moved to hospital .
His lawyers , including Asma Jahangir , believe he was victimised as he had been involved in a love affair with a female relative of an intelligence agency official .
But now , with the court bench disbanded , it remains unclear what the fate of those still missing will be , or how long families will need to wait for their fathers , husbands , brothers or sons - or indeed , if they will ever come back at all .

Fox pushes debunked info in ' Osama ' editorial cartoon David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday September 17 , 2007
Print This Email This Fox News Channel 's Fox and Friends morning program introduced a segment about MoveOn.org 's controversial ad in the The New York Times by running a pointed -- and inaccurate -- editorial cartoon from the Sunday edition of the New York Post .
The cartoon , by Sean Delonas , depicts an ad-toting Osama Bin Laden , asking for " the same discount you gave MoveOn.org , " from the Times advertising sales desk .
The line refers to a complaint from Rudy Giuliani , who purchased an ad rebutting MoveOn's in the paper on Friday , suggesting that the liberal group got a sweetheart deal by paying only $ 65,000 for a full page at standby rates .
Advertising Age , however , reports that the MoveOn received no discount .
" [ A ] t the end of the week , when he took out an ad in the Times advocating the opposite point of view , Giuliani paid the going rate for a full - page standby ad in the Times : $ 65,000 . "
" Catherine Mathis , a spokeswoman for the Times , said the paper does not set or adjust rates based on the political content of any ads , " Advertising Age reported .
Later in the program , conservative Newsday columnist Jim Pinkerton clashed with Fox News contributor Ellen Ratner , trading barbs about the MoveOn and Giuliani ads .
Conceding that MoveOn 's original ad , which read " GENERAL PETRAEUS OR GENERAL BETRAY US ? , " was not " necessarily sensible " for MoveOn " in terms of moving the middle of this country , " Ratner suggested that the same went for Giuliani 's response ad , published last Friday in the Times , which criticized the online group , as well as Sen.
Hillary Clinton , for her questioning of Petraeus during the general 's testimony before Congress .
" I do n't think it accomplished what it was supposed to do , " Ratner added .
" It was interesting , " Pinkerton shot back , " that Ellen tries to conflate MoveOn , which trashes America and savages the US military ; and Rudy Giuliani , who is running a political campaign ; and tries to make those sound like the same thing . "
" MoveOn trashed the US military in wartime , " he continued .
" That 's kind of akin to treason ... any Democrat with any brains would be the first to denounce them , even John Kerry can do that -- although Hillary Clinton can't . "
Referring to Giuliani's response ad , which cited Sen. Clinton 's quote that Petraeus ' report required " [t ] he willing suspension of disbelief , " Ratner asserted that the ad " took Sen .
Clinton 's words completely out of context ... and made her look like a jerk ... "
" True or false , " Pinkerton bit back , " Hillary Clinton said to Petraeus , 'it requires a willing suspension of disbelief to believe you ? "
After Ratner insisted that Clinton stood by Petraeus when it came to his honorable military service , Pinkerton interrupted , saying " I support you , Gen. Petraeus -- but you 're lying . "
" Hillary voted for the war , " he said later , " so she 's gotta kinda keep on to that , but then she wants to play to the MoveOn base by trashing the war and trashing Petraeus . "

The international prototype was forged in the 1880s .
Enlarge Image
To the eye it's an unremarkable object but " Le Grand K " or the international prototype , as it is known , has global significance .
The cylinder of platinum and iridium is the only object known to scientists that has a mass of exactly 1kg .
It is the reference object from which the unit of mass is derived .
Hence , all objects measured in kilograms , whether a bag of sugar or an aircraft carrier , are defined by Le Grand K's mass .
The object , along with a clutch of copycat cylinders , was forged in London in the 1880s .
Le Grand K was kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ( BIPM ) in Sevres in France and the others were distributed around the metric world - Britain holds Kilogram 18 for example - to act as the arbiters of mass .
Every few years the siblings were taken to Paris to be measured against Le Grand K to make sure that everyone was singing from the same song sheet .
Tiny drift
But around 30 years ago scientists discovered a problem .
The international prototype was no longer the same mass as the other cylinders .
And , since then , the drift has continued .
The drift is less than the mass of a grain of sugar
" Relative to the average of all the sister copies made over the last 100 years you could say it is losing [ mass ] , but by definition it can't , " explained Dr Richard Steiner of the National Institute of Standards and technology ( NIST ) in the US .
" So the others are really gaining mass . "
The fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion , less than a single grain in a bag of sugar .
But whilst it is tiny , the change can have important consequences , particularly for scientists who require precise definitions of the kilogram for other measurements such as voltage .
However , as they are all measured against each other , knowing which are losing mass or gaining it is an open question .
" We just do n't know , " admitted Dr Steiner .
If they have shed mass , one suggestion is that it is because atmospheric pollutants , incorporated into the cylinders when they were forged , have escaped .
If they have gained mass it could be because the platinum based ingots have absorbed mercury from the atmosphere or hydrogen from the solvents used to clean the ingots .
The drift of Le Grand K relative to the others could be explained by the fact that it is taken out of its vault and handled less often than the other objects .
The bottom line is that the cylinders have now passed their useful shelf life as the ultimate reference for the kilogram and as a result , scientists around the world have been working on new ways to define the kilogram .
Balancing force
Next week the custodians of measurement , the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) , will meet in Paris and one of the things on their agenda will be to assess progress in the field .
The watt balance was originally designed to measure the ampere
Two methods are currently being considered to do away with Le Grand K .
Both try to characterise mass in terms of a constant of nature , the way all other basic scientific units are now defined .
For example , the metre was originally measured against a brass bar but is now defined as the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in a precise fraction of a second .
One approach is to try to define the kilogram using a piece of apparatus known as the watt balance , which amongst other things can be used to determine the quantum mechanical constant known as the Planck constant .
" The Planck constant is the constant that relates energy to frequency in a photon , " said Dr Seton Bennett , Deputy Director at the National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) in the UK .
" It is related to a lot of other constants so it crops up all over the place in physics and in particular in the equations that describe the operations of the watt balance . "
This complex piece of machinery , invented at NPL , consists of a vacuum - enclosed balance arm , an ultra powerful magnet and a replica kilogram .
" What you are doing in the watt balance is balancing a current passing through a [ wire ] coil in a magnetic field against the force of gravity on the kilogram . "
Precise measure
This is achieved by lowering the coil into the magnetic field , creating a downward electromagnetic force .
The NIST watt balance uses superconducting magnets
By adjusting the current running through the coil the force can be made to exactly balance gravity 's pull on the kilogram .
A second experiment is then conducted to measure the strength of the magnetic field .
" When you combine those experiments , the equations give you a result that includes the Planck constant , " said Dr Bennett .
The constant is therefore intimately linked to the mass of a kilogram .
By rearranging equations the constant can be used to determine the mass of the kilogram .
" We are looking for experimental results that are 50 parts per billion or better , " said Dr Bennett .
This accuracy is equivalent to the drift measured between the standard kilograms used today .
" If we can do better than that we can come up with a value that we know is right and will stand for all time . "
Dr Steiner at NIST has so far managed to measure the Planck constant with uncertainties of 36 parts in a billion .
But their value is different from that measured at NPL , leaving scientists on both sides of the Atlantic scratching their heads .
Golden globe
However , there is another , perhaps more intuitive , approach .
The silicon is enriched in centrifuges
" We want to redefine the kilogram on the basis of the mass of an atom , " said Professor Peter Becker of the national metrology institute ( PTB ) in Germany .
" We want to try to count the atoms in one kilogram of a crystal . "
The project is named after the Avogadro Constant - the total number of carbon - 12 atoms in 12 grams ( 0.012 kg ) .
But instead of carbon - 12 , Professor Becker 's crystal of choice is a sphere of silicon , about the size of a grapefruit .
" We measure the volume of the sphere and we measure the volume of an atom of the silicon .
" So when you divide the silicon sphere by the volume of the atoms you get the number of the atoms - this is very simple . "
Except that it is not simple .
There may be 50 septillion ( trillion trillion ) atoms in the sphere and early work showed that they could only be measured with accuracies of a few parts in 10 million - not down to the crucial parts per billion .
The problem is that silicon occurs as isotopes - different forms of the same element with different masses .
To get round this , Professor Becker has commissioned Russian scientists to grow ultrapure 1 kg spheres of silicon made up of 99.99 % of one particular type of atom , known as silicon 28 .
The material for these spheres costs 1 million Euros ( £ 0.7 m ) .
" This gives us the chance to derive a result with an acceptable level of uncertainty , " he said .
History repeats
At the moment it looks like the watt balance method has the edge over atom counting and may therefore become the method used to redefine the kilogram , Professor Becker admitted .
But he does not think his work is in vain .
" If the decision is in favour of the watt balance we can check the work independently , " said Professor Becker .
Dr Bennett is of the same opinion .
" The two experiments are related so we have to get them to agree , " said Dr Bennett .
But that will be just the start of the redefinition .
In the world of measurement and standards everything must be precise and replicable .
" There will also have to be some standard instrument , whether a watt balance or something else , which will be used to monitor the kilogram or we 're just back in the same situation , " said Dr Bennett .
" I think the reality will be that there will still be the kilogram in Paris for years to come . "

In February , 2001 , I saw the end of the credit - filled boom , as the stock market went bust , and predicted recessionary times , which soon followed .
It seems , however , that Washington , D.C. , is one great big toga party , and if it is true that Blutarsky of " Animal House " became Senator Blutarsky ( as the film 's credits tell us at the end ) , perhaps that provides an explanation for the outright foolishness that has gone on with the Federal Reserve System for more than a decade .
However , the Fed and the rest of the D.C. crowd really did not need the hard - partying Blutarsky to set policy , as it seems that Alan Greenspan and his successor , Ben Bernanke , were willing to shed their dark suits and starched collars for a toga made of bed sheets ( or maybe some strips of old stock tickertape ) .
Certainly , the policies that these two men and their agents have foisted upon this country since the heyday of the Bill Clinton Administration fall into that of one big party with the Fed spiking the punchbowl with easy credit .
It is hard to know just how far the current meltdown in the stock market and housing market will go , but we can say unequivocally that it will not be business as usual , or business that has been usual for the last many years .
We can forget about a 14,000 - point Dow for a long while , as economic law — something that politicians have assured us exists only in the minds of " kooks " — reasserts itself , and the results are not pretty .
In this piece , I will briefly point out some of the more egregious things the Fed and the financial system have done and why this monetary charade has been able to go on as long as it has .
Before doing that , however , I will deal with one important aspect of economic theory : the relationship of production to consumption .
One of the continuing debates throughout modern economic history ( modern meaning the past 300 years or so ) has been that of the relationship between production and consumption , the source of what we call Say 's Law .
This is what separated Say and his allies from Thomas Malthus , and the Classical economists from Marx and his followers .
The debate went on into the 20th Century , with the Austrians taking one side , and the Keynesians the other .
The basics of the debate are this :
One side ( Say and those who followed him ) says that consumption and production are directly related , and that consumption flows from production , or " supply creates its own demand . "
The source of one 's consumption , they argue , is one 's production .
On larger scales , economies that produce much also are going to be societies that engage in the most consumption of goods .
The ramifications of this set of beliefs are important , for if one holds to Say 's Law ( as do the Austrians ) , one is acknowledging the efficacy of production and also the acknowledgement that in a market economy markets generally will work efficiently , as long as governments do not interfere with them .
Adherents to Say's Law do not disagree that there can be economic downturns ; indeed , Say begins his famous Book I , Chapter XV , describing what we would call " recession " conditions .
( I make this point because many critics of Say have accused those who hold to Say 's Law of believing that recessions are impossible .
Socialists are fond of saying that " the Great Depression discredited Say 's Law , " which is simply not true . )
On the other side , beginning with Bernard de Mandeville and his 1714 " The Fable of the Bees , " it is held that because production of goods is not a guarantee that they will be sold ( which in itself is true ) , therefore consumption must always be encouraged or economies will quickly stagnate into periods of " general overproduction " and fall into ruin .
To combat this problem , they have argued , people should be encouraged to spend and spend and spend , as saving money ultimately means unsold goods , and unsold goods mean overproduction , and overproduction means layoffs and mass unemployment .
Karl Marx and others systematized this viewpoint to make the case that free - market economies are inherently unstable and if governments do not intervene to bring about consumption , the capitalist economies will implode .
For Marx , the source of underconsumption was the profit - taking by capitalists , who had no right to that product which " rightfully " belonged to the " proletariat . "
John Maynard Keynes , in his 1936 General Theory , also " discredited " Say 's Law and held elsewhere that the creation of new credit by monetary authorities could " turn stones into bread . "
The idea to Keynes was that private investment spending was unstable , and that that very instability , when coupled with the multiplier effect of investment spending , meant that a market economy was vulnerable to quick downward surges of general underconsumption and overproduction that would quickly lead to the dreaded " liquidity trap . "
Thus , his view — and the view that has dominated government economic policies for at least a century — is that government must act to prop up consumption through various actions of monetary creation through central banks , as well as massive spending on public works and transference of income from the non-consuming rich to the consuming poor .
The idea was that wealthy people were unlikely to spend all of their income , displaying an unhealthy " propensity " to save , which meant that their spending habits would ensure general underconsumption unless some of that money was taken via taxation and given to those entities — individuals and government agencies — that would " responsibly " spend and keep the economy afloat .
Just put money into the " hands of the people , " they will spend thusly , and from that spending , production will automatically occur , just as the Golden Calf allegedly rose from Aaron 's fire .
All of this hit me hard when I briefly chatted with an official from the Federal Reserve System at a recent economics conference in Seattle .
When I spoke to him about the various bubbles the Fed has created over the past decade , he did not deny that point .
Instead , he insisted that the bubbles were good , since unemployment is relatively low .
My answer ( that he admittedly said was hard to argue against ) was that he was trying to tell me that without these bubbles , we would be worse off , economically speaking , something that is incredulous on its face .
While the Fed has been advocating credit for nearly anyone with a pulse , in reality it has been advocating the old Keynesian position that it must constantly create new " money " in order to facilitate commerce , and the Fed has not disappointed in that arena .
However , despite the assurances of various Fed spokespersons , in reality a bubble is called a bubble precisely because it cannot be sustained over time .
The reason that the Fed has been able to get away with its monetary shenanigans for more than a decade has been the historical accident of the US dollar being a major world currency , and the rise of the Asian economies .
The Asian central banks have been willing to hold dollars at levels well out of proportion to their real value , and Americans have benefited — temporarily , I will add — by the fact that the Chinese and others will accept US dollars for their relatively inexpensive goods .
Indeed , one can say that in one way , the Fed has succeeded ( temporarily ) in giving us the ultimate Keynesian economy , one in which the US government prints dollars and the Chinese accept them without question .
All one has to do is find a way to get dollars in one 's hands — the lending and credit processes seeming to do the trick — and then sit back and consume , consume , consume !
Thus , whether it be the refinancing of one 's home ( again and again ) to put extra cash in one 's pocket , beating the latest stock bubble , or " flipping " a house , there has seemed to be no end to government schemes to direct money to people to enable them to live beyond their means .
However , Say's Law is not dead ; indeed , the markets now seem to be catching on to the reality that Austrians and their fellow travelers have recognized for years , and that is that a policy of easy money cannot sustain itself .
Someone has to pay the piper , and he has shown up at the door .
Americans my age and older have been down this road before .
Following World War II , the dollar truly was the world 's reserve currency , and it was considered to be " good as gold . "
Bolstered by the dogma of the " New Economics , " which was Keynesian garb in American academic robes , promoted by the high priests of US economists , Paul Samuelson and Walter P. Heller , the US government went on a spending orgy .
( Compared to the government spending habits today , the " orgy " of the 1960s was little more than a tea party . )
By 1971 , however , it was clear that the dollar by itself was empty , and when President Richard Nixon closed the Bretton Woods " gold window " on August 15 , 1971 , it was the official beginning of the stagflation that dominated the US economy for a decade .
Only when the dollar was rejected by others was the folly of Washington 's endless economic toga parties fully exposed .
While I was roundly critical of the Clinton Administration for its irresponsible economic policies , nothing compares to what the George W. Bush Administration has given us , making Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford , and Jimmy Carter look responsible in comparison .
The entire time this administration has been in office , it has given us the " economy by bubble . "
From the housing bubble to the latest brief upward explosion in the stock market , we are now faced with the hard reality that there is no place for this huge wad of cash to go .
It is not the case that we have a " liquidity problem " because there is no money to lend ; we have a " liquidity problem " because the outlets for borrowed money have shrunk drastically .
Furthermore , the Chinese are now beginning to realize that the dollar is not what it used to be , and bellicose talk from Washington is wiping out whatever good will has been present between China and the United States .
The war in Iraq has turned that country into a charnel house , oil and gasoline prices have drastically increased , thanks to the war and government policies , and people are finding that Washington has nothing to offer , as if it ever did .
War abroad and fiscal and monetary irresponsibility at home gave us the infamous end of Bretton Woods 36 years ago .
( I am not endorsing the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 , which Henry Hazlitt knew from the beginning to be terribly flawed , but in retrospect , it was still superior to the current monetary madness that is the Federal Reserve . )
It now seems that the authorities have learned nothing from the financial disasters of four decades ago : they are determined to make the rest of us repeat them .
Granted , many of us have benefited from this era of " easy money , " but that is going to change .
Indeed , the party is over , the lights are out , and I do n't know when they will be turned on again .
Please leave your togas at the door .

A few hours ago the ICFP Programming Contest 2007 ended , and the team Funktion im Kopf der Mensch participated again , this year slightly demotivated by the fact that the organizer ’s main goal seems to have been to show off how smart they are instead of letting the participant practice their creative skills .
As always we were using Objective Caml for most of our programming work .
O’Caml has always had some annoying sides , but this year I ran into so many of them that I got seriously pissed off , and will now have to investigate other options .
For us , O’Caml ’s main attraction are its type system , which , when used correctly , makes it surprisingly hard to write incorrect code , and its performance .
O’Caml ’s big weakness is its standard library .
To be frank , it sucks , big time .
I ’ll present the issues I ran into during the past three days , and I ’ll compare the way O’Caml handles those things with Common Lisp , because in the areas I ’ll discuss here , it is a good example of how to do it right .
Note that I ’m not saying that Common Lisp does everything else better .
There is a reason why we ’ve been using O’Caml , after all .
Let ’s start with numbers .
Say we need a function which adds the number 3 to a given number .
Should be a trivial task , right ?
Indeed , in Lisp it is :
( defun add - 3 ( x )
(+ x 3 ) )
Let ’s see if it works :
[ 2 ] > ( add - 3 0 )
3
[ 3 ] > ( add - 3 4.5 )
7.5
[ 4 ] > ( add - 3 3/2 )
9/2
[ 6 ] > ( add - 3 ( sqrt - 4 ) )
# C( 3 2 )
Great – we can give the function any kind of number , and it adds 3 .
How do we implement this in O’Caml ?
Well , first we ’ll have to decide which kind of number we want to operate on , because , you see , you ca n’t mix different kinds of numbers .
Ok , let ’s concentrate on integers .
There ca n’t be more than one kind of them , can there ?
Well , it turns out there are several .
There ’s “ int ” , “ int32 ” , “ int64 ” , “ nativeint ” and “ big_int ” .
Here ’s the code for all of them :
let add_3_int x =
x + 3
let add_3_int32 x =
Int32.add x ( Int32.of_int 3 )
let add_3_int64 x =
Int64.add x ( Int64.of_int 3 )
let add_3_nativeint x =
Nativeint.add x ( Nativeint.of_int 3 )
let add_3 _big_int x =
add_big_int x ( big_int_of_int 3 )
And those are just for the integer types !
How ridiculous can it get ?
Next issue : Arrays .
Let ’s say we need a function which returns an array with all the elements of the array it was given in reverse order , except for the last one .
A triviality in Lisp :
( defun chop-rev ( seq )
( reverse ( subseq seq 0 ( 1- ( length seq ) ) ) ) )
Let ’s see if it works :
[ 10 ] > ( chop-rev # ( " abc " " 123 " " xyz " ) )
# ( " 123 " " abc " )
[ 9 ] > ( chop-rev " abcdef " )
" edcba "
Notice that in Lisp string are arrays , too .
As an added bonus , our function even works on lists :
[ 8 ] > ( chop-rev ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) )
( 3 2 1 )
What can O’Caml do for us ?
Again , we first need to ask :
Which kind of arrays are we talking about ?
There ’s the built - in array type “ array ” .
Then there ’s strings , which O’Caml does n’t treat as arrays , for no apparent reason .
There ’s another type called “ Buffer ” , which is really just a string that can grow , but is , of course , completely incompatible with “ real ” strings .
There ’s also something called “ bigarray ” , which is an array that can be big .
In any other language such a data structure would be obsolete , because standard arrays would n’t have any size limits .
Not so in O’Caml !
You can enjoy all the comforts of the built in array type , but only if you do n’t need to put in more than about 4 million elements ( on 32 bit systems ) , unless you work with floats , in which case you ’re limited to 2 million elements .
Perhaps I should also mention that strings are limited to 16 million characters , but they forgot to implement big strings .
What a joy !
It was in many ways a typical film - school scene .
On a recent hot afternoon , a group of eager young students crowded around a big - time director , asking for advice about backlighting and the best way to establish a scene of anarchy .
But the students quizzing David O. Russell , the director of “ Three Kings ” and “ I ♥ Huckabees , ” were n’t enrolled at New York University or Columbia or any other august institution .
They were from the Ghetto Film School , an unaccredited training program in the South Bronx that operates in the summer and on weekends during the school year .
It gives teenagers a rigorous introduction to filmmaking and , despite the humblest of origins , has built up an enviable roster of Hollywood donors and supporters inside city government .
Since early July the school ’s 19 students , ranging in age from 14 to 20 , have been studying the likes of Antonioni and John Huston , running through camera exercises and working on six - minute films in two cramped classrooms in a city recreation center in Mott Haven , where the ceilings periodically thump with the sounds of the weight room directly overhead .
The school ’s ambitions , however , reach far beyond the ghetto .
Tonight the students ’ work will be shown at Lincoln Center .
And the school is opening a spacious annex near its original location , financed by a $ 1.2 million grant from the city .
Ghetto Film is also working with the Department of Education to develop a cinema - themed high school that would join the elite ranks of specialized schools like the La Guardia High School for the arts .
It is astounding how quickly you get used to technological change .
For instance , within the space of 18 months , I have gone from regarding wireless broadband as an outlandish novelty to considering it my God - given right .
Cables appal me - they belong to the stone age - alongside electric typewriters , fax machines , video recorders , pagers and the plough .
But there is one device I just can't get comfortable with - my mobile phone .
I 'm not some medieval yeoman , infuriated by mobiles full stop .
Just this particular model .
The trouble started the afternoon someone from Orange rang me up to say , " Hey , valued customer - do you want a free phone ? "
At first I was n't interested , but he went on and on about how popular and great the Samsung E900 was , then promised me free texts at weekends for life if I said yes .
So I gave in .
The phone arrived the next day and immediately began elbowing me in the ribs .
It seems to have been designed specifically to irritate anyone with a mind .
It starts gently - a pinch of annoyance here , an inconvenience there - but before long the steady drip , drip , drip of minor frustrations begins to affect your quality of life , like a mouth ulcer , or a stone in your boot , or the lingering memory of love gone sour .
The menu system is a confusing mangle of branching dead ends .
It has touch - sensitive buttons that either refuse to work , or leap into action if you breathe on them .
One such button also terminates calls , so it is easy to cut people off merely by holding the phone against your ear to hear them .
It has no apparent " silent " mode , and when you set it to vibrate , it buzzes like a hornet in a matchbox .
It is lumbered with a bewildering array of unnecessary " features " aimed at idiots , including a mode that scans each text message and turns some of the words into tiny ani- mations , so if someone texts to say they have just run over your child in their car , the word " car " is replaced by a wacky cartoon vehicle putt - putting onto the screen .
There is also a crap built - in game in which you play a rabbit ( " Step into the role of Bobby Carrot - the new star of cute , mind - cracking carrot action ! " ) .
When you dial a number , you have a choice of seeing said number in a gigantic , ghastly typeface , or watching it moronically scribbled on parchment by an animated quill .
I can't find an option to see it in small , uniform numbers .
The whole thing is the visual equivalent of a moronic clip - art jumble sale poster designed in the dark by a myopic divorcee experiencing a freak biorhythmic high .
Worst of all , it seems to have an unmarked omnipresent shortcut to Orange 's internet service , which means that whether you are confused by the menu , or the typeface , or the user - confounding buttons , you are never more than one click away from accidentally plunging into an overpriced galaxy of idiocy , which , rather than politely restricting itself to news headlines and train timetables , thunders " BUFF OR ROUGH ? GET VOTING ! " and starts hurling cameraphone snaps of " babes and hunks " in their underwear at you , presumably because some pin-brained coven of marketing gonks discovered the average Orange internet user was teenage and incredibly stupid , so they set about mercilessly tailoring all their " content " toward priapic halfwits , thereby assuring no one outside this slim demographic will ever use their gaudy , insulting service ever again .
And then they probably reached across the table and high - fived each other for skilfully delivering " targeted content " or something , even though what they should really have done , if there was any justice in the world , is smash the desk to pieces , select the longest wooden splinters they could find , then drive them firmly into their imbecilic , atrophied , world - wrecking rodent brains .
Anyway , over the past week , I 've bumped into other people scowling at the same poxy phone as me .
And in each case , the story is the same : Orange rang up and offered them one for nothing .
It 's spreading like a sinister virus , putting me in mind of the meteor storm at the start of Day of the Triffids - a seemingly innocent event that rapidly cripples humankind .
My theory : the government is offloading these twittering handheld crapstones on to as many people as possible in a bid to whip us all into a state of perpetual , simmering anger in readiness for some kind of bare - knuckle street war .
Do n't say I did n't warn you .

Bling is the single most shallow , boring and wilfully superficial cultural phenomenon ever to excite humankind , which is saying something for a species already hooked on internet poker .
In recent months , collective guilt over the planet 's future and the disparity of global wealth have exerted a cooling effect on bling 's popularity , although genuine justice will never be achieved until everyone responsible for promoting , propagating , passively approving of , or even being ironically amused by any and all aspects of bling culture has been hunted down and jailed for a minimum of 37 years in a maximum security prison with no carpets , hot water or bog roll .

It was on a routine patrol that the Colombian coast guard stumbled upon an eerie outpost amid the mangroves : a mini-shipyard where suspected drug traffickers were building submarines .
Perched on a makeshift wooden dry dock late last month were two 55 - foot - long fiberglass vessels , one ready for launch , the other about 70 % complete .
Each was outfitted with a 350 - horsepower Cummins diesel engine and enough fuel capacity to reach the coast of Central America or Mexico , hundreds of miles to the north .
The vessels had cargo space that could fit 5 tons of cocaine , a senior officer with the Colombian coast guard ’s Pacific command said in an interview .
The design featured tubing for air , crude conning towers and cramped bunk space for a crew of four , he added .
Over the last two years , Colombian authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy have seized 13 submarine - like vessels outfitted for drug running .
The five seized by American authorities were en route to Mexico or Central America , each loaded with 3 to 5 tons of cocaine .
The seizures point to a security threat that goes beyond drug trafficking .
Many law enforcement officials are concerned that U.S. ports and shorelines could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks using such crudely built submarines .
“ There could be 5 tons of anything on board these things , ” said a senior U.S. military official involved in the war on drugs .
Added a senior official with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Colombia : “ Any viable method to covertly transport large quantities of illicit drugs over long distances such as these [ vessels ] could conceivably be employed to transport other prohibited materials . ”
The boats have become increasingly sophisticated , evolving from huge tubes built to be towed by fishing or cargo boats to self - propelled vessels with ballast systems and communications equipment that leave no wake or radar profile as they glide just below the ocean surface .
The recent discovery in the Pacific Coast estuary about 25 miles south of the port city of Buenaventura reflects drug traffickers ’ growing use of such boats in the face of stepped - up operations by Colombian and U.S. anti-drug forces , experts here say .
The subs were probably commissioned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , in whose zone of influence the shipyard was situated , according to the officer , who asked not to be identified for security reasons .
The FARC is thought to be Colombia ’s most powerful drug - trafficking organization .
Military officials here and in the United States say the war on drugs , financed by billions of dollars in U.S. aid , is forcing drug runners to undertake ever more ingenious methods of transporting cocaine from Colombia , which produces about 90 % of the drug consumed in the United States .
Proponents insist that the campaign is producing concrete results .
They cite a 24 % increase in cocaine street prices this year as reported by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
The price bump was caused by the “ disruption of cocaine flow , ” the office ’s director , John P. Walters , wrote in a letter to Rep. J. Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) .
Improved surveillance and intelligence have led to spectacular busts this year , including the seizure last Tuesday in Manzanillo , Mexico , of 23 tons of cocaine hidden in a freight container aboard a Hong Kong - flagged vessel that had stopped in Buenaventura .
The bust “ is going to have even more serious impact on cocaine price and purity levels here in the United States , ” a senior U.S. congressional aide said Friday .
Meanwhile , critics of the war on drugs warn that the price increase , as in past instances , may prove only temporary .
John Walsh of the Washington Office on Latin America , a watchdog organization , said a 45 % price increase in early 2002 was quickly reversed as suppliers adjusted .
Walsh and others say counter - narcotics efforts in Colombia should focus less on interdiction and more on economic alternatives for coca farmers and others caught up in the industry .
In any event , the ever - changing tactics of Colombian drug traffickers targeting the lucrative U.S. market reflect a constant cat - and - mouse game .
“ When we adjust to them , they adjust to us , ” said Rear Adm .
Joseph Nimmich , commander of the Key West , Fla. - based Joint Interagency Task Force South , a multinational force set up to interdict oceangoing drug shipments .
“ Their reaction to our greater surveillance and increased interdictions has been these self - propelled submersibles . ”
Are drug cartels resorting to submarines out of “ desperation or just diversification ?
It ’s a combination of the two , with the greater emphasis on the former , ” said Assistant U.S. Atty .
Joseph Ruddy , who heads Operation Panama Express , a Tampa , Fla . - based task force .
The task force ’s interdictions have resulted in more than 1,100 drug traffickers being convicted since 2000 .
The boats seized Oct. 28 are submarine - like , but officials here say a more accurate description is “ self - propelled semi- submersible ” craft because they do not dive and resurface like a true submarine .
Submarines are not new to drug trafficking , only more numerous , if the increase in seizures is any indication .
In what was the most spectacular bust involving a narco - submarine , police in September 2000 raided a warehouse near Bogota , the capital , and found a 100 - foot - long submarine that was being built according to Russian plans .
The sub was thought to be a joint venture by Colombian and Russian drug mafias and would have been capable of carrying 10 tons of cocaine per trip had it been completed .
Annual Colombian cocaine production is now estimated at 500 to 800 tons .
In 1995 , police broke up a deal in which Colombia ’s Cali cartel had planned to buy a Russian submarine .
The know - how to build crude “ submersibles ” is readily available on the Internet and in back issues of Popular Mechanics magazine .
Hobbyists in the United States have formed the Personal Submersibles Organization ; they conduct chats on the group ’s website , psubs.org , and hold annual meetings .
But the vessels found on Colombia ’s Pacific shores last week were built for anything but recreation and certainly not by hobbyists .
The Colombian coast guard official said crew members of a submersible detained this year after their 55 - foot vessel sank off the coast of Tumaco , Colombia , told police that they viewed the craft as a death trap but were lured by the $ 2,000 payment the drug magnates promised to pay them to guide the vessel to Central America .
Asked to describe the men detained , the coast guard official merely said : “ Crazy . ”

How to calculate binomial coefficients , again
Yesterday 's article about how to calculate binomial coefficients was well - received .
It was posted on Reddit , and to my surprise and gratification , the comments were reasonably intelligent .
Usually when a math article of mine shows up on Reddit , all the megacretins come out of the woodwork to say what an idiot I am , and why do n't I go back to school and learn basic logic .
A couple of people pointed out that , contrary to what I asserted , the algorithm I described can in fact overflow even when the final result is small enough to fit in a machine word .
Consider for example .
The algorithm , as I wrote it , calculates intermediate values 8 , 8 , 56 , 28 , 168 , 56 , 280 , 70 , and 70 is the final answer .
If your computer has 7 - bit machine integers , the answer ( 70 ) will fit , but the calculation will overflow along the way at the 168 and 280 steps .
Perhaps more concretely , !!35\choose11 !!
is 417,225,900 , which is small enough to fit in a 32 - bit unsigned integer , but the algorithm I wrote wants to calculate this as !!35{34\choose10}\over11 !! , and the numerator here is 4,589,484,900 , which does not fit .
One Reddit user suggested that you can get around this as follows :
To multiply r by a/b , first check if b divides r.
If so , calculate ( r / b ) ·a ; otherwise calculate ( r·a ) / b.
This should avoid both overflow and fractions .
Unfortunately , it does not .
A simple example is !!{14\choose4} = { 11\over1}{12\over2}{13\over3}{14\over4} !!.
After the first three multiplications one has 286 .
One then wants to multiply by 14/ 4 .
4 does not divide 286 , so the suggestion calls for multiplying 286 by 14/ 4 .
But 14/4 is 3.5 , a non-integer , and the goal was to use integer arithmetic throughout .
Order
The Art of Computer Programming : Volume 2 , Seminumerical Algorithms
from Powell 's r by a /b without overflow or fractions .
First let g be the greatest common divisor of r and b .
Then calculate ( ( r / g ) · a ) / ( b/g ) .
In the example above , g is 2 , and we calculate ( 286/2 ) · ( 14/2 ) = 143 · 7 ; this is the best we can do .
I have n't looked , but it is hard to imagine that Volume II of Knuth does n't discuss this in exhaustive detail , including all the stuff I just said , plus a bunch of considerations that had n't occurred to any of us .
A few people also pointed out that you can save time when n > m / 2 by calculating !!
m\choose m-n!!
instead of .
For example , instead of calculating !!100\choose98 !! , calculate .
I did n't mention this in the original article because it was irrelevant to the main point , and because I thought it was obvious .

Monster is a leading online jobs service
A computer program was used to access the employers ' section of the website using stolen log - in credentials .
Symantec said the log-ins were used to harvest user names , e-mail addresses , home addresses and phone numbers , which were uploaded to a remote web server .
The stolen data could be used to send phishing and spam e-mails .
" This remote server held over 1.6 million entries with personal information belonging to several hundred thousands of candidates , mainly based in the US , who had posted their resumes to the Monster.com website , " reported Symantec .
Security breach
The firm has contacted Monster.com to inform them of the security breach .
Symantec said it had seen reports of phishing e-mails sent out to Monster.com users which were " very realistic " and contained " personal information of the victims " .
The e-mail encouraged users to download a Monster Job Seeker Tool , which was in fact a program that encrypted files in their computer and left a ransom note demanding money for their decryption .
" To the best of our knowledge , this is not a hack of Monster 's security , rather , legitimate customer credentials are being used to log in to the database , " said Patrick Manzo , vice president of compliance and fraud prevention at Monster .
He added : " There have been reports of this as an issue of identify theft .
" We are not aware of any cases of identity theft .
In fact , the information that is gathered from Monster is no different than that displayed in a phone book . "
The program used to access Monster.com user data was a Trojan , which are commonly used to gain access to bank details , usernames and passwords .
More than 8,000 new variants of Trojans are found each month , according to internet security specialists Sophos .
Last year , a British nurse was blackmailed by hackers who had used a Trojan to access her personal e-mails .
They threatened to reveal personal details unless she paid them .
Symantec said users should always limit contact information posted to job websites and to use a disposable e-mail address .
" Never disclose sensitive details such as your social security number , passport or driver 's license numbers , bank account information to prospective employers until you have established they are legitimate , " said the firm .
Paper : White House has used Justice Department to restrict voting and help Republicans RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 19 , 2007 Print This Email This The Bush administration has used the Justice Department to manipulate voter turnout in " battleground states " in ways that favor Republicans over the past six years , writes Greg Gordon for the McClatchy Newspapers .
" The administration intensified its efforts last year as President Bush 's popularity and Republican support eroded heading into a midterm battle for control of Congress , which the Democrats won , " writes Gordon .
In the face of strong voter registration drives from left - leaning organizations , Gordon says , the Bush administration " alleged widespread election fraud " and pushed proposals at the state and federal level that would make it tougher for people , especially minorities , to vote .
The Justice Department disagrees with allegations that minority voting rights have been marginalized , calling such assertions " fundamentally flawed . "
" The administration , however , " continues the McClatchy article , " has repeatedly invoked allegations of widespread voter fraud to justify tougher voter ID measures and other steps to restrict access to the ballot , even though research suggests that voter fraud is rare . "
Excerpts from the report follow : # Questions about the administration 's campaign against alleged voter fraud have helped fuel the political tempest over the firings last year of eight U.S. attorneys , several of whom were ousted in part because they failed to bring voter fraud cases important to Republican politicians .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales could shed more light on the reasons for those firings when he appears Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
... Since President Bush 's first attorney general , John Ashcroft , a former Republican senator from Missouri , launched a " Ballot Access and Voter Integrity Initiative " in 2001 , Justice Department political appointees have exhorted U.S. attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases , and the department 's Civil Rights Division has sought to roll back policies to protect minority voting rights .
On virtually every significant decision affecting election balloting since 2001 , the division 's Voting Rights Section has come down on the side of Republicans , notably in Florida , Michigan , Missouri , Ohio , Washington and other states where recent elections have been decided by narrow margins .

What to know about Nashville area prep football at midseason
ANN ARBOR — Most people do n’t appreciate an angry look , but a new University of Michigan psychology study found that some people find angry expressions so rewarding that they will readily learn ways to encourage them .
“ It ’s kind of striking that an angry facial expression is consciously valued as a very negative signal by almost everyone , yet at a non-conscious level can be like a tasty morsel that some people will vigorously work for , ” said Oliver Schultheiss , co-author of the study and a U - M associate professor of psychology .
The findings may explain why some people like to tease each other so much , he added .
“ Perhaps teasers are reinforced by that fleeting ‘ annoyed look ’ on someone else ’s face and therefore will continue to heckle that person to get that look again and again , ” he said .
“ As long as it does not stay there for long , it ’s not perceived as a threat , but as a reward . ”
U -M psychology researchers Michelle Wirth and Schultheiss , the authors of the study , published their findings in the journal Physiology and Behavior .
They took saliva samples from participants to measure testosterone , a hormone that has been associated with dominance motivation .
Participants then worked on a “ learning task ” in which one complex sequence of keypresses was followed by an angry face on the screen , another sequence was followed by a neutral face , and a third sequence was followed by no face .
Participants who were high in testosterone relative to other members of their sex learned the sequence that was followed by an angry face better than the other sequences , while participants low in testosterone did not show this learning advantage for sequences that were reinforced by an angry face .
Notably , this effect emerged more strongly in response to faces that were presented subliminally , that is , too fast to allow conscious identification .
Perhaps just as noteworthy , participants were not aware of the patterns in the sequences of keypresses as they learned them .
While high - testosterone participants showed better learning in response to anger faces , they were unaware of the fact that they learned anything in the first place and unaware of what kind of faces had reinforced their learning .
Wirth , the lead author of the study and now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , added : “ Better learning of a task associated with anger faces indicates that the anger faces were rewarding , as in a rat that learns to press a lever in order to receive a tasty treat .
In that sense , anger faces seemed to be rewarding for high - testosterone people , but aversive for low - testosterone people . ”
She said the findings contribute to a body of research suggesting that perceived emotional facial expressions are important signals to help guide human behavior , even if people are not aware that they do so .
“ The human brain may have built - in mechanisms to detect and respond to emotions perceived in others , ” she said .
“ However , what an emotional facial expression , such as anger , ‘ means ’ to a given individual — whether it is something to pursue or avoid , for example — can vary . ”

CBS News foreign correspondent Lara Logan talked to Jay Leno on Monday about growing up in apartheid South Africa , how she became a reporter , and what it 's been like reporting on so many wars over 17 years .
" You see the absolute worst of humanity and then you see ... something that 's so incredible , " she told Leno .
" How are we doing [ in Iraq ] from your point of view ? "
Leno asked .
" We 're doing extremely badly , " Logan replied .
She said that because of the suppression of pictures of American casualties , most people have no idea how bad things are .
Logan emphasized that , although the alliance of the US military with former Sunni insurgents has had an impact on al Qaeda in Iraq , " to say that we have crippled them is suicide .
That 's one of those things that you say and you live to regret . "
She added that the surge is " working in certain places , temporarily , " but has n't altered the fundamental dynamics of the situation .

Rove is a no-show at Senate Judiciary , Jennings declines to say much
The Senate Judiciary Committee 's hearing on the firing of nine U.S. attorneys last year went on as scheduled this morning , and Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) used the session to bash Karl Rove for not showing up .
J. Scott Jennings , the deputy director of the White House political affairs offices , did make an appearance , however , although he provided Democrats with little new information on the prosecutor purge , relying on an assertion by President Bush of executive privilege to decline to answer numerous specific questions .
Rove and Jennings had been subpoenaed by the panel to testify on what they knew about the prosecutor purge .
The fact that Jennings was there and Rove was n't was seized on by Leahy and the Democrats as a sign of White House inconsistency on the issue .
" Mr. Jennings appearance shows that the White House 's newly minted claim of ' immunity ' for White House employees is a sham , " Leahy said .
" How can White House employees like Karl Rove speak publicly about these matters one day but declare that he cannot in any way be held accountable to the American people and their duly elected representatives in Congress on the same matter ? "
Jennings , for his part , said he was " caught in the middle of a constitutional struggle between two branches of government -- quite literally between a rock and a hard place .
One the one hand , I am appearing before this committee pursuant to a subpoena that compels me to answer questions concerning the dismissal and replacement of U.S. attorneys .
On the other hand , I have received a letter from the White House counsel asserting the president ''s claim of executive privilege over the very subject matter of the committee 's subpoena . "
Jennings said Bush executive - privilege claim made him " unable at this time to answer any questions concerning White House consideration , deliberations , or communications related to the U.S. attorneys matter , regardless of whether specific documents or conversations may have already been discussed publicly by others .
To do otherwise would directly violate the president 's order . "
Jennings then went on to assert executive privilege more than 20 times , refusing to answer any questions by Leahy or Sens.
Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) or Richard Durbin ( D - Ill. ) on his role in the firings .
Jennings was pressed repeatedly on the dismissal of David Iglesias , the former U.S. attorney in New Mexico .
Jennings helped set up a meeting between several New Mexico Republicans and a top Justice Dept. official .
During that meeting , complaints about Iglesias ' performance were raised .
Sen. Pete Domenici ( D - N.M. ) is being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee over phone calls he made to Iglesias during which he asked the former prosecutor about a corruption probe involving some local Democrats .
The House ethics committee has also interviewed Iglesias on a similar call he received from Rep. Heather Wilson ( R - N.M . ) .
Iglesias has testified that he felt the calls were improper .
Even though Schumer and other Democrats had an e-mail from Jennings to Monica Goodling , the former White House liaison for the Justice Dept. asking for a meeting with some New Mexico Republicans on Iglesias , Jennings declined to answer the question .
Democrats also pressed Jennings on why he used e-mail accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee to conduct officials business .
Jennings denied that the practice was an attempt to evade presidential record - keeping requirements , describing it as a matter of " convenience " since he never received a BlackBerry device for his White House e-mail account and had numerous messages to respond to during very hectic days .
Schumer , clearly unsatisfied by Jennings ' testimony , accused him of asserting privilege to duck difficult questions , such as his role in Iglesias ' firing , stating that Jennings was trying to " hide behind a false wall of privilege . "
Republicans , for their part , either criticized the now eight - month - old investigation as a partisan attempt to hurt Bush or said the probe should wrap up quickly so that the committee can go onto other business .
" This investigation needs to be completed , " said Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , ranking member of the committee .
Specter has supported Leahy on many aspects of the investigation , but has complained that Democrats and the White House are refusing to compromise on an agreement that would allow senior administration aides to testify on the matter behind closed doors .
Specter has predicted that the issue would end up in federal court if the Democrats try to move a contempt citation against Rove or other White House officials for failing to answer the committee 's subpoenas .
NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker on Sunday urged colleagues to take a stand against Apple 's iTunes , charging that the digital download service was undermining the ability of traditional media companies to set profitable rates for their content online .
" We know that Apple has destroyed the music business — in terms of pricing — and if we donât take control , theyâll do the same thing on the video side , " Zucker said at a breakfast hosted by Syracuseâs Newhouse School of Communications .
His comments
Sunday were the most aggressive yet since NBC informed Apple last month that it had decided not to renew its contract to sell digital downloads of television shows on iTunes after this year .
NBC originally claimed to be seeking more control over the pricing of songs and videos that it was selling on iTunes , in addition to better piracy controls and more flexibility to bundle video content in an effort to increase revenues .
For its part in the bitter feud , Apple responded by saying NBC was asking for a twofold increase in the wholesale price of its TV show content , which would have resulted in the retail price to iTunes customers increasing to $ 4.99 per episode from $ 1.99 .
Answering questions at the breakfast Sunday , Zucker offered substantially more color on the iTunes matter , explaining that it was â a relatively easy decisionâ for NBC to walk away from the Apple download service because it had only earned about $ 15 million from the service last year in spite of accounting for about 40 per cent of the videos sold on the store .
He said NBC routinely propositioned Apple to breach its standard pricing model and experiment with higher pricing for one hit show such as â Heroesâ by raising the price from the iTunes standard $ 1.99 to $ 2.99 on a trial basis .
â We wanted to take one show , it didnât matter which one it was , and experiment and sell it for $ 2.99 , â  he said .
â We made that offer for months and they said no.â 
The NBC chief also revealed that in addition to more pricing flexibility , his firm was also seeking a cut of Apple hardware sales — such as the iPod and iPhone — which were capable of viewing content downloaded from the iTunes Store .
" Apple sold millions of dollars worth of hardware off the back of our content and made a lot of money , " he said .
" They did not want to share in what they were making off the hardware or allow us to adjust pricing . "
Zucker 's comments also arrive just as NBC and NewsCorp . are launching their joint online video venture , Hulu.com , which aims to compete with iTunes by offering streaming TV and other commercial video content to viewers under an ad- supported model .
He said that 50 million streams of TV shows accessed on NBC.com during the month of October are proof that there is a demand for traditional TV series on the web .

The Nonprofit Industrial Complex : How the Politics of Funding can Hijack a Movement October 13 , 2007
I am one of the many radical , idealist youths , who , fresh out of college , trekked my way to the Washington , DC progressive world , to get a job at a nonprofit that could , hopefully , reconcile my desire to improve the world with my desire to make a living .
When I got there , I thought I was unbelievably lucky to actually get paid to do work that falls within throwing distance of my political beliefs .
Now that I have finished my one and only year in the DC nonprofit world , I must say I am a bit disillusioned .
During my time in that city , I learned that the DC nonprofit system is a tangled mess of good intentions , damaging compromises , and political contradictions .
In a capitalist society , DC nonprofits must do what it takes to survive – often by making their goals , agendas , and cultures palatable to funders , and by narrowing in on niche social change markets – a distinction that is always somewhat arbitrary .
In this nuts and bolts city , nonprofits focus on getting things done within their narrow fields , drowning out much needed discussions about political ideas and visions .
The survival of the organization , furthermore , often becomes an end in itself , making it rather difficult for nonprofits to admit when they have outlived their usefulness .
While many DC organizations start out with radical intentions , once they have been processed through the nonprofit system , they often no longer pose a threat to the status quo .
Recently , there has been an explosion of criticisms of the “ non-profit industrial complex ” coming from left magazines like Adbusters , and even former nonprofit organizations like Incite .
And while it is exciting that this issue is being thrown out into the open for open criticism and analysis , we are still left with the question : what do we put in its place ?
There are undeniable advantages to being a part of the nonprofit industrial complex , namely , survival .
Volunteer activists must scrape together what little free - time they have outside of their regular jobs to devote themselves to their cause .
Not only is this exhausting , but it simply does not give them the time and resources they need to develop their movement to the point that it can be at all effective .
Becoming a nonprofit , and getting funding , allows you to have an office , supplies , and time to spending working on an issue .
But there are other models for funding radical projects .
Organizations could do what labor unions have been doing for years : build membership and collect member dues .
Not only will this provide funding , but it will also provide a base of support for an organization ’s efforts and give its members a measure of ownership of the project .
Nonprofits could also have an entirely separate business just to fund its efforts , like a cafe or a bookstore .
This would allow it to act with total autonomy ; it would not be beholden to any corporate foundations .
Another option , though it might seem somewhat impractical , is that certain “ legitimate ” nonprofits could act as front groups for more radical nonprofits .
They could solicit funding and then secretly embezzle it to fund more radical projects .
We live in world with complex problems that demand thoughtful , nuanced solutions .
We cannot afford to base our plans of action on what gets the most funding .
We need to start building models for organizing and agitation that allow us to truly act on our beliefs without compromise .
While there are undeniable advantages to securing funding for radical projects , there are also considerable costs , and we must ask ourselves , Is it worth it ?

As Europe 's workers take a few weeks of holiday this summer , their American colleagues will be lucky to get a few days off work , says a report published by the European Trade Union Institute .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
PARIS ( Reuters ) -
As Europe ’s workers take a few weeks of holiday this summer , their American colleagues will be lucky to get a few days off work , says a report published by the European Trade Union Institute .
Finland , followed by France , offers working people the most statutory vacation , at more than six weeks per year , the report , an international snapshot of how much paid leave people get by law and in practice in 21 countries , says .
The United States is the only country where employees have no statutory leave , and they get about half as much time off in reality as Europeans get , according to the report , compiled by the Washington - based Centre for Economic Policy Research .
“ The United States is in a class of its own , ” the report says .
“ It is the no-vacation nation . ”
Andrew Watt , an economist at the Brussels - based European Trade Union Institute , said the report not only highlighted a conscious decision to ensure more free time in Europe .
It also showed the errors many economists make when saying U.S. productivity and economic output is better than Europe’s .
Canada and Japan , which require employers to give at least 10 days paid leave to their staff , are less generous than the Europeans , who get at least four weeks by law and often much more in practice , the report said .
In the United States , leave was generally harder to secure for people in low - pay and part - time jobs , it added .
Liam Madden from Iraq Veterans Against the War sends the following :
In 1969 , the My Lai massacre helped fuel popular opposition to the Vietnam War. U.S. political and military leaders insisted that such crimes were isolated exceptions .
Members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War knew differently .
In January of 1971 , over one hundred Vietnam Veterans gathered in Detroit to testify their experiences to America .
Their testimony , called the Winter Soldier Investigation , revealed that atrocities were systemic and responsibility laid at the highest levels of government .
The U.S. Government lied to get us into war and continues to conceal the true nature of military occupation .
On the weekend of 13 - 15 March , 2008 , Iraq Veterans Against the War will assemble history ’s largest gathering of US veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as Iraqi and Afghan survivors .
They will provide first hand accounts of their experiences and reveal the truth of occupation .
There was a day when I did n't know what a bignum was or why I would possibly want one .
I was fat , dumb , and happy with basic fixed - precision integers in C and Java land .
When I first started playing with Common Lisp , I thought , " Wow , that 's a neat trick that I can actually evaluate ( factorial 100 ) and it works correctly , but how often am I going to be doing that ? ? "
Boy , was I wrong .
I 'm working on a project in Emacs Lisp in my spare time and I suddenly have a need to deal with integers that are greater than the anemic 29 - bit fixnums that Emacs Lisp supports .
While 29 bits might be okay for working with character positions in a buffer , it falls flat on its face whenever you want to manipulate anything from the outside world .
In this case , 29 bits is too small to handle any 32 - bit quantity , let alone some of the 64 - bit stuff I want to deal with .
I 'm kind of amazed that RMS did n't just implement 32 - bit boxed integers if he was n't going to do full bignums .
I found that calc.el includes support for its own version of bignums and I might be forced to use those .
Painful , though .
I guess the old saying is true -- you do n't miss something until it 's gone .
Does any Emacs guru know if bignums are being considered as a standard Emacs Lisp datatype for a future Emacs version ?
I 'm currently working in Emacs 22.1 ( Fedora 7 ) .
Given the release schedule of Emacs versions , any future support wo n't help me , but it would at least be comforting to know that other people see the same need .

' Ba , ba , safo !

· Translated into Esperanto by MC Butler
In a Baptist church hall on the edge of Ipswich , 20 people are holding a meeting .
Among them are a quantity surveyor and a retired film - maker , an A - level student and a 95 - year - old former teacher .
Together , they have some routine business to discuss ; membership , accounts , that sort of thing .
Then , after homemade soup and vegetarian nibbles , there 's a general knowledge quiz , put together by Roy Threadgold .
Threadgold is an Essex dairy farmer whose ewe 's milk cheese wins prizes and , with his jovial face and long sideburns , he looks the part .
So when he stands up and announces the first question , it is surprising - almost shocking - to hear his words .
Are they Hungarian ?
Portuguese ?
A variety of Slovenian ?
Some words sound half - familiar , yet this is not French or German , and it certainly is n't Essex .
One thing is clear .
Whatever language Threadgold is using , his audience understands him .
For no sooner has he begun the quiz than they are teasing him for clues or pressing him for clarification , and all in the same exuberant tongue , with its " o " and " oi " sounds , and its hints of known languages .
An outsider chancing upon this gathering would almost certainly assume that here was a band of expatriates , come together to share fond memories of a distant homeland .
Only later might the truth dawn - that it is the shared language , not some common origin , that binds them .
For , apart from Dominique , a French database administrator who happened to pitch up in East Anglia , everybody here is as British as the day is wet .
They just happen to speak Esperanto .
Not that anyone " just happens " to speak Esperanto .
For this language has no territory to call its own .
Intended for use as a universal second language - an auxiliary tongue by means of which all people , no matter what their origins , might communicate freely - it is a constructed thing , a deliberate invention that must be deliberately learned .
The fact that , 116 years after the birth of Esperanto , few people reading this article will know a single word of it - may not even be aware of its existence - is an indication of just how reluctant the world has been to take that obvious next step .
In 1965 , William Shatner starred in Incubus , the first film to be made in the language .
Conrad Hall , the cinematographer on that project , went on to shoot American Beauty .
But what became of Esperanto ?
Neither the UN nor the EU has adopted it as a working language , and not a single multinational corporation or charity employs it in its day - to - day dealings .
Yet nobody in this church hall seems unduly downhearted .
Which is n't to say they do n't occasionally feel ever so slightly indignant .
Listen to Roy Simmons .
A 53 - year - old assistant headteacher at a comprehensive school in east London , he has come to Ipswich because , in his spare time , he is president of the Eastern Esperanto Federation , whose meeting this is .
Simmons is happy to tell anyone that , until 1994 , when he chanced to see a book on the subject , he had never heard of Esperanto .
But it was love at first sight .
" I was captured by the language , " he recalls , and promptly enrolled on a course .
Yet his attempts to pass on his enthusiasm have almost always fallen on deaf ears .
And not just deaf ears , but ears that are positively closed .
" What I find strange , " Simmons says , " is that , when you mention Esperanto , people never ignore it .
They are violently against it .
Even in schools .
If you say you 're going to teach Russian , people might say , ' Oh , that 's a waste of time ' , and just forget it .
But they will go on at you for ages about why you should n't teach Esperanto .
Apart from anything else , Esperanto is a great basis for learning other languages .
That is also true of Latin .
But Latin takes a long time to learn , whereas Esperanto does n't .
I became fluent in two years .
Do n't forget , he designed it for uneducated farm - workers who had 10 minutes a day . "
He ?
Ah , that must be Ludovic L Zamenhof .
Bialystok in the 1860s was no place to grow up .
A city in the north - east of what is now Poland , it was at the time under Russian rule .
Violence between ethnic Poles , Russians , Germans and Jews was commonplace , and every week brought fresh news of barbarism and cruelty between these isolated and mutually intolerant communities .
It was here , where lack of understanding translated readily into racial hatred , and racial hatred begat violence , that , in 1859 , Ludovic Zamenhof was born to a language teacher and her linguist husband .
By his mid-teens , young Ludovic had seen enough of man 's inhumanity to man to convince him of the need for a common language that would facilitate understanding between peoples .
Having been brought up to speak Polish , German , Russian , Yiddish and Hebrew , and having a good knowledge of English and French , Zamenhof knew that no existing language would fit the bill .
For one thing , the fact that they were associated with a particular country , race or culture meant that they lacked the neutrality any international language would need in order to be accepted .
And , for another , the fact that they were weighed down by copious rules , yet at the same time were riddled with illogicalities and exceptions , meant that they lacked another essential characteristic of a universal second language : ease of learning by ordinary people .
This difficulty factor also ruled out Latin and classical Greek - all of which left Zamenhof with only one option : to devise his own language .
But inventing languages does n't pay the bills , so Zamenhof studied medicine and became an oculist .
By day he fixed eyes and in the evening he wrestled with problems that would make a poet weep .
How rigid should he be in his pursuit of simplicity ?
Was it possible for Shakespeare in translation to sound like Shakespeare ?
At what point should he stop listening to his head and begin hearing with his heart ?
He was n't alone in treading this difficult path .
Pascal , Descartes and Leibniz all toyed with constructed languages , and Johann Schleyer , a German cleric , was even then working on his own creation , Volapük .
But whereas Schleyer 's language wasconsidered alien and ugly when it appeared in 1880 , Zamenhof was to craft a language that many regarded as a thing of beauty .
Moreover , while Volapük was almost as hard to learn as Latin , Zamenhof 's language was to have only 16 basic rules and not a single exception .
It is probably the only language to have no irregular verbs ( French has 2,238 , Spanish and German about 700 each ) and , with just six verb endings to master , it is reckoned most novices can begin speaking it after an hour .
Rather than create a vast lexicon of words , then expect people to learn them all , Zamenhof decided on a system of root words and affixes that alter their meanings ( " mal - " converts a word into its opposite , for example ) .
And because word endings denote parts of speech ( nouns end in " - o " , adjectives in " - a " , etc ) , word order is immaterial .
Although modern Esperanto now has around 9,000 root words , most meanings can be expressed by drawing from a pool of about 500 and simply combining them - a creative process that is regarded by Esperantists as acceptable and even commendable .
Three - quarters of the root words are borrowed from the Romance languages , the remainder from Germanic and Slavic tongues , and Greek .
This means that around half the world 's population is already familiar with much of the vocabulary .
For an English speaker , Esperanto is reckoned to be five times as easy to learn as Spanish or French , 10 times as easy as Russian and 20 times as easy as Arabic or Chinese .
While critics seize on the obvious downside of this Eurocentricity - namely that it puts speakers of other languages at a disadvantage - Esperantists argue that the regularity and simplicity of Zamenhof 's scheme quickly outweigh any lack of familiarity with root words , and point to the popularity of Esperanto in Hungary , Estonia , Finland , Japan , China and Vietnam as proof of Zamenhof 's pudding .
Apart from its logical construction , Esperanto has another appealing characteristic : it is phonetic and orthographic , meaning that each letter represents only one sound , and each sound is represented by only one letter .
In 1887 , at the age of 28 , Zamenhof was ready to go public .
His first brochure on the language , just 40 pages long but setting out the entire structure , was published under the pseudonym " Doktoro Esperanto " - " Doktoro " meaning " Doctor " in the new language and " Esperanto " meaning " he who hopes " .
As the booklet moved around the world , letters began pouring in , many written in what people were calling " Dr Esperanto 's International Language " - a name soon abbreviated to " Esperanto " .
After 12 months , Zamenhof published the names and addresses of 1,000 supporters , among them the secretary of the American Philosophical Society .
In Germany , members of the World Language Club printed a magazine in Esperanto , and by 1905 it was time to pull everything together and call the first Universala Kongreso , or Universal Congress .
Nearly 700 Esperantists from 20 countries assembled in Boulogne to converse in the new tongue and , quite soon , Schleyer 's Volapük was history .
But as the advancing century grew ever more bloody , Zamenhof 's hope that this new form of communication might elevate the human condition was to be sorely tried .
Alongside his medical work , the doctor developed his ideas through correspondence with enthusiasts around the globe .
But by 1917 he was exhausted .
He died aged 57 , while the worst human conflict the world had yet seen still raged around him .
And worse was to come .
Had he lived another 20 years , he would have seen Esperantists being rounded up and shot .
Even Zamenhof 's hopes might not have survived such a blow .
In the 253rd edition of Orienta Stelo , the newsletter of the Eastern Esperanto Federation , there 's an item recording the sad passing of Phyllis Strapps .
" Strappo " , as she was known , was born in the Fenland city of Ely in 1905 - the very year of that first congress in Boulogne .
In her early 20s , having moved to Ilford to work as a teacher , she discovered Esperanto , and for more than 70 years she remained loyal to Zamenhof 's philosophy , teaching the language to anyone who would learn it , and travelling the world to meet fellow Esperantists .
Hers was a life of endless evening classes - of diplomas and socials and Esperanto weekends at her beach chalet in Felixstowe .
In her front window at home was a sign saying " Esperanto parolata " - Esperanto spoken here - and in her spare room a bed was always made up for Esperanto guests .
But if all this suggests little more than a harmless enthusiasm , then it is only half the story .
For the years of Strappo 's life spanned the hardest of times for the language she loved .
Within a few years of Zamenhof 's first brochure , Tsarist Russia banned all publications in Esperanto .
Groups of revolutionary Esperantists were springing up across Europe and the world 's ruling elites were alarmed .
Soon , Stalin would call Esperanto " that dangerous language " and Hitler would describe it as a tool of Jewish world domination .
When Iran proposed that Esperanto be adopted by the League of Nations , France blocked the move and promptly banned the language from schools .
Meanwhile , governments across central Europe actively discouraged Esperanto , no doubt fearing what would happen if workers of the world could share their experiences and aspirations .
By the 1930s , both Germany and the USSR had outlawed Esperanto organisations .
The Nazis exterminated speakers they came across in their occupied territories , while Stalin , who spoke of " the language of spies " , had Esperantists deported or shot ( the Soviet government maintained controls until the late 1980s ) .
In Japan in the 1930s , Esperanto speakers were similarly persecuted , and even killed .
They were notably described at that time as being " like watermelons - green on the outside but red inside " ( green was adopted early on as the colour of Esperanto ) .
In one of those twists of history that set the head spinning , rightwingers in the US were to use an identical jibe against environmentalists decades later .
The suspicion that Esperanto was a communist plot made it similarly unpopular in Franco 's Spain , and many Esperantists had indeed fought on the Republican side during the civil war .
But while China 's nominally communist government has from time to time encouraged its use for official purposes , private use of Esperanto was ill - advised during the Cultural Revolution .
And the persecution continues .
Iran 's mullahs dislike Esperanto , and Saddam Hussein had one teacher of the language deported .
In recent years , two Swedish Esperanto speakers were severely beaten by Tanzanian police for attempting to teach the language .
Like any movement , Esperanto has also faced internal dissent , notably from an early breakaway group who devised an " improved " version called Ido .
The Idists were frustrated at the refusal of the growing Esperanto movement to modify any of Zamenhof 's basic rules .
But while Zamenhof's " fundamentals " are indeed sacrosanct ( Esperantists place great importance on structural stability ) , the Doktoro always insisted that Esperanto was not his property .
Rather , he saw collective ownership and the creation of a language community as essential to survival and growth ; a policy that , years later , was to receive vindication from the most unexpected quarter imaginable .
It was during the early 1960s , at the height of the cold war , that the US army , busily devising ever more realistic training scenarios , decided to create a fictitious nation to serve as an opponent during intelligence exercises .
These " aggressor " forces ( heaven forbid that the US would ever raise a finger other than in self - defence ) were kitted out with green uniforms complete with insignia of a strangely Soviet appearance .
And , as part of their fabricated identity , they were given a language .
And so it was that , in 1962 , there appeared a field training manual bizarrely entitled Esperanto : The Aggressor Language .
And while Esperantists are mortified that the language of peace and cooperation was ever tarred with the brush of aggression , and are quick to point out that the booklet contained several errors , they must also take comfort from the brief description that appeared in its introduction .
Zamenhof's " neutral interlanguage " , said the manual , had been chosen because it was " not identifiable with any alliance or ideology " and was " far easier to learn and use than any national language " .
And in words that , while betraying a less than perfect grasp of English , would nevertheless have warmed the heart of the good Doktoro , it went on : " Esperanto is not an artificial or dead language .
It is a living and current media [ sic ] of international oral and written communication .
Its basic rules of grammar are such that it will remain a live language because it can assimilate new words that are constantly being developed in existing world languages . "
They may not be finding Roy Threadgold 's quiz particularly easy -
Which planet 's year is shorter than its day ?
" Merkuro ? Ne. Venuso " - but when it comes to answering criticism , the Esperantists gathered in Ipswich are on familiar ground .
What do they say to people who argue that learning Esperanto is pointless because it has no culture ?
Roy Simmons turns the discussion around .
" That 's actually one of the arguments against the spread of American English , " he says .
" Because it comes with a culture , it 's not neutral .
It 's impossible to accept the American language in isolation , which is one of the causes of the Middle East problems .
And , anyway , what is culture ?
If you 're talking about literature , Esperanto has a huge literature of both original texts and translations . "
But , neutral or otherwise , surely English is now so widespread that there is no need - no room - for a separate international language ?
Angela Tellier , a qualified French teacher who educated her three children at home and taught them Esperanto " because I wanted to give them the best " , is horrified at the thought .
" English is English , " she says .
" It will get mangled if it becomes a universal language . "
Ask them how many Esperanto speakers there are worldwide and they caution against the wilder estimates found on the internet .
" It 's actually difficult to count , " says Simmons .
" How do you define a speaker ?
Everyone will tell you they are an absolute beginner , then sit down and speak to you for hours in faultless Esperanto .
But there are more speakers now than at any time in the past .
There have got to be a couple of million of us worldwide . "
And the next question - well , it 's difficult to phrase it tactfully .
These two million - are they all of a type ?
Are they all , er , middle class ?
" Certainly not , " says Simmons .
" If you went to eastern Europe , you would find it was everyday people who speak it . "
In the former communist countries , he says , Esperanto was a way out .
And there are pockets of the language all over the world for different reasons .
" In Brazil , spiritualism is very big .
A famous medium in the 1940s wrote many books in Esperanto and thousands of Brazilians will learn Esperanto in order to read them in the original .
Go to Ivory Coast and you will find big Esperanto groups because it's the anticolonial language .
It 's very big in China and Japan , because they find English too difficult .
And in Belgium , Flemish people who do n't want their kids learning French teach them Esperanto as a second language to retain their Flemish culture . "
And in Ilford or Ipswich , or anywhere in the Eastern Esperanto Federation - why would people here learn Esperanto ?
" Some go into it because of the peace ideal , others for the beauty of the language , " says Tellier .
" And some want to travel . "
The ability to chat freely and on equal terms with people from other countries is clearly a big draw .
" We can talk to ordinary people in the street , " she says .
" We do n't have to read newspapers to find out what 's going on in Hungary or Chile .
We can actually contact the people on the internet .
We can write to them .
Esperanto is the Latin of the ordinary people .
It 's true .
It really is . "
When the quiz is over and the accounts accounted for , several Esperantists recall their adventures .
One man who toured the eastern bloc in the 1970s and 1980s and seemed to know so many people that the Russian guides were invariably suspicious , produces photographs that prove beyond all doubt that a high proportion of Esperanto speakers in that neck of the woods were , and maybe still are , in their 20s , and frequently female .
Others tell of coming away from a discussion with a foreign congress delegate and realising that they had n't a clue about the nationality of the person they had just been speaking to .
" The thing is , " they say , " it really did n't matter any more . "
As a steamroller of cultural chauvinisms , Esperanto clearly works .
Take the case of the two Rots , Simmons and Threadgold .
Farmer Roy has an Essex accent that gets broader as he explains how he devised a translation of " silage " .
" It evaded me for years , but the answer was blindingly obvious : ' sil ' means ' silo ' , ' aj ' means ' substance ' , 'o ' is a noun , so it had to be ' silajo ' , which you can then qualify with grass or maize ... "
" I 'd known him for ages , " says teacher Roy , " but because people tend to speak in the language they met in , we 'd always spoken Esperanto .
Then , one day , we had an English - speaking visitor at a federation meeting and Roy chatted to them .
I realised for the first time that he had a heavy Essex accent .
' My God , ' I thought , ' I 've never heard him speak English in all the time I 've known him . ' "
It might not be world peace , but it 's the sort of result Ludovic Zamenhof must have hoped for

This is old news is n't it ?
I 'm surprised it 's not circulating .
I do n't hate Bush , it 's just I found this pretty interesting .
Original Article By Kevin Berger
Oct 29 , 2004 | George W. Bush tried to laugh off the bulge .
" I do n't know what that is , " he said on " Good Morning America " on Wednesday , referring to the infamous protrusion beneath his jacket during the presidential debates .
" I 'm embarrassed to say it 's a poorly tailored shirt . "
Dr. Robert M. Nelson , however , was not laughing .
He knew the president was not telling the truth .
And Nelson is neither conspiracy theorist nor midnight blogger .
He 's a senior research scientist for NASA and for Caltech 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , and an international authority on image analysis .
Currently he 's engrossed in analyzing digital photos of Saturn 's moon Titan , determining its shape , whether it contains craters or canyons .
For the past week , while at home , using his own computers , and off the clock at Caltech and NASA , Nelson has been analyzing images of the president 's back during the debates .
A professional physicist and photo analyst for more than 30 years , he speaks earnestly and thoughtfully about his subject .
" I am willing to stake my scientific reputation to the statement that Bush was wearing something under his jacket during the debate , " he says .
" This is not about a bad suit .
And there 's no way the bulge can be described as a wrinkled shirt . "
Nelson and a scientific colleague produced the photos from a videotape , recorded by the colleague , who has chosen to remain anonymous , of the first debate .
The images provide the most vivid details yet of the bulge beneath the president 's suit .
Amateurs have certainly had their turn at examining the bulge , but no professional with a résumé as impressive as Nelson 's has ventured into public with an informed opinion .
In fact , no one to date has enhanced photos of Bush 's jacket to this degree of precision , and revealed what appears to be some kind of mechanical device with a wire snaking up the president 's shoulder toward his neck and down his back to his waist .
Nelson stresses that he's not certain what lies beneath the president 's jacket .
He offers , though , " that it could be some type of electronic device -- it 's consistent with the appearance of an electronic device worn in that manner . "
The image of lines coursing up and down the president 's back , Nelson adds , is " consistent with a wire or a tube . "
Nelson used the computer software program Photoshop to enhance the texture in Bush 's jacket .
The process in no way alters the image but sharpens its edges and accents the creases and wrinkles .
You 've seen the process performed a hundred times on " CSI " : pixelated images are magnified to reveal a clear definition of their shape .
Bruce Hapke , professor emeritus of planetary science in the department of geology and planetary science at the University of Pittsburgh , reviewed the Bush images employed by Nelson , whom he calls " a very highly respected scientist in his field . "
Hapke says Nelson 's process of analyzing the images are the " exact same methods we use to analyze images taken by spacecraft of planetary surfaces .
It does not introduce any artifacts into the picture in any way . "
How can Nelson be certain there 's some kind of mechanical device beneath Bush 's jacket ?
It 's all about light and shadows , he says .
The angles at which the light in the studio hit Bush 's jacket expose contours that fit no one 's picture of human anatomy and wrinkled shirts .
And Nelson compared the images to anatomy texts .
He also experimented with wrinkling shirts in various configurations , wore them under his jacket under his bathroom light , and could n't produce anything close to the Bush bulge .
In the enhanced photo of the first debate , Nelson says , look at the horizontal white line in middle of the president 's back .
You 'll see a shadow .
" That 's telling me there 's definitely a bulge , " he says .
" In fact , it 's how we measure the depths of the craters on the moon or on Mars .
We look at the angle of the light and the length of shadow they leave .
In this case , that 's clearly a crater that 's under the horizontal line -- it 's clearly a rim of a bulge protruding upward , one due to forces pushing it up from beneath . "
Hapke , too , agrees that the bulge is neither anatomy nor a wrinkled shirt .
" I would think it 's very hard to avoid the conclusion that there 's something underneath his jacket , " he says .
" It would certainly be consistent with some kind of radio receiver and a wire . "
Nelson admits that he 's a Democrat and plans to vote for John Kerry .
But he takes umbrage at being accused of partisanship .
" Everyone wants to think my colleague and I are just a bunch of dope- crazed ravaged Democrats who are looking to insult the president at the last minute , " he says .
" And that 's not what this is about .
This is scientific analysis .
If the bulge were on Bill Clinton 's back and he was lying about it , I 'd have to say the same thing . "
" Look , he says , " I 'm putting myself at risk for exposing this .
But this is too important .
It 's not about my reputation .
If they force me into an early retirement , it 'll be worth it if the public knows about this .
It 's outrageous statements that I read that the president is wearing nothing under there .
There 's clearly something there . "
NTX Gramophone / Vinyl Record Player
This is my second version of my homemade Gramophone / Phonograph using my LEGO Mindstorms NTX .
( 2/11/2007 )
Parts needed & making the base .
Assembling the motor and connecting it to the NTX .
The turntable and the arm is assembled .
The " turntable " is one of the big wheels that comes with Mindstorms RCX , not NTX .
The Gramophone almost ready .
Detail of the arm assembled with the " speaker & amplifier " best know as a coffee cup .
The cup picks up the sound from the disk using a pin , a plastic cup works fine but a coffee cup have better sound quality .
A bigger cup amplifies better the sound .
An small cup amplifies only the high - frecuency sounds .
The Gramophone is ready .
I have some old vinyl disk that I enjoy to listen with it .
I even have a recording when the man reached the moon .
The motor drives directly the disk .
The power for the motor should be set at 25 % , it makes the vinyl disk to spin approximately 33 1/2 RPM .
Here is a video of my home - made gramophone :
On February 2006 , I puchased my first LEGO Mindstorms .
On January 2007 , I purchased my LEGO Mindstorms NTX , so I started to create some proyects with it .
I found NTX makes easier to create projects using fewer parts .
Here is my first NTX project :
Here are the visual - instructions to make your own Lego NTX Gramophone ( only if you are rich or your parents are wealthy enough to buy one )
By the way , I 'm not related with LEGO on any way .

IBM scientists have measured distribution of electrical charges in tubes of carbon that measure less than 2 nanometers in diameter , 50,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair .

IBM scientists today announced that they have measured the distribution of electrical charges in tubes of carbon that measure less than 2 nanometers in diameter , 50,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair .
This novel technique , which relies on the interactions between electrons and phonons , provides a detailed understanding of the electrical behavior of carbon nanotubes , a material that shows promise as a building block for much smaller , faster and lower power computer chips compared to today 's conventional silicon transistors .
Phonons are the atomic vibrations that occur inside material , and can determine the material 's thermal and electrical conductivity .
Electrons carry and produce the current .
Both are important features of materials that can be used to carry electrical signals and perform computations .
The interaction between electrons and phonons can release heat and impede electrical flow inside computer chips .
By understanding the interaction of electrons and phonons in carbon nanotubes , the researchers have developed a better way to measure their suitability as wires and semiconductors inside of future computer chips .
In order to make carbon nanotubes useful in building logic circuitry , scientists are pushing to demonstrate their high speed , high packing density and low power consumption capabilities as well as the ability to make them viable for potential mass production .
" The success of nanoelectronics will largely depend on the ability to prepare well characterized and reproducible nano - structures , such as carbon nanotubes , " said Dr. Phaedon Avouris , IBM Fellow and lead researcher for IBM 's carbon nanotube efforts .
" Using this technique , we are now able to see and understand the local electronic behavior of individual carbon nanotubes . "
To date , researchers have been able to build carbon nanotube transistors with superior performance , but have been challenged with reproducibility issues .
Carbon nanotubes are sensitive to environmental influences .
For example , their properties can be altered by foreign substances , affecting the flow of electrical current and changing device performance .
These interactions are typically local and change the density of electrons in the various devices of an integrated circuit , and even along a single nanotube .
A better understanding of how the local environment affects the electrical charge of a carbon nanotube is needed to allow the fabrication of more reliable transistors .
Therefore , the ability to measure local electron density changes in a nanotube is essential .
A team of researchers from the IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights have just solved this problem .
This achievement was published online October 14 , 2007 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
The team monitored the color of the light scattered from the nanotube ( Raman Effect ) , and measured small changes in the color of the light corresponding to changes in the electron density in the nanotube .
The technique takes advantage of the interaction between the motion of the atoms and the motion of the electrons , so that electron density changes can be reflected in changes of the frequency of the vibrational motion of the nanotube atoms .
In March 2006 , IBM announced that its researchers built the first complete electronic integrated circuit around a single carbon nanotube molecule .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 7 — Two - thirds of the world ’s polar bears will disappear by 2050 , even under moderate projections for shrinking summer sea ice caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , government scientists reported on Friday .
The finding is part of a yearlong review of the effects of climate and ice changes on polar bears to help determine whether they should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.
Scientists estimate the current polar bear population at 22,000 .
The report , which the United States Geological Survey released here , offers stark prospects for polar bears as the world grows warmer .
The scientists concluded that , while the bears were not likely to be driven to extinction , they would be largely relegated to the Arctic archipelago of Canada and spots off the northern Greenland coast , where summer sea ice tends to persist even in warm summers like this one , a shrinking that could be enough to reduce the bear population by two - thirds .
Redskins Sean Taylor Shot - In Critical Condition
Washington Redskins star safetywas shot in his Miami home early this morning during a possible robbery .
Police were dispatched to Taylor 's home around 1:45 am when his girlfriend called 911 .
Miami -Dade police Lt. Nancy Perez , speaking to reporters outside Taylor 's home , said Taylor " was shot in the lower extremities .
He was airlifted to Ryder Trauma ( center at Jackson Memorial Hospital ) in critical condition . "
The 24 - year - old player is in his fourth season with the Redskins .
The shooting is under investigation .
Ferdinand Marcos was among those who squirreled away dirty money
The joint UN - World Bank scheme aims to foster relations between developed and developing nations to ensure assets are returned to their rightful owners .
The World Bank says the campaign is a warning to corrupt leaders everywhere .
Switzerland has , so far , been famous for its secretive banks and a relaxed attitude to dirty money , observers say .
Clear message
Swiss banks provided a cosy home for $ 500 m ( £ 249 m ) looted by former Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos , says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Berne .
When the Philippines gained a democratic government , it took 18 years to retrieve that money .
Nigeria 's former leader Sani Abacha also held $ 700 m ( £ 348 m ) in Swiss banks .
Switzerland is probably the worst place in the world now for anybody who wants to stack illegal money in a hidden bank account
Paul Seger
Swiss foreign ministry
The new initiative aims to make it easier for developing countries to recover money they often need badly .
By joining the campaign so quickly , Switzerland is keen to send the message that looted assets will not find a home there any longer , says Paul Seger , head of international public law at the Swiss foreign ministry .
" We do not want our financial centre being used by illegal money , and we have really developed quite an extensive framework to prevent such money from coming into Switzerland , " he said .
" If it comes to restitute this money as quickly as possible - we have returned in the past years $ 1.6 bn ( £ 795 m ) , which is far more than any other financial place in Europe or elsewhere . "
' Fighting a cliche '
Mr Seger says the image of Swiss banks as easy places to hide cash will be hard to shake , despite new laws against money laundering .
" If you look at the last James Bond movie , or Dan Brown 's Da Vinci Code , there 's always the mean Swiss bankers who hide all this money , " he said .
" So we are fighting against a cliche but I think , really , we are fighting it successfully .
" Dictators who have put their money into Swiss bank accounts illegally will now think twice whether they will still do that in the future .
" I would say now that Switzerland is probably the worst place in the world now for anybody who wants to stack illegal money in a hidden bank account . "
Switzerland , which once insisted that its banks could do no wrong , has now promised to provide support and expertise to an international campaign to make sure looted assets do not disappear for good , our correspondent says .

On first glance , if you believe what Bush , Condoleezza Rice , and the America Mainstream News Media are stating regard the situation in Pakistan - you are receiving far less than the picture as a whole .
As I stated in a previous article - The United States bears some , if not much of the responsibility of Pakistan ’s woes that are currently handled via a state of emergency and martial law as declared by President Pervez Musharraf .
( IMHO )
Whether or not the call to suspend Pakistan ’s Constitution and declare Martial law was to circumvent a probable ruling by Pakistan ’s Supreme Court in reference to President Pervez Musharraf ’s eligibility to retain the Presidency remains to be seen , as there are many variables not being reported by America ’s MSM .
In a prior article , I made note of this , which is also somewhat substantiated in the link that accompanies the post :
We as a nation are watching the country of Pakistan , a primary ally of the United States , in a state of emergency and now under martial law .
This , in my opinion , is a condition that the United States , through thoughtful deployment of our armed forces could have helped to avoid - yet when we had the chance to completely decimate the Taliban and Al Qaeda , your Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , answering to you and Vice - President Dick Cheney - allowed both of the above terrorist entities to escape from Tora Bora by allowing the Afghanistan Military , as ill - trained as they were , to conduct the final mop-up of the remaining insurgents in Afghanistan and the Central Commands refusal to commit the necessary troops to finalize the destruction of Taliban and Al Qaeda elements , which allowed many of them to escape into the northern tribal areas of Pakistan and again become a threat to US interests , Pakistan itself , and now the fight in Afghanistan is almost as fierce as it was when we first began .
LINK ( Make sure and follow the link in regard Tora Bora to see Wikopedia ’s definition / assessment of the Battle of Tora Bora . )
To understand the situation as a whole , we must first understand the dynamics that are involved in Pakistan ’s internal politics , their past , and apparently - President Musharraf ’s belief that he could play both ends against the middle and come out unscathed .
The Bush ’s administration allowing Taliban and Al Qaeda elements to escape into Pakistan and to create a stronghold in the northern tribal areas complicated the situation - but even before that , the relationship between Islamic extremists , Pakistan ’s view on Afghanistan and the ongoing lawlessness in the northern tribal areas is a story itself , and the complexities of Pakistan ’s internal politics are extremely complicated and not necessarily common - knowledge as we attempt to evaluate the situation .
I found an article written in April of 2007 that is extremely insightful into the dynamics of Pakistan , and while it ’s a fairly comprehensive situation and the history is lengthy , because of copyright restrictions I am unable to republish more than three paragraphs - however , if you truly want to understand how complex this situation is , a full read of the original piece is a must ; it was written by Ziauddin Sardar , and his credentials are impressive :
Ziauddin Sardar , writer and broadcaster , describes himself as a ‘ critical polymath ’ .
He is the author of over 40 books , including the highly acclaimed ‘ Desperately Seeking Paradise ’ .
He is Visiting Professor , School of Arts , the City University , London and editor of ‘ Futures ’ , the monthly journal of planning , policy and futures studies .
LINK
FYI , this is only one opinion of many that exist , but this one is substantiated with links , extremely comprehensive , and paints a picture we as Americans have never fully understood and been apprised of in anything that was widely disseminated :
Pakistan : The Taliban takeover Ziauddin Sardar Published 30 April 2007 ( Excerpts . )
Pakistan is reverberating with the call of jihad .
For more than two months , the capital , Islamabad , has been held hostage by a group of burqa - clad women , armed with sticks and shouting : “ Al - jihad , al - jihad . ”
These female students belong to two madrasas attached to the Lal Masjid , a large mosque near one of the city ’s main supermarkets .
I found the atmosphere around the masjid tense , with heavily armed police surrounding the building .
Though the students were allowed to go in and out freely , no one else could enter the mosque .
The women are demanding the imposition of sharia law and the instant abolition of all “ dens of vice ” .
Away from the masjid , Islamabad looked like a city under siege .
A new generation of militants is emerging in Pakistan .
Although they are generally referred to as “ Taliban ” , they are a recent phenomenon .
The original Taliban , who ruled Afghanistan briefly during the 1990s , were Afghan fighters , a product of the Soviet invasion of their country .
They were created and moulded by the Pakistani army , with the active support of the United States and Saudi money , and the deliberate use of madrasas to prop up religious leaders .
Many Taliban leaders were educated at Haqqania by Maulana Sami ul - Haq .
The new generation of militants are all Pakistani ; they emerged after the US invasion of Afghanistan and represent a revolt against the government ’s support for the US .
Mostly unemployed , not all of them are madrasa - educated .
They are led by young mullahs who , unlike the original Taliban , are technology - and media - savvy , and are also influenced by various indigenous tribal nationalisms , honouring the tribal codes that govern social life in Pakistan ’s rural areas .
“ They are Taliban in the sense that they share the same ideology as the Taliban in Afghanistan , ” says Rahimullah Yusufzai , Peshawar - based columnist on the News .
“ But they are totally Pakistani , with a better understanding of how the world works . ”
Their jihad is aimed not just at “ infidels occupying Afghanistan ” , but also the “ infidels ” who are ruling and running Pakistan and maintaining the secular values of Pakistani society .
“ They aim at nothing less than to cleanse Pakistan and turn it into a pure Islamic state , ” says Rashed Rahman , executive editor of the Lahore - based Post newspaper .
The Pakistani Taliban now dominates the northern province of Waziristan , adjacent to Afghan istan .
“ They are de facto rulers of the province , ” says Yusufzai .
Waziristan is a tribal area that has historically been ruled by the tribes themselves .
Pakistan has followed the policy of British Raj in the region .
The British allowed tribal leaders , known as maliks , semi-autonomous powers in exchange for loyalty to the crown .
Pakistan gives them the same power but demands loyalty to the federal government .
They have been sidelined by the Taliban , however .
Pro-government maliks who resisted the onslaught of the Taliban have been brutally killed and had their bodies hung from poles as a lesson to others .
The Taliban have declared Waziristan an “ Islamic emirate ” and are trying to establish a parallel administration , complete with sharia courts and tax system .

Circumstitions ( Reasons Given for Circumcising a Male )
" If it seems too good to be true , it probably is " - Anon " Any phenomenon that apparently exceeds the functional
cries out for explanantion " - Daniel Dennett , Freedom Evolves , p183 " ... the cause of the origin of a thing and its eventual utility , its actual employment and place in a system of purposes , lie worlds apart ; whatever exists , having somehow come into being , is again and again reinterpreted to new ends , taken over , transformed and redirected ... an adaptation through which any previous " meaning " and purpose " are necessarily obscured or even obliterated .

Calling the process of rendition “ outsourcing , ” a federal appeals court judge in New York sharply questioned government lawyers yesterday at a hearing involving a Syrian - born Canadian detained at Kennedy Airport in 2002 and sent to Syria , where he was held for 10 months .
The man , Maher Arar , received a multimillion - dollar settlement from the Canadian government this year after it was determined that American officials removed him from the airport in an act of rendition , under which terrorism suspects are sent abroad for interrogation in countries that often practice torture .
Mr. Arar said he had been beaten repeatedly , and the Canadian government apologized to him and his family for the “ terrible ordeal ” after an inquiry found that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had wrongly told United States agents that he was suspected of being an extremist .
The judge , Robert D. Sack , was on a three - judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals weighing whether to reverse the dismissal of a civil rights lawsuit filed by Mr. Arar against the United States .
The suit was dismissed last year after a lower court ruled that it had no authority to review the case because it touched on national security and foreign relations .
Mr. Arar , a software engineer , was changing planes at the airport , en route to Canada , when he was detained by federal officials who claimed he was a member of Al Qaeda .
He was flown to Jordan , then taken overland to Syria .
He said he was beaten and forced to make a false confession before his release in 2003 .

When President Teddy Roosevelt attended the funeral of a member of British royalty , he declined the offer of a gilded carriage for the funeral procession .
Roosevelt told his British hosts that it would be inappropriate for the head of a republic .
He would therefore walk .
One of President Franklin Roosevelt ’s favorite things to do was to pack a lunch , drive up into the Pine Mountains , pull off the road , spread a blanket and enjoy a picnic lunch with two or three of his friends .
In 1933 , an assassin opened fire on Roosevelt during an appearance in an open car in Miami .
The mayor of Chicago , however , was in the way and took the bullets .
The Secret Service members immediately started to speed away , and Roosevelt ordered them to stop and retrieve the wounded mayor .
At first they did n’t , until he shouted , " Damn it , back this car up and get the mayor ! "
They did , and carried the wounded mayor to the hospital in the president ’s car .
The mayor later died .
President Harry Truman always took a vigorous daily walk — on the streets of Washington .
When his term ended , he and his wife took a cab to the train station , where they returned to Missouri .
Truman , by the way , refused all offers to serve on corporate boards of directors .
" You do n’t want me , you want the presidency , and that ’s not mine to sell , " he said .
If you will recall the funeral procession for Princess Diana , you will remember that the royal princes walked the route to Westminster Cathedral .
Imagine that —
British royalty walking down a street jammed with common people .
The last time President George W. Bush visited the British Isles , the Air Force had to fly over a fleet of 16 armored limousines for use of the president and his entourage .
If you are young and do n’t like to read ( I hope this has n’t become a redundancy ) , then you are probably unaware of the transition from a republic to an empire .
One of the reasons I ’m so contemptuous of modern politicians is that I do n’t compare them with each other ; I compare them with the great men of the past .
The last elected president who had genuinely great accomplishments on his rsum was Dwight Eisenhower .
There is no such thing as a flawless politician .
We should never expect perfection in anything involving human beings .
But there very much is such a thing as character , and that ’s where we ’ve gotten careless in our choice of leaders .
The foundations of character are honesty , courage and fidelity .
An adulterer who is unfaithful to his wife is hardly likely to be faithful to his oath of office .
John F. Kennedy was an adulterer and a playboy , but he was the first president to be marketed like a bar of soap or a tube of toothpaste .
It becomes more and more difficult these days to distinguish between accomplishment and image .
To get even an idea of a person ’s character , you have to look at his whole life , not just the public image .
People rarely , if ever , change their character after adolescence .
Hopefully , they will grow in knowledge and perhaps wisdom , but most people remain the same people they always were as far as character is concerned .
Self - indulgent cowards do n’t become brave stoics .
Viktor Frankl , a Jewish psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust , discovered that the hellish experience did n’t change anybody .
Those who were bad remained bad , and those who were good remained good .
I suppose the question for us today is , Have we lost the ability to distinguish between good and bad ?

I 've argued elsewhere that the most important step we can take to solve our peak oil / climate change problems is to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles .
This is likely to be vastly more effective in the near term than trying to ramp up public transit ( at least in the US - the considerations are rather different in Europe and Asia ) .
But in this piece , I want to take on the societal change that seems to me to have the second most powerful potential to help us adapt to declining oil availability .
This is particularly true if the declines turn out to be larger than increased fuel efficiency alone can manage .
I 'm going to argue that if we put our minds to it , there is potential for us as a society to increase the average size of households again , by both promoting the stability of nuclear families and promoting extended families living together under one roof .
This is an agenda that
Can be framed in an emotionally positive manner , instead of the doom , gloom , and energy taxes typical of thinking on these issues
Has the potential to appeal to both liberals and conservatives
Can make a big contribution to solving our problems over the course of a few decades .
Is likely to happen anyway , but could happen more and faster if we make conscious efforts to do it .
Increased household size will increase the density of population , which reduces the amount of transportation energy required for that population to get around .
It improves the utilization of heating / cooling / lighting energy , meaning we would n't need as much of that either .
It means our economy would have to spend less on building more housing and cars over coming decades , which would improve our ability to pay the enormous costs required to care for the baby boomers as they age .
Boomer medical costs would probably be lower for if more seniors were living with their families .
Kids would do better if their families stayed together , and if they had grandparents more involved in their lives .
That would reduce the stress on schools , and improve the supply of future human capital to American society , helping the US to stay competitive in a globalizing world .
There would be less need for abortion if too - young potential parents a ) had more adult involvment in their lives making them less likely to get in trouble , and b ) were part of an extended family that could support any children they did nonetheless have .
Public transit and walkable transit - oriented neighborhoods will be more feasible if population density is higher because family size is larger .
In fact , it 's quite hard to come up with an American societal problem that wouldbe helped by promoting family stability .
At the very least :
And finally , unlike most other potential solutions to our problems , families staying together and / or moving in together does not require huge financial investments that will be hard to afford during what is likely to be a difficult economic climate in the next decade or two .
Thus it has the potential to be a wedge big enough to matter .
Before we go on , I 'd just like to stress that I 'm not advocating encouraging larger families by increasing the birth rate .
That would be directly counter - productive .
Instead , I 'm advocating encouraging the existing families to cluster together more , so that fewer houses are required to house the same number of people .
I 'm also not advocating that anybody be forced to do anything they do n't want to .
Instead I 'm advocating that we try to change our culture and encourage people in this direction .
I 'll be more specific later .
It 's going to take several posts to develop these ideas .
Today I just want to quickly review some evidence of how we got to the small household size of today .
Here 's the headline graph again , which shows the last sixty years or so of declining persons per household .
.
That data began in 1950 , but the trend has been going on a lot longer and started at a larger average family size .
I 've relied heavily on the work of Steven Ruggles , a social scientist at the University of Minnosata who has been data mining past census data for several decades now , and drawing some interesting conclusions .
For example , this next graph shows where elderly persons were living from 1850 - 1990 .
As you can see , in the 19th century , it was pretty much standard for elderly people to live with their relatives , usually their children .
This does not mean that all families had elderly people in ( since life expectancy was lower ) , but generally elderly people did not live alone .
Over the course of the 19th century , there was a gradual tendency to elderly people living alone , and this accelerated in the early twentieth century , and then really took off after the second world war .
Now , only a relatively small fraction of the elderly live with their families .
However , this trend reached saturation towards the end of the twentieth century and has now begun to slightly reverse ( more on this later ) .
It seems to be generally accepted by historians and demographers that this social change was an effect of the industrial revolution and the rise of wage - based labor as the main occupation , rather than people living on the farm .
The next graph shows the decline in agricultural employment and rural population from 1790 - 1990 .
Per cent of population rural and per cent of the labour force employed in agriculture , 1790 - 1990 .
Source : Fig XI of S. Ruggles , Living Arrangements and Well - Being of Older Persons in the Past .
The effect of the Industrial Revolution is clear .
It began in Britain in the late eighteenth century and spread fairly quickly to the US by the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the ninetheenth century .
By the end of the nineteenth century , the US was the world 's largest industrial power .
Rural employment declined correspondingly .
It 's interesting to note that the early stages of the industrial revolution in the US were powered by wood .
By 1850 , when coal first showed up , agricultural employment had already fallen below 60 % of the labor force , and wood use did n't peak until around 1870 .
The US had a lot of forests , so it made sense to burn them in the new Watt steam engines ( patented 1769 ) for quite a while .
In this paper , and an update here , Ruggles uses regressions over the geographical and temporal patterns of family structure and prevalence of wage labor to argue fairly convincingly that it was the availability of industrial jobs that undermined the traditional multi-generational family .
As he summarizes the prior situation :
In the nineteenth century multigenerational families were usually formed when one child remained in the parental home after reaching adulthood to work on the family farm or business , with the anticipation of eventually inheriting it .
Even though most households did not include multiple generations at any given moment , the great majority of families went through a multigenerational phase if the parents lived long enough .
The multigenerational family was a normal stage of the pre-industrial family cycle .
Families were typically multigenerational only for a brief period , after the younger generation reached adulthood and before the older generation died .
This multigenerational phase nevertheless played an essential role in the functioning of the pre-industrial family economy .
It ensured continuity of the labour supply on farms and for other traditional livelihoods and provided economic security in old age .
The two generations were interdependent ; the elders needed their children to continue to operate the farm , but as long as the elders held the property they were ultimately in control .
With the replacement of the pre-industrial family economy by a wage - labour system , the incentives for multigenerational families disappeared .
and the process of change :
Between 1950 and 1970 , the income of the elderly doubled , but the income of the younger generation rose even faster .
In constant dollars , the income gap between the elderly and their children grew rapidly .
In 1950 , persons in their 30s and 40s made an average of $ 4,900 more than persons aged 65 or older , in 1990 dollars ; by 1970 , the gap had grown to $ 10,000 .
Even more dramatic was the growing disparity in education between the younger generation and the older one .
In the early twentieth century , when secondary education was expanding gradually , the younger generation was only slightly better educated than their elders .
In 1925 , the elderly had an average of only 1.1 fewer years of schooling than did their children .
With the rapid rise of secondary education after the turn of the century , however , that education gap expanded dramatically : by 1960 , the elderly had an average of 3.0 fewer years of schooling than did their offspring .
The author contends that the growing disparity in income and education between elderly parents and their children had profound implications for generational relations .
The traditional authority of the patriarch had depended largely on control over economic resources .
But the authority of the older generation — women as well as men — also depended on respect for their knowledge and experience .
In the rapidly changing world of the mid-twentieth century , longevity no longer was the key to useful knowledge .
The younger generation increasingly regarded their elders as relics of a bygone age .
The growing educational and economic gap between generations compounded the decline in the authority of the old .
It also meant a dramatic expansion of economic opportunity for the young .
The generation that reached adulthood after the war had unprecedented success early in life , especially in contrast to their Depression - era parents .
Social gerontologists have consistently argued that the decline in residence of the elderly with their children reflects the preferences of the elderly .
This argument has its roots in the pioneering surveys carried out in 1957 , 1962 and 1975 by Ethel Shanas , in which the elderly consistently maintained that they did not want to move in with their children ( Shanas , 1962 , 1968 ) .
The elderly say that they do not want to be a burden to their children .
When the elderly do live with their children , they are now usually dependants of their children , a living arrangement that is considerably less attractive than the dominant position of the elderly in the nineteenth - century family .
There has been much less attention paid to the preferences of the younger generation , but they are clearly just as reluctant to live with their parents as their parents are to live with them .
The rise of secondary and higher education eroded the remaining economic incentives for the younger generation to defer to their elders .
In the mid-twentieth century , after most people had begun to work for wages and agriculture had become a minor sector of the economy , young people often found jobs through parents or other family connections .
The growing gap in education between generations meant that the younger generation sought higher - status jobs , and their parents often could not help .
The increased pace of social and economic change in the twentieth century , compounded by the growing differences in education level , led to a growing cultural gap between the generations .
Thus , the residential preferences of the young may have shifted even more dramatically than did those of the old .
Although the early stages of household size decline in the industrial revolution were driven by the demise of the extended family household , the later stages have been driven by increasing fragmentation even of the nuclear family .
The following snapshot from a US Census publication gives an idea of the shift between 19990 and 2000 , which is microcosm of what 's been going on for the last fifty years :
Summary of changes in household composition 1990 and 2000 US Censuses .
Source : Figure 2 of Tavia Simmons and Grace O'Neill , Households and Families : 2000 .
As you can see , the number of married couple households decreased by 4 percentage points over that timeframe .
For another view , here 's the number of marriages and divorce per thousand population from 1950 - 2001 .
Bottom : number of marriages and divorces per 1000 population per year , United States , 1950 - 2001 .
Top : ratio of divorces / marriages each year ( this does not equal the lifetime risk of a marriage ending in divorce , but is an indicator of the relative popularity of divorces ) .
Source : # 83 in Chapter 2 of the statistical abstract of the United States for 2004 .
As you can see , most of the rise in divorce occurred during the 1960s .
However , there is at least circumstantial evidence that the cause was broadly the same as the reason for the demise of the multigenerational household - greater economic opportunities lowered the cost of getting divorced .
In particular , Ruggles again
From 1880 through 1940 , the rise in nonfarm employment was the most important contributor to the increase in the predicted frequency of divorce or separation .
After midcentury , however , nonfarm employment was saturated .
Since 1940 , the most important variable by far has been rising female participation .
The effect of female participation was especially dramatic in the period 1940 - 1970 when female participation increased from 13 % to 42 % .
In general , he argues that divorce probability is positively correlated with female employment , and negatively correlated with male income .
This is something that would probably come as no surprise to a sociobiologist .
It appears to me that there 's an overarching narrative here about the effect of industrial development on families .
The industrial system gradually ended up employing everybody it could , and as it did so , this facilitated the break - up of families into smaller and smaller units .
In particular , if you go back up to the graph of rural employment I showed above , it starts to get close to zero in the second half of the twentieth century , which is precisely when female employment starts to explode :
As the system runs out of rural men to bring into the industrial labor force , it begins employing women .
The big rise starts after 1940 , though the resulting divorce wave does n't come until the 1960s ( as the pressure on families is formally ratified with the introduction of no - fault divorce laws ) .
Eventually , this trend reaches into all corners of the labor force : by now even a majority of mothers of babies and toddlers are working :

That concludes this very quick introduction to how we got to today 's small families .
In future posts , I 'd like to look at the energetic cost of small household size , the nascent trends in the last decade to move back to larger families again , and the potential for these trends to increase and help with our various problems .
Finally , it 's worth noting that I am certainly not a social scientist and may have missed important points or trends in the literature .
Anyone who knows better should feel free to point that out in comments .

We do n't hear too much about that step - child of American wars , you know , the one in Afghanistan that was supposed to be all about capturing and bringing to justice those who instigated 9/11 , the one that we turned over to NATO once the White House decided it was time to attack and invade Iraq .
What little we do hear tends to be upbeat , such as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's most current assessment .
Today 's Los Angeles Times has an op - ed piece written by John Kiriakou ( a former CIA counter - terrorism official ) and Richard Klein ( a former State Department official ) which presents an entirely different picture .
Most Americans , still in shock over the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , approved going over to this tiny country to kick some backside in revenge .
Everyone figured it would be a quick and easy war : take down the repressive Taliban rulers , demolish the Al Qaeda training camps , capture Osama bin Laden and his cohorts : a week , maybe two .
The Russians figured Afghanistan would be a walk in the park not too long ago as well .
They got bogged down and finally limped back home .
But , we were told , we 're Americans : we 're exceptional , plus we have God and justice on our side .
A week , maybe two .
Well , it 's been close to six years and we still have some troops there , as do our allies in NATO , and things are not going so well .
In fact , Afghanistan is broken and longing for the very stability that is being promised by the Taliban we drove out .
Heckuva war , George .

Coolly , not to say coldly , Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt mount a prosecutorial brief against Israel ’s foreign and domestic policies , and against the state of Israel itself .
They describe a virtual rogue state , empowered by American wealth and might , that blocks peace at every turn , threatens its cowering neighbors with impunity , crushes the national aspirations of the Palestinians and , whenever the opportunity arises , bites the hand that feeds it .
Working tirelessly in the background is the Israel lobby , playing Iago to America ’s Othello , leading president after president down ever more dangerous paths .
Without intense pressure from the Israel lobby , the authors argue , America would not have undertaken the war in Iraq .
Most American readers will bristle at the authors ’ characterization of Israel .
This is to be expected , Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt argue , because of the completely false image of Israel and its history that has been manufactured by the Israel lobby .
As a result , Americans completely misinterpret the Palestinian issue and fail to support a productive policy that would tilt away from Israel and toward the Palestinians .
The authors state , on several occasions , their belief that Israel has a moral and legal right to exist , but the effect of their book is to leave it dangling by a moral and strategic thread .
In essence they call for the United States to cut Israel loose , to return more or less to American policy before the 1967 war , when the United States tried to occupy a middle ground between Israel and its Arab neighbors .
Strangely , the authors do not itemize the fabulous benefits delivered by this approach in the 1950s and ’60s .
It is a little odd that so chilly a book should generate such heat .
Most of Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt ’s arguments are familiar ones , and it is hardly inflammatory to point out that the major Jewish organizations tend to take a much tougher line on , say , a two - state solution to the Palestinian problem , the Iraq war or settlements in the West Bank , than most American Jews favor .
The writers stand on eminently defensible ground when they argue for a more constructive , creative American role in peace talks .
The general tone of hostility to Israel grates on the nerves , however , along with an unignorable impression that hardheaded political realism can be subject to its own peculiar fantasies .
Israel is not simply one country among many , for example , just as Britain is not .
Americans feel strong ties of history , religion , culture and , yes , sentiment , that the authors recognize , but only in an airy , abstract way .
They also seem to feel that , with Israel and its lobby pushed to the side , the desert will bloom with flowers .
A peace deal with Syria would surely follow , with a resultant end to hostile activity by Hezbollah and Hamas .
Next would come a Palestinian state , depriving Al Qaeda of its principal recruiting tool .
( The authors wave away the idea that Islamic terrorism thrives for other reasons . )
Well , yes , Iran does seem to be a problem , but the authors argue that no one should be particularly bothered by an Iran with nuclear weapons .
And on and on .
“ It is time , ” Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt write , “ for the United States to treat Israel not as a special case but as a normal state , and to deal with it much as it deals with any other country . ”
But it ’s not .
And America wo n’t .
That ’s realism .

As the flood of data across the internet continues to increase , there are those that say sometime soon it is going to collapse under its own weight .
But that is what they said last year .
Web traffic in the 90s was much smaller than today
Back in the early 90s , those of us that were online were just sending text e-mails of a few bytes each , traffic across the main US data lines was estimated at a few terabytes a month , steadily doubling every year .
But the mid 90s saw the arrival of picture - rich websites , and the invention of the MP3 .
Suddenly each net user wanted megabytes of pictures and music , and the monthly traffic figure exploded .
For the next few years we saw more steady growth with traffic again roughly doubling every year .
But since 2003 , we have seen another change in the way we use the net .
The YouTube generation want to stream video , and download gigabytes of data in one go .
" In one day , YouTube sends data equivalent to 75 billion e-mails ; so it 's clearly very different , " said Phil Smith , head of technology and corporate marketing at Cisco Systems .
" The network is growing up , is starting to get more capacity than it ever had , but it is a challenge .
" Video is real - time , it needs to not have mistakes or errors .
E-mail can be a little slow .
You would n't notice if it was 11 seconds rather than 10 , but you would notice that on a video . "
Spending our inheritance
Perhaps unsurprisingly , every year someone says the internet is going to collapse under the weight of the traffic .
The net 's backbone was built thanks to the 90s dotcom boom
Looking at the figures , that seems a reasonable prediction .
" Back in the days of the dotcom boom in the late 90s , billions of dollars were invested around the world in laying cables , " said net expert Bill Thompson .
" Then there was the crash of 2000 and since then we 've been spending that inheritance , using that capacity , growing services to fill the space that was left over by all those companies that went out of business . "
Router reliability
Much more high - speed optic fibre has been laid than we currently need , and scientists are confident that each strand can be pushed to carry almost limitless amounts of data in the form of light .
But long before a backbone wire itself gets overloaded , the strain may begin to show on the devices at either end - the routers .
" If we take a backbone link across the Atlantic , there 're billions of bits of data arriving every second and it's all got to go to different destinations , " explained Mr Thompson .
The real issue that people are going to face , and are already noticing at home , is that ISPs are starting to cut back on the bandwidth that is available to people in their homes
Bill Thompson , net expert
The manufacturer of most of the world 's routers is Cisco .
When I pushed them on the subject of router overload , they were understandably confident .
" Routers have come a long way since they started , " said Mr Smith .
" The routers we 're talking about now can handle 92 terabits per second .
" We have enough capacity to do that and drive a billion phone calls from those same people who are playing a video game at the same time they 're having a text chat . "
Congestion
Even if the routers can continue to take what the fibre delivers , there is another problem - the internet is not all fibre .
A lot of the end connections , the ones that go to our individual home computers , are made of decades - old copper .
" The real issue that people are going to face , and are already noticing at home , is that ISPs are starting to cut back on the bandwidth that is available to people in their homes , " said Mr Thompson .
" They call it bandwidth shaping .
" They do this because they have a limited capacity to deliver to 100 or 200 homes , and if everybody 's using the internet at the same time then the whole thing starts to get congested .
Before that happens they cut back on the heavy users . "
Obstacles
But digital meltdown is not the only threat facing the net .
There are other , more sudden , real world hazards which the net has to protect against .
Anything from terror attacks to , would you believe it shark bites , can and have taken out major links and routers .
It only takes an earthquake , as we saw at the end of last year , to take out a significant segment of internet infrastructure
Paul Wood , MessageLabs
" It only takes an earthquake , as we saw at the end of last year , to take out a significant segment of internet infrastructure .
Then the traffic finds another route , but it goes over a very slow route , which then becomes saturated and can't handle the bandwidth .
Then you lose the traffic and that part of the world goes dark for a while . "
For decades the internet has kept pace with our demands on it .
And demand continues to grow .
And the service providers will continue to insist that the net will survive , and the doomsayers will continue to insist that it is just about to collapse .
Delays to the Airbus A380 have cost the firm billions
The BBC's Dominic Laurie has learned that the new allegations will be given to an investigation of insider trading at EADS , the parent firm of Airbus .
The trading in shares occurred shortly before news about delays to the A380 superjumbo were made public last June .
EADS denies it knew about delays when millions of euros of shares were sold .
The announcement wiped 26 % off the value of Franco - German EADS .
New evidence
German investigators are investigating the extensive sale of stock options by certain senior managers and key shareholders before the problems with the plane were revealed .
Key French politicians in power at the time have been called in front of parliament to give evidence of what they knew about the dealings , and when .
" EADS says it has not been accused of any insider trading , that investigations are still continuing , and that it is cooperating fully with stock market authorities , " said Dominic Laurie , the BBC 's correspondent in Brussels .
" And executives who did sell shares at that time have also always said the timing was merely unfortunate - and that they had no privileged information , " he added .
However , French businessman Jean Galli -Douani told the BBC that this was not the case .
Mr Galli-Douani claims that senior executives at the firm knew about serious problems with the A380 project long before they made that information public .
His allegations stem from March last year , when Mr Galli - Douani was trying to solve a contractual dispute and he claims he could not get hold of any senior management at EADS to sort it out .
Mr Galli-Douani alleges that recently a senior executive admitted to him that at the time they could not take his calls because they were busy trying to resolve problems to do with the A380 .
This followed a previous conversation in November last year when another executive had suggested that management had been caught up with " general problems at Airbus " .
In these days of shock - and - awe travel , nobody can be sure whether a casual trip to Buffalo will end up in Syria – or as an all - expenses - paid tour of Guantanamo Bay .
For a quartet of Wilfrid Laurier University students from Kitchener - Waterloo , a two - day visit to a peace workshop in Washington , D.C. , turned into a week - long criminal case , with their car as chief suspect .
" We have n't been charged with anything , but they wo n't tell us why they want to keep our car , " said 23 - year - old Lenna Titizian , who borrowed her father 's compact Dodge to drive to Washington on Sunday with friends Adam Lewis , Kendra Foord and Jamie Adams .
Their troubles began when they entered Westminster Church in southwest Washington , where environmental and anti-war activists from the No War No Warming coalition were holding a panel discussion on peaceful protest .
" The day went smoothly , until we heard a ruckus in the back of the church and saw flashing lights , " said Lewis , a 19 - year - old political science student .
In a bizarre coincidence , the police were arresting people outside the church : an unrelated group of activists had allegedly robbed a Whole Foods store and made off with some items , which they took for the homeless .
They were quickly charged and released , but police went on with their investigation .
" Two vehicles were captured on camera , " said Lewis .
" One had Ontario plates .
The police were taking the car because they thought it was connected . "
The students had left their passports and other documents in the car " for safety . "
But police refused to hand them over before taking it away , so the group was stranded in Washington .
Although not arrested or charged with any wrongdoing , they could n't come home .
" Luckily a generous Washington couple saw me weeping in the church , and took us into their home , " said Titizian , a Laurier graduate who plans to return for a master 's degree .
By week 's end , police had returned the documents but kept the computer and electronic gadgets locked in the car .
Carless , the students were spinning their wheels .
The Canadian embassy said it could not interfere with the " criminal investigation " on the car .
The car seizure has baffled Titizian and her friends , as well as lawyers who have helped with her plight .
Some speculate it may be a fishing expedition to identify organizers of Washington protests , like one that resulted in the arrest of about 60 demonstrators this week .
" If the people who committed the crime were already released , why do they want my car ? " asked Titizian .
But , said Ron Harris , deputy general counsel of the Metropolitan Police in Washington , " if the vehicle is part of a crime it 's evidence .
If it is n't , it will be returned to the owner . "
The prime suspect – a grey 2003 Dodge SX2.0 – is far more modest than the lurid red Christine of horror movie fame , which went on a murderous rampage .
But to the Washington police , it apparently shares a suspicious past .
As they obtained a warrant to seize and search the car and its contents , it could be in for a long stretch of detention without bail .
" The situation raises serious questions about the safeguard of property and the justification of searches and seizures , " said Fritz Mulhauser , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union .
Titizian and her friends were n't given a reason the warrant .
But once the search is over , they should be able to read the affidavit .
In the meantime , the car is n't talking .
The climate - change organization that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore hopes its latest report , released Saturday , will influence governments around the world to curb greenhouse - gas emissions .
Timing is key , as world leaders prepare for a conference in Bali next month to begin updating the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the fourth in a series , and the culmination of four years of research .
The report 's summary condenses 2,500 pages of previous publications into a policy - focused 23 pages .
" With this final report , the scientists have done their job and explained that global warming is happening and we need to do something about it , " said Eben Burnham - Snyder , spokesman for the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
" We have to stop hiding behind China , and China has to stop hiding behind us . "
But there 's no guarantee the hiding by the world 's two worst environmental offenders will in fact stop .
The IPCC is credited with mainstreaming the idea that climate change is a direct result of human activity – specifically by burning fossil fuels which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
The international panel wants world governments to initiate a process under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that results in hard caps for emissions .
The IPCC hopes the report will frame the Bali meeting .
A new international climate - change deal must be settled in time to ensure that action continues after 2012 , when the current phase of the Kyoto Protocol ends .
But China and the United States are unlikely to agree to a negotiating process with that goal .
" I have no reason to suspect that the Bush administration will support a real negotiating process in Bali , " said Elliot Diringer , director of international strategies at the Pew Center on Climate Change .
" And as long as the U.S. takes that position , there is no reason for China or other developing countries to support emissions caps . "
While many policy experts doubt that a deal with teeth will emerge from Bali , they remain optimistic about the long - term future of capping greenhouse - gas emissions .
The influence of renewable energy businesses in the United States will reach around the world , said Christopher Flavin , president of Worldwatch Institute , a sustainability think tank .
" Climate change is changing the business sector , and that will soon change the political sector , " said Flavin .
" Over time these new energy industries will start to become politically influential in China , like they have in Silicon Valley . "
Critics say the Kyoto Protocol is largely symbolic , because it has not slowed global greenhouse - gas emissions .
The newest climate data available , published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggests that greenhouse - gas emissions accelerated through the early part of the decade .
" No region is decarbonizing its energy supply .
The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies , particularly China , " the study 's authors wrote .
But Flavin noted that the news out of China is n't all bad .
Worldwatch released a report last week projecting that China would become the world 's leader in renewable energy within the next three years .
While China has balked at international agreements , Flavin said , the government was moving to address climate change domestically .
China 's president , Hu Jintao , outlined his country 's plan at September 's Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .
Energy efficiency and investment in renewable energy sources are key to his plan .
Hu wants to reduce energy use per unit of GDP by 20 percent by 2010 .
Worldwatch 's analysts project that China will invest $ 10 billion in renewable energy capacity in 2007 .
" You could make a case that China has gone further than the U.S. has in embracing the kinds of national goals that are part of the commitment to reducing carbon dioxide , " Flavin said .
Kent Hughes , consulting director of the Woodrow Wilson Center 's Global Energy Initiative , believes an international agreement will eventually be hammered out that addresses greenhouse - gas emissions .
" Longer - term , I 'm a bit more optimistic , because there has been a shift in public thinking about climate change , " he said .
" But I think we 'll be at this for the rest of the century . "

One More for Impeachment
Submitted by davidswanson on Mon , 2007-09 - 10 18:37 .
Congress | Impeachment
By David Swanson
Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick is now listed on the official congressional list of cosponsors of H Res 333 , articles of impeachment against the Vice President .
That makes 19 official cosponsors , plus the original sponsor Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
Impeachment advocates have long considered Congressman Ed Towns to be a cosponsor because he phoned Kucinich ’s office during the August recess and signed on in front of a number of his constituents who had urged him to do so .
But Towns is not yet listed as an official cosponsor .
For the list of cosponsors , content of the bill , and how you can ask your Congress Member to sign on , see ( Original Article )

Facebook WASHINGTON 
Ten years after Congress banned sales of sexually explicit material on military bases , the Pentagon is under fire for continuing to sell adult fare , such as Penthouse and Playmates In Bed , that it does n't consider explicit enough to pull from its stores .
Dozens of religious and anti-pornography groups have complained to Congress and Defense Secretary Robert Gates that a Pentagon board set up to review magazines and films is allowing sales of material that Congress intended to ban .
" They 're saying ' we 're not selling stuff that 's sexually explicit ' … and we say it 's pornography , " says Donald Wildmon , head of the American Family Association , a Christian anti-pornography group .
A letter - writing campaign launched Friday by opponents of the policy aims to convince Congress to " get the Pentagon to obey the law , " he adds .
ON DEADLINE : Dept. of Defense responds
In an Aug. 15 letter to the groups , Leslye Arsht , a deputy undersecretary of Defense , said the Pentagon 's Resale Activities Board of Review uses appropriate guidelines to review material for sale .
This year , the board reviewed Penthouse and several Playboy publications and determined that " based solely on the totality of each magazine 's content , they were not sexually explicit , " Arsht wrote .
However , the board did decide to bar the sale of several videos found by the anti-pornography groups at military stores , including Girls Night In and Wet .
The Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996 bars stores on military bases from selling " sexually explicit material . "
It defines that as film or printed matter " the dominant theme of which depicts or describes nudity " or sexual activities " in a lascivious way . "
Challenged as a First Amendment violation , the law was upheld by a U.S. appeals court in 2002 .
" The ( Pentagon's ) lawyers … determined that for a magazine to be found lewd and lascivious , a certain percentage of the content would have to fall under that category , " says Steve Sellman , a retired Pentagon official who chaired the resale board in the late 1990s .
" We looked to see how much of ( a magazine ) was articles or advertising that had no sexual content . "
About 67 % of the 473 " titles " reviewed have been barred , the Pentagon says .
Defense officials " do n't want to take porn away from soldiers , " says Patrick Trueman , a former federal prosecutor who now works with the Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal group .
" They say , ' well , 40 % of this magazine is sexually explicit pictures , but 60 % is writing or advertising , so the totality is not sexually explicit . '
That 's ridiculous . "
Rep. Roscoe Bartlett , R - Md. , who sponsored the law , says the military is skirting Congress ' intent .
He notes the material also could contribute to a hostile environment for female military personnel .
" If soldiers want to read that stuff , they can walk down the street and buy it somewhere else , " Bartlett says .
" I do n't want ( the military ) to help . "
Nadine Strossen , a New York Law School professor who heads the American Civil Liberties Union , says the law effectively censors what troops get to read in remote areas or combat zones .
" We 're asking these people to risk their lives to defend our Constitution 's principles … and they 're being denied their own First Amendment rights to choose what they read , " she said .

Dependency upon imported energy undermines UK national security and will have potentially dire consequences for the balance of trade .
Not so long ago the UK was self sufficient in these energy resources but now we are importing increasing amounts of all three .
In 2006 , 92 % of the primary energy consumed in the UK was derived from fossil solar fuels - oil , natural gas and coal .
UK Primary Energy Consumption - basic statistics
A beneficial attribute of the BP annual statistical review of world energy ( used throughout this report ) is that it shows primary energy consumption for the 5 principal energy sources normalised to millions of tonnes of oil equivalent .
This eases comparison of energy consumption from oil , natural gas , coal , nuclear and hydroelectric power as shown for the UK ( click all charts to enlarge ) .
In 1965 ( when BP records begin ) 98 % of UK primary energy was derived from burning fossil solar fuels for transporation and power generation purposes .
By 2006 , the proportion of fossil solar in the energy mix had fallen marginally to 92 % - largely due to an increase in nuclear energy .
In this period , the energy mix has changed significantly .
In 1965 , no natural gas was used .
But with the discovery and development of offshore natural gas in the North Sea , the proportion of natural gas in the UK energy mix has increased steadily since 1968 largely at the expense of burning coal .
In 1965 , the UK population was 54,350,000 and this had grown to 60,245,000 by 2005
This equates to 3.6 tonnes oil equivalent per person per annum in 1965 and 3.8 tonnes oil equivalent per person per annum in 2005 .
UK per capita energy consumption has been essentially flat in the period .
Energy efficiency gains in transportation , building standards and in more energy efficient appliances have been lost to an overall rise in living standards and more prolific use of energy in transportation , single occupancy dwellings , foreign travel etc .
Each person in the UK uses on average 10 kgs of oil equivalent energy every day .
The main message of this post is that it is in the vital national interest that this profligate level of energy consumption ( and waste ) is substantially reduced .
I will now look at the oil , natural gas and coal production and consumption records for the UK for the past 40 years and show how swings from deficit to surplus and back to deficit have affected our overall balance of trade .
I will also examine oil and gas production forecasts for the period to 2012 and project how this will affect the trade balance and energy security .
Oil and gas prices
Historic average annual oil and gas prices are lifted from the BP statistical review .
Inflation adjusted prices based on 2005 $ US have been used .
Future oil and gas prices are of course impossible to predict with certainty .
However , as a central aim of this post is to illustrate the potential impact of energy imports upon UK trade balance it is essential to make assumptions about future energy costs .
Future oil prices are based upon the oil price model presented here .
This translates to an average 16 % increase per annum to 2012 .
Year $ US / barrel 2007 70 2008 80 2009 90 2010 110 2011 130 2012 160
Future gas prices are based on a 5 % annual increase as shown below .
BP quote gas production figures in BCM ( billions of cubic meters ) whilst prices are quoted in millions of BTUs ( British thermal units ) .
To convert , from BCM to BTU millions the former is multiplied by 36 million ( see sheet on conversion factors in the BP review ) .
Year $ US / million BTU 2007 7.4 2008 7.7 2009 8.1 2010 8.5 2011 9.0 2012 9.4
Future price estimates do not include adjustment for monetary inflation or changes in exchange rates .
It is taken for granted that some may view the future oil and gas price estimates as too high whilst others may take the view they are too low .
Future price estimates are presented for illustrative purposes only .
Oil
The historic oil production and consumption data shows large UK oil imports pre 1976 .
Once North Sea oil production got underway , imports were gradually reduced until in 1981 , the UK became a net oil exporter .
The UK remained an oil exporter until 2005 .
But in 2006 , with falling production the UK once again resumed importing oil .
1.74 million barrels per day is a key figure for the UK as this represents the approximate level of daily oil consumption .
If we produce more than this amount we can sit back and relax in the sure knowledge that our oil needs can be met from domestic supplies .
Less than 1.74 million barrels per day means that the UK must compete for oil imports in the increasingly competitive world oil export market .
What will happen next ?
Three oil production forecasts are shown :
The first is by Alex Kemp who is Schlumberger Professor of Petroleum Economics at the University of Aberdeen .
Professor Kemp has recently been appointed as energy economics advisor to the Scottish Parliament .
The details of the Kemp forecast can be found here .
The second is by myself ( Mearns2 ) the details of which can be found here and here .
The third is by the UK Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) who have responsibility for compiling UK oil and gas production forecasts and reporting those to the UK government .
The DTI produce a forecast range .
The upper range boundary is more or less coincident with Kemp whilst the lower range boundary is more or less coincident with Mearns2 .
Given this coincidence , the discussion will only consider the Kemp and Mearns2 forecasts .
The key difference between the Kemp and Mearns2 forecasts is that Kemp sees production rising this year and next and this mainatins the UK oil exporter status for a few years yet .
The Mearns2 forecast sees the UK as a permanent oil importer with annual production declining at a rate of around 8 % per annum .
The impact these different forecasts have upon the UK trade balance is quite profound .
At times of high oil prices , oil exporters are handsomly rewarded whilst importers are penalised .
The falling production and rising oil price implicit in the Mearns2 model shows the UK oil trade balance plunging from a surplus of over £ 5 billion in 2000 to a deficit of over £ 20 billion by 2012 .
Which forecast is more likely to be correct ?
Only time will tell .
Near term , the biggest impact upon UK oil production is the giant Buzzard Field that came on stream in January 2007 .
Production from Buzzard has pushed the UK into oil surplus for the first 4 months of the year according to the DTI Table et3_10 ( XL spread sheet ) .
However , oil and NGL production was 3.8 % lower for Jan-April compared with the same period last year and I calculate an average daily production rate of 1.74 million bpd which is bang on UK average consumption levels and slightly higher than my forecast of 1.67 million bpd for the full year .
Offshore maintenance programs combined with the relentless impact of decline means that production during the first half of the year is normally higher than during the second half and I would judge that my forecast for the full year is looking good .
Natural gas
Offshore natural gas production in the UK got underway in earnest around 1968 .
Production grew steadily for over 30 years and peaked in 2000 and since then gas production has fallen , gradually at first , and then accelerated decline since 2003 .
Up until around 1995 , most domestic gas production was consumed within the UK .
Domestic gas production was allowed to substitue for coal in home heating and in power generation resulting in cleaner air in our cities and helping to solve the acid rain problem associated with burning sulphur rich UK coal in power stations .
Up until 1995 the UK also imported North Sea natural gas from Norway and Holland .
But then in an extraordinary bout of bravado , the UK exported gas for a brief spell between 1996 and 2003 .
The UK has become hooked on natural gas for home heating and power generation and with plummeting production faces serious issues in securing future supplies .
The production forecast is the DTI median forecast and combining this with assumed constant consumption produces an import requirement of over 40 bcm per annum in 2012 .
It is by no means certain that consumption will stay constant as new gas fired power generation plants are still being sanctioned and built !
The UK has pinned future gas supplies on a two pronged strategy .
The most important strand is the new Langeled pipeline to Norway .
This is the world 's longest sub-sea pipeline starting at the Ormen Lange gas field off Mid Norway and ending in Easington , Yorkshire in the UK .
At its peak , Ormen Lange will produce around 22 bcm per annum or around one half of the projected UK import requirement in 2012 .
It has to be noted that the UK will compete with continental Europe for Ormen Lange gas .
The second strand is to import liquified natural gas ( LNG ) , especially from the North Field in Qatar .
The UK will have to compete with the whole of the natural gas importing world to secure these supplies .
Three terminals have been built :
The Isle of Grain with import capacity of 4.4 bcm per annum
Milford Haven ( Dragon ) with import capacity of 3 bcm per annum
Milford Haven ( South Hook ) with initial import capacity of 10.5 bcm per annum
The combined LNG capacity of 17.9 bcm per annum plus Ormen Lange capacity of 22 bcm per annum provides the magic number of 39.9 bcm per annum compared with the projected import requirement of 40 bcm per annum by 2012 .
So long as no one else wants that Norwegian and Qatari gas the UK should be OK .
UK government sources report Isle of Grain at 5 to 15 bcm per annum and Milford Haven at 10 to 25 bcm per annum .
Whilst there may be doubts about the availability of gas for import to the UK , there seems to be unanimous agreement on the fact that the UK will have to import ever increasing amounts of gas for the foreseeable future and the imapct this will have upon the trade balance is shown below .
A surplus of £ 1 billion in 2000 is converted to a deficit of £ 8 billion by 2012 .
Note that this model assumes no growth in domestic gas consumption and a relatively modest increase in gas prices .
There is also the possibility that the DTI forecast for domestic gas production proves over - optimistic .
This chart taken from a UK government report shows gas demand increasing to 2020 and a gas import requirement of 100 bcm per anum .
How many LNG cargoes is that ?
LNG ships have current capacity of around 2.8 bcf .
That translates to around 0.07 bcm , suggesting that the UK alone would require around 1400 LNG deliveries per annum to meet this import requirement .
Coal
Back in 1965 ( when BP records begin ) coal accounted for around 60 % of UK primary energy consumption and most of that was met by domestic supply .
Both domestic production and consumption of coal fell steadily from 1965 to 1999 when coal accounted for only 16 % of UK energy consumed .
The spike down in 1984 represents the miners ' strike .
Since 1999 coal consumption as a percentage has once again begun to rise and in 2006 it represented 19 % of the UK total .
So much for the UK government 's feigned concern about global warming .
Faced with the choice of switching off the lights , saving the planet and reaping the anger of the electorate , the UK government has made the pragmatic decision to keep the lights on , come what may , whilst voicing concerns for the welfare of polar bears .
In plotting these data I was somewhat surprised to see that the UK was once a significant exporter of coal and need to note that the production / consumption figures in tonnes do not agree with the BP data when transformed into BOE as shown in the next diagram .
This shows the UK as a net coal importer since the 1980s .
The trends , however , are the same , and show increasing dependence of the UK upon imported coal .
We have had much debate recently on The Oil Drum about the status of UK and Global coal reserves .
See for example :
The Coal Question and Climate Change
COAL - The Roundup
Coal reserves and resources - a gentle cough
I tend to side with Heading Out on this debate and take the view that the UK has substantial deep coal resources that are uneconomic in the current economic and political climate .
I think this climate is about to change and that a soaring energy trade deficit ( see below ) will result in a political decision to subsidise new deep UK coal mines in order to protect UK energy security and mitigate the plummeting trade deficit .
Energy and Trade Balance
Pulling all the data together for oil , gas and coal with nuclear and hydro provides the following picture of the overall UK energy balance .
Note that following consultation with Jerome , I have shown nuclear as domestic supply due to the fact that the cost of importing uranium is a negligible part of the total cost of nuclear power ( this is open to debate ) .
What we see is that during the 1960s and 1970s , the UK was a major importer of energy , mainly oil .
At that time oil was cheap and the UK had a large manufacturing base , exporting goods all over the world .
Trade back then was balanced ( see below ) .
The advent of North Sea oil and gas resulted in a golden era of energy surplus from 1980 to 2004 .
However , with falling North Sea oil and gas production the energy balance is now plunging back into the red .
So are we to return to the circumstances of the 1960s and 1970s ?
The answer is no !
Back then energy was cheap and plentiful and the UK had a major manufacturing and export base .
International energy supplies are now increasingly expensive , increasingly scarce , sourced from increasingly hostile geographic and political environments and our economy has lost much of its manufacturing export base that once enabled us to pay our way .
The UK trade balance has 3 main components : 1 ) goods , 2 ) oil and gas , and 3 ) services .
The latter is made up mainly of financial services channelled through the major finance centres of London and Edinburgh .
The chart is compiled from official government statistics using table 300570782 .
I have deducted oil and gas receipts from the goods column ( IKBJ ) to provide a separate picture for goods ( less oil gas ) and for Oil & Gas receipts .
From 1980 to 2004 , the rapidly deteriorating trade deficit in goods was partly offset by surpluses in services and Oil & Gas .
The Oil & Gas surplus , however , has now disappeared and the deficit looks set to get much worse as shown .
The trade deficit of £ 54 billion recorded in 2006 looks set to hit £ 100 billion per annum by 2012 .
The government and main stream media ( MSM ) appear to be extremely sanguine about these eye popping numbers and one reason is that the deficit normalised to the size of the growing economy is much less significant .
In percentage terms , the annual deficit is no worse now than on occasions in the past .
The absence of a period of surplus for the last 20 years , however , is resulting in the cumulative deficit expanding .
Can the cumulative deficit be allowed to expand forever and how will it be repaid ?
One of the main points of this post is to point out that rising North Sea oil and gas production rescued the UK trade balance during the 1980s and 1990s .
The solution then is the problem now .
Ballooning energy imports are set to make deterioration in the trade balance a whole lot worse .
Government response
The UK government is fully committed to private companies running our energy production and energy distribution industries and to a large extent our transportation infrastructure .
These companies have one motive and that is to maximise turnover and profits via the eternal growth paradigm .
The government tends only to interfere at the margin via regulation , taxation and occasionally setting strategy .
In recent years the government has :
1. Supported a massive expansion of UK airports
2. Supported on - going expansion of the road network
3 . Shied away from increasing taxation on energy consumption
4. Introduced and then doubled windfall taxation on the profits of North Sea operating comapnies
5 . Prevaricated about climate change , conservation and renewable energy without taking any decisive action .
The whole energy debate is shrouded in a carbon dioxide mist whilst the main thrust of policy has been to encourage the expansion of fossil fuel based transportation and to penalise the energy producers .
The measures supported by the government are in my opinion the exact opposite of what are required to provide greater energy security for the UK .
What needs to be done ?
The answer here is very simple .
Domestic energy production should be maximised whilst energy consumption should be minimised .
The strategy needs to be set within the context of national interest and energy security instead of being obscured by the fog of climate change .
1 . The primary energy policy goal should be for the UK to remain in balance with respect to primary energy production and consumption .
2 . To achieve this , domestic energy production should be expanded and in the near term this will inevitably mean expanding domestic coal production , nuclear energy and renewables with proven high ERoEI which for the UK means hydro electric and wind power .
2b . Construct a network of combined heat and power generators running on combustible domestic , industrial and agricultural waste .
Expanding these energy sources will unlikely replace the decline in domestic oil and gas supplies and the other side of the equation is conservation .
3 . Meaningful energy conservation measures requires a clear and detailed understanding of where most energy is consumed by our society and a first step to conservation should be to audit our energy consumption patterns .
Where is most energy being wasted and where can the easiest and least painful conservation measures be made ?
I suspect that government buildings ( schools , hospitals , government housing and offices ) and industry are profligate wasters of energy .
4 . Set staged targets for per capita energy use reduction and identify stategies to achieve them .
This must be linked to the primary objective of achieving energy balance which will likely require large incisions to be made in energy consumption .
5. Cars / automobiles are an obvious target and I would advocate aggressive legislation on motor efficiency that will inevitably mean reduced engine size , power and weight .
6 . The strategy for cars should combine with a strategy for phased electrification of the automobile fleet and a proper evaluation / feasibility study of implementing V2G ( vehicle to grid ) technology combined with expansion of renewable energy sources .
7. Electrified mass transit systems should be built where possible .
8. Encourage pan-European taxation of jet fuel .
9. Legislate to discourage single occupancy dwellings and to encourage multi-occupancy .
This has the added benefit of solving the apparent shortage of housing and will save the enormous energy cost of building millions of new homes .
10 . Legislate to upgrade building standards for homes , industry and public buildings including the incorporation of micro renewables .
Enable the upgarding of the existing building stock to improve energy efficiency - ensuring all the while that measures introduced do actually result in significant energy savings .
11 . Audit our food production and distribution systems .
Legislate in favour of energy efficiency which will inevitably limit choice .
Ensure the energy infrastructure exists to guarantee our future food supplies .
12 . Mount a public awareness exercise aimed at informing the public about decisions about energy use that are to be made on their behalf and their best interests .
These may seem draconian measures but they are in fact intended to provide a " business as usual model " for the UK based on using significantly less energy .
There will inevitably be certain business casualties .
But many new business opportunities will also be created .
The alternative may be to face real energy shortages in 2 to 8 years time when the anticipated supplies of imported natural gas and oil do not appear .
Energy shortages combined with spiralling energy costs and energy import bills may paralyse our economy .
Energy lost from hot engines could save billions of dollars if it could be captured and converted into electricity via thermoelectric devices , Clemson University physicist Terry Tritt told scientists gathered in Dallas for the world - renowned NanoTX ’07 conference .
Tritt delivered an address at the Alan MacDairmid Memorial Nano Energy Summit on challenges in alternative energy , specifically thermoelectricity used to generate electrical energy from waste heat .
“ Thermoelectric generators are currently used in NASA ’s deep - space probes to convert the heat of radioactive elements to electrical energy , powering these systems for over 30 years , ” Tritt said .
“ Thermoelectric energy conversion is a solid - state technology that is environmentally friendly .
One of the more promising ‘ down - to - earth ’ applications lies in waste - heat recovery in cars . ”
Tritt said more than 60 percent of the energy that goes into an automotive combustion cycle is lost , primarily to waste heat through the exhaust or radiator system .
“ Even at the current efficiencies of thermoelectric devices , 7 to 8 percent , more than 1.5 billion gallons of diesel could be saved each year in the U.S. if thermoelectric generators were used on the exhaust of heavy trucks .
That translates into billions of dollars saved , ” Tritt said .
Clemson research focuses on developing higher - efficiency thermoelectric materials that could increase savings significantly .
Research on the electrical and thermal properties of new materials could reduce the world ’s reliance on fossil fuels and has shown promise with two classes of materials : low - dimensional systems for enhanced electrical properties and increased phonon scattering that leads to inherently low thermal conductivity .
Tritt heads up the Department of Energy ’s Center of Excellence in Thermoelectric Materials Research at Clemson , one of the leading laboratories for thermoelectric materials in the world .
The national center focuses on the next generation of thermoelectric materials for power conversion and refrigeration .
Researchers in physics , materials science and chemistry screen promising new classes of materials in order to achieve higher - performance thermoelectric materials .
DOE recently renewed the program with more than $ 1 million a year in research funding for the next three years .
NanoTX , presented by Semiconductor Industry Association , highlights advances in nanoscience and explains how nanotechnology is being used today and how it will impact a broad range of industries tomorrow , including electronics , energy , aerospace , defense , biomedicine , robotics , chemicals and more .
The United Nations control freaks seek to micro-manage all aspects of our lives , and this includes the Internet .
Many have used the Internet as an instrument of truth to counter the spin , lies , and disinformation spewed by the mainstream media .
That is not to say that everyone in the alternative media can be trusted , and furthermore , the Internet is also being used to spread government propaganda .
The mainstream media and government are so intertwined , and often the media simply parrots and toes the line .
In many cases , the Internet gives the other side of the story with different points of view which encourage critical thinking on important issues of the day , where as the corporate media caters to the dumb - downed public .
More and more people are moving to the web for their source of news and entertainment , and in the process are abandoning television and newspapers altogether .
Even with all its imperfections , the Internet is truly one of the last havens of free speech and offers an alternative to the corporate - controlled media .
Attacks are coming from all directions , and there is a desire by some to shut down the Internet under its current format , and curb , control , and further restrict its access .
The Internet has become a vast worldwide infrastructure which more and more people rely on in their everyday lives .
It is a free market of ideas and creativity , and has accelerated our capacity to share information .
In the process it has challenged the mainstream media 's monopoly on news gathering and has lead to unpopular legislation being defeated that might not have been otherwise .
That is not to say that you should believe or trust everything you read on the Internet , but there are many creditable and well - researched sites and archived news information .
The Internet has become a force in politics , and no where is that more apparent than Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul 's campaign .
It has been used to rally grassroots support and volunteers , and raise substantial amounts of money .
There is also a lot of fear - mongering surrounding the net as many are warning that it is struggling to survive under the strain of technical limitations .
There has been much speculation that Internet 2 , which is used by universities working side by side with government and industry , could replace the current format .
The Internet of today poses a threat to any illegitimate government , and the stage is being set to hand over its control to the United Nations .
The UN wishes to end U.S. control of the Internet , and at the same time silence many who oppose its agenda of world governance .
At the 2006 World Summit on the Information Society , the Internet Governance Forum ( IGF ) was created as a permanent standing body .
The Internet of today is run by a non-governmental organization , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , which has the task of managing the assignment of domain names and IP addresses .
They do not decide who can and cannot access the Internet , and there is a genuine fear that shifting ICANN control over to the UN could facilitate censorship of the web .
The IGF recently met in Brazil , and is being used by the UN to achieve control of the Internet in an effort to standardize legislation and fund their world government through a series of global taxes .
The UN has talked about keeping the world safe from SPAM , cyber crime , terrorists , increasing Internet access to the third - world , and instituting a global e-mail taxation system .
A ban on taxing the Internet in the U.S. recently received a seven year extension .
Some are warning that UN control could lead to a slower and more expensive Internet .
Any challenges and problems that face the Internet cannot be solved by the UN or any another global entity .
That is not to say that the Internet is perfect the way it is now , but I would take the status quo over UN control .
By controlling the Internet , the UN could severely restrict information , silence free speech , and quell dissent .
China 's massive censorship of the web is the UN model .
The Heritage Foundation said of UN control of the net , “ it would give meddlesome governments the opportunity to censor and regulate the medium until its usefulness as a vehicle for freedom of expression and international competition is crippled . ”
An Internet governed and managed by the UN would represent a serious threat to our freedom , sovereignty , economy , and security .
China has been leading the charge to further globalize Internet control , their technological capabilities have further enabled them to track and restrict access and they have exported such tools to other countries .
Companies such as Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo are also accomplices in Chinese Internet censorship , and their involvement and complacency illustrates how this could be achieved anywhere .
Recently , Yahoo settled a case with two Chinese journalists who were jailed for ten years as a result of information of their on line activities provided to Chinese authorities .
Google is hypocritical as they state that Internet censorship is a threat to their business , yet censor their own website in China .
Asia director of Human Rights Watch , Brad Adams said , “ When companies like Yahoo , Microsoft , and Google decide to put profits from their Chinese operations over the free exchange of information , they are helping to kill that dream . ”
Many western computer companies are providing filtering equipment to the Communist Chinese government , and are aiding to suppress free speech and political activism , which is leading to the further control and management of information .
In China , there are divisions inside the police department whose task is to delete any information they find harmful that could challenge the system and impede social stability .
Chinese President HU Jintao said that Internet cultural units need to , “ take on the responsibility of encouraging development of a system of core socialist values . ”
There is no room for dissenting voices , and thus access to many political websites has been blocked or is content - censored .
Bloggers are being targeted , and any breaking news that has not been reported by the official government media is also blocked and censored .
Thousands of Internet cafes have been closed , and there are even pop-ups that worn users not to access unapproved sites .
Amnesty International campaign director Tim Hancock said , “ The Chinese model of an Internet that allows economic growth but not free speech or privacy is growing in popularity , from a handful of countries five years ago to dozens of governments today who block sites and arrest bloggers . ”
There is an agenda by some to further tighten surveillance and restrict access to the Internet around the world .
Many other countries besides China are filtering Internet content in areas of politics , religion , and sex .
Any effort to curb hate speech could constitute a ban on any speech the government disapproves of or fears .
In late September , a bill was introduced in Australia 's Parliament that would give the police the power to control which sites can and cannot be accessed .
In Malaysia , there are new rules where by bloggers can be held without trial indefinitely .
Many bloggers are being prosecuted using terrorism laws .
Much of the control aimed at the Internet centers around terrorism , with the aim of preventing terrorists from using it as a tool to further achieve their goals .
A definition of the terrorists could include anyone who criticizes the government .
With the advent of the alternative and independent media , and bloggers alike , the days of media blackouts are a thing of the past .
In many cases , they are breaking more stories than the mainstream media .
For many , the Internet is the only true source of uncensored news and opinion .
The battle for the Internet rages on with freedom of speech hanging in the balance .
In his article , ' What The Chinese Style Internet Will Look Like , ' PrisonPlanet .
Com reporter Paul Joseph Watson said , “ The new Internet will be nothing more than an electronic police state , merely acting as a tool for authorities to track down and incarcerate dissidents who dare question the government . ”
The United Nations is undermining our sovereignty , independence , and security .
They seek to control the environment as well as the oceans of the world through the Law of the Sea Treaty .
The U.N. wishes to institute a global ban on guns , and the disarming of the population can only be seen as tyrannical .
It is not surprising that they also wish to control the free - flow of information on the Internet as it has been used as a weapon in the info war and has sparked a mass awaking .
Many are using the Internet as a resource tool that has lead to countless research and investigations that demand real answers .
This is exactly why the global elite want the Internet controlled , much like it is in China .
It would mean the end of free speech on the web , and any site that criticizes the government .
The days of the Internet as we now know it are numbered .

Abstract Evolutionary theory predicts that senescence , a decline in survival rates with age , is the consequence of stronger selection on alleles that affect fertility or mortality earlier rather than later in life .
Hamilton quantified this argument by showing that a rare mutation reducing survival is opposed by a selective force that declines with age over reproductive life .
He used a female - only demographic model , predicting that female menopause at age ca. 50 yrs should be followed by a sharp increase in mortality , a “ wall of death . ”
Human lives obviously do not display such a wall .
Explanations of the evolution of lifespan beyond the age of female menopause have proven difficult to describe as explicit genetic models .
Here we argue that the inclusion of males and mating patterns extends Hamilton 's theory and predicts the pattern of human senescence .
We analyze a general two - sex model to show that selection favors survival for as long as men reproduce .
Male fertility can only result from matings with fertile females , and we present a range of data showing that males much older than 50 yrs have substantial realized fertility through matings with younger females , a pattern that was likely typical among early humans .
Thus old - age male fertility provides a selective force against autosomal deleterious mutations at ages far past female menopause with no sharp upper age limit , eliminating the wall of death .
Our findings illustrate the evolutionary importance of males and mating preferences , and show that one - sex demographic models are insufficient to describe the forces that shape human senescence .

Introduction Evolutionary theory [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] predicts that human survival rate declines at old ages because selection against mutations that reduce survival weakens with age .
Hamilton [ 1 ] used one - sex ( female ) demography [ 3 ] to show that selection against a rare mutation at an autosomal locus that reduces survival at any age is proportional to a female 's expected survival - weighted reproduction past that age .
Thus selection to maintain survival should decline with age , favoring pleiotropic alleles that have positive effects at young ages and negative effects at older ages , and allowing alleles that are simply deleterious at old ages to reach a high frequency .
Because selection to maintain survival should fall to zero after female menopause by age 55 yrs [ 4 ] , accumulation of mutations that reduce old - age survival rates should lead to a sharp rise in mortality at female menopause ( Fig. 1 ) , aptly called a “ wall of death . ”
But 31 % of people live past age 55 yrs in human hunter gatherer populations ( life expectancy 33.5 yrs ) [ 5 ] .
Life expectancy in today 's industrialized countries is 75 – 85 yrs [ 6 ] , and mortality increases gradually , not suddenly , with age after female menopause [ 4 ] .

The wall of death .
This figure shows the force of selection by age , S( x ) , as a fraction of the force of selection at birth , S( 0 ) , as described by Hamilton using female - only demography .
( a ) Hamilton 's one - sex force of selection at age x ( shown relative to its value at birth ) falls to zero with the decline of remaining survival - weighted female reproduction .
b is the inverse of the top panel .
In mutation - selection balance , the frequency of deleterious mutant alleles is expected to be proportional to 1/S , where S is the force of selection for a dominant or semi- dominant allele .
The inverse of the force of selection is an indicator of age - specific mortality .
The rapid increase in mortality at female menopause is the ‘ wall of death . ’
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000785.g001
Ecological explanations for lifespan beyond the age of female menopause have focused on the value of transfers from the old to the young as measured by gains in fitness .
Hawkes [ 7 ] and colleagues made the qualitative argument that grandmothers advantage their daughters and granddaughters through care of grandchildren .
Lee [ 8 ] makes a quantitative analysis of the fitness benefit of transfers between age groups .
Kaplan and Robson [ 9 ] argued that the presence of older people maximizes fitness as measured by economic efficiency , and Shanley and Kirkwood [ 10 ] argued that older females enhance the survival of young .
Support for these explanations of observed patterns of senescence is in the form of correlations [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] , or simulations [ 8 ] .
But these studies are not framed as models that track the gene frequency of rare survival - altering mutations , and thus do not yet extend Hamilton 's framework .
In contrast , Rogers [ 11 ] , tracks gene frequency change in asking whether a tradeoff between a female 's future reproduction and the enhanced survival of her offspring could explain the evolution of menopause .
But his results are inconclusive and we conclude that such tradeoffs alone are not likely to explain female patterns of senescence .
In the context of Hamilton 's theory , Charlesworth [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] and Marlowe [ 14 ] suggested that senescence may be keyed to the fact that human males can reproduce at high ages .
But reproductive potential does not imply reproductive fitness : the latter must derive indirectly from the reproductive fitness of females .
While there have been major steps forward in our understanding of the evolution of senescence , Medawar 's “ unsolved problem of biology ” [ 15 ] remains so .
Here we show that a great part of the problem is resolved by adding realistic patterns of mating and the resulting male fertility to Hamilton 's approach :
This can only be done using a two - sex model .
We first present data showing that observed male fertility in many human populations is nonzero between the ages of 55 and 70 .
This pattern and its implications were first discussed by Marlowe [ 14 ] using data on Tanzanian Hadza hunter - gatherers .
But we must still prove that older males contribute to selection at ages greater than female menopause .
A male - only analysis [ 12 ] cannot answer this question , and does not change Hamilton 's female - only results .
Unlike the reproduction of clonal organisms , human mating patterns depend on the age and sex structure of populations and on culturally defined rules of pairing .
Models of human evolution without these elements can yield mistaken conclusions about evolutionary processes [ 16 ] .
Here we analyze the change in frequency of a rare autosomal mutation in a two - sex demographic model , showing that selection against autosomal mutations that reduce survival after the age of female menopause is proportional to remaining male survival - weighted reproduction .
We derive expressions for the two - sex force of selection as a function of population structure and mating pattern .
Our analysis shows that old - age male fertility allows evolution to breach Hamilton 's wall of death and predicts a gradual rise in mortality after the age of female menopause without relying on “ grandmother ” effects or economic optimality .
Discussion Our analysis ( see Appendix S1 ) shows that the age - specific force of selection is a weighted average of the remaining survival - weighted reproduction in each sex .
Equation ( 1 ) tells us that after the age of last female reproduction the Hamiltonian force of selection is derived entirely from the pattern of male reproduction with younger females .
Our analysis of mating patterns shows that productive mating between men older than the age of female menopause and younger women was likely a feature of early human life .
Even when life was much shorter than today there was a reasonable supply of older males : among hunter gatherers with an expected lifespan of 33.5 yrs , the ratio of 70 yr olds to 30 yr olds was about 0.32 and to 40 yr olds was about 0.37 [ 5 ] .
Therefore natural selection should have acted against survival - reducing mutations and delayed the onset of rapid senescence for as much as two decades past female menopause .
At still older ages , we predict that mortality rates should continue to rise gradually , rather than abruptly like a wall of death , for four reasons .
First , male fertility does not fall abruptly at a specific age ; robust males ( such as chiefs or high - status males [ 23 ] , most notably in Australian aboriginal societies [ 14 ] ) could have maintained fertility at relatively high ages .
Second , older male fertility would have been higher at times when younger males faced high mortality from , e.g. , warfare or hunting effort in lean times .
Third , Charlesworth [ 12 ] showed that if some genes are beneficial at both reproductive and post - reproductive ages , then mutations that damage those genes should be selected against and late - life mortality should be restrained as a result .
Finally , the fundamental two - sex force of selection we describe here may well be enhanced by intergenerational transfers [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
The inclusion of male reproduction has two important effects on predictions of senescence , the first a consequence of the mean age of male reproduction and the second a consequence of the shape of the distribution .
If the pattern of male reproduction were identical to that of females but shifted to the right , the wall of death would still exist , but with a step - like shape between the years of last female and last male reproduction .
However , the typical male and female fertility distributions are not identical in shape .
The long tail of the male fertility distribution forestalls the rapid increase in mortality that Hamilton predicted and slows the rise towards infinity .
Methods We use Pollak 's [ 33 ] and Schoen 's [ 34 ] expositions of two - sex demography .
Female numbers by age i are F = {F i } , male numbers are M = {M i } at ages i .
Matings between a female aged i and a male aged j produce on average B ij female births in one time interval .
The functions B ij ( F , M ) satisfy standard demographic assumptions [ 33 ] .
All else fixed , births from i , j matings increase with the number of potential mates F i and M j .
We assume unions are formed in each period ; persistent unions would complicate the analysis but not change the conclusion [ 33 ] .
Marginal fertilities G n F for females are ( 2 ) evaluated at the stable equilibrium ( see Appendix S1 ) ; G n M for males is defined analogously .
Male marginal fertility at age n is nonzero in general .
The characteristic equation for stable growth is where uF and uM are the stable female and male age structures , and σ is the male - to - female sex ratio at birth .
Euler 's theorem on homogeneous functions allows us to rewrite this as ( 3 ) The result ( 3 ) is obtained by inserting the changes in survivorship and growth rate of an AB phenotype into the characteristic equation , and then using a standard Taylor expansion .
The example in Fig. 4 is constructed by using a form of Schoen 's harmonic mean model [ 34 ] in which the b i are fertility levels for females aged i , and the α ij are mating preference weights .
We constructed these weights from age gaps of marriage among the Dobe ! Kung [ 17 ] , and used empirical hunter - gatherer life tables assembled by Gurven and Kaplan [ 5 ] with life expectancy 33.5 yrs .
Female fertility distribution is chosen to represent hunter - gatherers and derived from the Ache and !
Kung .
Stationary populations for one - sex and two - sex models are computed in the usual way .

The news story in the New York Times actually painted the conviction Thursday of terrorism suspect Jose Padilla as " a significant victory for the Bush administration . "
The L.A. Times suggested something rather similar .
It was far from that .
If anything , it was a repudiation of the way the administration handled his case .
But that doesnt begin to capture the deep shame ( or anger ) Americans should feel at the way the government handled the case .
It s something of a textbook illustration of how war , declared or undeclared , as Robert Higgs explained in detail in his classic book , Crisis and Leviathan , not only leads to government bloat , but to undermining the kinds of civil and other liberties and fair - minded execution of justice on which this country used to pride itself .
Mr. Padilla , 36 , is the former Chicago gang member who converted to Islam and became sympathetic to jihadism and may well have had direct contact with al - Qaeda .
The governments chief evidence against him was an application form with his fingerprints on it that prosecutors said he filled out to attend an al - Qaeda training camp in 2000 .
But that s a far cry from the story the government told when this U.S. citizen was apprehended in Chicagos OHare Airport in 2002 .
Then - Attorney General John Ashcroft announced then that the government had foiled an " unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb " that would have caused " mass death and injury . "
We were all invited to be grateful that our brave protectors in the federal government had taken this dastardly plotter off the streets .
What happened next was unconscionable .
For whatever reason , Mr. Padilla was never charged with anything connected to a " dirty bomb " plot .
Instead he was named an " unlawful enemy combatant " and held incommunicado in a military brig for more than three years , with no charges filed against him .
As the Christian Science Monitor documented in an extensive series last week , he was subjected to complete isolation , sensory sleep deprivation , with no access to a lawyer or any other human being , and other treatment that Americans used to call torture when done by outright police states .
It s worth quoting at some length from that article to give a flavor of just how deliberately Jose Padilla was tortured :
" When suspected al - Qaeda operative Jose Padilla was whisked from the criminal justice system to military custody in June 2002 , it was done for a key purpose  to break his will to remain silent .
As a US citizen , Mr. Padilla enjoyed a right against forced self - incrimination .
But this constitutional guarantee vanished the instant President Bush declared him an enemy combatant .
" For a month , agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been questioning Padilla in New York City under the rules of the criminal justice system .
Padilla was delivered to the US Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , S.C. , where he was held not only in solitary confinement but as the sole detainee in a high - security wing of the prison .
Fifteen other cells sat empty around him .
" The purpose of the extraordinary privacy , according to experts familiar with the technique , was to eliminate the possibility of human contact .
No voices in the hallway .
No conversations with other prisoners .
No tapping out messages on the walls .
No ability to maintain a sense of human connection , a sense of place or time .
In essence , experts say , the US government was trying to break Padillas silence by plunging him into a mental twilight zone .
Padilla was not the only al - Qaeda suspect locked away in isolation .
Although harsh interrogation methods such as water - boarding , forced hypothermia , sleep deprivation , and stress positions draw more media attention , use of isolation to ‘ soften up ’ detainees for questioning is much more common .
" ’ It is clear that the intent of this isolation was to break Padilla for the purpose of the interrogations that were to follow , ’ says Stuart Grassian , a Boston psychiatrist and nationally recognized expert on the debilitating effects of solitary confinement .
Dr. Grassian conducted a detailed examination of Padilla for his lawyers . "
As Scott Horton comments on his blog for Harpers , " Under U.S. military procedures governing the treatment of captured enemy prisoners embodied in a Department of the Army Field Manual , these isolation techniques were banned .
The decision to ban them was driven more by concern about their efficacy than legality .
It s well established at this point that they dont work .
In fact , they routinely lead to false statements . "
In fact , these techniques were almost directly adapted from Soviet techniques .
It s been pretty well established by now that when the " war on terror " began and prisoners started being captured , there was almost nobody , in the CIA or elsewhere , with experience in interrogation techniques that were likely to elicit useful information about other members of a terror cell or planned activities .
So they started with handbooks prepared after the " brainwashing " scandal of the Korean War , designed to help potential American POWs resist the kinds of techniques the communists had reportedly used .
From there it was a quick step  all too quick , and almost unthinking  to adapt those very techniques to the new circumstances .
So thats what the CIA did to prisoners who were " renditioned " to secret sites overseas , thats the template used at Guantánamo and Afghanistan and Abu Ghraib , and thats the template used for a prisoner like Jose Padilla .
We will probably never know whether those techniques actually elicited any potentially useful information from Jose Padilla .
But we can be pretty sure that they broke his spirit .
He was so dispirited when it finally came time for him to go to trial that his attorneys tried to get him declared incompetent to stand trial .
He was strangely passive throughout the trial .
He had been broken , much as a horse is " broken " to bend to the will of the master .
Even as the U.S. government was breaking Jose Padilla , it was also systematically denying him the most fundamental legal rights of a citizen .
As Yale professor Jack Balkin put it :
" It s important to remember that the Bush Administration did everything it could to deny Padilla even the basic right of habeas corpus .
It argued that courts had no power to second guess the presidents determination that Padilla was an enemy of the United States and could be held in solitary confinement indefinitely .
It argued that no one had the right to contact Padilla and that no one had the right to know what the government was doing to him .
It argued that courts should defer to the presidents views about who was dangerous and who was not  that once the president declared a person an enemy , that person had all the process that was due them and courts should respect that determination .
" It argued , in short , that the president always knows best .
If the president had his way , the government , on the basis of information that never had to be tested before any neutral magistrate , could pluck any citizen off the streets , throw them in a military prison , and proceed to drive them insane .
" Those are the powers that the Bush Administration sought .
I will not mince words :
They are the powers of a dictator in an authoritarian regime .
They are the powers of the old Soviet Union , of the military junta in Argentina during the time of the disappeared . "
The administration finally charged him with activities he and others had undertaken in the 1990s only when it became obvious the Supreme Court would order him charged or released .
As Cato Institute constitutional studies senior fellow Robert Levy , who followed the case closely , put it , " for those of us concerned about the rule of law , the Padilla episode is not the way America is supposed to work . "
The Padilla cases final or semifinal outcome  its unknown as I write whether he will appeal , though his codefendants have said they will  illustrates that with few exceptions the American justice system is fully capable of handling most accused terrorists .
The extraordinary ( and extraconstitutional ) measures the administration has used against Padilla and others are not only outrageous but unnecessary .
The only consolation we might take away from this shameful episode is that most American newspapers could understand how reprehensible the treatment of Padilla was and editorialized fairly strongly against it .
But the administration has been ignoring editorials and other forms of criticism since it came to power , and its inclination to grab for even more power seems not only not to have abated but to have been whetted .

The provenance of the famous quote is in dispute but the thinking behind it is alive and well in U.S. dealings with dictators : “ He may be a son of a bitch but he is OUR son of a bitch . ”

Ascribed most frequently to the late president Franklin D. Roosevelt , the remark referred to a corrupt dictator , Nicaragua ’s Anastasio Somoza , who enjoyed U.S. backing because he served Washington ’s interests during the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union .
The Cold War is long over but the United States again distinguishes between leaders it considers dictators who are acceptable and those who are not .
Despite ringing rhetoric about freedom and democracy , superpower politics tend to be driven by practical considerations of self - interest rather than by ideals .
Washington ’s present list of acceptable dictators include General Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan , who took power in a military coup in 1999 , and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt .
The most dangerous of the unacceptable dictators , to hear U.S. officials tell it , is President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran .
Also high up on the bad dictators list : Hugo Chavez , the left - wing ( and elected ) president of Venezuela , who is using democratic ballots to tighten his hold on his country ’s institutions , a process U.S. officials have likened to Adolf Hitler ’s rise to absolute power in the 1930s .
A leader who goes out of his way to insult the U.S. president ( “ the devil ” and “ a donkey ” ) can hardly expect gentle treatment from the Bush administration but its different reaction to similar events in Pakistan and Venezuela has been striking .
When the Chavez government forced the most popular ( and anti-government ) TV network off air by refusing to renew its license , Washington was so concerned that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raised it at an Organization of American States meeting .
She demanded an OAS investigation into the closure .
“ Freedom of speech , freedom of association and freedom of conscience are not a thorn in the side of the government , ” she said .
“ Disagreeing with your government is not unpatriotic ... ”
Three cheers for Rice .
Nice words .
Freedom , freedom , freedom .
Who could disagree ?
Rice and her boss , President George W. Bush , did not wax as eloquently five months later when General Musharraf declared a state of emergency and shut down not one but all private television channels , as well as the BBC and CNN .
Musharraf ’s stick - wielding security forces rounded up thousands of opposition activists , judges and journalists .
Bush telephoned him to urge elections but issued no explicit condemnation of the crackdown , which was much harsher than anything in Venezuela .
HANDS OFF AID TO PAKISTAN
The number two in the State Department , John Negroponte , told lawmakers that the Pakistani leader is “ indispensable in the global war on terror . ”
Translation :
Do n’t even think of cutting off aid to Pakistan , which has received close to $ 11 billion since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .
The rousing speech Bush gave when he was sworn in for his second term in 2005 seemed to specifically address people like those bundled off to Pakistani jails .
“ When you stand for liberty , we will stand with you .
Democratic reformers facing repression , prison , or exile can know : America sees you for what you are -- the future leaders of a free country . ”
Bush is not the first and will not be the last U.S. president whose words on lofty ideals have little to do with his actions on the ground .
Support for democracy against dictatorship has been a key theme of U.S. foreign policy since the country rose to big power status at the turn of the 20th century .
That did not keep the U.S. from overthrowing or helping to remove leaders it did not like ( Chile ’s Salvador Allende , Guatemala ’s Jacobo Arbenz , Congo ’s Patrice Lumumba ) and propping up dictators it did ( the Shah of Iran , Congo ’s Mobutu Sese Seko , Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines ) .
The list is long .
It also includes Spain ’s iron - fisted Francisco Franco , a succession of Brazilian military leaders and Yugoslavia ’s Josip Broz Tito .
FREEDOM AGENDA : OLD WINE IN NEW BOTTLE
The “ freedom agenda ” Bush declared for his second term is merely a variation on an old theme .
Then and now , a gap between word and deed exists .
During the Cold War , siding with the United States against the Soviet Union was usually enough to win “ acceptable ” status for leaders with questionable democratic credentials .
Since the September 11 attacks , cooperation with the U.S. in the “ war against terror ” tends to divide the good from the bad .
Take the example of Kazakhstan ’s Nursulatan Nazarbayev , who was an honored guest at the White House last year .
The U.S. State Department ’s Human Rights report notes that in Kazakhstan , there are “ severe limits on citizens ’ rights to change their government ” and “ increased restrictions on freedom of speech , the press , assembly , and association . ”
On the other hand , Kazakhstan occupies a strategic location , sandwiched between Russia and China .
It also has oil , which tends to wash away the stain of anti-democratic abuses .
Otherwise , how could Equatorial Guinea ’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema , have won the label “ good friend ” from Rice when he visited Washington shortly after her own department noted her guest ’s government had a poor human rights record and “ continued to commit and condone serious abuses . ”
Equatorial Guinea is Africa ’s third - largest oil producer , behind Nigeria and Angola .
That counts for a lot in a world where talk is cheap and oil expensive .
Starting a company is cheap enough that you do n’t need to raise a lot of money to do it , but you still need to feed yourself .
A popular route is the in - between step of being an entrepreneur while still working in a corporate job .
This means there are a lot of people running companies from their cubes .
Sort of .
It ’s contrary to just about every company policy for you to set up your widget shop inside your cube and solicit your co-workers ’ business .
But most startups can skate past the corporate policy restrictions because the founder works after hours .
So the entrepreneur is sitting in the cube even if the company is not , and it makes for a difficult balancing act .
Here are ten ways to manage entrepreneurship from your corporate cubicle :
1 . Do n’t tell your co-workers .
You will want to tell them .
They will say , “ How was your weekend ? ” and you ’ll want to say , “ I got two new clients and I am feeling like a startup stud ! ”
Do n’t say that .
Even if you ’re not doing your company at your work , it still feels like cheating to a co-worker .
They do n’t want to hear you ’d rather be working on something else besides their stuff .
You need to keep a positive profile at work even while you do your startup :
The best entrepreneurs have solid networks .
2 . Do n’t blame your problems on lack of time .
It ’s certainly a luxury to have tons of time on your hands to focus on your company all day .
But most people do n’t have that .
Most people who start companies have kids or a day job or a girlfriend or college courses – something that distracts them .
Do n’t tell yourself you would do better if you had more time .
Just do better now .
Be smarter .
Everyone is short on time all the time .
It ’s not an excuse .
3 . Do n’t have guilt .
Yes it is morally questionable to be a salaried employee and turn your cube into a call center for your other business .
But you can do a ton of personal business from your cube – like call your landlord or the plumber or make plane reservation – in order to make more time to do your business from home .
Most cubicle workers spend two hours a day surfing for personal reasons .
And these people do not have side businesses at home .
So it ’s fair for you to do it , too .
4 . Get on a stupid project at work .
When you have your own business you think about it all the time .
You are responsible for everything , so there is no coasting while someone else deals with a problem or a project .
Fortunately , that sort of coasting is rampant in big companies .
So if you are starting a business at home , get on a project at work that lets you coast – that will give extra mental energy to let thoughts of your own company jump around in your head .
5 . Look for like - minded people at work .
In most companies there are some people thinking like you – trying to get something off the ground while they spend their days in their cube .
It ’s so hard to keep believing in yourself when the startup is more idea than business .
It ’s hard not to toss in the towel , but you are less likely to give up if you have other entrepreneurs in your life .
To sniff out the other entrepreneurs look for people who dash outside the building every day to take calls .
( Reality check :
If the calls are ten minutes , it ’s a startup .
If the calls are a half - hour , it ’s a new girlfriend . )
6 . Go to the gym on your lunch break .
You think you are doing something so big and so challenging and you are even holding down a full - time job while you do it , so of course you have no time to go to the gym .
But exercise provides mental traits of an entrepreneur :
You think more clearly , you are more self - confident , resilient to setback , and you become a person who inspires confidence in other people .
7 . Sit on a yoga ball instead of a chair .
Everything you need to do to have a startup and a corporate job at the same time requires self - discipline .
And this might be why entrepreneurs are happier than most people — because they have good self - discipline and people with self - discipline are more likely to get what they want in their life .
You can get self - discipline by working on your posture .
No kidding .
So get a ball chair for your cube .
Psychologist have found that if you make one , small change in your life that requires self - discipline , like improving your posture , then you are more able to make other changes in your life that require self - discipline .
8. Partner with a stay - at - home - parent .
In general , when I have started companies , I tried not to hire people with kids because they are less able to jump for investors , more torn between where their head and heart are at any given time , and anyway , today ’s parents generally do not work insanely long hours .
( Yes , this is an illegal hiring practice .
But it ’s common . )
So anyway , if you are starting a company from your cube you are missing exactly what a stay - at - home parent has : Flexibility during the work day .
One of the things that make for a successful entrepreneur is partnering with someone who can fill in the spots where you are weak , according to Andrew Zacharakis , professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College .
9 . Stop fantasizing that a credit card could fund your cubicle escape .
Especially in the current credit crunch , it ’s important to be conservative in how much you bet on this side - business of yours .
The most successful entrepreneurs are not actually huge risk takers but people who intuitively mitigate risk wherever they can , according to Saras Sarasvathy , professor of business at the University of Virginia .
The point of entrepreneurship , after all , is to get out of the cubicle , not tie yourself to it forever paying off your debt .
10 . Believe in yourself .
Entrepreneurship is lonely and frustrating .
This is not something people talk about a lot because the thing that makes entrepreneurs successful is a crazy optimism that they can create something big from nothing .
But underneath that optimism , is a fear that things will never work .
The feelings of loneliness and fear will be exacerbated in your cubicle , where you will be surrounded by people who are satisfied with stable jobs , regular paychecks , and having someone else take responsibility for the ultimate bottom line .
In your cube is the time you will have to be your best self : Confident , productive , disciplined and optimistic .
No small feat , for sure , but that ’s why entrepreneurship brings out the best in us .
That ’s why it ’s so enticing .
August , 2004 : Optimizing Pixomatic for x86 Processors : Part I
Challenging assumptions about optimization
Michael is a developer at RAD Games Tools and author of several legendary programming books , including Graphics Programming Black Book .
He can be contacted at michael_abrashhotmail.com .
For the first time in a while , I recently happened to leaf through my Graphics Programming Black Book ( http://www.ddj.com/downloads/premium/abrash/), where one of the first things I noticed was the phrase " Assume Nothing . "
And that made me think that maybe I should follow my own programming advice more often ...
You see , a couple of months ago , Jeff Roberts ( my boss at RAD Game Tools ) asked me to take a look at the low - level MP3 filter code in the Miles Sound System , an SDK that handles all aspects of sound 3D audio , digital audio , digital decompression , interactive MIDI , and the like .
This code was performance critical , so much so that it was written entirely in assembly language .
Nonetheless , Jeff wanted me to see if I could find a way to speed it up further .
In particular , he thought perhaps the code would benefit from Streaming SIMD Extension ( SSE ) , the instruction set Intel introduced with the Pentium III .
It had been a while since I had had a crack at pedal - to - the - metal x86 optimization ( I 've been working on PlayStation2 ) and I happily dove into the code .
It is complex and intricate , and not obviously amenable to the four - way parallelism of SSE , but eventually I figured out a way to bring SSE to bear .
With a day of coding , I managed to speed up the entire MP3 test application by about 10 percent .
As it turned out , that 10 percent speedup was more impressive than it seems .
When I finally got around to profiling , the low - level filter code turned out to have taken only about one - third of the total time before my optimizations , meaning that I had succeeded in speeding the low - level filter up by about 1.5 times .
Not bad .
However , profiling also revealed that an unrelated C routine was taking 40 percent of the time , considerably more than the filter code .
Obviously , my assumption that the code in assembly was the most performance critical had caused me to start optimizing in the wrong place .
Worse yet , most of the time in the C routine was taken by a tiny block of code , which did nothing more than call the library pow ( ) function with integer exponents between 0 and 15 .
Worst of all , though , it turned out that the exponent was on most of the time .
It did n't take a whole lot of research or deep thinking to figure out a faster way to raise a number to the first power than calling pow ( ) !
I converted this bit of code over to using a switch ( ) statement to handle the various cases directly with multiplication ( and to handle an exponent of one by doing nothing ) , all of which took about five minutes .
In return , I got an overall speedup in the MP3 test of about 1.4× four times what I had gotten from my heroic assembly language optimizations .
" Assume Nothing " is probably the oldest , simplest , and least - specific optimization principle I 've ever come up with .
Every so often , however , I am reminded yet again that I ignore it at my peril .
So as I examine a variety of optimization techniques in this article , remember that any technique is only as good as the assumptionsor , preferably , knowledge that you base it on .
Pixomatic
In this three - part article , I discuss the process of optimizing Pixomatic , an x86 3D software rasterizer for Windows and Linux written by Mike Sartain and myself for RAD Game Tools ( http://www .radgametools.com / ) .
Pixomatic was perhaps the greatest performance challenge I 've ever encountered , certainly right up there with Quake .
When we started on Pixomatic , we were n't even sure we'd be able to get DirectX 6 ( DX6 ) features and performance , the minimum for a viable rasterizer .
( DirectX is a set of low - level Windows multimedia APIs that provide access to graphics and audio cards . )
I 'm pleased to report that we succeeded .
On a 3 - GHz Pentium 4 , Pixomatic can run Unreal Tournament 2004 at 640×480 , with bilinear filtering enabled .
On slower processors , performance is of course lower , but by rendering at 320×240 and stretching up to 640×480 , then drawing the heads - up display ( HUD ) at full resolution , Unreal Tournament 2004 runs adequately well , even on a 733 - MHz Pentium III .
In the end , we exceeded our design goals .
With Version 2.0 , Pixomatic has a high - end DX7 - class feature set ( except it does n't support cubemaps ) and low - end DX7 - class performance , with peak 3 - GHz Pentium 4 performance of more than 100 megapixels and nearly 5 million triangles a second .
In this three - part article , I describe how we 've managed to push Pixomatic as far as we have .
While I wo n't be talking about Pixomatic as a product , there is one product issue that I 'd like to address .
People keep asking : " Why would anyone want to use a software rasterizer nowadays ? "
( Actually , I believe the exact words they often use are : " Are you nuts ? "
But I 'll just go with the first version of the question . )
It 's a good question , with a simple answer : Because Pixomatic is utterly reliable .
There are no dependencies on APIs , drivers , or chips , so you can be absolutely certain that Pixomatic will work on any Windows or Linux machine with Intel 's Multimedia Extensions ( MMX ) .
The potential market is bigger , tech support is simpler , and returns are reduced .
Ad Astra Per Aspera
A good place to start is the story of how Pixomatic came to be a DX7 - class rasterizer , and a good place to start with that is to digress a bit to discuss Norton Juster 's wonderful children 's book The Phantom Tollbooth .
In it , Milo travels through the Kingdom of Wisdom , having many adventures and surviving many dangers to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason .
As he does so , people keep telling him , " There 's just one thing about your quest , " but they wo n't tell him what that thing is .
Finally , after he has succeeded , a parade is held in his honor , and while riding in it , he asks the Kings exactly what that thing no one would discuss with him was .
They inform him of the truth :
His quest was impossible .
The Kings add : " But if we 'd told you then , you might not have goneand , as you 've discovered , so many things are possible just as long as you do n't know they 're impossible . "
If only we'd had the Kings to guide us when we started to design Pixomatic !
We were n't sure whether we'd be able to get adequate performance , and after back - of - the - envelope calculations , we figured we'd have to cut features to the bone to keep performance up .
In addition , once we 'd determined that we'd have to compile code on the fly , we were convinced that the overhead and complexity of supporting a lot of features would be too much .
Consequently , we aimed for a DX6 - class pipeline , with little more than two textures and Gouraud shading , and with modulation as the only operation .
That was Pixomatic 1.0 , and if its features were a little limited and did n't map ideally to most current games , its performance was certainly good enough .
Then customers started asking for DX7 - class features and we started patching new capabilities into Pixomatic .
Naturally , because there was n't any overall design to these additions , they started to get messy and complicated .
And then , one day , I realized that the problem was that I had assumed that a DX7 - class feature set was impossible , and I had n't even taken a shot at it to find out if that was really true .
It turned out that it was actually easier to refactor the code to a full , orthogonal DX7 - class feature set than to patch in random features .
Moreover , the performance was just as good as in Pixomatic 1.0 .
Everything worked great for Pixomatic 2.0 ; the only way it could have been better would have been if we had designed for DX7 - class features from the start .
( Clearly , for Pixomatic 3.0 , all I have to tell myself is that a DX9 - class software rasterizer is n't impossible ! )
In short , everything worked out fine , and Pixomatic wound up with a nice , big , clean feature set .
In 1995 - 97 , I wrote a series of Dr. Dobb 's Sourcebook articles describing all the revelations and false starts we went through in designing and implementing Quake at Id Software .
I 'd love to do the same for Pixomatic , but the truth is it was n't that kind of project .
This was at least the fourth 3D rasterizer I 'd written , so there was n't a whole lot of aha ! in the process ; it was more a matter of matching our knowledge of the 3D pipeline to Pentium III and Pentium 4 hardware as efficiently as possible .
Of course , that 's not to say it was easy , or that there were n't any mistakes or learning experiences .
There were plenty of both , as you 'll see , which is n't surprising in a product with well over 1030 valid pixel - processing configurations .
Still , it was a relatively linear development process , at least compared to Quake .
By the way , a number like 1030 may make you wonder how we managed to test Pixomatic .
We constructed a testbed that implemented the pixel pipeline in C , along with a very - long - period random - number generator and the ability to run random configurations through both the C and Pixomatic pipelines and compare the results .
Then we started it up and left it running for days at a time , churning through tens of billions of configurations a day .
But obviously , it 's impossible to test every single possible configuration .
C , Assembly , and More
Pixomatic is implemented in several ways , as appropriate for the performance needs of various parts of the rasterizer .
Most of the code outside the pixel pipeline is in pure C , with inline assembly used in key places .
For example , backface culling is done with inline assembly , among other reasons because , in C , there is no way to prevent gradient values from getting stored to memory before the backface test is performed , even though they only need to be stored if the backface test passes .
The span generator emits perspective - correct horizontal spans 1 to 16 pixels long to the pixel pipeline and exists in three versions .
The first is an all - C x87 version .
The second is a part C , part inline assembly version that uses MMX and 3DNow ( a set of MMX - like multimedia extensions that AMD has added to its processors ) .
The third and fastest is an all - inline assembly version that uses SSE and MMX .
The use of inline assembly improved performance by 20 - 45 percent in various scenarios and that 's overall performance , including time spent in the pixel pipeline , which I will discuss shortly .
In addition to C and inline assembly , Pixomatic contains a fair amount of code that 's neither C nor inline assembly .
The reason for this is the tremendous number of configurations Pixomatic has to support .
For example , Pixomatic has to handle a huge number of possible pixel pipelines , as mentioned earlier ; consider the number of available stage operations , sources , and scalings for both alpha and RGB , and then multiply by three stages .
Or consider the number of possible vertex formats .
Moreover , it 's not enough to process all these configurations correctly ; they also have to be handled efficiently , which rules out using lots of tests and branches .
When we started to design Pixomatic , it was n't obvious how best to get both complete feature coverage and high performance .
One approach we used was to write a custom preprocessor to simply expand out all the permutations ; for example , this is how the various 2D blts Pixomatic supports are implemented .
Our overall experience with this approach was mixed ; the preprocessor made it easy to generate permutations , but that code was then hard to debug because we had to work with the preprocessor output in the debugger .
Worse , though , was that the preprocessor made it easy to generate a huge amount of code .
Since the pixel pipeline involves a vast number of possible configurations , it was clear early on that the preprocessor was n't going to do the trick there .
When we tried using the preprocessor to implement the relatively limited pipeline of Pixomatic 1.0 , it generated several megabytes of code ( that 's executable code the source was even larger ) , way over our design target .
( For comparison , the entire Pixomatic 2.0 DLL is about 250 KB in size . )
A technique I had used back in the x486 and Pentium days was to thread together span processors that each performed one pixel processing operation ; for example , one span processor to load the texels for a span into a temporary buffer , another to Gouraud shade them in the buffer , yet another to handle specular shading , and so on .
However , my experience was that the loop overhead for each pass was fairly expensive even then ; given how costly mispredicted branches are now and that at least one branch per pass is likely to mispredict , this did not seem like the right direction .
The obvious next thought was to compile an optimized pixel pipeline on the fly , one that contained no extraneous instructions or overhead at all .
There were two concerns with this .
The first concern was whether the code would run slowly as a result of the CPU synchronizing its caches for the modifications .
After all , code compiled on the fly is close to self - modifying code , which Intel specifically warns against as a performance hazard .
However , tests showed that the time between the drawing primitive call ( when compilation happens ) and the pixel pipeline ( when the modified code starts to execute ) is more than long enough for the new code to propagate to the code cache , what with transformation , projection , clipping , culling , gradient calculation , and span construction all happening in that interval .
The second concern was whether the overhead of compiling the code would be so large as to offset the benefits .
Certainly , it would take some time to do the compiling , and that cost would be multiplied by the number of times rendering state changes forced a recompilation of the pixel pipeline .
Initially , we assumed we would have to implement some kind of cache for compiled pixel pipelines , and we even exposed APIs to enable applications to do so if they wanted , but all this proved to be unnecessary for three reasons .
State changes are expensive with 3D hardware as well as with Pixomatic , so 3D apps are already written to minimize state changes .
We designed Pixomatic to batch up state changes until a triangle actually needed to be drawn , so we recompiled only when it was actually needed , rather than whenever a state changed .
We designed Pixomatic 's pixel pipeline so that the selection of a new texture does n't require recompilation .
This last point is critical because while textures change frequently ( often every few triangles with mipmaps ) , the remainder of the rendering state tends to remain in effect for dozens or even hundreds of triangles .
Of course , none of this would have mattered unless the code could be compiled very quickly , so full - blown traditional compilers were out of the question .
Instead , we wrote a streamlined compiler custom designed for the task , which we call the " welder . "
Next Month
In the next installment of this article , I 'll delve into welder and , among other topics , introduce an optimization tool dubbed " Speedboy . "

Herman the giant rabbit

The mighty bunny weighs a massive 7.7kg , and his ears are a lengthy 21 cm - almost as long as most pet rabbits are tall .
And he is almost 1 m tall .
The German Giant is even big for his breed , which usually tip the scales at around 6kg .
Herman lives in a specially built solid oak hutch and chomps his way through just over 2 kg of food a day .
His owner says his favourite snack is lettuce .
The giant bunny , who lives in Berlin with owner Hans Wagner , also takes a vitamin supplement to keep him healthy , and munches through a bale of hay a week .
Bred big
Herman could be the world 's biggest rabbit , but Guinness World Records have stopped accepting entries because of fears people were over - feeding their pets .
German Giants do not exist in the wild , and have been developed by breeders .
They can live for as long as 12 years .
The Pentagon is paying Lockheed Martin to try to predict insurgencies and civil unrest like the weather .
It ’s part of a larger military effort to blend forecasting software with social science that has some counterinsurgency experts cringing .
Lockheed recently won a $ 1.3 million , 15 - month contract from the Defense Department to help develop the " Integrated Crises Early Warning System , or ICEWS .
The program will " let military commanders anticipate and respond to worldwide political crises and predict events of interest and stability of countries of interest with greater than 80 percent accuracy , " the company claims .
" Rebellions , insurgencies , ethnic / religious violence , civil war , and major economic crises " will all be predictable .
So will " combinations of strategies , tactics , and resources to mitigate [ against those ] instabilities . "
DARPA , the Pentagon ’s bleeding - edge research arm , laid out the case for ICEWS this summer at its conference , held outside of Disneyworld .
" Commanders will always need to have an accurate picture of enemy positions , as well as friendly units and allies , " David Honey , who heads the agency ’s Strategic Technology Office , told confab - goers in Anaheim , California .
" But increasingly it ’s social , cultural , political and economic information , foreign language capabilities and other clues – that are proving essential . "
Figuring out how to find those clues wo n’t be easy , his colleague , Sean O’Brien , warned .
He has a three - part plan for how ICEWS might get it done , however .
It tracks , roughly , to how meteorologists piece together long - range weather forecasts .
Step one : dump everything we know about a country like Iraq , and “ create [ software ] agents that mirror the actual communities . ”
Not only does that mean identifying " government leaders [ ‘ ]
propensity to defuse or exacerbate potentially volatile situations , "
O’Brien explained in a call for proposals .
It also requires a determination of " how a country ’s macro- structural conditions ( social , demographic , economic ) affect the way in which the country ’s citizens interact with its government . "
What ’s more , according to an
article in the Military & Aerospace Electronics trade journal , the ICEWS system should be designed to " capture and process vast quantities of data from digitized news media , Websites , blogs , and other sources of information that reflect the dynamic and rapidly changing character and intensity of interactions between people and governments . "
Step two in the ICEWS plan : make these agents even more realistic , by “ leverag[ing ] the hundreds of social , cultural , and behavioral theories ” about why people act the way they do .
Step three : let commanders run mock battle plans against these modeled Iraqis , to see how they might react .
Experts on counterinsurgency are , to say the least , skeptical .
“ Wait a minute , you ca n’t tell me who ’s going to a win a football game .
And now you ’re going to replicate free will ? ” Lieutenant Colonel
John Nagl , who helped write the Army ’s manual on defusing insurgencies , tells DANGER ROOM .
“ They are smoking something they should n’t be , " retired Lieutenant General Paul Van Riper recently quipped to Science Magazine .
The military has been trying , for decades , to use social science data to forecast what might happen next on the battlefield — or around the world .
In 1976 , for example , Pentagon - funded researchers put together a " integrated crisis warning system … comprised of ( 1 ) quantitative military , political , and economic crisis indicators ; ( 2 ) quantitative indicators of U.S. military , political , and economic interests abroad ;
(3 ) a unified multi-method forecasting capability ; and ( 4 ) a computer base . "
More recently , DARPA has funded efforts to " anticipate the societal / regional indicators that precipitate instability . "
For these projects , the agency turned to Carnegie Mellon University professor Kathleen Carley and Massachusetts research firm Aptima , Inc. VISualization of Threats and Attacks in Urban Environments , or " VISTA , " was their company ’s attempt to " utiliz[e ] cultural models and other social network analysis techniques to assess and forecast nation state instability and conflict . "
The " Anticipatory Culture - Based Modeling Environment , " or ACUMEN , toolkit created a " simulation engine " based on " theories from psychology , social psychology , sociology , organization science , political science , and economics . "
ACUMEN modeled political , military , social , religious , and insurgent groups as agents , along with their relationships regarding hostility , support , membership , and more .
ACUMEN modeled the profiles of agents and geographic regions ( at the state and province levels )
within specific test states using a set of social , political , economic , health , and demographic indicators .
In all there were 150 indicators for the state , 60 indicators for each province , and 30 indicators for each agent .
But that was all in the lab .
The goal of ICEWS is to eventually bring the tool to war .
As Military & Aerospace Electronics notes , " The third phase will involve a live , in - theater test of the system . "

Low bone density puts people at risk of osteoporosis
Their study of 2,500 people revealed drinking cola was linked with low bone mineral density in women regardless of their age or calcium intake .
But the work published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found no such link in men .
Over a million UK women have been diagnosed with osteoporosis , although many more may have the condition .
Osteoporosis literally means " porous bones " and makes it more likely for them to fracture as they lose their density .
" Women , particularly those concerned about osteoporosis should limit their intake of cola to occasional "
Professor Katherine Tucker
Professor Katherine Tucker , director of the Epidemiology and Dietary Assessment Program at Tufts University in Boston , and colleagues compared information from dietary questionnaires with bone mineral density measurements at the spine and three different hip sites .
Men reported drinking an average of five cola drinks a week , and women reported consuming four cola drinks a week .
Cola consumption was linked to lower bone mineral density in all three hip sites in women , although not in the spine , but was not associated with bone mineral density in men .
There was no association with bone mineral density loss for women with other carbonated drinks , however .
Past work suggests that consumption of cola may be detrimental to bone health because it replaces milk in the diet , but in the current study the women who drank higher amounts of cola did not drink less milk than others .
However , calcium intake from all sources , including non-dairy sources such as dark leafy greens or beans , was lower for women who drank the most cola .
Phosphoric acid
An ingredient of cola called phosphoric acid might be responsible for the link , but the mechanism is not fully understood .
Professor Tucker said : " We think that particularly in doses in cola and especially when it 's repeated daily , phosphoric acid creates an acidic environment in the blood .
Calcium is then taken out of the bones to balance that out .
But that view is controversial . "
She advised : " Women , particularly those concerned about osteoporosis should limit their intake of cola to occasional . "
A spokesperson for the National Osteoporosis Society said : " We know that phosphoric acid seems to play a role in bone health and that excessive amounts may lower bone density although there have not been any studies that show exactly why this is .
" What 's interesting about this study is that most of the women did seem to be getting a good intake of calcium from other food sources , yet their bone density was affected by drinking as little as four cans of colas a week , which is n't much . "
She said more studies were needed .
Dr Peter Stott , a GP in Tadworth , Surrey and member of the NOS scientific advisory board said young women should think about protecting their bones for the future by eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of exercise .
A spokesperson for the British Soft Drinks Association said the most important preventative measures for osteoporosis were consuming adequate amounts of calcium - rich foods , taking regular weight - bearing exercise , stopping smoking , and reducing consumption of alcohol .
He added : " The scientific evidence does not suggest that phosphate , used in the form of phosphoric acid in some carbonated drinks , has a detrimental effect on bone health .
In any case , soft drinks provide only 3 per cent of total phosphorus intake from dietary sources , the two main sources being cereals and cereal products , and milk and milk products . "
Prison officers are taking a softly - softly approach
Officers at Wakefield 's maximum security prison are wearing soft - soled footwear after complaints from some prisoners at the building .
But a Prison Officers ' Association spokesman said the approach also had security benefits .
Glyn Travis said officers could patrol landings unheard by the inmates .
Mr Travis said the policy was fairly widespread across the country as the usual footwear made officers ' approaches to cells audible during the night .
He said : " In the majority of prisons officers wear soft shoes or slippers on nights .
" By midnight most prisoners should be asleep and we do n't want to disturb prisoners ' sleep . "
Slate flooring
The policy of using soft - soled footwear on night shifts also reaps rewards for officers patrolling the landings .
" Walking around with soft shoes , the prisoners do n't know we 're there , " said Mr Travis .
" We are always listening out for prisoners using drugs or being involved in other illegal activities during the night . "
Mr Travis said many of the Victorian - built jails had slate flooring which was noisy as officers approached wearing boots .
He added : " As usual you get the same offenders who whinge for England about it . "

There are two sides to any exchange rate : Europe 's prospects matter as well as America's .
In 2006 the Euro area looks likely to grow at its fastest pace for six years .
That its GDP growth is modest by American standards , largely because of its slower population growth , is not the point : what matters is that this year it has surprised the soothsayers time and again .
That has lifted its currency , and not just against the dollar .
A euro now buys more yen than at any time since the single currency was created .
--- The Economist , The Dollar Heads for a Tumble So -- when a European financial expert tells me that more and more people are dumping dollars for Euros , Americans would be well - advised to pay attention .
It was not so long ago , after all , that the American right wing was advocating a boycott of French wines and " French Fries " .
What a ludicrous and pathetic spectacle that was !
There is a sick , sophomoric mentality in America that likes to coin stupid terms like Islamo - fascism and Euro - trash .
Both terms are " designer " red flag terms chosen by the GOP for their appeal to bigotry and jingoism .
The US was even at that time a net importing nation of almost everything , in no position to terrify other nations with comic opera threats based upon the misconception that the US had not yet embarked upon an inexorable slide into third world status .
The unkindest cut of all is the Democratic sell out to the GOP !
The result is the GOP has now " auctioned off " the office of President of the United States , an eventuality embodied in Mussolini 's term : corporatism .
Let 's put it another way : the apparatus of the US government is now " owned " by rich , elite corporate interests who pay for the campaigns ( bread and circuses ) , pay for the candidates , pay for the legislation they want and need to rape the environment , dominate the world 's natural resources to include oil while enslaving the middle and lower classes .
Something similar occurred on March 28th , 193 AD , when the Praetorian guards , literally , sold the Roman empire to the wealthy senator Didius Julianus for the bargain price of 6250 drachmas .
I have n't tried to buy drachmas ( lately ) but it sounds like a bargain compared to the absurdly high prices that are paid by US corporations for control of the US Presidency , indeed , the US government .
Our modern day " Didius " has fared better than Julianus .
A magnificent feast was prepared by his order , and he amused himself until a very late hour , with dice , and the performances of Pylades , a celebrated dancer .
Yet it was observed that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed , and left him to darkness , solitude , and terrible reflection , he passed a sleepless night ; revolving most probably in his mind his own rash folly , the fate of his virtuous predecessor , and the doubtful and dangerous tenure of an empire , which had not been acquired by merit , but purchased by money .
- Gibbon , The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ; See also : Edward Gibbon : General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West An important point must be made here .
Gibbon reports that Julianus paid for the Roman Empire in " drachmas " .
" Drachmas " denotes Greek currency .
At that time , the basic unit of currency in Ancient Rome was a bronze coin called an as or aes .
A sestertius , another bronze coin , was worth four asses .
A silver coin , the denarius , was worth 16 asses . [ I will not go there ! ]
If Gibbon is correct , it is an indication that Rome , by that time in decline , had suffered a catastrophic devaluation of its coinage .
Even now " real " money is considered by some to be " gold " if anything at all has intrinsic value .
That Didius Julianus would pay in Greek currency , not Roman , indicates to me that the smart money had already dumped the as , the asses , and the sestertius for drachmas .
At last , bronze would seem to have little intrinsic value as " real " money unless you had enough of it to melt down for public statuary .
I would wager that only very wealthy Roman aristocracy possessed denarius , which they might have held against the complete collapse of bronze coins .
Kucinich Believes We MUST Impeach .
He 's right !
Part Deaux Dennis Kucinich is correct in describing a " race to the bottom " , a phrase that describes well the US decline under GOP domination and incompetence .
All but Bush 's increasingly tiny elite have financed Bush 's on - going folly .
A falling dollar is a market response to a balance of trade imbalance , a long - term decline in US exports begun , I believe , with the GOP administration of Richard Nixon .
Most economists will tell you that for most of some 50 years , the US enjoyed an economic pre-eminence if not dominance characterized by strong domestic industries , notably steel and automobile manufacturing .
Since important discoveries in Southeast Texas and , later , West Texas , the US was , for awhile , the world 's leading oil producing nation .
As US dominance of world supplies began to slip , " terrorism " grew worse . [
See chart at this link . ]
I recently provoked the ire of the Heritage Foundation by stating and proving -- to the foundation 's chagrin -- the simple truth : Terrorism is Worse Under GOP Regimes .
More than enough stats make an equally compelling case about crime : crime is always worse under GOP regimes .
That this should turn out to be the case may have something to do with the fact that since 1980 , unemployment , as well as terrorism , is always worse under GOP regimes .
Job Growth Per Year Under Most Recent Presidents Johnson 3.8 % Carter 3.1 Clinton 2.4 Kennedy 2.3 Nixon 2.3 Reagan 2.1 Bush 0.6 Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , Current Employment Statistics Survey .
I do n't believe in GOP coincidence theories .
There are reasons for the sorry state of nation and state .
GOP policies are injurious to the nation 's fiscal health , its security , and the well - being of US citizens .
The GOP is endemically corrupt and dishonest .
I have stated and will repeat : the GOP is not a political party is it a criminal conspiracy not unlike that described by St. Thomas More in the England of Henry VIII .
... so God help me , I can perceive nothing but a certain conspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and title of the commonwealth .
They invent and devise all means and crafts , first how to keep safely , without fear of losing , that they have unjustly gathered together , and next how to hire and abuse the work and labour of the poor for as little money as may be .
- Of the Religions in Utopia , St. Thomas More
There is a reason " terrorism " is worse under GOP regimes .
As an Iranian diplomat told me in Houston almost one year ago , oil is a curse .
He was not alone .
Many " industry - watchers " now use the term " curse " to refer to the nature of oil exploitation that democracy , public institutions , and civil liberties are often retarded because of it .
Civil liberties are most often dispensed with altogether .
Oil wealth concentrates at the top .
People in Venezuela , Nigeria , and Azerbaijan enjoy few benefits of oil production their countries .
We now see in the US the unseemly spectacle that other nations have always known , that is , ruthless factions scrapping for control and riches .
What is needed is a radically different approach .
A recent report quotes British energy economist David Fleming : Anticipated supply shortages could lead easily to disturbing scenes of mass unrest as witnessed in Burma this month [ 2006 ] .
For government , industry and the wider public , just muddling through is not an option any more as this situation could spin out of control and turn into a complete meltdown of society .
-- British Economist David Fleming in Crude Oil : The Supply Outlook , Report to the Energy Watch Group , October 2007
We may have already entered the melt - down phase .
For too long , Americans were just barely aware that the price they paid for gasoline was about one - third the price Europeans paid .
But you have to credit the GOP with resourcefulness .
The Bush administration delivered a message to the faithful : the war in Iraq would result in lower prices even as Bush cited every other reason for waging war .
To assert that oil was behind Bush 's war of aggression was tantamount to treason .
It was unpatriotic .
It was enough to get you pilloried and ostracized .
Every SUV sported a flag .
Many worry about a " hard landing " .
Inflation and interest rates rise as the dollar falls .
A collapsing dollar threatens to make of the US a third world nation , a " banana Republican " nation , if you will .
Americans had grown accustomed to the accoutrements of empire .
Oil and the lifestyle it afforded was cheap .
The rest of the world had a stake in keeping us afloat .
After all , they wished to export to the US .
That will be impossible should the dollar collapse .
Per capita oil production peaked in the 1970s .
Globalization was supposed to make us rich even as it lifted millions in the " third world " out of poverty and hunger .
This has not worked out as planned .
The Kucinich take on all that is correct .
Recently , the one - two punch of corporatization and globalization has undermined US welfare even as it threatens to end in a global crisis of our making .

This arises from very useful discussions with Gareth and Paul in my article on Iverson ’s convention .
Python code , like this : « if x is 1 :» , that uses is to test equality with numbers , is subtely wrong and should not be tolerated .
Python ’s is operator tests for object identity ( whether two expressions evaluate to the same object ) .
Numbers in Python are objects just like everything else ( and very sensible this is too ) .
The problem is that there may be more than one object with the same value .
And since you as a programmer are almost certainly only interested in the value of a number it ’s probably a mistake to use is for numbers .
Two numbers with the same value are n’t necessarily the same object .
Example using float :
>>> x = 1.0 >>> x is 1.0 False >>> x == 1.0 True
Each floating point number is actually a new object , so the «x is 1.0 » test fails ; the literal 1.0 creates a new float object that is not the same as the one that was created for the assignment « x = 1.0 » .
The same is true of long :
>>> x = 1L >>> x is 1L False >>> x == 1L True
Compiler memoisation
As Gareth points out there is an additional subtlety .
The Python compiler feels at liberty to merge literal number objects having the same value into one number object ; at least within a compilation unit :
>>> x = 1L >>> y = 1L ; print x is 1L , y is 1L False True
«y is 1L » is True in this case because Python uses the same 1L object for the all the 1L literals that appear on the same line passed to the interpreter .
On int
For int ( Plain integer ) the situtation is a bit more misleading .
Certainly an int is an object and you can have two int objects with the same value , creating the same issues as for float and long :
>>> x = 2007 >>> x is 2007 False
The issue is that using is seems to work for smaller numbers :
>>> x = 160 >>> x is 160 True
What is happening is that Python maintains a global store of pre-made int objects for some of the more commonly found values .
Whenever it needs an int object it checks to see if it is one of its favourites that it made earlier and if so then reuses that object instead of creating a new one .
Compared to allocating a new object every time an int is required , this is a big win .
There ’s no mention of this in the Python language reference , and it ’s just the sort of thing you might stumble upon by accident .
You might observe by experiment that is is safe to use on numbers , because you only played with small ones , and then get bitten by some sort of horrible «x is 2007 » bug .
The Python implementation ( that is , the C Python implementation that everyone uses ) does n’t define what range of int objects get memoised in this way .
This is deliberate .
Apparently it used to be 100 numbers , might now be 262 numbers .
Maybe other implementations do n’t use this technique at all .
If you think «x is 1 » is safe then what range are you going to rely on ?
The message is clear :
It is not sensible to rely on using is for numbers .
Not even 1 .
Bonus section : bool
Though bool is an integer type ( False == 0 , True == 1 ) , code like «x is False » is fine .
That ’s because the language specification says that there are only two bool objects , True and False .
You ca n’t create any more , so expressions that evaluate to True or False , like «x > 7 » , always evaluate to one of the canonical bool objects .
You ca n’t even use bool .
__new__ to reach behind the curtain and generate new bool objects :
>>> x = bool.__new__(bool , 0 ) >>> x False >>> x is False True
( despite what the documentation for bool .
__new__ says )
Obligatory Lisp Comparison
Python ’s is is Common Lisp ’s EQ .
Like Python , Common Lisp has all the same issues about whether « ( EQ 3 3 ) » is true or not ( it ’s not guaranteed , either way ) .
But Common Lisp has EQL which implements conceptual sameness .
Python does n’t have anything similar , and I think that ’s a mistake .

Here we sit in a branchy row , thinking of beautiful things we know ,
Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do , all complete in a minute or two —
Something noble and wise and good , done by merely wishing we could !
By the rubbish in our wake , and the noble noise we make ,
Be sure , be sure , we 're going to do some splendid things !
– " Road Song of the Bandar - Log , " from Rudyard Kipling 's Jungle Book
During the 1930s , the wish of the world 's politicians to " plan " other men's lives was strong and , by unhappy coincidence , so was their power to do so .
The urge to " educate and uplift " their fellow ( if lesser ) man into a state more agreeable to their theories beat brightly in every progressive heart from Moscow and Berlin to London and Washington D.C .
The Communist Manifesto had vastly more influence on the intellectual mind than it does today , and its exhortation for " combination(s ) of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country , by a more equitable distribution of the population over the country " was taken seriously as a workable idea and , more important , as a morally correct idea .
Writings such as the Manifesto undoubtedly contributed to the birth of the Back to the Land movement , an intellectual fad that swept through the brains of many 1930s Western politicians .
As a result , the city of Magadan in Russia 's Siberia was built from nothing , by and for Stalin 's slave army .
It still exists today .
[ 1 ]
In Germany , the town of Ramersdorf was built from scratch on the magnanimous whim of Adolph Hitler ; it too still exists today .
And America 's very own example of the fad was the West Virginia town of Arthurdale , constructed during 1933 on the magnanimous whim of Eleanor Roosevelt .
Like Magadan and Ramersdorf , it too still exists today .
People Over Profit : The Birth of Arthurdale
" There was nothing that a humanist could n't supervise — or so it was widely believed at the time . " – from Jailbird by Kurt Vonnegut
The idea of it had been floating around for decades , at least from 1848 , the year the Manifesto slithered out of Karl 's pen .
It passed like a plague from one European intellectual to another before sailing a Genoese galley to America , and before the story ended it had infected heads as varied as the journalist Stuart Chase , the industrialist Henry Ford , and — most importantly — the First Lady , Eleanor Roosevelt .
As projected , Arthurdale was to be immune from the ups and downs of the business cycle , with its citizens farming their five - acre plots part time and working part time in a local factory ; a perfect combination of town and country floating through life as just the happiest little autarkic bubble you ever did see .
And it was not just to be a bunker to defy the Great Depression ; Eleanor and friends harbored more grandiose dreams .
As Mrs. Nancy Hoffman 's Eleanor Roosevelt and the Arthurdale Experiment states , " Mrs. Roosevelt never considered Arthurdale a charity but a social experiment . "
Arthurdale was to herald a Glorious New Life , led by a New American .
It was all very 1930s .
" The President ( FDR ) and the First Lady feared sparks of revolution would explode … specifically a communist revolution against the United States government . " – from Eleanor Roosevelt and the Arthurdale Experiment
Like an unwanted pregnancy , Arthurdale was not conceived in an atmosphere of calm , deliberate reflection .
Much like circa -1914 Russia , cursed with an ass for a leader when she required a lion [ 2 ] , circa - 1933 America was cursed with public servants who did not have nerves of steel .
Harry Hopkins , hand picked by FDR to run FERA , [ 3 ] hand picked one Lorena Hickok to be a FERA " investigator " in West Virginia , to check out the local scene , and to report back with any suggestions . [ 4 ]
Thrown into hysterics and horrified by the plight of West Virginia 's indigent coal miners , on returning to Washington D.C. she breathlessly reported to Eleanor Roosevelt that " the only way out of the mess " she could fathom was that FDR become an " absolute dictator " ( Thomas 1998 , p. 117 ) .
West Virginia 's " welfare director " Francis Turner also reported , albeit a little less hysterically , that if the federal relief program failed the next election would see " Roosevelt against the Reds " ( Thomas 1998 , p. 117 ) .
During the first hundred days of FDR 's administration , the Subsistence Homestead Division was born and " Back to the Land " was no longer merely an idea , but a tangible , if unconstitutional , reality .
In Eleanor Roosevelt , it found a very willing and able patron .
In FDR , who stated the " project represented something new " and hailed it as a " bold government venture , " it found $ 25 million of other peoples ' money to play with . [ 5 ]
Eleanor took the West Virginia tour herself , and — being blessed with a likable combination of compassion , ignorance , and arrogance — latched onto the Back to the Land movement as the solution .
Though living in the later part of a heavy migration back to the land already underway ( from 1930 to 1935 many West Virginia miners were already flowing back to the land , reducing average farm acreage from 106 to 90 ) , Eleanor and some friends conceived the idea of Arthurdale .
Displaying the type of intelligence that brings to mind the phrase " bright and bookish , but not that smart , " despite the " chronic poverty of its countryside " ( Thomas 1998 , p. 163 ) , they believed that a solution to West Virginia 's economic crisis might be found by moving even more miners back into chronic poverty .
With no time to waste ( project supporters warned there was a revolution brewin ' ) and promises that it was sure to be easy on the taxpayer ( " we would get most of the money back in due time , " FDR dreamed in a letter to Republican Senator George Norris ) , 1,000 acres of West Virginia land were purchased from Richard Arthur , a man who " could no longer pay the taxes " on his farm ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 20 ) — and there , dear people , is as pure and stark an example of redistribution as you 'd ever wish to see . [ 6 ]
As for the business acumen that Eleanor and her friends displayed in delivering Arthurdale , a writer for the Saturday Evening Post put it best when he wrote , " There is no reason to doubt the good faith of the backers of Arthurdale .
There is reason to doubt their competence . " [ 7 ]
And how !
Clarence Pickett , a staunch advocate of Arthurdale , sadly recorded his concern on " seeing many prompt , if not hasty actions " taken on behalf of Eleanor 's pet project .
[ 8 ]
And it all started to unravel from the very first step — the " purchase " of the land from Mr. Arthur .
The land turned out to be unsuitable for the large scale habitation envisioned by the planners , as Professor Thomas 's An Appalachian New Deal relates , since a " stratum of porous rock lay beneath the land [ and ] caused great expense in making the water supply safe " [ 9 ] .
Not to be outdone , Louis Howe , one of the project managers , promptly purchased fifty pre-fabricated summer cottages that were " totally inadequate for West Virginia winters " ( Thomas 1998 , p. 170 ) , not to mention that they did n't fit the pre-fabricated foundations waiting for them .
Architects had to be brought in from New York " at great expense " to make the summer cottages suitable for West Virginia ( and make them fit their foundations ) , pushing back the initial move - in date six months . [ 10 ]
Mrs. Nancy Hoffman's Eleanor Roosevelt and the Arthurdale Experiment called it " the first and most notable fiasco " during the community 's construction , but the purchase of the stratum of porous rock has my vote .
Delivered late and vastly over budget , [ 11 ]
Arthurdale displayed all the characteristics of a boondoggle , a political creature that " puts people over profits " and is widely familiar to all Americans , circa 2007 .
The pre-fabricated houses , even when it was known that they were unsuitable for West Virginia winter and would n't fit their foundations , were still built but then torn to pieces and remodeled .
An article in the August 1934 Saturday Evening Post speaks of how chimneys were built eight feet away from their houses ' sides , after which the houses were reconstructed to meet the chimneys .
From padded payrolls , to houses stuffed with goodies ( " most Arthurdale families found their new homes lavish , " Hoffman 2001 , p. 44 ) , to the importing of rhododendrons ( a flower native to the Arthurdale area ) from sixty miles away ( just to leave them to rot ) , to wells being drilled at great expense and then abandoned , the project was every bit the financial disaster that one should expect when giving management over obscene sums of cash to people who believe " profit " is a curse word .
Even Mrs. Roosevelt herself noted " much money was spent , perhaps some of it unwisely , " and if you substitute " perhaps some " with the far more accurate " all , " she would have been spot on .
The building of Arthurdale was a criminal waste of wealth during a time when the American economy could least afford it .
Finally , by late 1934 , the first " colonists " were settled in , and Arthurdale would eventually grow to 165 homesteads .
When all was said and done , what Eleanor Roosevelt and her circle of experts had assured would cost $ 2,000 — maybe $ 3,000 per unit , tops — came in at " $ 16,625 each " ( Conkin 1959 , p. 332 ) .
Needless to say , nobody was fired .
Pleasantville
" Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent . " — Eleanor Roosevelt
" We did n't resent it as much as we probably should have . " —
Arthurdale resident , 1999 interview
The " colonists " — or " homesteaders " as the press and politicians often referred to them — were the lucky few selected from among the indigent coal miners by the screening process . [ 12 ]
If they thought they were getting " relief " they would have been correct , but they were getting a bit more in the bargain , too .
They were to be resettled , fed , clothed , and housed by order of the politicians , and in addition they were to live on a stage set .
Knowingly or not , they were a propaganda piece .
During the initial enthusiasm for the Back to the Land movement , when passions burned brightest and the money spigot was gushing , the people of Arthurdale were often " put on display " for publicity purposes , as they were dreamily forecast to be only the beginning , the first of many Arthurdales to follow .
Mrs. Roosevelt and her friends , chattering excitedly about building homesteads from sea to shining sea , urged the newly settled people " to succeed , not only for yourselves , but for what it will mean to people everywhere " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 40 ) .
It was one small step for the people of Arthurdale , one giant leap for mankind .
Everyone was giddy .
Politicians , bureaucrats , hangers - on , and the press descended upon Arthurdale to record , measure , condemn , pontificate , and praise .
" News reporters and government officials were always around , watching and questioning the homesteaders " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 40 ) .
Most of the adults resented it , one complaining that there was always " some stranger peeking in at the window or walking in to ask some fool questions " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 41 ) .
But they 'd struck a bargain , and the right to privacy was part of the price .
Another was the necessity of obedience , much like a military member , or else back into the coalmines they 'd go , as " the fear of being kicked out of Arthurdale if they failed to live up to the government 's expectations was real for many homesteaders " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 52 ) .
And to keep them on edge , what exactly those expectations consisted of was a mystery ; Roosevelt later reminisced , " sometimes they did n't quite know what was expected of them " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 86 ) .
Eleanor Roosevelt and her friends displayed toward the people of Arthurdale a type of attitude Dr. Alan Dawley recently summed up as " the itch to uplift and the itch to control . "
And the uplifting control was to start early in life ; the newspapers from that time reported , " children are taken to a nursery school at the age of two " [ 13 ] where they were put into the hands of Arthurdale 's education czar , Elsie Clapp , a friend of Eleanor 's and a woman bejeweled with degrees from Vassar , Barnard , and Columbia University .
From the nutritional ( " If I can teach these mothers that cold pancakes and coffee are n't good for babies , " she wrote to Eleanor , " my two year olds will be much healthier , " Hoffman 2001 , p. 56 ) [ 14 ] to the educational ( " It 's much like surgery .
We remove mental and physical impediments and graft on the things that help .
Negative thoughts and attitudes do not flourish here , " Elsie boasted to the papers ) [ 15 ]
Arthurdale 's children ( adults , too , were encouraged to attend classes ) were to be given the best that " progressive " education could offer — at least until the school was folded into the surrounding Preston County system two years later , sending Ms. Clapp and her " alternative " teaching methods into the dustbin of history .
Sadly , despite all the money , tough love , removal of their " mental and physical impediments , " and grafting on of " the things that help , " the people of Arthurdale were n't displaying the attributes of the New American Man , or at least not the type the planners planned for .
Instead , they behaved like dirt - poor coal miners and part - time farmers who had become accustomed to living off of other peoples ' money .
They displayed what we now call " dependency . "
Nancy Hoffman writes that " there were times they depended too much on her [ Mrs. Roosevelt 's ] help and not enough on their own resources , " leading Eleanor to lament that " they seemed to feel that the solution to all their problems was to turn to government " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 85 ) .
In one defining moment , the town 's school bus broke down and the good people of Arthurdale , rather than fixing it themselves , had it towed over two hundred miles to the White House garage for repairs . [ 16 ]
As for employment , Eleanor and her friends had left the town 's unemployed residents the choice of abandoning Arthurdale or staying put and collecting welfare .
" With business struggling to survive in urban areas , it was unlikely one would go through the expense of moving to a more isolated area . " – from Eleanor Roosevelt and the Arthurdale Experiment
The planners of Arthurdale , when conjuring an entire town out of scratch , forgot one of the most basic lessons of real - estate investing : location is everything .
Arthurdale 's location was less than ideal ; in fact , it was in the middle of nowhere .
This was a severe flaw in the plan .
Since Arthurdale was built in the middle of nowhere , yet designed with the notion that industry would nevertheless locate there to provide jobs , " the homesteaders would remain stranded government wards , even though they lived in bright new homes " ( Conkin 1959 , p. 109 ) .
Arthurdale was the nicest ghetto in our nation 's proud history .
The fact that " the remoteness of Arthurdale from suitable transportation and markets made [ it ] especially unattractive as a manufacturing site " should have been plainly apparent to anyone with an IQ high enough to gain admission to our Ivy League schools , yet it made no dent in the heads of those involved .
Like the shortage of lifeboats on the Titanic , the choice of Arthurdale 's location was a blunder of monumental proportions .
By turns , a vacuum - part manufacturer , a furniture maker , a box factory , a shirt manufacturer , and a radio - cabinet maker opened and quickly went under .
By 1940 , a mere six years after the town 's birth , 165 out of 166 employed residents were working on a government job ( Penix 2007 , p. 79 ) .
Eleanor Roosevelt , thrilled that things were going so well , stated " I hope that many private enterprises will do it throughout the country in the future " ( Hoffman 2001 , p. 72 ) .
In case you 're wondering why the Great Depression lasted so long , wonder no more .
With people such as Eleanor planning our way back to prosperity , could it have done anything else ? [ 17 ]
The Darkening Of the Light
" It should be perfectly safe , just a bit of harmless brain alteration . " – from Wallace and Gromit , the Curse of the Were - Rabbit
Arthurdale is a story with no hero .
The American voting masses — that vanguard of the socialist revolution — wanted a strong man , exactly as that genius Marx had predicted . [ 18 ]
And , again exactly as Marx predicted , history produced that man .
His likeable wife Eleanor helped spread the gospel that underpinned the New Deal : that living off the toil of others is perfectly acceptable and moral .
Most Americans , not even a century removed from fighting a Civil War supposedly to end such an inhuman practice , agreed .
Did Arthurdale help the families chosen to enjoy that money ?
Absolutely .
Did the families enjoy an ocean of material abundance , even if many of them eventually learned that , in terms of " normal American life , " they were n't in Kansas anymore ?
Absolutely .
Yet the good fortune of the residents does not negate the fact that they were living off the sweat of others ' labor .
Arthurdale was not " charity " ; nobody was asked to contribute those millions any more than Thomas Jefferson simply asked his slaves to bring in the harvest .
Eleanor Roosevelt and her friends did n't use the money to " help the poor . "
Arthurdale was not in their minds charity ; they used it to perform an experiment on the people they placed into Arthurdale .
Eleanor called it a " program of long term rehabilitation . "
It had been decided that the people placed into Arthurdale needed to be more like Eleanor Roosevelt and her parlor friends .
Everything I 've come across on Arthurdale maintains ( in a manner of haughty approval ) that it was a social experiment .
The entire project was designed by a small clique of the powerful to see if they could improve their fellow man .
In this case , admittedly just one of many such examples history provides , Eleanor was the potter and a group of dirt - poor Americans were the clay . [ 19 ]
Where Our Creator had fallen short of perfection , where they had spotted a flaw in His work , Eleanor and her friends went riding into the breach , over the carcasses of all the other great plans intended to improve on our Creator 's design .
Dr. Paul Conkin's Tomorrow A New World states that Arthurdale and the others sure to follow would be " demonstrations of a new way of life " ( Conkin 1959 , p. 115 ) and the New York Times praised it ( of course ) as " a national laboratory of which may come a new American way of life " [ 20 ] .
If Arthurdale was a laboratory , what did that make the Americans placed into it ?
From the view of cold , hard , economic science , Mrs. Roosevelt , closely linked to Arthurdale for the rest of her days , defended her project by saying " the new hope and life given to the residents … were not to be measured in dollars and cents , " [ 21 ] showing she was as poor an economist as she was a homebuilder .
You must consider that which is unseen as well as what 's right before your eyes — else you 're only using half your brain .
Mrs. Roosevelt , eyes set high on the progressive horizon , never looked down to notice those others she helped reduce to poverty , the jobs she helped destroy , the hope and life she snuffed out by the removal from their lives of the millions squandered on her " pet project " Arthurdale , all at the flick of her mighty ego .
I am sad to report and I repeat , Arthurdale is a story with no hero .
" ' Cause this is nothing like we 'd ever meant .
Tell Sir Thomas
More we 've got another failed attempt . " — The Shins
By 1948 , the Arthurdale project had come to a quiet end .
All the holdings were sold off to the homesteaders , some for as low as $ 750 ( Conkin 1959 , p. 115 ) .
Once on the lips of every newspaper editor from sea to shining sea , the town has slid into obscurity ; no longer do strangers come peeking in at the window or walk in to ask foolish questions .
Today the town has a wonderful museum that keeps the memory of her beginnings alive , and every year the residents , many descendants of the original settlers , play host to the New Deal festival . [ 22 ]
Though Arthurdale was , from both a moral and financial point of view , a cataclysmic failure , I am happy to see the town live despite my misgivings about its vicious birth .
I wish for the town to stand for years to come but not , like the friendly people who staff its museum believe , as a monument to noble charity .
Her creation did not spring from any charitable impulse .
I wish her to stand as a monument to the squandering of others ' wealth , the residents ' loss of freedom , and most important , the loss to all Americans of the principle that no man shall be forced to support another 's crackbrained scheme .
In the end , Eleanor Roosevelt 's dream of covering America with Arthurdales came true — from sea to shining sea , federally funded housing projects are not hard to find .
For better or for worse , in them we have Arthurdale 's legacy .

Lottery tickets offer us the dream of escaping to a different life .
Often I find myself wondering what it would be like if I did n’t have to work full time .
I always imagine spending more time on my open source software projects , getting in better shape and doing some freelance consulting to pay the time .
About ten years ago I got to see my parents make the transition from working full - time to retirement .
It was n’t an easy switch for them .
There was some sadness , a lack of motivation and a lonliness as they lost the human contact the workplace gave them each day .
For the past two months I ’ve gotten to experience what it ’s like not to work every day .
I was laid off from my previous job with severance .
While I money was n’t tight , there was n’t enough to jet set off to Europe or go on any big vacations other than the ones I already had planned for the summer .
I was stressed out most of the time until I found myself a new job .
After I accepted the job offer , I gave myself a big window until I had to start so that I could relax and enjoy my time off .
This was the longest stretch of time I had booked off ; it has been 14 years since I ’ve had that much time to myself all at once .
When I was working , I imagined all the web projects I could do if I did n’t have to go to work .
The reality of the experience was quite different .
Once you have the freedom to do anything you want with your day , sitting in front of the computer is the last thing you want to do .
For the first few weeks I found myself irritated by 3 pm every day .
I quickly realized that it was the lack of structure ; if I got myself out of the house the feeling went away .
So time was spent walking around the city , going to the library and reading in coffee shops .
The beautiful weather really helped .
Why stay inside on a sunny day if you do n’t have to ?
Part of it was a desire to be around real people , instead of the virtual people I usually associate with if I ’m stuck on a computer .
There was a definite priority shift .
With the freedom to do anything I wanted with my day , it made so much more sense to focus on those long term , important but not urgent goals .
Organizing things around the house .
Getting a new family doctor .
Renewing my passport .
Getting new contacts .
Removing clutter from my house and my life .
I had to laugh one day when I found an old to - do list from 2006 .
There was stuff on that list that was important to my life and my well being that I was finally getting around to .
I found it amazing how much clearer it was to process my task list and choose the most important tasks for the day .
Because I felt no urgency in any of my tasks , I was able to make much better decisions about what was important vs what was n’t even worth doing .
I ’m about to enter the workforce again , and I hope I can take some of the clairity I currently feel with me .
When Christin Odell graduates from acupuncture school this spring , she plans to move from California to Colorado .
Wherever she goes , she 'll bring her house with her .
Odell lives in a yurt , a portable , round , tent - like structure first used thousands of years ago by the nomads of Mongolia .
" I 'm kind of a nomad myself , " says the 27 - year - old student at the Five Branches School of Oriental Medicine in Santa Cruz , California .
" I 've lived in about 10 places in the last 10 years .
I figured if I was ever going to buy a house , I had to find one that I could take with me . "
Among the world 's oldest indigenous structures , yurts are experiencing newfound popularity in the United States , where they 're popping up as houses , offices , ski huts , art studios and even government buildings .
Yurt devotees range from aging hippies living off the grid to urban professionals needing space for a home office or guest room .
Some are drawn to yurts by their interest in environmentally sustainable building practices .
Others simply enjoy the pleasing aesthetics of a round room .
" I was blown away by the look of it , that round shape , " says Debra Amerson , 40 , an interior designer and digital artist who built a yurt as an art studio and office next to her home in Forest Knolls , California .
After seeing a yurt on the property at the Esalen Institute , she decided to construct her own .
The project took about seven months , including time for clearing the land of debris and building a deck to house the yurt .
She used as many green building materials as possible in building and furnishing the yurt , which contains recycled items like an old card table she found in a junkyard and turned into a hearth for her wood stove .
" I 'm concerned about the health of the planet and the health of the trees , " says Amerson , who selects plants and art for businesses like Whole Foods , the organic food store chain .
Given their portable nature , it 's difficult to say how many yurts exist in the United States , but some estimates put the number in the thousands .
They generally range in size from 14 to 30 feet in diameter .
The most popular variety consists of a lattice frame covered in stretched vinyl .
They are typically constructed on a wooden deck made of polished plywood or bamboo .
Many yurt users add extra features , like insulation , additional doors and windows , ceiling fans and water collection systems .
Some yurts are equipped for the snow .
Others are designed for tropical climates .
" It 's not a permanent structure , but it 's more than just a tent , " says Alan Bair , president of Pacific Yurts , the largest manufacturer of lattice - wall yurts .
" It has the advantage of being easy to install and relatively low in cost while it's also durable and useful in different climates . "
The original yurts were simple affairs .
Known by Mongolians as " gers " they consisted mainly of a wood frame covered in wool felt .
Yet the design was carefully thought out .
Rooted in the context of Shamanistic notions about the connectedness of all things , the floor plan was based on the four directions – north , south , east and west – much like the Native American medicine wheel .
" Every aspect of the ger had spiritual significance , from the placement of the door and furnishings to the central fire and the direction in which one walked inside , " says Becky Kemery , who is writing a book on yurts and has lived in three of them .
By the time the first yurts appeared in the United States in the early 1960s , the design remained simple .
Over the years , features were added such as insulation developed by NASA .
Still , even with these changes , they remain less expensive and use far fewer building materials than a traditional structure .
The simplicity of yurt living attracted Odell , who sought inexpensive housing in Santa Cruz , where rents are among the highest in the nation .
Odell found she could live more cheaply in a yurt , which range in price from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 depending upon their size and added features , than in an apartment .
After conducting research on the Internet , she purchased a 24 - foot model from a company called Advanced Canvas .
With the help of friends who let her build the structure on their property in nearby Scotts Valley , she built a deck over a couple of weekends .
It took less than a day to raise the yurt .
To power her lights , stereo and iMac , Odell installed solar panels .
Other amenities include a refrigerator , which runs on propane , a wood stove and a composting toilet .
Water from a nearby tap on the property is piped in to a sink purchased at Home Depot and a refurbished bathtub that she bought at a junkyard .
The whole setup cost under $ 20,000 , which she paid for with student loans .
" I plan to live in this yurt for a while , " Odell says .
" I 'm going to treat my student loan payment as a house payment . "
Critics liken Guantánamo Bay to Soviet gulags , but reality does not match their hyperbole .
The supporters of David Hicks , the detainee popularly known as the “ Australian Taliban , ” asserted that Mr. Hicks was mistreated and wasting away .
But at his March trial , where he pleaded guilty to providing material support to a terrorist organization , he and his defense team stipulated he was treated properly .
Mr. Hicks even thanked service members , and as one Australian newspaper columnist noted , he appeared in court “ looking fat , healthy and tanned , and cracking jokes . ”
Some imply that if a defendant does not get a trial that looks like Martha Stewart ’s and ends like O. J. Simpson ’s , then military commissions are flawed .
They are mistaken .
The Constitution does not extend to alien unlawful enemy combatants .
They are entitled to protections under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , which ensures they are afforded “ all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples . ”
Justice John Paul Stevens , in the Hamdan decision that rejected an earlier plan for military commissions , observed that Article 75 of the Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions defines the judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable .
A comparison of Article 75 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 shows military commissions provide the fundamental guarantees .
Each accused receives a copy of the charges in his native language ; outside influence on witnesses and trial participants is prohibited ; the accused may challenge members of the commission ; an accused may represent himself or have assistance of counsel ; he is presumed innocent until guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt ; he is entitled to assistance to secure evidence on his behalf ; he is not required to incriminate himself at trial and his silence is not held against him ; he may not be tried a second time for the same offense ; and he is entitled to the assistance of counsel through four stages of post - trial appellate review ending at the United States Supreme Court .
One myth is that the accused can be excluded from his trial and convicted on secret evidence .
The administrative boards that determine if a detainee is an enemy combatant and whether he is a continuing threat may consider classified information in closed hearings outside the presence of the detainee .
But military commissions may not .
The act states , “ The accused shall be permitted ... to examine and respond to evidence admitted against him on the issue of guilt or innocence and for sentencing . ”
Unless the accused chooses to skip his trial or is removed for disruptive behavior , he has the right to be present and to confront all of the evidence .
Still , if we rely solely on e-mail at work , the absence of a channel for the brain ’s emotional circuitry carries risks .
In an article to be published next year in the Academy of Management Review , Kristin Byron , an assistant professor of management at Syracuse University ’s Whitman School of Management , finds that e-mail generally increases the likelihood of conflict and miscommunication .
One reason for this is that we tend to misinterpret positive e-mail messages as more neutral , and neutral ones as more negative , than the sender intended .
Even jokes are rated as less funny by recipients than by senders .

We fail to realize this largely because of egocentricity , according to a 2005 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Sitting alone in a cubicle or basement writing e-mail , the sender internally “ hears ” emotional overtones , though none of these cues will be sensed by the recipient .
When we talk , my brain ’s social radar picks up that hint of stridency in your voice and automatically lowers my own tone of exasperation , all in the service of working things out .
But when we send e-mail , there ’s little to nothing by way of emotional valence to pick up .
E-mail lacks those channels for the implicit meta-messages that , in a conversation , provide its positive or negative spin .
On the upside , the familiarity that develops between sender and receiver can help to reduce these problems , according to findings by Joseph Walther , a professor of communication and telecommunication at Michigan State University .
People who know each other well , it turns out , are less likely to have these misunderstandings online .
These quirks of cyberpsychology are familiar to Clay Shirky , an adjunct professor in New York University ’s interactive telecommunications program .
His expertise is social computing — software programs through which multiple users interact , ranging from Facebook to Listservs and chat rooms to e-mail .
I asked Professor Shirky what all of this might imply for the multitudes of people who work with others by e-mail .
In a surprise announcement during a news conference at the presidential palace in Tehran , Mr Ahmadinejad said the 14 men and one woman would be " going back home " in a move marking the birthday of the prophet Muhammad last Saturday and acknowledging Easter .
Iran 's IRNA state news agency said later the Britons would leave Tehran tomorrow at 8 am ( 5.30 am UK time ) on a flight to London .
Immediately after the news conference , Iranian television showed footage of the naval crew effusively thanking Mr Ahmadinejad on the steps of the palace .
Dressed in grey suits , apart from the sole female captive , Leading Seaman Faye Turney , who was wearing a striped top and a headscarf , they appeared delighted .
" We are very grateful for your forgiveness , " said one of the male captives , Lieutenant Felix Carman .
" You are welcome , " Mr Ahmadinejad responded in Farsi .
" You came here on a compulsory trip , " the Iranian leader told another , getting the answer : " I do n't know if I 'd put it like that but you could call it that . "
Tony Blair welcomed the news , calling the crew 's imminent freedom " a profound relief not just to them but to their families , that have endured such distress and anxiety over these past 12 days " .
Britain had taken " a measured approach , firm but calm , not negotiating but not confronting either " , he said , adding in a message to the Iranian people that he hoped any other disagreements could be resolved peacefully .
Relatives of the detainees reacted with uncontained delight .
Sandra Sperry , the mother of Royal Marine Adam Sperry , told Sky News : " I 'm absolutely ecstatic ... I heard in Asda ... I think everyone thought I had gone mad ... we thought it would drag into next week . "
It had been feared that Mr Ahmadinejad - renowned for being a hardliner and a critic of the west - would use his news conference to make more demands relating to the captives .
The initial signs were not positive : the president began with a long complaint about the invasion of Iraq , also criticising Britain for taking the case of the captives to the UN security council .
He also presented medals to three members of the Revolutionary Guard naval patrol that seized the Britons as they searched an Indian - registered merchant ship just outside the mouth of the Shatt al - Arab waterway , which divides Iran and Iraq .
But in a dramatic flourish about an hour into the address , the president suddenly announced : " While insisting on our rights , these 15 sailors have been pardoned and we offer their freedom to the British people . "
Iran repeatedly said the patrol had been in Iranian waters , but Britain presented GPS evidence last week that it said proved the UK personnel had been well inside the Iraqi zone .
Later on during his two hour - plus press conference , Mr Ahmadinejad said the British government had sent a letter to Iran 's foreign ministry pledging that incursions " will not happen again " .
Iranian TV has shown a series of broadcasts in which some of the detainees have apparently admitted being in Iranian water , prompting an angry reaction from British officials .
In a seemingly mischievous aside during his press conference , Mr Ahmadinejad said he hoped this would not get them into trouble , saying : " I ask Mr Blair not to punish the soldiers with the charge of accepting and telling the truth . "
There has been speculation that the release was prompted in part by an agreement to let an Iranian representative meet five Iranians detained by US forces in Irbil , northern Iraq , in January .
Tehran says the men are diplomats ; the US says they are Revolutionary Guards linked to insurgents in Iraq .
There have been claims that Tehran orchestrated the seizure of the British crew with a view to an exchange .
The US insisted today that there was no connection between the cases .
" Not that I am aware of , " said a State Department spokesman , Tom Casey , when asked if there was a link .
People of Britain : congratulations are in order .
You have now joined ferret owners , sidewalk artists , hot dog vendors , publicly funded attorneys for poor people , low - income community college students , museum curators , a couple of innocent black men shot dead by the police , the sections of the New York City charter governing rules of succession to the mayoralty and , of course , Hillary Clinton , as objects of Rudy Giuliani 's demagoguery and wrath .
You may by now have heard the story .
In a radio ad that his campaign prepared for New Hampshire voters , Giuliani tells listeners that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000 and goes on to say : " My chance of surviving cancer - and thank God I was cured of it - in the United States : 82 % .
My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England : only 44 % under socialised medicine . "
The numbers are false .
The actual five - year survival rate in Britain is 74 % , which is still lower than America's , but obviously high enough for the figure not to have constituted fodder for a campaign commercial .
( Even the remaining , much smaller difference , is largely explained by more widespread screening in the US , which catches many more incidents of prostate cancer that are non-lethal ) .
It turned out that Giuliani 's numbers were from a seven - year - old article in a conservative policy journal .
The article was written by his own healthcare policy adviser , who admitted that his comparison was a " crude " interpretation of a study by a respected health policy group .
The group , in turn , said the article 's author had grossly misused its numbers .
That 's about as red - handed as anyone in politics gets caught these days .
But when asked if the campaign would continue to use the figure , a Giuliani spokeswoman said , " Yes , we will . "
I know the form all too well .
I covered Giuliani for a dozen years in New York ( note to angry American rightwingers preparing to email me a warning to keep my foreign nose out of their business : I 'm as American as a Ford F - 150 ) .
The man lies with staggering impunity .
But here 's the thing : he does it with such conviction and such seeming authority that people who are not inclined to study the matter will believe him - will in fact be utterly convinced that Giuliani is speaking the gospel truth , and they will prove almost impossible to shake from this conviction .
Giuliani's hypocrisy with regard to this ad does n't end with the fake statistics .
As Joe Conason noted on www.Salon.com, Giuliani was at the time of his treatment the mayor of New York and enrolled in a nonprofit health maintenance organisation for government employees - that is , mini-socialised medicine .
And as Ezra Klein noted on Comment is free , the treatment that saved Giuliani was developed in Denmark - which , as Klein drolly notes , " is both in Europe and has a universal healthcare system " .
But none of this will stop Giuliani .
He will say and do anything he feels he needs to say and do to get power .
Newspapers write that he was " liberal " on social issues in his mayoral days , as if his positions on abortion and immigration were matters of conviction .
Nonsense .
He took the positions he needed to take to be elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic city .
( Although to grant him a speck of humanity , I 'd guess that his pro-gay rights views were more or less genuine : anyone living in the city gets to know many gay people . )
And now he is saying and doing whatever he needs to say and do to get millions of rightwing Americans to support him .
He recently told a meeting of social conservatives that his reliance on God " is at the core of who I am " .
As mayor he was known to attend mass almost never , he obviously cheated serially on the wife ( wife No 2 ) he married in the Catholic church , and the only occasions on which I can remember him invoking God when he was mayor were the two times he was forced to say " so help me God " in taking the oath of office .
But forward he will charge , telling more lies with even more impunity .
And immunity , because in a culture where a sense of history is largely limited to remembering certain stirring television images , he will for the most part get away with it , confident in the knowledge that the main thing most Americans will ever recall about him is the film clip of him running from the rubble of the World Trade Centre on September 11 .
A far smaller percentage will know that the reason he had run was because he had catastrophically decided to place his emergency command centre in the tower complex - the only building in New York that had previously been the target of a major terrorist attack .
And by the way : shame on Gordon Brown for inviting him to No 10 in September .
Yes , there 's a long tradition of presidents and prime ministers welcoming party standard - bearers from across the pond .
But Giuliani is n't yet that .
Brown had no business giving him the kind of special benefit that an audience with a prime minister bestows .
Brown and all of Britain will be better off the sooner they figure this out : Giuliani is a dangerous man .
George Bush with brains .
Dick Cheney with better aim .
Consider yourself warned .

DR . DAVID GRAHAM IS LOSING WEIGHT AGAIN .
His wife noticed first , then his colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration .
Graham is a skinny man , and when he drops weight , his cheekbones seem to sit higher on his face .
His striped cotton shirts , the frumpy uniform of a government scientist , hang more loosely on his narrow frame .
But he is n’t eating , and no wonder : Graham , the scientist who brought the Vioxx scandal to the nation ’s attention , feels like a marked man .
“ I ’m no longer welcome , ” he says , sitting in a Rockville , Maryland , coffee shop in early February .
He has just left another frustrating day at work , where his boss warned him not to disclose new safety findings about a popular class of painkillers called Cox - 2 inhibitors .
In a few minutes , he is due at his son ’s Boy Scout meeting , but all he can talk about now is the exhaustion of working in a drug - safety system in turmoil .
“ I ’m hoping things will calm down , but I do n’t think the FDA will let that happen , ” he says .
“ How do you get off the merry - go - round ? ”
In August 2004 , Graham told his supervisors that , in light of his research , high - dose prescriptions of the painkiller Vioxx , which appeared to triple heart attack rates , should be banned .
They told him to be quiet .
Their reasoning was circular :
That ’s not the FDA ’s position ; you work here ; it ca n’t be yours .
Dr. John Jenkins , the FDA director of new drugs , argued that because Graham ’s findings did n’t replicate the drug ’s warning label , Graham should n’t be raising the warning .
Another supervisor , Anne Trontrell , called Graham ’s position “ particularly problematic since FDA funded this study . ”
Days after Graham ’s pronouncement , the agency approved Vioxx for use in children .
But Graham was right .
The following month , Merck pulled Vioxx from the market after its own research found that the drug , even when taken at low dosages , doubled the risk of heart attack .
The announcement provided Graham no vindication .
With a scandal on the horizon , the FDA brass now saw him as a danger .
They could n’t silence the message , so they tried to take out the messenger .
Dr. Steven K. Galson , the acting director of the drug-evaluation division at the FDA , told reporters that Graham ’s work “ constitutes junk science . ”
Then he sent an email to an editor at the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet , questioning the “ integrity ” of Graham ’s data — a suspicion that proved baseless .
The FDA ’s acting commissioner , Dr. Lester Crawford , criticized Graham for evading the agency ’s “ long - established peer review and clearance process . ”
Another official made calls to at least one Senate staffer , disparaging Graham personally and professionally .
Eventually , he was heard .
In November he went before the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Vioxx .
Gaunt ( he ’d lost 12 pounds over three months ) but very lucid , Graham took his place before a bank of cameras , wearing his only sport coat , a 20 - year - old blue blazer with brass buttons .
He explained his conclusion that patients taking high doses of Vioxx were suffering heart attacks .
“ The estimates range from 88,000 to 139,000 Americans , ” he said .
“ Of these , 30 to 40 percent probably died .
For the survivors , their lives were changed forever . ”
According to the top end of those projections , the toll Vioxx had already taken was comparable to the number of Americans killed in Vietnam .
“ The FDA , as currently configured , ” Graham told the committee , “ is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx .
We are virtually defenseless . ”
But three months later , as Graham sips iced tea in a Rockville cafe , the FDA is again trying to suppress his research , this time on the effects of pain medications similar to Vioxx .
“ I think we ’ve already articulated our preference , ” his supervisor , Dr. Paul Seligman , wrote him in a terse email .
The agency does n’t want Graham presenting his latest research to scientists who will be meeting in a few days to discuss the drugs .
David Graham is headstrong , but not insubordinate .
He can not afford to lose his job .
His family has just moved to a new house .
His wife , Nancy , stopped working as a lawyer so she could homeschool their six children .
Really , though , he has no more time to sit here worrying .
The Boy Scouts are competing for their merit badges this evening .
He finishes his iced tea .
“ I ’ve made a commitment , ” he says , before walking out the door .
“ I ’ll weigh myself this evening . ”
WE LIVE IN THE pharmaceutical era of medicine , a time of tablet - sized miracles and blockbuster serums .
More than 70 new drugs are approved every year , adding to the thousands for which American doctors already write some 3 billion annual prescriptions .
The medications prolong countless lives and cause millions of harmful side effects .
For most patients , the benefits far outweigh the dangers .
An aging man will risk diarrhea to restore his virility .
A cancer patient will lose her hair in the hope that chemotherapy will save her life .
FDA safety officers like Graham spend their lives searching out the other type of pills , the unexpected killers that harm patients after the FDA has approved them .
Since 1988 , Graham has called for the removal of 12 drugs from pharmacy shelves , leading to 10 recalls that have likely saved hundreds , if not thousands , of lives .
Each recall is an embarrassment for Graham ’s employer , the FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , which approved the drugs in the first place .
The trouble is that the roughly 2,300 staffers who support the approval process , and the 109 , like Graham , who study the safety of drugs after their release , all fall under the same leadership , and that leadership is highly responsive to industry .
In recent years , nearly half of the center ’s $ 400 million budget has been paid for by drug companies .
This arrangement stems from a 1992 agreement , made partly at the urging of AIDS activists , that the FDA would speed up approvals in exchange for “ user fees ” from industry .
“ The focus at FDA is efficacy , ” says Dr. Curt Furberg , a scientist at Wake Forest University who advises the agency .
“ Safety is a stepchild . ”
For the pharmaceutical companies the system works just fine .
“ The drug - approval process [ in the United States ] is second to none , ” says Jeff Trewhitt , a spokesman for PHRMA , the drug industry ’s trade group .
“ This is an exhaustive process . ”
Companies eventually recall about 3 percent of their drugs for safety reasons .
Behind many of these recalls are scientists like Graham , who often find themselves pitted against their own supervisors .
“ If you say something negative about a drug , they try to shut you up , ” says Dr. Sidney Wolfe , an FDA watchdog for the group Public Citizen , which has been exposing dangerous drugs for three decades .
“ David is not the only one , by any means , who has raised issues that later proved to be correct . ”
In 1998 , for instance , an FDA drug reviewer named Dr. Robert Misbin wrote a paper showing that the diabetes drug Rezulin had caused liver failure in a patient during a controlled study .
When his bosses tried to prevent him from publishing , Misbin saw firsthand how the system encouraged the sacrifice of public health to the interests of the industry .
“ One of my supervisors said something to me that I have never forgotten , ” Misbin says , “ that we have to maintain good relations with the drug companies because they are our customers . ”
Misbin eventually went public with his concerns , and the drug was pulled a year later .
But he has paid for sticking to his principles .
“ I am no longer given any good projects , ” he says .
Dr. Andrew Mosholder , another FDA reviewer , faced similar pressures last year when he completed a study showing that antidepressants increased suicidal behavior in children .
Further studies proved that Mosholder ’s science was spot on .
But his bosses told him not to report the findings .
When someone with access to the study passed his results to the press , the FDA launched an investigation into the leak .
According to Tom Devine at the Government Accountability Project , who later became Graham ’s lawyer , several scientists were interrogated and threatened with possible jail time .
Such intimidation has worked .
In 2002 , about one in five FDA scientists told federal investigators that they felt pressure to approve drugs despite reservations about safety and efficacy .
Two - thirds said they lacked confidence that the agency adequately monitors drug safety after approval .
DAVID GRAHAM IS A CHILD of the Bronx .
One of six children , he spent his teenage years in a cramped home in northern New Jersey , sleeping three to a room .
It was n’t until he reached college , at Franklin & Marshall , that he decided to become a doctor .
Johns Hopkins Medical School offered him a chance at early admission , and he accepted .
His plan was to become a general practitioner in Vermont , where he ’d live with Nancy Peterson , a girl he had met in the freshman dormitory .
He graduated from med school with the second - highest grades in his class–not the highest , he points out , owing to a single B in the medical history course he cut every other Friday , when he ’d ride a bus 75 miles to spend the weekend with Nancy .
She married him a year later .
“ It was worth it , ” he says .
Hopkins , however , was geared toward academic research , not producing family doctors for the Green Mountain State .
And Graham never took to working with patients anyway .
“ What I really enjoyed was problem solving , ” he says .
So after residencies in internal medicine at Yale and neurology at the University of Pennsylvania , Graham took a job at the FDA in epidemiology .
His first major safety review , in 1988 , focused on a pill called Accutane , intended for patients with severe , previously untreatable acne .
The study proved to be a crash course in the ways of the FDA .
At the time , Accutane was seen as a miracle cure by people just like Graham , who still bears the scars of teenage acne .
But the side effects could be horrible .
One in four children born to women who got pregnant while using the medication suffered from birth defects .
Many women did n’t bring their babies to term at all , losing them to miscarriage , and most pregnancies ended in abortion .
Graham looked at the data and sounded an alarm .
Attempts to educate young women about Accutane ’s risks were failing .
“ Only the immediate withdrawal of Accutane from the market will work , ” he wrote to his supervisors in 1990 .
“ The delay only compounds the body count . ”
That statement was both scientific and political .
Graham is opposed to abortion , and the bodies he was referring to were those of the thousands of unborn children whose mothers had taken the drug .
Devoutly Catholic , Graham keeps a postcard image of Jesus on his office wall and speaks easily about his calling to service as a Christian .
He taught himself ancient Greek so he could read the New Testament as it was written .
For him , the scientific process is an extension of his faith .
“ He really does believe that to know what is real is to know something about the Author of the truth , ” says John Cavanaugh - O’Keefe , a pro-life activist who met Graham at a prayer group .
But for his managers at the FDA , under pressure from dermatologists and Roche , the drug ’s manufacturer , Graham ’s religion was an irrational excuse for his unreasonable claims .
“ They ’d call him the right - to - life nut , ” says Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , who recently introduced legislation to restrict patient access to Accutane .
“ But everything he said has pretty much been proven . ”
The FDA sided with Roche , rejecting Graham ’s calls to withdraw the drug and his later pleas to restrict its distribution .
In the years that followed , the drug ’s use among young women nearly tripled , and Roche ’s annual Accutane revenues exceeded $ 1 billion .
The company designed a voluntary program to encourage birth control among users , but the number of pregnancies continued to rise .
Nonetheless , Roche described the program as a success , noting that occasional pregnancies were the inevitable result of birth - control failures .
“ You ca n’t control everything when you are dealing with human behavior , ” explains Gail Safian , a Roche spokeswoman .
In 2002 , when Roche ’s patent expired , the FDA helped create a stricter program to ensure that women on the drug used birth control , requiring monthly proof of a negative pregnancy test .
Two years later , a panel of scientists found the system was still failing .
In November , as the FDA was attacking Graham for his work on Vioxx , the agency announced still stronger restrictions .
These measures echo changes Graham asked for more than a decade ago .
SHORTLY AFTER Merck pulled Vioxx from the market last September , Graham began carrying an index card full of phone numbers in his breast pocket .
The little scribbles of red and black ink were his lifelines , contacts to a dozen supportive congressional staffers and reporters who ’d sought him out after he went public .
It had become clear that he would n’t survive long in his job without help from some heavyweight defenders .
Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley , the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee , became his primary protector .
“ It ’s people like this who give us the opportunity to know that something is wrong , helping me do my job , ” Grassley says .
He believes the industry has far too much influence on FDA deliberations over safety .
“ There should only be one chair at the table , ” he says , “ and that is for the American people . ”
The only way to resolve the FDA ’s dangerous conflict of interest , according to Graham , is to create an independent center for drug safety , situated on one side of a fire wall ; those who study efficacy and recommend approvals would be on the other side .
Researchers would report their findings to scientists with no stake in the performance of the drug .
But this is a more drastic change than the agency is likely to implement of its own accord .
The FDA has made other gestures :
It has announced a new committee to monitor safety issues , asked for an investigation of its procedures by the Institute of Medicine , and proposed reassigning about 20 scientists to work on drug safety .
Jeff Trewhitt , the spokesman for PHRMA , rejects Graham ’s solution out of hand .
“ He seems to start from the premise that the drug - safety program is broken , and we do n’t accept that premise at all , ” Trewhitt says , adding that any new regulation “ could mean slower delivery of new medicines to patients . ”
That view has also been embraced by the White House , which maintains close ties to the drug industry and its more than 600 lobbyists .
During a television interview , Andy Card , chief of staff to President Bush , said that the administration ’s handling of the Vioxx recall was “ a testament to the FDA and how they do their job . ”
This leaves the prospect of real systemic change at the FDA in the hands of Congress .
Indeed , throughout history , safety scandals have regularly sparked congressional action .
The agency itself was established by Congress in 1906 after a wave of adulterated or dangerous drugs was exposed in the press , including a “ headache powder ” containing acetanilide that caused heart attacks .
In 1962 , Congress began forcing pharmaceutical companies to test drugs after doctors distributed doses of a pill called thalidomide to pregnant mothers , a sedative later shown to cause birth defects .
But the scale of the Vioxx scandal appears , in sheer numbers , far greater than any other in the nation ’s history , and Congress has yet to respond .
Not only has the drug been widely used — peaking in 2001 at 25 million prescriptions — but it has increased by two - or threefold the risk of one of the most common causes of death , heart attack .
IN FEBRUARY , six months after the Vioxx scandal broke , Graham still finds himself struggling to get the word out .
His latest research , based on the records of 651,000 California Medicaid patients , raises safety concerns about other drugs in the same class as Vioxx .
Mobic , a popular painkiller still viewed as safe , appears to be increasing heart attack rates by about 37 percent .
Celebrex , a blockbuster pain medication from Pfizer , increases rates by about 25 percent in high doses .
Although the findings are not statistically conclusive , the study adds key data to the medical literature .
But Graham ’s superiors are n’t interested .
The email Graham receives before heading to his son ’s Boy Scout meeting asks him to focus only on “ the key studies in the published literature . ”
According to Graham , he can present only one unpublished study , a report paid for by Merck .
Graham ’s most powerful defender comes to his aid : Senator Grassley sends a terse letter to the acting FDA commissioner , Lester Crawford , demanding an explanation of why Graham ca n’t present his data .
Grassley gives Crawford a deadline for responding : February 16 , opening day of the three - day FDA advisory committee meeting .
The gathering is held in an overstuffed Hilton conference room in Gaithersburg , Maryland , a suburb of Washington , D.C. , covered with rolling parking lots and B - rated shopping malls .
Broadcast trucks ring the hotel , and the hallways are crowded with cameras .
Just hours before Steven Galson , Graham ’s supervisor , is to welcome the 32 scientists assembled from around the country , Crawford intervenes .
The backtracking is brazen .
“ It goes without saying , ” Galson says in his opening remarks , “ that all FDA staff are free to make any presentation without fear of any retaliation . ”
Graham , who is scheduled to speak the next day , leaves the meeting to hastily redesign his presentation .
When he returns the following day , he ’s wearing the same coat and the same tie .
In the previous three weeks , he has lost two more pounds .
“ I ’d like to take this moment to thank Dr. Crawford for his leadership , for making it possible for me to present our preliminary data from a study from California Medicaid , ” he tells the gathered scientists .
He presents his findings on the dangers of Mobic and Celebrex in high doses .
About Vioxx , he says the risks associated with taking high doses are “ probably more significant than smoking or diabetes or hypertension . ”
Then he challenges the FDA to begin shifting its assumptions when it considers a new drug .
“ Let ’s start out at the beginning assuming the drug is n’t safe . ”
On the third day of the conference , Graham dips outside the meeting room for a break and is immediately surrounded by a scrum of reporters .
The committee of 32 scientists was nearly unanimous in acknowledging the dangers Graham presented to the FDA six months earlier .
But they voted by a narrow margin to keep the two most troublesome painkillers , Vioxx and Bextra , on the market , calling instead for tighter restrictions on distribution .
Ten of the scientists were consultants for the manufacturers of the drugs in question .
Had they not been allowed to vote , according to an analysis by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , both Vioxx and Bextra would have been recalled .
The reporters ask Graham for his reaction .
“ The fact is , debate is happening , ” he says .
It may be one of the last times he finds himself in the public spotlight as a federal researcher .
If the experience of others is repeated , he ’ll be sidelined within the agency and denied any meaningful projects over the coming year .
Despite Grassley ’s backing , he expects to be pushed out of his job .
Standing outside the conference , however , Graham still has the power to speak out — and infuriate his government employer .
“ Sunlight is the best disinfectant , ” he tells the surrounding crowd .
“ This is more sunlight on the problem . ”

Cotton Chicken and Candy Nuggets for the win !
By Dave Lindorff
You would n’t know it if you just watch TV news or read the corporate press , but this past Tuesday , something remarkable happened .
Despite the pig- headed opposition of the Democratic Party ’s top congressional leadership , a majority of the House , including three Republicans , voted to send Dennis Kucinich ’s long sidelined Cheney impeachment bill ( H Res 333 ) to the Judiciary Committee for hearings .
The vote was 218 to 194 .
Now the behind - the - scenes partisan maneuvering that preceded that vote was arcane indeed , with Kucinich first exercising a member ’s privilege motion to present his stymied impeachment bill to the full House , only to have Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrange for a colleague ( Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - MD ) offer a motion to table it .
The Republicans , anxious to embarrass the Speaker , threw a wrench into that plan , though , by voting as a bloc to oppose tabling .
Since Kucinich already has 22 co-sponsors for his bill , it was clear that the tabling gambit would fail .
As soon as that became apparent , rank - and - file Democrats , unwilling to be seen by their constituents as defending Cheney , rushed to change their votes to opposing the tabling motion .
In the end , tabling failed by 242 to 170 with 77 Democrats supporting a pleasantly surprised Kucinich .
In order to avoid a floor debate on the merits of impeaching the eminently impeachable Vice President Cheney , Pelosi and her allies then moved to send Kucinich ’s bill directly to the Judiciary Committee .
They were joined by three Republicans , including maverick Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul ( R - TX ) .
Now the hope of the Democratic leadership is that this means Kucinich ’s impeachment bill will continue to be safely bottled up in a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee .
But it may not work out that way for them .
Whatever the explanation , this impeachment bill has been endorsed by a floor vote of the full House , with bipartisan support .
For the Judiciary Committee to sit on it now and not schedule a hearing would be a gross travesty of parliamentary procedure and custom .
Indeed , some House members not associated with Kucinich ’s resolution are now openly calling for immediate hearings into Cheney ’s impeachable actions — specifically lying the country into a war in Iraq , and threatening war with Iran .
One indication of the change in the political climate in the House is the announcement by Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , a six - term congressman and a member of the House Judiciary Committee , that he will call for the Judiciary Committee to take up Kucinich ’s impeachment bill .
This is significant because Wexler , no left - wing hothead , is not a co-signer of the Kucinich bill .
In an email message to constituents , Wexler said :
" I share your belief that Vice President Cheney must answer for his deceptive actions in office , particularly with regard to the preparations for the Iraq war and the revelation of the identity of covert agent Valerie Plame Wilson as part of political retribution against her husband . "
" ... Cheney and the bush Administration have demonstrated a consistent pattern of abusing the law and misleading Congress and the American people .
We see the consequences of these actions abroad in Iraq and at home through the violations of our civil liberties .
The American people are served will with a legitimate and thorough impeachment inquiry .
I will urge the Judiciary Committee to schedule impeachment hearings immediately and not let this issue languish as it has over the last six months .
Only through hearings can we begin to correct the abuses of Dick Cheney and the bush administration ; and if it is determined in these hearings that Vice President Cheney has committed High Crimes and Misdemeanors , he should be impeached and removed from office .
It is time for Congress to expose the multitude of misdeeds of the Administration and I am hopeful that the Judiciary Committee will expeditiously begin an investigation of this matter . "
Also calling for prompt action by the Judiciary Committee in the wake of the Tuesday House vote was Carol Shea - Porter , a first - term Democrat from New Hampshire , who also is not a sponsor of the Kucinich measure .
In explaining her vote to send the Kucinich bill to the Judiciary Committee , she said :
" It is the duty of the Vice President to faithfully execute the laws of the United States of America and to defend the Constitution .
There is growing evidence that the Executive Branch has ignored some of our laws and has attempted to bend the Constitution to its will .
Members of both parties decided that this issue is too important to ignore .
I voted with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to investigate the Vice President ’s actions in office . "
She characterized the resolution sending the bill to the Judiciary Committee a " strongly bi-partisan vote . "
With these kinds of endorsements and calls for action , it is clear both that Speaker Pelosi is looking increasingly pathetic and out of touch with her " impeachment is off the table " mantra , and also that Judiciary Chair John Conyers ( D - MI ) , who seems to have been intimidated by the Speaker for the past year , but who earlier had been a leader in exposing the crimes of the Bush / Cheney administration , is getting strong support for taking a bolder stand .
Stephen Cohen ( D - TN ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee who is a co-sponsor of the Kucinich resolution , says he thinks that there will be an impeachment hearing in the committee .
The 22 House members who have already signed on as co-sponsors of Kucinich ’s Cheney impeachment resolution are : Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , Maxine Waters D- CA ) , Hank Johnson ( D - GA ) , Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , Lynn Woolsey D- CA ) , Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) , Albert Wynn ( D - MD ) , William Lacy Clay ( D - MO , Yvette Clarke ( D - NY ) , Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) , Jim Moran ( D - VA ) , Bob Filner ( D - CA ) , Sam Farr ( D - CA ) , Robert Brady ( D - PA ) , Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , Donald Payne ( D - NJ ) , Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) , Sheila Jackson Lee ( D - TX ) , Carolyn Kilpatrick ( D - MI ) , Ed Towns ( D - NY , Diane Watson ( D - CA , and Danny Davis ( D - IL ) .
The change is attitude toward impeachment among the rank and file , and the evident increasing willingness to buck the Speaker , reflects growing awareness of the groundswell of popular anger with the Bush administration and the Democratic Congress over continued funding of the Iraq War , and over continued erosion of Constitutional government and civil liberties by an administration that wants unfettered executive power and by a Congress that is afraid to act .
The latest polls show three in four Democrats in favor of impeaching the vice president and president , while a majority of all Americans favor impeaching the vice president and roughly half of all Americans favor impeaching the president .
This is before hearings and presentation of evidence have even begun !
The Democratic strategy for the 2008 election has been to do nothing overly confrontational , to pass no significant legislation , to collect lots of money from corporate interests , and to hope that the Republican Party , saddled with an unpopular administration and an unpopular war , will implode .
The strategy , however , is proving to be a disaster , as public support for the Democratic do - nothing Congress has fallen even below the president ’s record low numbers .
Just running against Republicans , Bush / Cheney , and the continuing war risks seeing Democrats go down to defeat in ’08 .
It is awareness of this looming electoral disaster that underlies the growing restiveness among rank - and - file Democrats in the House , all of whom have to face the voters in less than a year ’s time .
As recently as a month ago , it did n’t look like impeachment was in the cards ,
Now it ’s starting to look like we Cheney ’s going to be put in the dock .
It may not be long before we start to see bills of impeachment filed against President Bush too .
The corporate media enjoy making fun of Rep. Kucinich , a height - challenged but dedicated progressive who has made a career of standing tall for his views .
If his bill ends up leading to impeachment hearings against Cheney , Kucinich will end up having the last laugh .

The administration ’s war on science — revisited
Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told a Senate panel yesterday that climate change “ is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of Americans . ”
If that sounds a little vague and non-specific , there ’s a good reason — the White House refused to let her say what she wanted to say .
Testimony that the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention planned to give yesterday to a Senate committee about the impact of climate change on health was significantly edited by the White House , according to two sources familiar with the documents .
Specific scientific references to potential health risks were removed after Julie L. Gerberding submitted a draft of her prepared remarks to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review .
Instead , Gerberding ’s prepared testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee included few details on what effects climate change could have on the spread of disease .
Only during questioning did the director of the government ’s premier disease - monitoring agency describe any specific diseases likely to be affected , again without elaboration .
A CDC official familiar with both versions told the AP that Gerberding ’s draft “ was eviscerated . ”
Among the deletions were “ details on how many people might be adversely affected because of increased warming and the scientific basis for some of the CDC ’s analysis on what kinds of diseases might be spread in a warmer climate and rising sea levels . ”
Consider the big picture here .
We have a CDC , financed by taxpayers , committed to public safety .
We have a CDC director , whose salary is financed by taxpayers , prepared to tell senators the truth .
We have CDC research , financed by taxpayers , pointing to potential public - health consequences associated with climate change .
And we have a White House that believes the truth should be muzzled , and information should be kept from the public , because it conflicts with the Bush agenda .
This might be amusing if a ) it were n’t so serious ; and b ) it did n’t happen all the damn time .
Let ’s not forget , for example , that in June 2005 , the New York Times uncovered the fact that the White House hired Philip Cooney , a former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute , to be chief of staff of the president ’s Council on Environmental Quality .
As part of his responsibilities , Cooney re-wrote government reports on global warming , editing out scientific conclusions he did n’t like , and substituting the conclusions of scientists with his own politically - motivated opinions .
For that matter , Gerberding is hardly the first to be muzzled .
James Hansen , the longtime director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has spoken out repeatedly , explaining to anyone who will listen that administration officials have tried to censor scientific information about climate change .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s scientists have reported similar problems .
In one particularly egregious example from a year ago , weather experts at NOAA set up a seven - member panel to prepare a consensus report on the views of agency scientists about global warming and hurricanes .
When the data suggested that global warming is contributing to the frequency and strength of hurricanes , the Bush administration blocked the release of the report .
( It led Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) to argue that “ the administration has effectively declared war on science and truth to advance its anti-environment agenda . ” )
Moreover , TP notes that a “ January report found 435 instances in which the Bush administration interfered into the global warming work of government scientists over the past five years . ”
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , the committee chairperson , said in a statement last night that the administration “ should immediately release Dr. Gerberding ’s full , uncut statement , because the public has a right to know all the facts about the serious threats posed by global warming . ”
Sounds reasonable , does n’t it ?
March 01 , 2007 D.C. Madame to Sell 10,000 Phone Records of High - End Washington Clients Deborah J. Palfrey is unhappy .
And , if you know who Deborah J. Palfrey is — and especially if you know her by Jeane — you probably do n’t want her unhappy .
From 1993 until this past summer , Palfrey ran Pamela Martin and Associates , a “ high - end adult fantasy firm which offered legal sexual and erotic services across the spectrum of adult sexual behavior , ” according to a statement she put out today hoping to raise funds for her legal defense .
The way she plans to raise those funds could reverberate through Washington ’s power corridors .
She is considering “ selling the entire 46 pounds of detailed and itemized phone records for the 13 year period , ” reports The Politico 's Ryan Grim .
In October , the Internal Revenue Service seized her assets ; the sale of the records would fund her fight against the seizure .
Palfrey released what she said were a sample of the records , which do n’t include names , but do feature a number of Washington area exchanges .
Her attorney , Montgomery Blair Sibley , said that prices have yet to be set for the data .
“ We do n’t actually know that yet , ” he said , “ because we have n’t finished mining the data to identify the individuals .
Obviously if Bill Clinton ’s on the list that ’s a different matter than you know , somebody nobody ’s ever heard of before . ”
But , he said , chances are good that some interesting names will pop up .
“ Statistically , if you have 10,000 people , and given the structure of this particular service , these were n’t people beckoning from car windows , ” he said .
“ The escorts only responded to four and five star hotels or private residences .
And so the landlines will show up on the private residences real quickly . ”

It is sad that we are at the point in this country where having a normal sex drive is somehow considered to be deviant and needas to be supressed .

A British man who was held in Guantánamo Bay has begun a civil action against MI5 and MI6 over the tactics that they use to gather intelligence .
The suit has been brought by Tarek Dergoul , 29 , who claims he was repeatedly tortured while he was held by the US , and that British agents who had also questioned him were aware of the mistreatment .
He wants a high court ruling that will ban the security services from " benefiting " from the abuse of prisoners being held in detention outside the UK .
If Mr Dergoul wins , it would mean that MI5 and MI6 could not interrogate British nationals while they are being held and tortured abroad .
A British citizen , he has been awarded legal aid for the case , and papers will be lodged at the high court today .
They were drafted by the Rabinder Singh , QC , a leading human rights barrister from the Matrix Chambers .
According to court documents seen by the Guardian , Mr Dergoul alleges that agents from MI5 and MI6 repeatedly interrogated him while he was held and tortured in Afghanistan and then Guantánamo , and were thus complicit in his treatment .
In the 13 - page document to be lodged at court , he says he suffered beatings , sexual humiliation , insults to his religion , and was subjected to extremes of cold .
He was released back to Britain in 2004 without charge .
Britain says it does not carry out or condone torture , but it stands accused of benefiting from inhumane treatment meted out by other countries .
Mr Dergoul is seeking damages for " misfeasance in public office " by the security services and the Foreign Office .
The court papers state : " The British government and its officials knew that the claimant was being subjected to mistreatment amounting to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment because he told them so ... Accordingly the British government and its officials unlawfully sought to benefit from mistreatment of the claimant .
It is averred that either the British officials knowingly unlawfully interrogated the claimant or they acted with reckless indifference to its illegality . "
Mr Dergoul said he was picked up in Afghanistan in 2001 by local warlords who " sold " him to the US for $ 5,000 .
He denies involvement in fighting or terrorism and says he went to the region to study Arabic .
He was held for a month at the prison in Bagram then spent three months in Kandahar before being sent to Guantánamo Bay .
He says one week after his arrival at Bagram , British agents first questioned him , identifying themselves only by their first names , " Andrew " and " Matt " and was questioned in front of an armed US soldier .
He says he was kept in a cage with 20 others and saw horrific acts of torture inflicted on prisoners .
" They would be severely beaten , often with baseball bats , when they collapsed from exhaustion .
The claimant also observed two or three men being hung by their hands with bags over their heads .
The claimant also heard gunshots and screams , " the papers say .
Mr Dergoul says he was moved to Kandahar , suffering more torture and denial of medical treatment that led to a toe being amputated .
Again he says he was visited and interrogated by the British .
One of the officials was ' Matt ' whom he had previously seen at Bagram and the other man was in his early 40s and short . "
In 2002 , hooded , drugged and shackled Mr Dergoul was taken to Guantánamo , where he says UK agents questioned him five times , at intervals of every four to five months .
In Guantánamo the Briton says he suffered more abuse and torture , which he says he told UK officials about .
" The claimant complained that he was being beaten and was being sexually assaulted by having his genitals touched during searches .
The claimant also complained that he had been repeatedly attacked ... , that he had been placed in freezing conditions in isolation without access to a toilet , water or soap , that he had had his facial hair forcibly shaved . "
The government is expected to fight the court action .
Last night Mr Dergoul said : " This action comes at a time when people all over the world need protection from torture and abuse by governments which say they represent and uphold human rights . "
The government confirmed last night that security service agents had interviewed Mr Dergoul and other Britons held in Guantánamo " about the UK's national security " adding " it was important that we got as much information as possible .
They were arrested in unusual circumstances .
British officials who visited them acted with the highest degree of professionalism . "
The Foreign Office said : " The UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture .
The British government , including its intelligence and security agencies , never use torture for any purpose , including obtaining information , nor would we instigate actions by others to do so . "
It said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings .

The New York Post ran this below the fold on page one yesterday evening .
The Post had this comment in the body of the article :
A group of 9/11 families and firefighters who oppose Giuliani ’s candidacy were outraged .
“ Giuliani is running on 9/11 and portraying himself as a hero .
It ’s disgusting .
It ’s horrible , ” FDNY Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches said .
“ This guy will do anything to get elected . ”
The little man in search of a balcony appears to be doing his best to try to live up to satirists ’ expectations .
Here ’s hoping Giuliani has finally overplayed the 9/11 card .
Breaking news :
The Weekly Standard reports that Rudy ’s “ achievements in New York – not , as is so widely claimed , his leadership on September 11 , 2001 – serve as the touchstone of his presidential candidacy . ”
It looks like Rudy ’s campaign did n’t get the message ( scanned from the Post . )

Sometimes , it seems as if licensing and patent holding companies are holding a secret contest between themselves to see who can pack in the most defendants into a patent lawsuit .
Technology Patents LLC may be the new champion for suing 131 companies worldwide — the list goes on and on , naming companies like Vodafone , Orange , T - Mobile , Telstra , AT&T , Cincinnati Bell , Motorola , Microsoft , Helio , Taiwan Mobile , O2 , Rogers Wireless , China Resources Peoples Telephone Company , Yahoo , Sprint , and everyone in between .
The company and its founder , Aris Mardirossian , are suing over what he believes to be infringement on two of his patents that address international text messaging .
The two patents in question are 6,646,542 and RE39,870 — the second of which is merely a continuation of the first .
They are both titled " Global paging system using packet - switched digital data network and remote country designation " and discuss a method that would allow text messages to be sent from country to country while using the Internet as part of the process .
The system requires the sender to specify which country the message is going to first , then sends the message over a packet - switched digital data network ( the ' Net ) before being broadcast in the destination country in order to reach the recipient .
The continuation patent was issued just last month by the US Patent and Trademark Office .
In the complaint , Mardirossian asserts jurisdiction over all 131 companies because they all , in some way or another , enable text messages to be sent or received within his company 's home state of Maryland .
He accuses the companies of knowingly infringing on the two patents , which make them money by importing , selling , offering for sale , making , or advertising systems that do the same things .
Indeed , many mobile phone companies and Internet - based technologies allow users to send text messages all over the world , which Mardirossian would say infringes on his patents .
However , given the Supreme Court 's new standards for obviousness in patents , this case may hit a few speed bumps .
A technology licensing company named Friskit recently lost a patent infringement suit against Real Networks due to the SCOTUS decision , giving the ruling another leg to stand on .

The USPTO has been trying to cut down on the use of continuation patents , too , but has run into a few roadblocks of its own .
A federal judge stopped the USPTO late last month from limiting how continuation patents — those that mirror the original patent but with modifications — can be used , but the office is determined to soldier on .
" The USPTO continues to believe that the rules are an important component of modernizing the patent system .
They are part of a package of initiatives designed to improve the quality and efficiency of the patent process , " a USPTO spokesperson told InformationWeek in October .
Needless to say , Mardirossian has demonstrated with this suit that he is no ordinary guy .
Typically , a company genuinely interested licensing out technology to other companies would sue a few small companies at a time in order to build its portfolio , not the entire world at once .
The Patent Troll Tracker blog has also pointed out a number of other legal antics by Mardirossian , including his filing of frivilous defamation lawsuits and having been fined for attempting to donate money to political campaigns under his children 's names .
He also attempted to get a permit to chop down a number of trees after his neighbor , Washington Redskins ' owner Daniel Snyder , did so , but said that his reasoning was to protect his kids from hickory nuts .
Nuts or not ( * cough * ) , Mardirossian believes that he deserves some relief from these 131 companies .
Mardirossian and Technology Patents LLC ask for a permanent injunction against the infringing parties , and to have the US - based carriers shut down international SMS capabilities for good .
The complaint also asks for unspecified monetary damages .

Again with the NAR
In an article earlier today , I pointed out that the National Association of Realtors is sounding desperate these days .
The 6 % home - sale skimmers are taking pains to make housing look like a good " investment , " even though the NAR 's own predictions call for a worsening market .
In its latest press release , NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun , the trade group 's new and improved David Lereah , tries to argue that homes are better investments than stocks .
I wo n't take too much time to point out how specious his argument is , beyond pointing out that stocks , unlike homes , operate on a highly liquid market .
Moreover , they pay dividends , they do n't require thousands of dollars in yearly maintenance and property taxes , and finally , let 's note that Yun 's bogus return rate for housing depends entirely on the leverage people use to buy homes .
Buying stocks with major leverage would boost returns far beyond the alleged payoff from a home .
But that , of course , would be a risky thing to do -- just like buying an expensive home at the top of a market with no money down and an ARM , as so many Americans did over the past couple of years .
Numbers do n't lie , unlike the writers of some press releases
But back to the NAR 's numbers .
The organization that thinks it 's always a great time to buy nevertheless does n't seem to feel like it 's ever a good time to put its sales predictions in context .
I 'm here to help the NAR out , and by " help , " I mean " illustrate , in the NAR 's own words and figures , how the trends in its predictions makes its look downright ridiculous . "
Let 's start with existing home - sales predictions .
Estimated 2007 Sales Diff . From Prior Month Difference From January Prediction Difference From Prior Year NAR Spin January 6,420,000 ( 0.93 % ) Gradual Rise Projected for Home Sales February 6,440,000 0.31 % 0.31 % ( 0.62 % ) Existing - Home Sales To Improve , With Later Recovery for New Homes March 6,420,000 ( 0.31 % ) 0.00 % ( 0.93 % ) Housing Recovery Likely This Year , but Timing Is n't Clear April 6,340,000 ( 1.25 % ) ( 1.25 % ) ( 2.16 % ) Tighter Lending Standards Good for Housing , but Will Dampen Sales May 6,290,000 ( 0.79 % ) ( 2.02 % ) ( 2.93 % ) Housing Forecast Changed Slightly Due to Impact From Tighter Lending June 6,180,000 ( 1.75 % ) ( 3.82 % ) ( 4.63 % ) Home Sales Projected to Fluctuate Narrowly With a Gradual Upturn July 6,110,000 ( 1.13 % ) ( 4.83 % ) ( 5.71 % ) Home Prices Expected to Recover in 2008 as Inventories Decline August 6,040,000 ( 1.15 % ) ( 5.92 % ) ( 6.79 % ) Near - Term Home Sales to Hold in Modest Range September 5,920,000 ( 1.99 % ) ( 7.79 % ) ( 8.64 % ) Mortgage Problems to Dampen Home Sales in The Short Term October 5,780 , 000 ( 2.36 % ) ( 9.97 % ) ( 10.80 % ) Improvement in Mortgage Market Bodes Well for Housing in 2008 November 5,670,000 ( 1.90 % ) ( 11.68 % ) ( 12.50 % ) Modest Recovery for Existing - Home Sales in 2008 as Credit Crunch Subsides
Hmmm .
How 's that for an investment opportunity ?
Lever up with a risky mortgage , and then enter a market where the supposed " experts " continually drop their sales predictions , which now stand at a 12.5 % drop from last year 's actual sales , and 11.7 % below what the NAR cheerleaders expected in January .
From ugly to fugly
Things look even worse for new - home sales .
Here 's what the NAR 's constantly shifting story there has looked like .
Estimated 2007 Sales Difference From Prior Month Difference From January Prediction Difference from Prior Year January 957,000 ( 8.86 % ) February 961,000 0.42 % 0.42 % ( 8.48 % ) March 950,000 ( 1.14 % ) ( 0.73 % ) ( 9.52 % ) April 904,000 ( 4.84 % ) ( 5.54 % ) ( 13.90 % ) May 864,000 ( 4.42 % ) ( 9.72 % ) ( 17.71 % ) June 860,000 ( 0.46 % ) ( 10.14 % ) ( 18.10 % ) July 865,000 0.58 % ( 9.61 % ) ( 17.62 % ) August 852,000 ( 1.50 % ) ( 10.97 % ) ( 18.86 % ) September 801,000 ( 5.99 % ) ( 16.30 % ) ( 23.71 % ) October 804,000 0.37 % ( 15.99 % ) ( 23.43 % )
Again , this should come as a surprise to no one who 's followed the problems at builders such as Centex ( NYSE : CTX ) , Ryland Group ( NYSE : RYL ) , or Toll Brothers ( NYSE : TOL ) .
Houses are n't selling like they used to , nor are they getting the prices they used to .
That 's because lenders such as Countrywide Financial ( NYSE : CFC ) and IndyMac Bankcorp ( NYSE : IMB ) are n't spreading subprime and Alt - A loans out the way they used to .
Peers such as Novastar Financial ( NYSE : NFI ) and Impac Mortgage Holdings ( NYSE : IMH ) have pretty much pulled the blinds and given up .
Foolish final thought
So there 's no glut of low - end money to keep pushing prices up , which means the end of the great housing Ponzi scheme of this decade .
The builders know it .
The banks know it .
Even the NAR knows it .
Just do n't expect them to explain it to you in plain English , as these tables do .
Straight talk is bad for Realtors ' pocketbooks .
Mobile phone use is currently banned on planes
Plans have been developed across EU countries to introduce technology which permits mobile calls without risk of interference with aircraft systems .
Regulators around Europe are calling for consultation on the potential introduction of the technology .
If given the go ahead , the service would allow calls to be made when a plane is more than 3,000 metres high .
Individual airlines would need to decide if they wanted to introduce the technology , if the green light is given by national regulators .
A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic said the airline was " watching developments closely " .
She said : " We are monitoring customer demand and will act if they say they want to use their mobile phones . "
She added : " If we were to introduce this service in the future we want to ensure we do it in a socially acceptable way . "
The European Union has recommended to member states that the plan go ahead and space on the airwaves has been reserved for the technology .
The cost of making a mobile phone call from a plane will be higher than making one from the ground .
In the UK , regulator Ofcom said it would investigate and address any evidence of " excessive charges and abuses of competition " if prices were set unfairly by airlines and mobile networks .
Mobile use is currently prohibited on planes because there is evidence that they interfere with onboard communication and navigation systems .
Research published in 2003 by the CAA found mobile phone signals skewed navigation bearing displays by up to five degrees .
Many stages
A spokesman for the UK regulator Ofcom said there were still many stages to pass through before final approval was given to the roll out of the plans .
The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) , in the UK , and the European Aviation Safety Agency are working to ensure that aircraft safety and passenger welfare issues are resolved before these systems can be used .
The regulator said that the technology could be implemented next year .
The proposed system utilises an on - board base station in the plane which communicates with passengers ' own handsets .
The base station - called a pico cell - is low power and creates a network area big enough to encompass the cabin of the plane .
The base station routes phone traffic to a satellite , which is in turn connected to mobile networks on the ground .
A network control unit on the plane is used to ensure that mobiles in the plane do not connect to any base stations on the ground .
It blocks the signal from the ground so that phones cannot connect and remain in an idle state .
Calls will be billed through passengers ' mobile networks .
The current plan is for 2G phones only but Ofcom said that if services proved successful , it could be rolled out to 3G and other standards in the future .
Last month the popular private BitTorrent tracker OiNK was effectively shut down in a joint effort by Dutch and British law enforcement .
OiNK admin Alan Ellis who was arrested during the raid now launched a legal defense fund to cover the legal costs and asks former OiNK members to help him out .
Alan has put a message on his reclaimed domain where he writes : “ A PayPal account has been setup for those of you wishing to give a gift to help cover legal costs , if or when they arise .
Although the account is not in my name ( it ca n’t be ) , it is someone I trust . ”
The donations will be used to cover the legal costs Alan is likely to make .
If for some reason the money is n’t needed it will be donated to an animal charity ( pigs ? ) .
The official OiNK fundraiser is hosted at saveoink.com , and unlike the scams we have seen before , it is totally legit .
OiNK was considered by many to be the best BitTorrent music tracker the world has ever seen .
With 180,000 members it was without a doubt one of the most popular private BitTorrent trackers .
Although most of its members found a new home by now , there is little doubt that it will be very hard to equal the success of OiNK
At this point it is still unclear what the charges against Alan will be , more details on this will come out next month .
We will keep you updated of course .

Via Sully , the drug wars claim another life :
Robin Prosser , a Missoula woman who struggled for a quarter century to live with the pain of an immunosuppressive disorder , tried years ago to kill herself .
Last week , she tried again .
This time , she succeeded .
After her earlier attempt failed , Prosser wound up in even more trouble after investigating police found marijuana in her home .
She used the marijuana to help cope with pain .
That marijuana charge was eventually dropped in an agreement with the city of Missoula , and Prosser had reason to rejoice in 2004 when Montanans passed a law allowing medical use of the drug .
She was a high - profile campaigner for the Montana Medical Marijuana Act , and like others , she was dismayed when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that drug agents could still arrest sick people using marijuana , even in states that legalized its use .
I have had a couple drinks , so let ’s be blunt ( pardon the pun ) - and this goes out to anyone , of any political persuasion , anywhere , who had a problem with this woman using marijuana to alleviate her pain ( especially the alleged “ conservative ” federalists who ca n’t handle the thought of states making their own drug laws ) :
Go fuck yourself .
To death .
I am tired of being patient with you nannies and your stupid self - serving rules and your slippery slopes and your bullshit and your need to be tough on crime and your earnest concerns about society .
Mind your own business , get your own house in order , stop fucking interns and little boys and cheating on your wives and on your taxes and being found dead wearing two wetsuits with a dildo shoved up your ass .
Just mind your own damned business , and let people do what they must to deal with their own screwed up lives , and let people handle their pain the best way they can .
I am sick of the bullshit .
Life is hard for most people out there , and damned near impossible for people in chronic pain .
Quit making it worse , you allegedly compassionate sons - of - bitches .
*** Update ***
If I could choose one person to force to run for office who would represent my views a portion of the time but would be fair when he did n’t , it would be James Joyner .
*** Update # 2 ***
This woman is now dead , in large part , because of DEA behavior condoned and encouraged by compassionate conservative George Bush , who supported the rights of states to decide these things when he was running for President .
As President , he allowed his Justice Department and his DEA to continue to menace people .
Karl
Rove probably decided it was better to go with the Christians than the middle , yet again .
Robin Prosser is dead , and George Bush does n’t even know or probably care who she is , but his government had a hand in her passing .
I do n’t know yet who I am supporting in 2008 for President , but something needs to be done about the current state of affairs in this country .
The status quo in America is just not working for most Americans .
That is n’t left - wing radicalism to recognize that .
Across the board , this administration has pushed policies which are not only deeply unpopular with Americans , but bad for them .
Stem - cell research immediately comes to mind .
I do n’t support government solutions to every problem , and never will , but I do n’t think it is too much to ask for the government to at least do no harm .
Well , I did n’t think that was too much to ask until I realized what Bush and Cheney and their allies in Congress have done to this country .
It is beyond time for them to grab their bibles and get the fuck out of the way .
The conventional take on Rudy Giuliani ’s courtship of the religious right is that the former New York City mayor gutsily has refused to compromise his pro-choice principles , instead asking pro-life Christian conservatives not to allow his differences with them on that issue to obscure larger areas of agreement .
In fact , in a well received speech at the recent Values Voters Summit sponsored by the Family Research Council , Hizzoner tried to make a virtue of out of his apostasy .
“ Is n’t it better that I tell you what I really believe , ” he asked the VVs , “ instead of pretending to change all of my positions to fit the prevailing winds ? ”
He then cited his  and the audience ’s  hero Ronald Reagan for the proposition that “ my 80 % friend is not my 100 % enemy . ”
Do the math , as they say , and one might think that the 80 % Giuliani and the Values Voters have in common concerns issues other than abortion  toughness on urban crime , for example , or resistance to what Giuliani called “ the Islamic terrorist war against the United States . ”
Actually , thanks to some rhetorical double - bookkeeping , Giuliani was able to cram abortion - related issues into his 80 % solution .
True , he alluded to his own longtime pro-choice position by noting that “ people of good conscience come to different conclusions about whether abortions should be legal in some circumstances ” ( an assertion that is anathema to many Values Voters ) .
But then he turned on the fudge machine .
Pro-choice as he may be , Giuliani told the VVs that he wants America to become “ a country without abortion . ”
This takes Giuliani well beyond the triangulating formula used by Bill Clinton : that abortions should be “ safe , legal and rare . ”
In its absolutism , moreover , it recalls the absurd aspiration of a “ drug - free America . ”
True , Giuliani said he would obliterate abortions by “ changing the minds and hearts of people , ” but then he offered a laundry list of governmental actions to limit the procedure .
“ First , I will veto any reduction in the impact of the Hyde Amendment or other existing limits on abortions or the public funding of abortions .
I will support any reasonable suggestion that promises to reduce the number of abortions .
I support parental notification and will continue to , and I supported and continue to support the ban on partial - birth abortion . ”
He added that as president he would “ remove the bureaucratic red tape that makes adoption so difficult , both for children here at home and abroad ” and would make a $ 10,000 adoption tax credit permanent .
But that ’s not all .
The supposedly pro-choice Giuliani promised the VVs that he would appoint Supreme Court justices “ in the mold of Justice Scalia , Justice Thomas , Justice Alito or Chief Justice Roberts . ”
For good measure , he noted that his campaign ’s judicial advisory board is chaired by former Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson and includes conservative lawyers Miguel Estrada and Steven Calabresi ( a founder of the Federalist Society . )
Never mind that the four justices he mentioned are not interchangeable on abortion .
All four joined in this year ’s ruling upholding a federal ban on so - called partial - birth abortion , but Roberts and Alito declined to sign a concurring opinion by Thomas and Scalia that trashed Roe vs. Wade .
So there are at least two molds in which President Giuliani might form his appointments to the court .
But that nuance was lost ( as it was supposed to be ) in the larger message : that Giuliani would appoint justices congenial to the VVs on the issue they care most about .
So let ’s review : Giuliani is pro-choice , at least to the extent of believing that abortion should be legal “ in some circumstances . ”
( If the circumstances he has in mind are abortions early in pregnancy , then he believes that most abortions should be legal . )
But as president he would do his best  including in his appointment of justices to the Supreme Court  to make it harder to get an abortion .
And his absolute goal is an America in which no abortions occur  including abortions that the pro-choice half of Giuliani ’s brain thinks should be legal .
Huh ?
Giuliani has been criticized  fairly  by pro-lifers for simultaneously believing that abortion is what they say it is ( the unjustified taking of a human life ) and for insisting that it ’s a matter of a woman ’s choice .
But that contradiction is no more contorted than Giuliani ’s message to the Values Voters : I am pro-choice , but I will appoint Supreme Court justices who ( nudge , wink ) might take that right away from women .
Let me anticipate a defense of Rudy ’s position  that you can be “ personally pro-choice ” and still object to Roe vs.
Wade as judicial overreaching .
I actually know and admire people who hold this position .
Abortion should be legalized , they maintain , but through the action of the people ’s elected representatives , not by the fiat of an imperial judiciary .
Fair enough .
So would a President Giuliani sign the Freedom of Choice Act , a perennial proposal in Congress to codify Roe vs .
Wade in a federal statute ?
I suppose Rudy could balk at signing that bill by citing concerns about federalism , rejecting the legislation ’s premise that Congress can legislate on abortion as part of its constitutional power , including the power to regulate interstate commerce .
OK , but in that case , would Giuliani urge the states to legalize abortion in the circumstances in which he believes it should be allowed ?
I have a feeling the Values Voters would regard that as a breach of faith .
The interesting question about Giuliani ’s courtship dance with the religious right is not whether VVs will accept him as the Republican nominee despite his differences with them on abortion .
It is whether Giuliani ’s pro-choice position is so attenuated and abstract that he might as well be an opponent of legal abortion .
As a practical matter , the 20 % difference between the VV ’s position on abortion and “ what I really believe ” may be closer to 2 % .
Perhaps an abortion - rights group should invite the mayor to amplify on what being pro-choice means to him .

LAS VEGAS —
In the foreclosure crisis of 2007 , thousands of American families are losing their homes without ever missing a payment .
They are renters in houses whose owners default on their mortgages — a large but little noticed class of casualties .
Some live in big apartments , others in houses owned by small investors who got in over their heads .
There are no exact figures for how many renters have been evicted because of foreclosures , but a survey taken this year by the Mortgage Bankers Association found that one in seven foreclosures was non -owner - occupied .
This figure probably underestimates the problem , according to the association , because buildings receive tax benefits if they are registered as owner - occupied .
More than one million properties are expected to enter foreclosure this year .
Many renters say they never even knew their buildings were heading for foreclosure .
“ This is an explosion , ” said Judith Liben , a lawyer at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute .
“ This is n’t business as usual .
These are investors that overleveraged themselves , and the renters are collateral damage in the mortgage crisis . ”
Here in Nevada , which has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , 28 percent of mortgages that were in default earlier this year were for homes not owner - occupied , more than twice the national average , according to the bankers group .
Arizona and Florida , both leaders in foreclosures , are also well above the national average .
In California , 22 percent of the properties lost to foreclosure this year were not owner - occupied , according to ForeclosureRadar.com , which tracks California foreclosure auctions .
The young marine lit a cigarette and let it dangle .
White smoke wafted around his helmet .
His face was smeared with war paint .
Blood trickled from his right ear and the bridge of his nose .
Momentarily deafened by cannon blasts , he did n't know the shooting had stopped .
He stared at the sunrise .
His expression caught my eye .
To me , it said terrified , exhausted and glad just to be alive .
I recognised that look because that 's how I felt too .
I raised my camera and snapped a few shots .
With the click of a shutter , Marine Lance Corporal James Blake Miller , a country boy from Kentucky , became an emblem of the war in Iraq .
The image would change two lives - his and mine .
I was embedded with Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion , 8th Marine Regiment , as it entered Falluja , an insurgent stronghold in Iraq 's Sunni Triangle , on 8 November 2004 .
We encountered heavy fire almost immediately .
We were pinned down all night at a traffic circle , where a six - inch kerb offered the only protection .
I hunkered down in the gutter that endless night , praying for daylight , trying hard to make myself small .
A cold rain came down .
I cursed the Marines ' illumination flares that wafted slowly earthward , making us wait an eternity for darkness to return .
At dawn , the gunfire and explosions subsided .
A white phosphorus artillery round burst overhead , showering blazing - hot tendrils .
We came across three insurgents lying in the street , two of them dead , their blood mixing with rain .
The third , a wiry Arab youth , tried to mouth a few words .
All I could think was : ' Buddy , you 're already dead . '
We rounded a corner and again came under heavy fire , forcing us to scramble for cover .
I ran behind a Marine as we crossed the street , the bullets ricocheting at our feet .
Gunfire poured down and it seemed incredible that no one was hit .
A pair of tanks rumbled down the road to shield us .
The Marines kicked open the door of a house and we all piled in .
Miller and other Marines took positions on the rooftop ; I set up my satellite phone to transmit photos .
But as I worked downstairs in the kitchen , a deep rumble almost blew the room apart .
Two cannon rounds had slammed into a nearby house .
Miller , the platoon 's radioman , had called in the tanks , pinpointed the targets and shouted : ' Fire ! '
I ran to the roof and saw smouldering ruins across a large vacant lot .
Beneath a heap of bricks , men lay dead or dying .
I sat down and collected my wits .
Miller propped himself against a wall and lit his cigarette .
I transmitted the picture that night .
Power in Falluja had been cut in advance of the assault , forcing me to be judicious with my batteries .
I considered not even sending Miller 's picture , thinking my editors would prefer images of fierce combat .
The photo of Miller was the last of 11 that I sent that day .
On the second day of the battle , I called my wife by satellite phone to tell her that I was OK .
She told me my photo had ended up on the front page of more than 150 newspapers .
Dan Rather had gushed over it on the evening news .
Friends and family had called her to say they had seen the photo - my photo .
Soon , my editors called and asked me to find the ' Marlboro Marine ' for a follow - up story .
Who was this brave young hero ?
Women wanted to marry him .
Mothers wanted to know whether he was their son .
I did n't even know his name .
Shellshocked and exhausted , I had simply identified Miller as ' a Marine ' and clicked ' send ' .
I found Miller four days later in an auditorium in the city 's civic centre .
Miller 's unit was taking a break , eating military rations .
Clean - shaven and without war paint , Miller , 20 , looked much younger than the battle - stressed warrior in the picture - young enough to be my son .
He was co-operative , but embarrassed about the photo 's impact back home .
Once our story identified him , the national fascination grew stronger .
People shipped care packages , making sure Miller had more than enough smokes .
President Bush sent cigars , candy and memorabilia from the White House .
Then Major General Richard F Natonski , head of the 1st Marine Division , made a special trip to see the Marlboro Marine .
To talk to Miller , Natonski had to weave between earthen berms , run through bombed - out buildings and make a mad sprint across a street to avoid sniper fire before diving into a shattered store front .
' Miller , get your ass up here , ' a first sergeant barked on the radio .
Miller had no idea what was going on as he ran through the rubble .
He snapped to attention when he saw the general .
Natonski shook Miller 's hand .
Americans had ' connected ' with his photo , the general said , and nobody wanted to see him wounded or dead .
' We can have you home tomorrow , ' he said .
Miller hesitated , then shook his head .
He did not want to leave his buddies behind .
' It just was n't right , ' he told me later .
' Your father raised one hell of a young man , ' the general said , looking Miller in the eye .
They said goodbye and Natonski scrambled back to the command post .
For his loyalty , Miller was rewarded with horror .
The assault on Falluja raged on , leaving nearly 100 Americans dead and 450 wounded .
The bodies of some 1,200 insurgents littered the streets .
As the fighting dragged on , the story fell off the front page .
I joined the exodus of journalists going home or moving to the next story .
More than a year and a half would pass before I saw Miller again .
Back home , I tried to put Falluja behind me .
Yet not a day went by that I did n't think about Miller and Iraq .
National Public Radio interviewed me .
I became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize .
Bloggers riffed on the photo's meaning .
Requests for prints kept coming .
In January 2006 , I was on assignment along the US - Mexico border when my wife called .
' Your boy is on TV .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder , ' she said .
' They kicked him out of the Marines . '
I 'd spoken with Miller by phone twice , but the conversations had been short and superficial .
I knew PTSD was a complex diagnosis .
So I dug up his number .
I offered simple words : life is sweet .
We survived .
Everything else is gravy .
As the third anniversary of the US - led invasion approached , my editors wanted another follow - up story .
So in spring 2006 , I drove to Miller 's hometown of Jonancy , Kentucky , in the hollows of Appalachia .
Mobile homes and battered cars dot the rugged ranges .
Marijuana is a major cash crop .
Addiction to methamphetamine and prescription drugs is rampant .
Kids marry young and boys go to work mining the black seams of coal .
Miller showed me around .
At an abandoned mine , he picked up a chunk of coal .
' Around here , this is what it 's all about , ' he said .
' Nothing else .
It was this or the Marines . '
Often brooding and sullen , Miller joked about being ' 21 going on 70 ' , the result , he said , of humping heavy armour and gear on a 6ft , 11½st frame .
Before he was allowed to leave Iraq , he attended a mandatory ' warrior transitioning ' session about PTSD and adjusting to home life .
Each Marine received a questionnaire .
Were they having trouble sleeping ?
Did they have thoughts of suicide ?
Everybody knew the drill .
Answer yes and be evaluated further .
Say no and go home .
Miller said he did n't want to miss his flight .
He answered no to every question .
He returned to Camp Lejeune , North Carolina .
His high - school sweetheart , Jessica Holbrooks , joined him there and they were married in a civil ceremony .
But he began to have nightmares and hallucinations .
He imagined shadowy figures outside the windows .
Faces of the dead haunted his sleep .
Once , while cleaning a shotgun , he blacked out .
He regained consciousness when Jessica screamed his name and realised he was pointing the gun at her .
He reported the problems to superiors , who promised to get him help .
Then came a single violent episode which put an end to his days as a Marine .
It happened in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2005 .
His unit had been sent to New Orleans to assist with hurricane Katrina relief efforts .
Now a second giant storm , Hurricane Rita , was moving in , and the Marines were ordered to seek safety out at sea .
In the claustrophobic innards of a navy ship , someone whistled .
The sound reminded Miller of a rocket - propelled grenade .
He attacked the sailor who had whistled .
He was medically discharged with a ' personality disorder ' on 10 November 2005 , one year after his picture made worldwide news .
Back home in Kentucky , the Millers settled into a sparsely furnished , second - storey apartment .
Four small windows afforded little light .
The TV was always on .
Miller bought a motorcycle and went for long rides .
He and Jessica drank all night and slept all day .
He started collecting a monthly disability benefit of about $ 2,500 .
The couple spent hours watching movies on DVD , Coronas and bourbon cocktails in hand .
Friends and family gave them space .
Miller had hoped to pursue a career in law enforcement , but the PTSD and discharge killed that dream .
No one would trust him with a weapon .
But at least he did n't have to go back to Iraq .
He started to realise he was n't the only one traumatised by war .
' There 's a word for it around here , ' Jessica said .
' It 's called " vets " . '
She talked of Miller 's grandfather , changed by the Korean War and dead at 35 .
Her Uncle Hargis , a Vietnam veteran , had it too .
He experienced mood swings for years .
Sometimes , Miller 's stories about Iraq unnerved his wife .
He sensed it and talked less .
Nobody really understands , he said , unless they 've been there .
On 3 June 2006 , the Millers renewed their vows at a hilltop clubhouse in a lavish ceremony paid for by donors from across the country .
His father and two younger brothers , supposed to be groomsmen , did n't show up .
His estranged mother was n't invited .
Instead of a honeymoon , the couple travelled to Washington , DC , at the invitation of the National Mental Health Association , which wanted to honour Miller for his courage in going public about PTSD .
They also wanted him to visit lawmakers to share his experience .
As a boy , Miller confided , he had embraced religion , even going so far as to become an ordained minister by mail order .
He felt the passion for preaching .
That 's how he found his new mission : to tell people what it was like to come home from war with a broken mind .
Three days after their wedding , I tagged along as the young couple flew to the nation 's capital .
Easily distracted by the offer of free drinks for an all - American hero , Miller stayed out until 3 am .
He was hungover during his meeting with House members a few hours later and smoked and cursed while recounting his combat experiences .
The politicians listened politely and thanked Miller for his service .
One congressman sent an aide to tell Miller he was too busy to meet him .
No one promised to take up his cause .
After Miller picked up his award , he took a tour past the White House and Lincoln Memorial , but his mind was elsewhere .
' Let 's get drunk , ' he said .
I returned to Los Angeles the next morning , thinking I would catch up with Miller in a couple of months .
A week later , Jessica called .
After they had got home , Miller 's mood had become volatile .
He was OK one minute and in a deep funk the next , she told me .
Then he 'd disappeared .
She had n't seen him for days .
Could I come to Kentucky and help ?
Why me ?
I thought .
I could feel the line between journalist and subject blurring .
Was I covering the story or becoming part of it ?
I travelled all night to get to Pikeville , Kentucky , and found myself with Jessica , making the rounds of all the places Miller might have gone .
I wanted to be somewhere else .
Finally , the next morning , Jessica saw him driving in the opposite direction .
She did a U - turn and caught up with him down the road .
He got out of his truck .
A woman sat in the passenger seat .
' Who is that , Blake ? ' Jessica demanded .
' Who is she ? '
He said her name was Sherry .
They had just met and he was helping her move .
Jessica did n't believe him .
I thought : did n't I attend this young couple 's fairytale wedding just 10 days ago ?
Now here they were , in a gas station parking lot , creating a spectacle .
Jessica grilled Miller .
He seemed sober and sullen .
Then he dropped a bomb .
He did n't want her any more and had filed for divorce .
' You guys might want to go home and talk , ' I suggested .
At home , the tortured dialogue escalated .
Jessica pleaded with Blake to stop and think .
They could quit drinking , she said .
They 'd get help for him and as a couple .
Maybe they could move away - anything to work it out .
Miller slumped on the couch .
I sensed his unease and feared he would become violent , so I stayed even though I felt intrusive .
But he remained strangely calm , albeit brooding .
I returned the next morning .
He called his attorney and put the phone on speaker .
If uncontested , the lawyer said , the divorce would become final in 60 days .
Jessica went to the fire escape to gather herself .
Miller remained unmoved , chain - smoking .
The local newspaper had been calling him about rumours that he was getting divorced .
He wrote a statement .
He asked for compassion and respect for their privacy .
The next day , I found Miller in a back bedroom at his uncle 's house .
He told me that he had come close to killing himself the night before .
He had thought about driving his motorcycle off the edge of a mountain road .
He showed me the newspaper .
His divorce was the lead story .
I felt torn .
I did n't want to get involved .
I desperately wanted to close the book on Iraq .
But if I had n't taken Miller 's picture , this very personal drama would n't be front - page news .
I felt responsible .
Sometimes , when things get hard to witness , I use my camera as a shield .
It creates a space for me to work and distance to keep my feelings in check .
But Miller had no use for a photojournalist .
He needed a helping hand .
I flashed back to the chaos of combat in Falluja .
In the tight spaces , we were scared mindless .
Everybody dragged deeply on cigarettes .
Above the din , I heard what everybody was thinking : this is the end .
I 've never felt so alone .
I snapped back to the present and before I knew it , the words spilled out .
' I have to ask you something , Blake , ' I said .
' If I 'd gone down in Falluja , would you have carried me out ? '
' Damn straight , ' he said , without hesitation .
' OK then , ' I said .
' I think you 're wounded pretty badly .
I want to help you . '
He looked at me for a moment .
' All right , ' he said .
A veterans ' treatment programme in West Haven , Connecticut , arguably the best in the nation , offered hope .
Moe Armstrong , a pioneer in vet - to - vet counselling , had heard of Miller 's troubles and sent him feelers about coming for a visit .
Despite my reservations about getting too involved , I coaxed Miller into my car and we headed north .
I questioned myself .
Was this the right thing to do ?
For Miller , yes .
But for me ?
What awaited us at the end of this journey ?
I caught Miller 's eyes in the rear - view mirror , droopy and lifeless .
A long road led from his home in the Appalachian coal country to New England .
During the long drive to Connecticut , Miller and I discovered we had a lot in common , despite our 25 - year age difference .
We both had religious upbringings .
We both went to public schools and ran with reckless crowds .
Like Miller , I 'd faced obstacles growing up .
Despite my good grades , my high school counsellor saw only a Filipino immigrant and lumped me in with the underachievers .
Instead of college catalogues , she offered me army recruitment brochures .
It would be better than ' setting chokers ' , she said , referring to the equipment used to harvest clear - cut timber off mountainsides .
It 's dangerous work , like mining coal in Kentucky .
As dusk descended , Miller and I drove on , discussing movies , music , motorcycles and cars .
We talked about Iraq .
Miller recalled intense training as the Marines prepared to enter Falluja .
There was bluster , bravado .
Some of the men talked about notching ' kills ' .
On the eve of battle , they became subdued as they wrote last goodbyes .
Their letters basically said : if you get this , I am dead .
Miller was haunted by the brutality of the fight .
I remembered that , but my mind had also stored a consoling image , one of transcendent serenity .
I told Miller about it as we drove north .
The morning sun was streaming gloriously through the broken windows of the shattered Khulafah Rashid mosque in Falluja , where Marines had taken refuge during the battle .
The light splashed over deep red prayer rugs where Marines sprawled in fitful sleep , their packs serving as pillows .
Rubble littered the floor and dust floated up through shafts of light .
I recalled leaning against a pillar in the vast space , breathing the tranquillity .
Miller talked about killing the enemy .
' To try to live with that ... how do you justify it , regardless of what your causes are or what their causes are ? ' he said .
' To see somebody in your sights and to pull that trigger , it 's almost like you 're with them , seeing their life flash before their eyes as well as taking it .
It 's an insane connection that you make with that person at that point . '
We talked about the dissonance we felt .
We existed in our postwar world , forever changed by the experience .
Meanwhile , everyone around us seemed distracted by trivialities - the price of petrol , a sex scandal in Washington , a paparazzi photo of Britney Spears without panties .
Fuelled by coffee and Marlboros , we crossed six state lines and covered 870 miles .
At dawn , we arrived in West Haven .
It was pouring rain .
We checked into a motel pushed up against the freeway and Miller nodded off .
A CNN report about the war glowed on TV .
I could n't sleep .
A journalist was n't supposed to get involved with his subjects .
But I felt responsible for Miller .
Over and over , I thought : it will be my fault if something bad happens to him .
' You know you 're going to be OK , right ? '
Laurie Harkness , who runs Errera Community Care Centre for veterans , said when she met Miller the next day .
' Maybe you did some horrible things in Iraq .
But war is terrible , ' she said .
' You do what you have to in order to survive .
And you survived .
That 's good news , right ? '
Miller nodded .
He agreed to join the programme .
Veterans ' benefits would cover the cost of treatment .
Miller would pay $ 300 a month for room and board .
Between the counselling and the peer support from Moe Armstrong 's group , Vet to Vet , it seemed Miller would finally get the help he needed .
But shortly after signing in , he insisted on returning to Kentucky to get his motorcycle .
Harkness reluctantly issued a weekend pass .
I crossed my fingers .
Worried that I was in over my head , I asked Armstrong to accompany us as we covered the same highways we had traversed just days before .
I figured that if Armstrong was there to offer professional counselling , I could retreat into my role as journalist .
Besides , my patience was wearing thin .
Another 1,700 miles - for a motorcycle !
All the way back to Connecticut , I kept my eyes on the rearview mirror , constantly checking to make sure Miller had n't pulled a U - turn .
On the programme .
On himself .
On me .
Over the next month , I stayed by Miller 's side as he began to reveal the things that weighed so heavily on his mind .
At his request , I sat in on most of his therapy sessions .
He said my presence put him at ease , but I never put down my camera , never stopped documenting the story .
Miller told Harkness how empty and confused he had felt when combat ended .
How he had placed the barrel of an M - 16 assault rifle in his mouth on the outskirts of Falluja one day , taken a deep breath and reached for the trigger .
' What made me so special that I deserved to stay here and my buddies did n't ? '
Miller asked , speaking of friends who had died .
' At one point , I was almost mad at them .
How could they leave me like that ?
We came together .
We were supposed to leave together .
I do n't know how you can disconnect that feeling .'
He told us about an event that haunted him .
From an observation post in Falluja , he had seen a head pop up amid the wreckage of several cars .
It was a free - fire zone .
He squinted into his rifle scope , saw dark curly hair and squeezed the trigger .
Later , Marines advanced on the scene and found a dead boy , six or seven years old , his curly hair mottled by bits of brain and blood .
There was more , he said , terrible things he could n't divulge .
Not now .
Maybe never .
' To kill the snake , we had to cut off its head , ' was all he would say .
On 10 July 2006 , Miller turned 22 .
He seemed to be getting the help he needed .
I had been away from my wife and three children for a month .
It was time to go home to Los Angeles .
The night before my departure , I joined Miller and some other vets for a birthday dinner .
We broke it up about 10 pm .
I told Miller to call me day or night if he needed help .
I encouraged him to hang tough .
' You stuck your neck out for me to keep mine here , ' he said .
' And I feel with everything in me that you have saved my life .
I thank you for that .'
Relief washed over me .
It was like shedding a rucksack of rocks .
I got into my car as he started up his motorcycle .
A deep , loud rumble ripped the night .
We travelled together for a time .
He slowed and waved as I turned into my hotel .
I watched him roar into the darkness .
Over the next several weeks , Harkness took a special interest in Miller 's recovery .
She told him that , in time , he might even enrol at Yale University through a special admissions process .
Miller began to realise that guilt and fear were ruining him .
It 's what prompted the rush to marry Jessica , even though he knew deep down he was n't ready .
Now he understood that even Jessica could n't make him feel safe or accepted .
She could n't make him stop scanning the darkness for the enemy beyond .
It 's what made him drink all night , finding sleep in the arms of exhaustion .
Still , he did n't say much in group therapy .
He commonly skipped the daily meetings and instead spent hours on the phone with Jessica .
He put off sessions of ' cognitive behavioural therapy ' , which would require him to discuss his troubling memories .
' It 's all good , ' he told me over the phone .
He said he was gaining clarity .
He borrowed a guitar and strummed all day .
He expressed optimism .
But soon Miller began talking about going home .
Once again , I made the trip .
I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and tell him not to blow an excellent opportunity to put his life back together .
A chance to go to Yale ?
I would jump at that myself .
But Miller was n't receptive .
He had scuffled with some local motorcycle toughs and felt threatened .
He missed the mountains .
He wanted to go home .
Period .
Disappointing all who had tried to help him , he dropped out just two months into a programme that was supposed to last six months to a year .
We left Connecticut in the middle of the night .
I followed in my car as he rode his motorcycle for 18 hours through a sweltering summer day to be reunited with Jessica .
It was August 2006 .
The couple hoped to get a fresh start in Princeton , West Virginia , which offered a veterans ' centre , the mountains Miller loved and the privacy so lacking in his hometown .
They thought maybe they could work things out .
They shopped for used furniture and found an apartment that was light and airy , with a porch for barbecues .
But Armstrong , a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War , was worried .
He had had high hopes that he could help Miller and that Miller could help him reach a younger generation of combat veterans .
' Blake Miller is a flipped - out , 22 - year - old former Marine who was involved in a major battle , ' Armstrong said .
' He 's been through a lot , seen a lot .
I can't endorse the quick fix .
It 's a common pattern that vets are in and out of therapy for years . '
Miller began seeing psychologist and retired Marine Ernie Barringer at the veterans ' centre in Princeton .
Miller knew I was disappointed in him for leaving the Connecticut programme .
He and Jessica went out of their way to reassure me everything would be OK .
They drove me to the secluded mountain top outside Pikeville to show me the spot where Miller had asked Jessica to be his girl , just days before he shipped out to Iraq .
They laughed , embarrassed by the story .
Miller sipped root beer and Jessica Nehi orange soda .
Insects hummed in the dark .
Under a splash of stars , the moon rose .
A gentle breeze rippled the woods .
One could almost imagine Falluja had never happened .
By mid-October 2006 , Miller had again slipped into depression .
Memories flooded back as the second anniversary of the Falluja battle approached .
As the death toll mounted in Iraq , he worried about his buddies who had been redeployed to the Middle East .
Marriage counselling proved hard ; sessions often ended in stony silence .
Vaguely familiar facial features reappeared in Miller 's dreams : a mole , thick beards and curly black hair .
Then body parts exploding .
Jessica became frustrated .
They did n't talk .
They stopped having sex .
One night later that month , Miller called me , sounding depressed .
I offered to come and see him .
By the time I arrived , Jessica had moved out .
They next met at a law office in Pikeville , They sat across a wide table and agreed to proceed with a divorce .
So much for happy endings , I thought , recalling their wedding .
As Miller and I drove back to West Virginia , news crackled over the radio .
The Democrats had routed the Republicans in the midterm congressional election .
Public sentiment about Iraq had soured , and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the architect of the war , was resigning .
Miller had mixed feelings .
' That 's good news , I guess .
But it should 've happened a long time ago , ' he said .
' Everybody that 's dead now .
I mean , what 's the point ? '
It was 9 November 2006 , two years after I took the famous picture of Miller and a year after he left the Marines .
In his empty apartment , Miller took his wedding picture from the wall and replaced it with a Meritorious Mast , a certificate detailing his valour in combat .
He drank beer for comrades living and lost .
He spoke the names of the dead : Brown , Gavriel , Holmes , Ziolkowski .
' I did n't cry then and I wo n't now , ' Miller said .
' I just can 't . '
Over the next 10 days , we awoke late and drove aimlessly in the countryside .
He attended meetings at the vet centre .
I took more pictures .
Winter was upon the mountains .
Miller blamed his melancholy on the season .
Within weeks ,
Miller moved back to Kentucky and got an apprenticeship at a custom motorcycle shop , working up to 14 hours a day .
The shop 's owner presided over the local chapter of the Highwaymen , a Detroit - based motorcycle club under constant scrutiny by law enforcement .
Miller acknowledged that the Highwaymen were into ' serious business ' , but said he joined the club for the camaraderie .
The uniforms and codes of conduct reminded him of the Marines .
I worried about this new affiliation .
After joining , Miller never went out without his 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and he kept a shotgun in his truck .
To me , his new friends seemed overly interested in his combat ' kills ' .
One biker , a Vietnam veteran also plagued by PTSD , promised me he'd get Miller to join the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars .
' We 'll connect veteran to veteran , ' the biker told me , his breath tinged with moonshine .
Miller now sees Jessica a couple of times a month .
They have not completed their divorce , but remain separated .
' I see him on his good days , ' Jessica said , ' and everything is wonderful .
We actually have conversations . '
But then weeks pass without sight of him .
' He has to get stable , ' she said .
' If he was better , we'd be together all the time . '
Miller lives in a refurbished trailer behind his father 's house .
Two TVs provide constant background chatter .
The refrigerator is bare .
A hound called Mudbone spends most days tied in the yard .
Miller is estranged from his mother .
He talks with his father , Jimmy Miller , 43 , about everything except Iraq .
' What am I going to say ?
Son , I know what you 've been through ?
I know what you 're going through now ? ' the father said .
' Well , the truth is I do n't .
Maybe it 's just better that we leave it alone . '
Miller 's brother Todd , a 21 - year - old diesel mechanic , does n't pretend to understand .
' I 'm glad I did n't join the Marines , ' Todd said one day .
' I got a nice house , a wife and twin baby daughters and I drive a Durango that 's used but damn near new .
You 're divorced , drive a beat - up pickup and live in a trailer . '
On top of that , Todd told his brother , your head is screwed up .
The months go by .
One disability check comes and then the next - about $ 2,500 a month .
Miller sees Barringer , the psychologist , but only occasionally .
' Sometimes you just have to look at the culture of small - town eastern Kentucky , ' Barringer said .
' Blake graduated from high school and had no future .
So he joined the Marines , and now he 's home and has a steady income .
Things are good .
But sometimes that 's more of a negative than a positive , ' he added .
' Look , every time you go out to that mailbox and get your disability check , it tells you you 're sick . '
It took a while to get to know Miller .
But I 've come to appreciate his intelligence , generosity and dignity .
He is a talented musician and skilled mechanic .
I try to relate to him as a brother , even though I 'm older than his father .
He has helped me sort through the craziness of Falluja .
I can't stop the war , but Miller has given me a chance to make a difference - by helping him .
And maybe myself .
Often , I wonder if I 've done enough .
Can I let go now ?
Can I ever let go ?
The experts tell me I may be in it for the long haul .
Armstrong says Miller is ' playing out his symptoms on cue ' , adding : ' He 's just keeping his head above water .
He can't afford any downtime because it allows him to think . '
Harkness holds out hope that Miller will eventually seek intensive therapy of the kind she offered .
' He wo n't come in for help because a part of him is very macho , ' she said .
' He really comes across as the Marlboro Man .
My fear is that at some point , it 's all going to come crashing down . '
To me , she said : ' You are a constant object for Blake .
You are the only person to follow him from the war zone to back home .
You have a bond .
He would be much lonelier and lost without you . '
Some experts estimate that 30 per cent of the troops who have seen combat in Iraq will suffer from PTSD .
As that thought lingers in my head , I remind myself that the sweetest victory is survival .
The rest of life is a glittering gift , tempered in the forge of Falluja .
Sometimes in the night , I hear a grenade launcher belching rounds .
Or maybe it 's just Miller gunning his Harley .
He 's roaring over Foggy Mountain , the wind blowing by , cleansing his thoughts .
Blake , son , I know it sounds crazy , but my mind always takes me back to that distant rooftop in Falluja , where I snapped your picture .
I think of that sunrise , bright and warm , and how lucky we were to see it .
Sunday ’s scene played out for about 20 minutes , and at least one woman granted the men ’s request , setting off a roar as if the former star running back Curtis Martin had just scored a touchdown .
Martin was actually nearby , being honored on the field in the official halftime show , which had a far less intense audience .
Throughout halftime , about 10 security guards in yellow jackets stood near the bottom of the circular , multilevel ramp , located beyond the stadium ’s concourse of concession stands and restrooms .
One of the guards was smoking a cigarette ; many fans do the same during halftime on the giant ramps , which are located at each corner of the stadium .
Another guard later said they were not permitted to do anything about the chants at Gate D because of free speech laws .
Yet when a reporter tried to interview two security guards after halftime , he was detained in a holding room , threatened with arrest and asked to hand over his tape recorder .
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority , which provides security at Giants Stadium for Jets and Giants games , is aware of the raucous and raunchy halftime show .
Patrick C. Aramini , the authority ’s vice president for security , parking and traffic for the Meadowlands Sports Complex , said men and women could be expelled and even turned over to the New Jersey State Police to be arrested for their participation — although he said he did not know if anyone was cited Sunday .
He added that other measures , like blocking access to the ramps , were being considered .
“ The problem is , you got to watch four or five hundred people sometimes in the one particular spiral , ” Aramini said .
Throwing $ 75 BILLION into another trash dump to prop up their previously failed ventures .
When did throwing good money after bad become a successful strategy ?
While it may provide some immediate easing of the pain ( and that ’s a big * may * ) this is only delaying the inevitable .
Anyone who has their money with these banks ought to be wondering if their interests are being served with this new program .
Between the cushy exits plans for disgraced executives plus the typically high fees the banks charge ( including ATM charges that make no sense at all ) there is very little that these banks offer for average customers .
At least the Bush administration has not given Wall Street a wad of cash from taxpayers but it ’s still early .

Mr Davies returned to the UK on Saturday ( photo courtesy of Fair Trials Abroad )
Alan John Davies , 65 , from Blackpool , Lancashire , was convicted of trying to sell a large amount of heroin to a police informer in Thailand .
Mr Davies was sentenced to death after a trial in September 1994 , a term later reduced to 25 years in jail .
Fair Trials Abroad say he was the victim of a " miscarriage of justice " .
Mr Davies , who previously lived in Poole , Dorset , arrived back at Heathrow on Saturday after being released from a Bangkok prison on 8 May .
He said : " It 's more of a relief than anything .
At last I 'm away from there .
" That part of my life is over .
When it happened I never thought it would go on this long . "
" I 'm happy and gradually getting round to seeing and speaking to all my friends who helped me . "
We believe his case is a miscarriage of justice
Catherine Wolthuizen , Fair Trials Abroad
Catherine Wolthuizen , chief executive of Fair Trials Abroad , said Mr Davies was the longest - serving British prisoner overseas .
" He was in prison for 17 years , " said Ms Wolthuizen .
" There were a number of very severe anomalies in John 's arrest and subsequent trial .
" There were severe problems in how his applications for pardons were handled and also what we conceived to be very worrying irregularities in evidence and documentation provided by an official attached to the British Embassy .
Death row
" We believe his case is a miscarriage of justice .
Lawyers working on his case wrote on his behalf attesting to that . "
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) said its staff had done all they could to help Mr Davies .
" Since his arrest and detention in 1990 consular staff have visited Mr Davies in prison on a regular basis , " a spokeswoman said .
" Consular staff have provided a welfare role .
We supported two appeals for clemency on the grounds of Mr Davies ' ill health . "
The spokeswoman added that the FCO could not interfere or become involved in another country 's judicial process .
Mr Davies left Blackpool in January 1988 and was living in Thailand and working for a firm organising work contracts when he was implicated in a drug supply plot .
He was shackled with heavy leg irons for two years while on death row in the high - security Bangkwang prison in Nonthaburi .
' Hell - hole '
Mr Davies was later transferred to Klong Prem prison in Bangkok and said his wife died while he was in jail .
Describing the conditions he said : " It was a hell - hole .
You understand that 10 % of the prison population die every year - about 5,000 prisoners . "
Mr Davies survived a stroke in prison and an infection which almost led to his foot being amputated .
" I survived because a lot of people helped me from the UK , " he added .
" That is what kept me going .
If you are on your own there you get depressed , some take drugs , you have to cope . "
Mr Davies will mark his 66th birthday on Thursday and was planning to spend time with friends on Saturday .
Bolton sees Bush administration 's Iran diplomacy as appeasement David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007

Print This Email This Another former Bush administration official has turned into an outspoken critic , but instead of highlighting the administration 's failures in Iraq , former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton has been condemning it for being insufficiently hawkish on Iran .
According to the New York Times , " Mr. Bolton , long viewed by liberal critics as a villain on the Bush team , has since emerged as the administrations most outspoken critic from the right , rebuking his former boss in interviews , in op - ed articles and now in a book . "
Bolton 's criticism has reached a point where Steve Clemons is suggesting at The Washington Note that " the anti-Bush administration rhetoric now spewing forth from Bolton is shocking a lot of avid Bush supporters and hitting higher and higher decibel levels .
At what point do book parties for Bolton cross that line of disloyalty to Bush ? "
Promoting his book on CNN Friday morning , Bolton told John Roberts that the issue in Pakistan " is not a choice between democracy ... and martial law .
...
This is a choice right now between secure command and control over Pakistan 's nuclear weapons arsenel on the one hand and chaos on the other .
If we have chaos , we could have a radical Islamicist regime in charge of those weapons . "
When Roberts pointed out that Musharraf is arresting lawyers , not Islamic radicals , Bolton continued to insist that " we do n't have a very good idea of what the situation is .
... Events can spiral out of control . "
He also indicated his belief that all civilian governments in Pakistan have been corrupt and that only the military is reliable .
Roberts then asked Bolton about Iran 's recent claims of progress in its nuclear program .
Bolton responded that " we may be past the tipping - point " and said " I 'd analogize this to 1936 , when Hitler marched into the Rhineland .
...
If Iran gets nuclear weapons , the entire situation in the Middle East changes dramatically . "
Iran insists that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , although critical of Iran 's lack of full transparency , agrees there is no sign it is actively working on nuclear weapons and says Iran is years away from having a bomb .
Observers have also pointed out that , with Israel and Pakistan already having nuclear weapons , even if Iran joined them it would not fundamentally alter the balance of power in the region .
Roberts also showed Bolton a clip of Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel saying , " Now is the time for the United States to pursue an offer of direct , unconditional , and comprehensive talks with Iran . "
" That would be a bad mistake , " Bolton commented .
" When you go back to the days of the Cold War ... they knew you did n't negotiate with the Soviets until you were in a position of strength .
And we 're not in that position now .
... I do n't think Iran is going to be chit - chatted out of its nuclear weapons . "
Bolton is extremely negative in his book about the State Department under both Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice , saying they gave Iran time to develop its nuclear program and " that 's why we 're at such a dangerous point today . "
He describes the Bush administration 's Iran policy as " 4 1/2 years of failed diplomacy " and claims he left his position at the United Nations because of it .
However , according to most accounts , Bolton stepped down from his recess appointment as UN ambassador in December 2006 because it had become clear that his nomination -- formally submitted by President Bush the previous month -- would never be approved by the Senate .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on November 9 , 2007 .
RUSH TRANSCRIPT
( via closed captions )
ROBERTS :
We have been watching the volatile situation unfolding in pakistan this morning .
My next guest has some powerful and controversial ideas about the ways the u.s .
Diplomacy needs to change overseas .
Former u.s.
Ambassador to the united nations john bolton's got a new book out called " surrender is not an option , " and he joins me now .
Ambassador bolton , good to see you .
BOLTON : nice to be here .
ROBERTS : great read for me , because you know , all those years of following you around the world with the u.s .
Press corps filled in a lot of blanks .
A peek behind the curtain , fascinating stuff .
So pakistan , what do you see as the eventual outcome of this and what can the u.s .
Do to influence events there ?
BOLTON : it is obviously distressing .
It 's important people understand , this is not a choice between democracy and benazir bhutto on one side and martial law and pervez musharraf on the other .
This is a choice right now between security command and control over pakistan 's nuclear weapons arsenal on the one hand and chaos on the other .
If we have chaos , we could have a radical islamic regime in charge of those weapons .
ROBERTS : the people musharraf are arresting are not radicals , they 're attorneys , judges .
BOLTON : I think the problem is we do n't have a good idea of what the situation is .
I think unfortunately , we 've contributed to it .
And this is one of those things where events can spiral out of control .
And if they do that and those nuclear weapons fall into the hands of tirsts , we 're all in much worst shape .
ROBERTS : is benazir bhutto the savior of pakistan that they would like to portray her as ?
she was kicked out of office twice for corruption .
BOLTON : just because she 's a harvard graduate does n't mean she 's the savior for pakistan .
Her administration , sadly , was no better than most other civilian administrations in pakistan .
That 's why they call the military the steel skeleton there .
We may not like it , but it 's a fact of life in that country .
ROBERTS : your book goes into a lot of detail about trying to get iran to give up its nuclear program , and of course that , reached a new milestone this week when ahmadinejad said they had 3,000 of these centrifuges now capable of turning fluoride into highly enriched uranium .
Are we at a tipping point in this standoff and are you concerned that israel may try to take preemptive action ?
BOLTON : I think we may be past a tipping point .
I think iran clearly now has the scientific and technical mastery it needs to get to nuclear weapons .
I 'd analogyize this to hitler .
If britain and france had done some about the violation of the versailles treaty , we may have prevented world war i .
If iran gets nuclear weapons , the entire situation in the middle east changes radically .
ROBERTS : and hitler with was appeased in his early march and you accuse the government of trying to appease iran , throwing too many carrots .
And you talk about getting to a restaurant and condoleezza rice ordered carrot soup .
And kerik is very critical of the way white house is dealing with iran .
Take a look at what he said .
I want to ask you about it .
BOLTON : now is the time for the united states to actively pursue an offer of direct , unconditional , and comprehensive talks with iran .
We cannot afford to refuse to consider the strategic choice any longer .
ROBERTS : direct , unconditional , and comprehensive talks with iron .
An -- iran .
Your opinion ?
BOLTON : I think that would be a bad mistake .
Look , when you go back to the cold war and we had leaders leak dean acheson , they knew you did n't associate with the soevts until you were in a position of strength and we 're not in that position now .
On the nuclear issue , I do n't think iran is going to be chitchatted out of nuclear weapons .
They 've been pursuing it , 20 - year - long strategic decision to acquire this capability .
They 're very close to it .
We 've missed a lot of opportunities , precisely by engaging in diplomacy via the european union .
ROBERTS : you do n't seem to have in this book any great admiration for the way either colin powell or condoleezza rice handled the situation in dealing with iran .
Did they blow it ?
BOLTON : well , I think by deferring to the europeans in what actually became an obsession with the technique of diplomacy , as if that 's a policy objective rather than an instrument of foreign policy , we gave the iranians something they could n't buy , and that was time , time to get the necessary science and technology to get the nuclear weapons .
That 's why we 're at such a dangerous point today .
ROBERTS : the book is called " surrender is not an option , " a really interesting memoir from john bolton , former u.s .
Ambassador to the united nations , also the undersecretary of state for arms control and proliferation .
Thanks for being with us .
BOLTON : glad to be here .
ROBERTS : always good to see you .
Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) spoke with Tim Russert on this morning 's " Meet The Press " and stated he plans to introduce a resolution to censure President Bush in a few days .
When asked if the Senate Democratic leadership is supporting him , Feingold only went so far as to say that he has spoken with them and that they are working with him to put the resolution together .

Timmeh uses his best straw man argument to give the appearance that this will just be seen a politics , but Senator Feingold reminds him that a censure resolution is actually a rather tame move to make , considering a growing number of Americans want to see the president impeached .
Contact your Senators and ask them to support this resolution .
A censure does n't go far enough , but it 's a start ...
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union today announced the launch of a new " Surveillance Society Clock " to symbolize the reality that we are fast approaching a genuine surveillance society in the United States .
The clock is set at six minutes before the " midnight " of a dark end to privacy .
Also being released is a new report summarizing the state of privacy today and the video of a new piece about surveillance by spoken - word artists Steve Connell & Sekou ( tha misfit ) .
" We are rapidly moving toward a future where our every move , our every transaction , our every communication is tracked and may be used against us , " said Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU ’s Technology and Liberty Project .
" Too often that big picture is lost amid the stream of daily privacy stories .
The Surveillance Clock is part of our efforts to keep people focused on that big picture and dramatize what ’s happening to America . "
In conjunction with the clock , the ACLU released " Even Bigger , Even Weaker : The Emerging Surveillance Society . "
A follow - up to the ACLU ’s widely cited 2003 report " Bigger Monster , Weaker Chains , " the new paper provides an update on how diverse developments in technology , law and government are working together to bring us toward a surveillance society .
The ACLU also released a video of " Monster Among Us , " a spoken - word performance piece dramatizing the growing surveillance society , which Connell & Sekou wrote for the ACLU .
" The trend toward greater tracking and surveillance of individuals has intensified rapidly in recent years , " said Steinhardt .
" National identity systems , mass surveillance and data mining , the NSA ’s warrantless surveillance program , DNA data - banking , search engines that store our every query , even satellites – it ’s worse than ever . "
The ACLU also made available Web buttons that individuals can put on their own Web sites to spread the word about out - of - control surveillance .
The ACLU said it would push the clock forward or back in response to developments that worsen or improve the movement toward mass surveillance .
The Surveillance Society Clock was inspired by the " Doomsday Clock " created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to warn about the potential for nuclear war .
" The United States is at a crucial crossroads , " said Steinhardt .
" As Americans , we must rise to the challenge , confront the implications of new technologies before it ’s too late , and protect the privacy that Americans have always valued . "

After 35 Years on the Lam , Fugitive Captured Police arrested convicted murderer and prison escapee Linda Darby on Friday .
Oct. 17 , 2007  --
For the last 35 years Linda Joe McElroy lived a quiet and unassuming life in Pulaski , Tenn .
So neighbors were shocked to learn the grandmother who baby - sat their children and cleaned their homes was a convicted murderer who had escaped from prison decades earlier .
" I was flabbergasted because I just did n't believe she done that , " said McElroy 's neighbor Martha Ann Slater .
" She just do n't seem like that type of person . "
But police said the 64 - year - old , whose real name is Linda Darby , hid a secret .
Darby was a fugitive sentenced to life in prison in Indiana for murdering her husband in 1970 .
The man was shot to death and his body set ablaze .
After her conviction in the case , Darby served two years behind bars before she escaped from Indiana Women 's Prison in March 1972 by going over a barbed - wire fence .
She then moved to Tennessee where she married , had two children and started a new life — complete with a new name .
At least one expert said it is not difficult to begin a new life while on the lam .
" It 's actually quite easy to be absorbed if they cut all ties from their previous life , which appears to be the case in this situation , " said ABC News consultant and former FBI agent Brad Garrett .
Police credit Darby 's arrest to Indiana 's recently formed fugitive task force .
Though Darby had no driver 's license , authorities tracked her to Tennessee , where her confession surprised local police .
" I 've known of her the last 16 years .
She 's lived the life of a real good citizen , " said Pulaski Police Capt .
John Dickey .
Darby 's husband and stunned relatives have pleaded for mercy and leniency in her case .
" Let her out and go home to her family , " said her tearful cousin Tina McElroy .
While Darby awaits extradition to Indiana to serve out the rest of her sentence , a county jail holds her , according to The Associated Press .
Though she has waived her right to an extradition hearing , Darby has maintained her innocence .
" I did n't mean to mislead anybody , but I did n't want to pay for someone else 's crime , " she said .

A Royal Navy interception of a suspected drugs vessel
The UK and six other nations are launching a fresh effort to intercept drug smuggling runs across the Atlantic into Europe from Latin America .
A special centre is being opened in Portugal to co-ordinate rapid response naval operations against the trade .
A senior officer from Britain 's Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) has been named the operation 's first director .
Ministers hope the special naval operations centre will mean less cocaine reaches British drugs markets .
Officials say the amount of cocaine being smuggled into Europe has been rising - but the Lisbon - based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics ( MAOC-N ) has been set up for a new concerted continental effort against Latin America - based producers .
The operations centre co-ordinates drug smuggling intelligence and vessels from each country 's navy which are patrolling waters between South Africa and the Norwegian Sea .
Officers at the centre take decisions on which vessels from the partner nations are best placed to intercept a suspected cocaine shipment .
The centre is jointly run by the UK , Portugal , Spain , the Irish Republic , France , the Netherlands and Italy but will also include US military officers linked to naval operations in the Caribbean .
While the operation is being officially launched on Sunday , its officers have already run 22 operations since April , leading to 10 seizures totalling more than 10 tonnes , say officials .
In June intelligence gathered by British officials led to the French Navy intercepting a Brazilian vessel carrying 840 kg of cocaine .
' Cutting pathways ' Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said : " Our law enforcement agencies are focusing efforts on reducing the supply of Class A drugs , which cause the most harm to the individual , communities and society as a whole .
High Seas : Ministers want more co-ordinated missions " Soca involvement in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre - Narcotics will help target cocaine smugglers by sharing intelligence with other countries and coordinating rapid air and sea operations , making the best use of law enforcement and military resources to stop attempted drug runs across the Atlantic .
" By taking an active role in this innovative drug trafficking centre we are cutting down the pathways used by those serious criminals attempting to infest our country with cocaine . "
Despite increasing collaboration between European agencies , the amount of cocaine reaching Europe from Latin America has increased over the past decade .
The centre is seeking to attack that trend by targeting private vessels used to avoid detection by customs officials at ports .
Launched in 2006 , Soca says that in its first year it seized one fifth of Europe 's cocaine supply - 73 tonnes with a street value of £ 3 bn .
While critics say the agency needs to be more transparent , its chiefs say it needs to be judged over the long - term .
Its strategy focuses on bringing down organised criminals by trying to make it impossible for them to do business , rather than focusing on just making arrests .

What are these ?
The environmental group Greenpeace staged a protest yesterday at Woolworths '
London headquarters as part of a campaign to convince the retailer to take inefficient incandescent lightbulbs off the shelves by 2008 .
It was timed to coincide with the release of the group 's half - yearly financial results .
About 30 volunteers delivered thousands of signatures written on flags and formed a colonnade which staff passed under to reach their offices in Marylebone , while holding a banner reading ' Customers tell Woolworths - shelve old bulbs now ' .
Office workers were handed free compact fluorescent ( CFL ) bulbs as gifts and urged to bring up the topic with their managers .
Greenpeace claims that a recent policy announcement made by Woolworths about the phasing out of old - fashioned incandescent lightbulbs is dangerously weak .
While other retailers have committed to remove all such bulbs from stores as soon as this year , Woolworths has just announced a move which would barely comply with the government 's own voluntary initiative , which would see the bulbs off the shelves by 2011 .
In addition , the cheapest compact fluorescent bulb currently on sale at Woolworths is priced at £ 2.49 , while the retailer recently announced that it would be selling an entire bottle of champagne for £ 5 - the price of two low - energy lightbulbs .
For each year that British retailers keep selling incandescent lightbulbs , five million tonnes of unnecessary CO2 are released into the atmosphere , Greenpeace said .
Put another way , if all UK retailers moved as slowly as Woolworths , the UK would emit 20 million tonnes of CO2 unnecessarily - the equivalent to the yearly output of the entire country of Yemen .
Robin Oakley , a climate campaigner with Greenpeace , said : " We 're here to tell Woolworths that their customers want them to move a lot faster .
Removing power crazy lightbulbs from the shelves should be a first , quick step on the road towards offering truly sustainable products across the board .
Instead , Woolworths are doing the bare minimum , while most of their competitors are going much further . "
Woolworths recently changed its policy after a Greenpeace league table , which lists the commitments of all major UK retailers to phasing out inefficient bulbs , gave them a W grade for worst .
A recent hurried decision to comply with the 2011 government target still puts them behind Currys ( 2007 ) , Habitat ( 2009 ) , Sainsburys ( 2010 ) and Asda ( 2010 ) .
Oakley added : " The scientists are telling us that we have less than ten years left to really drastically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions , but Woolworths are telling us that it takes four of those years to change a lightbulb .
If the company really cares about offering their customers value for money they should only be selling CFL bulbs , which save households around £ 50 every single year . "
Woolworths said in a statement : " We are in ongoing discussions with Greenpeace with regard to the sale of lightbulbs .
Woolworths sells 5,000 energy efficient lightbulbs a week and has a range of 15 different energy saving options for customers ( a quarter of our total range ) .
We wrote to Greenpeace on Thursday to make our position clear and to share with them plans to stop selling incandescent lightbulbs by 2011 , phase out energy inefficient lightbulbs gradually in the run up to that date and promote energy saving lightbulbs to our customers .
Greenpeace has not responded .
We have asked Greenpeace to pass on our comments to its members and update its literature . "

What Stoichiometry Is and Why You Need To Understand It
Answer these questions NOW !
When you wash your hands , does it look like you are prepping for surgery ?
Do you quietly vomit inside your mouth when you shake someoneâ€™s hand ?
Do you avoid touching door handles ? … and yes , this includes the one in your own room .
If you answered â€ œYesâ€ to ALL of these questions , you are NORMAL and can stop reading at this point since you probably have a bottle of life saving antibacterial hand sanitizer in your pocket or purse right now .
If you answered â€ œNoâ€ to ANY or ALL of these questions , you need some HELP since you obviously donâ€™t know what germs are .
Would you let a colony of ants run rampant in your bedroom ?
Obviously not .
What if I said that thereâ€™s a colony of ants running rampant all over your body ?
Did you piss your pants yet ?
Look , Iâ€™m not here to dazzle you with techno - babble or use words that only a scientist geek would utilize .
Iâ€™m going to keep my argument short and sweet .
Germs are defined as â€œmicro - organisms that often cause diseasesâ€ .
NEWSFLASH EVERYBODY ! - Diseases Kill .
Iâ€™ll assume that you are convinced and we can move on to discussing ways of avoiding sickness and death .
OfferOfTheDay.com ’s Golden Rule :
You should use hand - sanitizer if you touch anything that you canâ€™t account for .
( Basically , when you are out in public , â€ œanythingâ€ means â€œeverythingâ€  )
How to Avoid Sickness And Death
If thereâ€™s one thing in life that you CAN control , itâ€™s whether or not to carry anti-bacterial hand sanitizer .
They make them in little pocket or purse - friendly sizes , and they even come in pens .
You can be the envy of your office and keep a few bottles on your desk at work , like I do .
I keep a few in my car so I can use some after I pump some gas .
I set aside a section of a drawer in my room especially for hand sanitizer .
It is currently filled to the brim with a couple dozen mini Purell bottles - I suggest you also set aside an “ Antibacterial Hand Sanitizer Drawer ” in your house for the same purpose .
I am often asked the question “ Which situations call for using hand sanitizer ? ” .
My answer is simple - “ ALL situations call for hand sanitizer “ , as made obvious by the “ Golden Rule “ .
Carry it with you at all times … unless you want to die .
How to Use Hand Sanitizer
Squeeze a dime sized portion of hand sanitizer on your hand ( Hint : Use your other hand to squeeze the bottle ) .
If nothing comes out of the bottle , this means that you forgot to flip open the top of the bottle … beginner ’s mistake .
Now rub both hands together and you ’re done !
To clear up some confusionâ€ ¦just because itâ€™s referred to as â€ œHandâ€ sanitizer doesnâ€™t mean it only goes on your hands .
Evidently , it rubs on everywhere and anywhere , leaving a refreshingly cool feeling .
Hand sanitizer has also made the news lately because teenagers and prisoners have been drinking the gel in order to get drunk or stoned .
I only have one thing to say to each of these groups .
To the teens : Rock On !
To the prisoners : Stick to pruno !
Some interesting facts concerning germs : 10 little tid-bits about bacteria
And nobody has ever really explained what this second Ryder truck was doing in a secret camp half way from Elohim City to Oklahoma City two weeks before the bombing .
So , here we are today .
Like the Romans of Crassus ' and Cicero 's time , or the Germans under a newly elected Hitler , we are being warned that a dangerous enemy threatens us , implacable , invisible , omnipresent , and invulnerable as long as our government is hamstrung by that silly old Bill of Rights .
Already the US has violated international law with the use of " extraordinary measures " ( i.e. torture ) justified by the manufactured hoaxes of ISIS and Al Qaeda .
As was the case in Rome and Germany , the government continues to plead with the public for an expansion of its power and authority , to " deal with the crisis " .
However , as Casio watch timers are paraded before the cameras , to the stentorian tones of the talking heads ' constant dire warnings , it is legitimate to question just how real the crises is , and how much is the result of political machinations by our own leaders .
Are the terrorists really a threat , or just patsies with fake bombs and Casio watches , paid for by Cicero and given brown shirts to wear by Hitler ?
Is terrorism inside the United States really from outside , or is it a stage managed production , designed to cause Americans to believe they have no choice but to surrender the Republic and accept the totalitarian rule of a new emperor , or a new Fuhrer ?
Indeed , given that acts of terror undermine the very public support needed by the so - called " terrorists " to bring about change , it may be argued that there are in fact no genuine acts of terror ; that they are all manufactured events to be blamed on the groups wishing to challenge the status quo .
Once lost , the Romans never got their Republic back .
Once lost , the Germans never got their Republic back .
In both cases , the nation had to totally collapse before freedom was restored to the people .
Remember that when Crassus tells you that Spartacus approaches .
Remember that when thugs in the streets act in a manner clearly designed to provoke the public fear .
Remember that when the Reichstag burns down .
Remember that when the President lies to you about weapons of mass destruction .
The Rachel Maddow Show :
Dear Senator Hatch -
You do n't call , you do n't write ...
I 've just about exhausted myself trying to get someone in your office to call me back this week .
Please apologize to your adorable receptionist on my behalf - the poor man now gets audibly exasperated as soon as I say " hello " .
What I 'd like to talk with you about is very simple : on NBC's Meet the Press this past Sunday , you said this about Carol Lam , the US Attorney for San Diego who was fired by the Justice Department in December :
" She was a former law professor , no prosecutorial experience , and the former campaign manager in Southern California for Clinton "
I checked the transcript against the video ( or click here for the specific clip ) and it's clear to me that you were n't misquoted .
Here 's my question for you or your staff : what in the Lord 's name are you talking about ?
Look what they have found in Chelyabinsk city .
The story is that there was a construction site with a deep foundation ditch .
They have touched some underground river in that place so the water in the ditch did n’t get away so it stayed there full of water .
Then some workers a few months later spotted some movement in this water , they threw some pieces of their lunch in the trench which caused a big activity inside .
They were puzzled who is there ?
And caught one thing up then in big panic stepped away cause it tried to bite them so they had to kill it with some equipment and here are the remains of it .
It was around 5 feet length .
Nobody of them got any idea of what ’s that :

From the San Francisco Chronicle :
Feinstein backs legal immunity for telecom firms in wiretap cases
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein said Thursday that she favors legal immunity for telecommunications companies that allegedly shared millions of customers ' telephone and e-mail messages and records with the government , a position that could lead to the dismissal of numerous lawsuits pending in San Francisco .
In a statement at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is considering legislation to extend the Bush administration 's electronic surveillance program , Feinstein said the companies should not be " held hostage to costly litigation in what is essentially a complaint about administration activities . "
She endorsed a recent statement by Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - W. Va. , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , that companies assured by top administration officials that the surveillance program was legal " should not be dragged through the courts for their help with national security . "
Feinstein , D - Calif. , plays a pivotal role on the Judiciary Committee , which has a 10 - 9 Democratic majority .
If she joins committee Republicans in voting next Thursday to protect telecommunications companies from lawsuits for their roles in the surveillance program , the proposal - a top priority of President Bush - will become part of legislation that reaches the Senate floor .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 — It might seem , after nearly seven years of deliberate detachment from Arab - Israeli peace negotiations , that President Bush has plunged into Middle Eastern diplomacy with Clintonesque energy .
He met with the Israel and Palestinian leaders at the White House on Monday and will do so again on Wednesday .
On Tuesday , he will meet them at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. , along with delegations from 46 countries and international organizations ( including , after an arm - twisting by phone last week , Saudi Arabia ) .
In fact , Mr. Bush and his aides still deplore what they view as President Clinton ’s disastrously hands - on involvement in the peace process in 2000 .
And they insist that Mr. Bush does not intend to negotiate personally the two - state peace he has pronounced as his vision , just as they insist that this is not an 11th - hour effort to forge a legacy other than the one left by the Iraq war .
“ The United States can not impose our vision , ” Mr. Bush told the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , in the Oval Office on Monday , before saying , and sounding , again , Clintonesque , “ but we can help facilitate . ”
Florida is working in special legislative session to cut property taxes as a way to stimulate consumer spending .
Nevada has called for a 5 percent cut in the budgets of all state agencies .
Michigan has expanded its sales tax to cover luxury services such as massages , manicures , and skiing , which were not taxed previously , and has increased the income - tax rate from 3.9 percent to 4.35 percent .
With at least a quarter of US states collecting less money than anticipated from sales taxes , and many others barely holding even with inflation in their overall revenues , state budgets appear to be headed for tough times , say several economists .
Closing the gap may require states to use creative measures , these same economists predict .
With a falling housing market , several experts see troubling economic warnings similar to those that preceded the US recession in 2001 .
This time , they say , states would probably be on shakier ground because they wo n't have the years of fat that the 1990s stock - market boom provided .
" Many of the indicators , from sales - tax receipts to national debt to purchase of US treasury bonds , are similar to the year 2000 , " says Philippa Dunne , a co-editor of The Liscio Report on the economy .
" But this time , states may have to take more drastic measures because they wo n't be coming out of a decade in which they had tons of money . "
Why housing market downturn is key sign
The receding housing boom is affecting nearly every state and is a key indicator , say Ms. Dunne and others , because it produces a domino effect , colliding with the consumer purchases that feed state treasuries via sales taxes .
On average , about one - third of state income comes from sales taxes on consumer items .
" When people are not buying homes , they are not buying appliances and furniture and other big - ticket items to go inside them , " says Robert Ward of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany , N.Y .
Also related to the diminishing sales - tax receipts is the dwindling equity in homes , exacerbated by the raft of foreclosures nationwide .
Nevada , Florida , California , Arizona , and Michigan have been hit the hardest by declines in the housing market according to the number of houses and condos bought and sold .
" People use the equity in their homes as a cash machine by taking out additional home - equity lines … and when that is gone or tapped out , it means smaller lending support for consumer spending for all goods , " says Mark McMullen , a senior economist in Portland , Ore. , for Economy.com .
" There is going to continue to be a headwind for consumer spending and job gains , both of which weaken the state tax base . "
Both stock market and state spending up
Others are more sanguine , noting two trends :
The stock market is doing well , and state spending in 2007 grew 8.6 percent over the previous year , two points above the 30 - year average .
" Many states say they are experiencing uncertainty and a heightened awareness over dropping revenues , but no one to date is ringing the bell to say we are in deep trouble , " says Arturo Perez , an economist with the National Conference of State Legislatures .
What most bears watching is the intangible factor of consumer confidence .
" Tax collections can change overnight with good news or bad , " he says .
" The extreme was 9/11 , but there are other things like unexpected jumps in unemployment claims , a drop in the stock market , a rise in oil prices , international instability , or a combination .
We have not yet seen a rise in unemployment or a decline in the stock market . "
Nevada loses big source of revenue
But states report that the general drop in consumer confidence nationwide is having an effect in their state .
Clark County , Nev. , for instance , has seen housing values drop as much as 20 percent , as reported by the Las Vegas Sun .
A falloff in out - of - state visitors to Nevada casinos has socked one of the state government 's biggest sources of income : gambling .
" People 's perceptions of their net worth have dropped , and they continue to be bombarded by media saying everything is headed south , which affects consumer confidence , " says Reese Tietje , chief planner of the Nevada Department of Administration .
Besides dwindling sales - tax receipts , Mr. Tietje reports that what Nevada 's government has collected from gambling operations was off 4.41 percent in August 2006 compared with August 2007 – nearly $ 50 million in just the month of August .
Nevada has announced a freeze for all state hires and is asking every state agency to reduce its budget by 5 percent .
Those include cuts of $ 50 million for the Department of Health and Human Services and $ 30 million by the state university system .
California signs deal to expand gambling
Part of Nevada 's reduced gambling income and tax receipts comes from changes next door in California , observers say .
When times get tough , many stop crossing the border to gamble in Las Vegas 's ritzy casinos , opting instead for smaller Indian casinos in their own area .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) recently signed a pact with Indian tribes that will expand gambling in the state in an effort to close a $ 6.1 billion budget deficit .
Such operations are expected to produce $ 9 billion in revenue for the state 's treasury over 20 years .
Besides scrambling to cut corners , states expect to tap into rainy - day funds , but they wo n't have the option of billions in tobacco - company settlements that helped to bail them out when things started getting tough in 2001 .
One - time fixes , however , will not be enough to bail out many states .
Michigan , for one , is struggling with a poor economy , resulting mostly from losing 300,000 auto industry jobs in the past seven years .
After failing to close a $ 1.7 billion gap by Oct. 1 , the state government partially shut down .
The legislature helped end the shutdown in the early morning by agreeing on two new measures : an expanded sales tax and a rise in income tax .
The taxes will cover only about $ 1.3 billion of the budget shortfall , says Leslee Fritz , spokeswoman for the Michigan State Budget Office .
17 University of Oregon students accused of file - sharing by the RIAA have received support from the university and the Oregon Attorney General 's office .
The university , represented by the state AG 's office , has asked a federal judge to quash the RIAA 's ex parte subpoena seeking the names of 17 Does flagged by the RIAA 's investigator , SafeNet .
All 17 of the IP addresses in question resolved to the University of Oregon , and , after pre-settlement litigation letters went undelivered , the record labels quickly filed a lawsuit in an attempt to obtain identifying information of those flagged by SafeNet .
The University has a number of objections to the RIAA 's subpoena .
First and foremost , it says it cannot identify 16 of the 17 students in question .
Dale Smith , director of network services for the university , testified in an affidavit that it would not be possible to finger the students in question without conducting interviews or doing forensic investigations .
Five of the 17 students in question accessed the P2P network from a double - occupancy dorm room , two of them from a single - occupancy room , and nine from the university 's wireless network .
For the dorm rooms , Smith says it 's impossible to determine if one of the students living there accessed the P2P network — or if it was a guest .
The Does using the wireless network all logged on with a username , but Smith testifies that he can't determine " whether the content was accessed by the individual assigned that user name or by someone else using the computer associated with the user name . "
The AG 's office has some severe criticism of the RIAA 's tactics in the memorandum supporting the motion to quash the subpoena .
Before the lawsuit was filed , deputy attorney general Randolph Geller spoke to RIAA counsel Katheryn Coggon and assured her that the school would preserve all the relevant data .
Despite that , the RIAA told the court that there was a " very real danger the ISP will not long preserve " the data it wanted .
The AG points out that the RIAA neglected to tell the court that the school had already guaranteed that the evidence would be kept as long as necessary .
The school also says that the subpoena would put an undue burden on it , given the amount of effort required to discern the identities of those flagged by SafeNet .
" In short , the subpoena requires the University to create discoverable material to assist Plaintiffs in their litigation rather than merely disclose existing documents , " argues the school , citing case law that indicates that non-parties " are not required to create documents that do not exist , simply for the purposes of discovery . "
As has happened in a couple of other cases , the university accuses the RIAA of using the wrong law as the basis for its subpoena .
The RIAA 's subpoena is " invalidated " by the DMCA , which the school argues should have been used by the record labels to discover the identities of the students in question .
It 's the same argument used successfully in a case involving students at the College of William and Mary in Virginia , where the judge quashed the RIAA 's subpoenas for exactly that reason .
There 's more , but the gist is the same : the school has no hope of identifying the students in question without engaging in some serious investigation of its own , it should n't be forced to do so , and the RIAA is using the wrong law as the basis for seeking the info in the first place .
We 've pointed out previously that the RIAA has traveled a bumpy road in its legal efforts to battle on - campus file sharing , and this case is shaping up to be even more arduous for the labels than other cases involving schools as ISPs .
As copyright attorney Ray Beckerman pointed out , this appears to the first time that a university has taken to heart the exhortations of former EFF staff attorney Wendy Stetzer to resist " copyright bullies , " and directly fought the RIAA 's subpoenas .
If the judge sides with the University of Oregon on this issue , the RIAA will face a long , uphill battle to get the information it needs to continue its efforts to unmask the 17 students in question .
Functional programming is increasing in popularity these days given the inherent problems with shared mutable state that is rife in the imperative world .
As we march on to a world of multi and many - core chipsets , software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it wo n't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore 's law .
Of course , learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward .
For example , most imperative programmers ( which include most of us who build software for a living ... ) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems .
Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way , often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is " the Way " .
Dr. Brian Beckman , a Channel 9 celebrity , astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way : a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9 .
This video interview is the result of Brian 's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation .
Of course , you can't just cover monads in a vacuum ( category theory is not really addressed here ) so the context is functional programming ( Brian covers functions and composable functional structures ( function chains ) and of course monoids and then monads ) .
Tune in .
There 's a lot to learn here and only Brian can make monads easy to understand for the rest of us !
Happy Thanksgiving to all the US Niners out there .
Enjoy .
It is extraordinary how President Bush has streamlined the Senate confirmation process .
As we have seen most recently with the vote to confirm Michael Mukasey as attorney general , about all that is left of “ advice and consent ” is the “ consent ” part .
Once upon a time , the confirmation of major presidential appointments played out on several levels — starting , of course , with politics .
It was assumed that a president would choose like - minded people as cabinet members and for other jobs requiring Senate approval .
There was a presumption that he should be allowed his choices , all other things being equal .
Before George W. Bush ’s presidency , those other things actually counted .
Was the nominee truly qualified , with a professional background worthy of the job ?
Would he discharge his duties fairly and honorably , upholding his oath to protect the Constitution ?
Even though she answers to the president , would the nominee represent all Americans ?
Would he or she respect the power of Congress to supervise the executive branch , and the power of the courts to enforce the rule of law ?
In less than seven years , Mr. Bush has managed to boil that list down to its least common denominator : the president should get his choices .
At first , Mr. Bush was abetted by a slavish Republican majority that balked at only one major appointment — Harriet Miers for Supreme Court justice , and then only because of doubts that she was far enough to the right .
Proofreading your text for misspelled words and grammatical mistakes is essential .
What about the punctuation , though ?
Despite being more subtle , these errors can equally hurt your credibility .
I ’m going to point out six common punctuation errors that you should n’t be making , and give you examples so you ’re sure about the right way to handle these situations .
Ready ?
Let ’s go .
1. Apostrophe for Plurals
This mistake is particularly common among foreigners who are learning English as a second language .
After all , you would expect native English speaks to know how to form plurals ( right ? ) .
The apostrophe is used to form contractions ( e.g. , It ’s time to go ) and to indicate possession ( e.g. , Mary ’s car is blue ) , but never to form plurals .
Wrong :
The boy ’s will go to the school tomorrow .
Right :
The boys will go to the school tomorrow .
2. The Comma Splice
When the comma is used to separate independent clauses , there must be a conjunction connecting them .
If the conjunction is not there , we have a comma splice .
You can fix this mistake by using a period instead of the comma , or by adding a coordinating conjunction .
Wrong :
The car costs $ 10000 , I am going to buy it .
Right .
The car costs $ 10000 .
I am going to buy it .
Right :
The car costs $ 10000 , and I am going to buy it .
3. Quotation Marks for Emphasis
Quotation marks are mainly used to quote speech , sentences or words .
They can also be used to denote irony .
They ca n’t be used , however , to add emphasis to a word or sentence .
It is not rare to find advertisements or promotional flyers carrying this error .
If you want to add emphasis to a word , use the boldface type and not the quotation marks .
Wrong :
This gift is “ free ” !
Right :
This gift is free !
4. Multiple Punctuation Marks
Unless you want to sound like an overly emotional teenager writing on MySpace , you should limit yourself to one exclamation point , regardless of how excited you might be when writing that sentence .
The same applies to question marks and to the ellipsis ( which should have only three dots ) .
Also , keep in mind that exclamation points are not used that frequently in business and formal writing .
If your text is loaded with them , you probably should review it .
Wrong :
This is amazing !!!!
Wrong :
The man was silent ……
Right :
This is amazing !
Right :
The man was silent …
5. Punctuation Outside the Quotation Marks
If you are writing in American English , other punctuation should go inside the quotation marks , even if it is not part of the quotation itself .
British English , on the other hand , places punctuation that is not part of the quoted sentence outside of the quotation marks .
Wrong in American English : Uncle John said , “ My car is blue ” .
Right in American English : Uncle John said , “ My car is blue . ”
6. The Missing Comma After Introductory Elements
Sometimes you want to give an introduction or provide a background to a certain sentence .
That is fine , but do not forget to place a comma after that introductory element .
Notice that an introductory element can be a sentence ( like in the example below ) or a single word ( e.g. , however , moreover and so on ) .
Wrong : Before going to the school Joe stopped at my house .
Right : Before going to the school , Joe stopped at my house .
What other punctuation mishaps do you make , or what drives you crazy when others fracture the rules ?

Judge gives go - ahead to lawsuit against Bush 's bank transfer spying program Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday June 19 , 2007 Print This Email
This A federal judge in Chicago last week rejected a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed against a Belgium - based bank transfer clearinghouse that collaborated with an anti-terrorism spying program led by the US Department of Treasury .
The judge 's decision will allow two plaintiffs to press their case that the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) violated the Fourth Amendment and financial privacy rights of bank customers throughout the United States when it collaborated with president George W. Bush 's so - called ' Terrorist Finance Tracking Program . '
" I do n't think any corporate entity should be given a blank check to spy on Americans whether it's their telephone conversations or their financial transactions , " said Steven Schwarz , the lead attorney for the case 's two plaintiffs , in a Tuesday morning phone call with RAW STORY .
" Maybe that 's how they do it in other countries , but we have one set of rules , and nobody gets carte blanche to shred the Constitution . "
SWIFT facilitates $ 6 trillion a day in financial transactions among thousands of banks in hundreds of countries .
In June 26 , 2006 , articles in the New York Times , Los Angeles Times , and Wall Street Journal , SWIFT was revealed by the media to have turned over considerable information its database to the US Department of Treasury .
Schwarz alleged that the government initially had filed a more limited subpoena for information .
( Note : Counterterrorism expert Victor Comras wrote just after the revelation that the US government 's monitoring of SWIFT transactions first was noted in 2002 in United Nations publications . )
Schwarz explained to RAW STORY why the action undertaken by SWIFT in assisting the government 's program allowed an alarming fishing expedition to take place .
" You can think of SWIFT as gatekeeper , like if they have the keys to a warehouse , " he said .
" The government wants to get in and take a lot of specific items in there .
SWIFT says ' Sorry , it 's too hard to show you around , and give you this or that , why do n't you just take a look around and take whatever you want . ' "
James F. Holderman , the Chief Judge in the Federal Court for the Northern District of Illinois , agreed with Schwarz 's argument that SWIFT appeared to have carried out an overbroad surrender of information to the US government .
" Unfettered government access to the bank records of private citizens [ is ] constitutionally problematic , " the judge wrote in his decision , in which he allowed two of the four complaints to continue to be considered .
The banking cooperative defended itself in a statement released to Bloomberg News last week .
" SWIFT complies with lawful obligations in the countries where it operates and will vigorously defend itself against the plaintiffs ' remaining allegations , " said a spokesman in the article written by Andrew Harris .
Another attorney working on the case , Carl Mayer , warned that the banking consortium has great deal at stake in the case .
" SWIFT faces billions in damages after this weeks ruling , " he said in a statement released to the press by the plaintiffs .
" Federal bank privacy laws provide for $ 100 in damages for each illegal disclosure of customer records . "
While agreeing that the government 's financial spying program was most alarming to large , offshore institutional investors , Schwarz argued that his plaintiffs were not billionaires and all Americans should be worried about the financial privacy implications of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program .
" Our plaintiffs are average Americans with checking accounts and credit cards , " he said of Ian Walker and Stephen Kruse , who were named in the suit .
" We 're alleging that basic routine transactions were vacuumed up in a big data mining program .
Some people may be fine with it because they think it may help catch a terrorist , but I think just as many people are uncomfortable with having their records sifted through in that manner . "
Judge Holderman approved a ' change of venue ' request by SWIFT to move the case to the federal district court in Virginia .
If Schwarz 's case holds up in the new district court , which is known for being more conservative and pro-government in its orientation , he said he 'll begin his discovery process about three months from now .

Last Sunday , I wrote a post in response to a reader who had commented negatively on my assertion that most Americans felt Dick Cheney should be impeached .
Claiming that I had ' lost all credibility ' on the subject , and that Democrats were all ' socialists and closet communists ' that want to create a ' Stalinist type regime ' , the reader also made the bold claim that the United States was founded on ' Christian principles ' .
It appears I was not the only one who took exception to the readers comments , and other readers of The Daily Banter promptly joined in the argument .

Here 's an interesting comment from Buckler , who quotes one of the founding fathers , Thomas Jefferson :
" As for America being founded on Christian principles , perhaps we should look at a few quotes from Thomas Jefferson , arguably one of the greatest of our Founding Fathers .
These are just a few , extracted from a collection of many , many more :
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others .
But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods , or no god .
It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg .
-- Thomas Jefferson , Notes on the State of Virginia , 1781 - 82 ( capitalization of the word god is retained per original ; see Positive Atheism 's Historical Section )

The ' Wall of Separation , ' Again :
Because religious belief , or non-belief , is such an important part of
every person 's life , freedom of religion affects every individual .
State churches that use government power to support themselves and
force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil
rights .
Moreover , state support of the church tends to make the clergy
unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion .
Erecting the " wall of separation between church and state , " therefore ,
is absolutely essential in a free society .
We have solved ... the great and interesting question whether
freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and
obedience to the laws .
And we have experienced the quiet as well as the
comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and
openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own
reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries .
-- Thomas Jefferson , to the Virginia Baptists ( 1808 ) .
This is his
second use of the term " wall of separation , " here quoting his own use
in the Danbury Baptist letter .
This wording was several times upheld by
the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment
Clause : Reynolds ( 98 US at 164 , 1879 ) ; Everson ( 330 US at 59 , 1947 ) ;

My essay on the transformational potential of Barack Obama 's candidacy is now online :
Strictly speaking , Obama is at the tail end of the Boomer generation .
But he is not of it .
“ Partly because my mother , you know , was smack - dab in the middle of the Baby Boom generation , ” he told me .
“ She was only 18 when she had me .
So when I think of Baby Boomers , I think of my mother ’s generation .
And you know , I was too young for the formative period of the ’ 60 scivil rights , sexual revolution , Vietnam War .
Those all sort of passed me by . ”
Obama ’s mother was , in fact , born only five years earlier than Hillary Clinton .
He did not politically come of age during the Vietnam era , and he is simply less afraid of the right wing than Clinton is , because he has emerged on the national stage during a period of conservative decadence and decline .
And so , for example , he felt much freer than Clinton to say he was prepared to meet and hold talks with hostile world leaders in his first year in office .
He has proposed sweeping middle - class tax cuts and opposed drastic reforms of Social Security , without being tarred as a fiscally reckless liberal .
( Of course , such accusations are hard to make after the fiscal performance of today ’s “ conservatives . ” )
Even his more conservative positionslike his openness to bombing Pakistan , or his support for merit pay for public - school teachersdo not appear to emerge from a desire or need to credentialize himself with the right .
He is among the first Democrats in a generation not to be afraid or ashamed of what they actually believe , which also gives them more freedom to move pragmatically to the right , if necessary .
He does not smell , as Clinton does , of political fear .

Hey , Joe --- how 's that helmet and flak vest working out for you ?
The night before , 30 other soldiers crowded around him with questions for the senator .
He wrote them all down .
At the top of his note card was the question he got from nearly every one of his fellow soldiers : " When are we going to get out of here ? "
The rest was a laundry list .
When would they have upgraded Humvees that could withstand the armor- penetrating weapons that U.S. officials claim are from Iran ?
When could they have body armor that was better in hot weather ?---
Then Lieberman walked in , wearing a pair of sunglasses newly purchased from an Iraqi market that the military had taken him to in southeast Baghdad .
He 'd been equipped with a helmet and flak vest when he toured the market , which he described as bustling .
It was unclear if they ever asked their questions .
" It 's like everything else in this war , " Adams said , referring to Baghdad .
" It has n't changed . " ... read on ( h/t Id )
The latest blame China bill , unveiled last week in the Senate , is not as bad as earlier proposals .
Gone are the ham - fisted tariffs that lawmakers once threatened to impose if China did not raise the value of its currency , the yuan .
In their place is a more gradual process for inflicting economic and political pain unless Beijing moves faster to lift the yuan .
But the new approach , while tamer , is still a dangerous game .
The senators behind the bill  Democrats Max Baucus and Charles Schumer and Republicans Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham  bristle at being labeled protectionists , in part because they generally agree that free trade is superior to trade constraints .
But they also clearly believe in threatening protectionism to get their way .
Threats can backfire .
They also obscure workable solutions to today ’s global imbalances .
Even if China were to give in , there is no guarantee that a stronger yuan would be a big plus for the United States ’ economy .
Theoretically , it would make American exports more competitive .
But it could also ignite inflation in the United States , as consumer prices on imported goods rise .
With interest rates up sharply in the past month , inflation is the last thing lawmakers should be toying with now .
There ’s also no telling how China would react to mounting protectionism .
Weak Asian demand at a recent auction of Treasury debt is one of the reasons behind the latest increase in American interest rates .
Rates could rise even more if China retaliated against pressure from the United States by further curtailing its demand for dollar - based assets .

Facebook MOSCOW ( AP ) 
The Russian military has successfully tested what it described as the world 's most powerful non-nuclear air - delivered bomb , Russia 's state television reported Tuesday , the latest show of the nation 's military muscle amid chilly relations with the United States .
It was the latest show of Russia 's military muscle amid chilly relations with the United States .
Channel
One television said the new weapon , nicknamed the " dad of all bombs " is four times more powerful than the U.S. " mother of all bombs . "
" The tests have shown that the new air - delivered ordnance is comparable to a nuclear weapon in its efficiency and capability , " said Col. - Gen . Alexander Rukshin , a deputy chief of the Russian military 's General Staff , said in televised remarks .
Unlike a nuclear weapon , the bomb does n't hurt the environment , he added .
The statement reflected the Kremlin 's efforts to restore Russia 's global clout and rebuild the nation 's military might while the ties with Washington have been strained over U.S. criticism of Russia 's backsliding on democracy , Moscow 's vociferous protests of U.S. missile defense plans , and rifts over global crises .
The U.S. Massive Ordnance Air Blast , nicknamed the Mother Of All Bombs , is a large - yield satellite - guided , air - delivered bomb described as the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in history .
Channel
One said that while the Russian bomb contains 7.8 tons of high explosives compared to more than 8 tons of explosives in the U.S. bomb , it 's four times more powerful because it uses a new , highly efficient type of explosives that the report did n't identify .
While the U.S. bomb is equivalent to 11 tons of TNT , the Russian one is equivalent to 44 tons of regular explosives .
The Russian weapon 's blast radius is 990 feet , twice as big as that of the U.S. design , the report said .
Like its U.S. predecessor , first tested in 2003 , the Russian bomb is a " thermobaric " weapon that explodes in an intense fireball combined with a devastating blast .
It explodes in a terrifying nuclear bomb - like mushroom cloud and wreaks destruction through a massive shock wave created by the air burst and high temperature .
Thermobaric weapons work on the same principle that causes blasts in grain elevators and other dusty places — clouds of fine particles are highly explosive .
Such explosions produce shock waves that can be directed and amplified in enclosed spaces such as buildings , caves or tunnels .
Channel
One said that the temperature in the epicenter of the Russian bomb 's explosion is twice as high as that of the U.S. bomb .
The report showed the bomb dropped by parachute from a Tu -160 strategic bomber and exploding in a massive fireball .
It featured the debris of apartment buildings and armored vehicles at a test range , as well as the scorched ground from a massive blast .
It did n't give the bomb 's military name or say when it was tested .
Rukshin said the new bomb would allow the military to " protect the nation 's security and confront international terrorism in any situation and any region . "
" We have got a relatively cheap ordnance with a high strike power , " Yuri Balyko , head of the Defense Ministry 's institute in charge of weapons design , told Channel One .
Booming oil prices have allowed Russia to steadily increase military spending in recent years , and the Kremlin has taken a more assertive posture in global affairs .
Last month , President Vladimir Putin said he ordered the resumption of regular patrols of strategic bombers , which were suspended after the 1991 Soviet breakup .

Come enjoy the refreshing undersea dystopia of BioShock , a highly anticipated game for Xbox 360 and Windows .
From the moment you arrive , you 're plunged headfirst into an objectivist social experiment .
Banners proclaim ALTRUISM IS THE SOURCE OF ALL EVIL , and perky advertisements preach the wonders of genetic modification .
The architecture is all Albert Speer does art deco ( A ) , but the world , called Rapture , is beginning to crumble and let in water .
You 're soon beset by deranged flappers and dandies , like Jay Gatsby 's party guests gone feral ( B ) .
And , as in any first - person shooter , you reach for your gun ...
Or do you ?
It 's just the kind of ethical question that bubbles up from the depths of this game .
" We 're living in a very gray age , " says Ken Levine , cofounder of Irrational Games and lead designer on BioShock .
" When I play an ultra-patriotic game , I 'm not comfortable unquestioningly accepting what authorities say . "
Players are bombarded with radio messages from Rapture 's rival warlords , all offering conflicting advice .
Will doing what they say help your cause or merely advance their own agendas ?

The Sisters are hollow - eyed creatures who search out corpses as a source of genetic material - the coin of this twisted realm .
The Daddies , lumbering monsters in diving suits , are their vigilant protectors .
Defeat a Daddy and you can set the little girl free — or steal her genetic bounty and use it to enhance yourself , killing her but prolonging your own life .
Which would you choose ?

BETHEL , Alaska , July 21 ( AP ) —
You will not find a luxury hotel or concert hall here in Bethel .
But this remote Alaska town has at least one advantage over New York :
It may be the nation ’s taxicab capital .
Situated on the tundra about 400 miles west of Anchorage , Bethel has 70 taxis for a population of just 5,900 .
That is one cab for every 84 people .
That is more even than New York , the ultimate cab city , where there is one hired vehicle like a taxi , commuter van or livery car for every 149 people .
“ It ’s most likely by far the highest ratio of taxis per residents in the United States , ” said Alfred LaGasse of the Taxicab , Limousine & Paratransit Association .
Priest and Hull begin their article by making the issue personal , connecting it with one person :
Army Spec. Jeans Cruz helped capture Saddam Hussein .
When he came home to the Bronx , important people called him a war hero and promised to help him start a new life .
The mayor of New York , officials of his parents ' home town in Puerto Rico , the borough president and other local dignitaries honored him with plaques and silk parade sashes .
They handed him their business cards and urged him to phone .
But a " black shadow " had followed Cruz home from Iraq , he confided to an Army counselor .
He was hounded by recurring images of how war really was for him : not the triumphant scene of Hussein in handcuffs , but visions of dead Iraqi children .
Yet even though Cruz had the support of the psychologist who examined him , who
wrote that Cruz was " in need of major help " and that he had provided " more than enough evidence " to back up his PTSD claim .
His combat experiences , the letter said , " have been well documented . "
his claim was denied by the VA on grounds that he had psychological problems before he entered the service and that he had not proved he was ever in combat , despite his service as a scout and a commendation medal with valor - a designation that can only be awarded under combat conditions .
He is offered only group therapy , with session not available on weekends or late enough for him to be able to keep his job and still attend .
The foregoing is but a brief look at the detail Priest and Hull use to set the scene .
They then lay out the problem clearly in two brief paragraphs :
Jeans Cruz and his contemporaries in the military were never supposed to suffer in the shadows the way veterans of the last long , controversial war did .
One of the bitter legacies of Vietnam was the inadequate treatment of troops when they came back .
Tens of thousands endured psychological disorders in silence , and too many ended up homeless , alcoholic , drug - addicted , imprisoned or dead before the government acknowledged their conditions and in 1980 officially recognized PTSD as a medical diagnosis .
Yet nearly three decades later , the government still has not mastered the basics : how best to detect the disorder , the most effective ways to treat it , and the fairest means of compensating young men and women who served their country and returned unable to lead normal lives .
Here I note that I served on active duty at the beginning of the Vietnam buildup , in 1965 - and 1966 .
While I served only stateside I encountered those who had been in combat , and there were those who were suffering from what we now call PTSD .
It is an issue for which those in the Vietnam era did NOT get the proper attention or service .
Priest and Hull illustrate this with several paragraphs on one vet from that era , which I will quote in full to establish the problem :
Former Lance Cpl. Jim Roberts 's underlying mental condition was overlooked by the Marine Corps and successive health - care professionals for more than 30 years , as his temper and alcohol use plunged him into deeper trouble .
Only in May 2005 did VA begin treating the Vietnam vet for PTSD .
Three out of 10 of his compatriots from Vietnam have received diagnoses of PTSD .
Half of those have been arrested at least once .
Veterans groups say thousands have killed themselves .
To control his emotions now , Roberts attends group therapy once a week and swallows a handful of pills from his VA doctors : Zoloft , Neurontin , Lisinopril , Seroquel , Ambien , hydroxyzine , " enough medicine to kill a mule , " he said .
Roberts desperately wants to persuade Iraq veterans not to take the route he traveled .
" The Iraq guys , it 's going to take them five to 10 years to become one of us , " he said , seated at his kitchen table in Yonkers with his vet friends Nicky , Lenny , Frenchie , Ray and John nodding in agreement .
" It 's all about the forgotten vets , then and now .
The guys from Iraq and Afghanistan , we need to get these guys in here with us . "
" In here " can mean different things .
It can mean a 1960s - style vet center such as the one where Roberts hangs out , with faded photographs of Huey helicopters and paintings of soldiers skulking through shoulder - high elephant grass .
It can mean group therapy at a VA outpatient clinic during work hours , or more comprehensive treatment at a residential clinic .
In a crisis , it can mean the locked - down psych ward at the local VA hospital .
" Out there , " with no care at all , is a lonesome hell .
How serious is the problem we are confronting now ?
By this spring , the number of vets from Afghanistan and Iraq who had sought help for post - traumatic stress would fill four Army divisions , some 45,000 in all .
But that is the tip of the iceberg .
They represent the first wave in what experts say is a coming deluge .
As many as one - quarter of all soldiers and Marines returning from Iraq are psychologically wounded , according to a recent American Psychological Association report .
Twenty percent of the soldiers in Iraq screened positive for anxiety , depression and acute stress , an Army study found .
And to what do they return ?
It is almost impossible to describe quickly all that Priest and Hull present .
There are an insufficient number of mental health professionals on active duty ( the number of active duty licensed psychologists has dropped from 450 to 350 with many unable to handle the stress of the patients they are seeing ) , and many counselors are improperly trained to deal with the problems they are encountering .
In one case they write about a doctor whose specialty is aerospace medicine who basically thinks PTSD is over - diagnosed and thus opposed recognizing its existence in the personnel for whom he was responsible .
When the military personnel are discharged and enter the VA system , they are enter what can only be described as a netherworld - a bureaucracy that
chronically loses records and sags with a backlog of 400,000 claims of all kinds
and whose methods for determining the existence of PTSD
had little basis in science
and were applied inconsistently at best .
The authors were , of course , responsible for exposing what was happening at Walter Reed .
A report commissioned in the wake of that outpatient scandal found
" There is not a coordinated effort to provide the training required to identify and treat these non-visible injuries , nor adequate research in order to develop the required training and refine the treatment plans . "
and the acting surgeon general of the Army wants to double the number of mental health professionals and increase their pay in order to address the problem .
But the problem is not yet fully developed .
For one thing , there is a reluctance , particularly on the part of the officer corps , to avoid the stigma of seeking mental health assistance .
The authors lay this out in a very blunt fashion :
Only 40 percent of the troops who screened positive for serious emotional problems sought help , a recent Army survey found .
Nearly 60 percent of soldiers said they would not seek help for mental - health problems because they felt their unit leaders would treat them differently ; 55 percent thought they would be seen as weak , and the same percentage believed that soldiers in their units would have less confidence in them .
Lt. Gen. John Vines , who led the 18th Airborne Corps in Iraq and Afghanistan , said countless officers keep quiet out of fear of being mislabeled .
" All of us who were in command of soldiers killed or wounded in combat have emotional scars from it , " said Vines , who recently retired .
" No one I know has sought out care from mental - health specialists , and part of that is a lack of confidence that the system would recognize it as ' normal ' in a time of war .
This is a systemic problem . "
Officers and senior enlisted troops , Vines added , were concerned that they would have trouble getting security clearances if they sought psychological help .
They did not trust , he said , that " a faceless , nameless agency or process , that does n't know them personally , wo n't penalize them for a perceived lack of mental or emotional toughness . "
Priest and Cruz not only introduce their subject by focusing on one soldier , Cruz .
They return to him to illustrate in detail the nature of the problem .
Despite having had problems he was allowed to reenlist and given a bonus , then later
Seven months after his reenlistment ceremony , the Army gave him an honorable discharge , asserting that he had a " personality disorder " that made him unfit for military service .
This determination implied that all his psychological problems existed before his first enlistment .
It also disqualified him from receiving combat - related disability pay .
There was little attempt to tie his condition to his experience in Iraq .
Nor did the Army see an obvious contradiction in its handling of him :
He was encouraged to reenlist even though his psychological problems had already been documented .
I will not quote further .
It is an article for which you should make the time .
And I cannot offer the kind of insight on this problem that our own Ilona Meagher has given us .
But I am a citizen .
I am a former serviceman .
First and foremost , I am a human being .
We cannot ask others to suffer like this on behalf of supposed national goals and not be willing to fully care for them .
We should have learned this lesson from Vietnam , and apparently we have not .
Perhaps it is a function of how little of our civilian leadership actually served in the military .
Perhaps it is that there are so few now on active duty who themselves served in that conflict , which after all ended more than 3 decades ago , although the senior leadership - both enlisted and officers - would have served with many who had been in country , and who should have been able to understand the cost paid by those who served .
And in our discussions about what the war is costing us we must insist on properly accounting for the price being paid by those who serve .
Here I do not merely mean that sufficient funds for medical and psychological care , sufficient trained personnel .
If we cannot properly staff military activities without sending back those who have already suffered psychological damage , then we cannot continue our armed occupation .
If it is against international law to subject those who are captured to inhumane treatment or to deny them appropriate medical attention , surely it must be wrong ( even if not specifically illegal , which it well may be ) to send into combat situations those with severe medical problems .
I use the term medical advisedly - PTSD is a recognized condition .
And those who would deny our military the proper diagnosis and treatment and / or who send them back armed into a hostile situation may well be guilty of crimes against humanity on two counts .
First , their mistreatment of our military , which unfortunately might be the only thing that some would acknowledge .
But also , under the doctrine of command responsibility they then become responsible for any wrongdoing by those troops , wrongdoing for which in reality the psychologically damaged troops should not themselves be held responsible .
Consider the number who have served , and what they have encountered .
Recognize that sometimes the symptoms do not fully appear for months after leaving the theater .
Remember that we have been sending units back with less than one year out of Iraq , and with their personnel not being fully screened and even if screened properly treated .
We are exacerbating whatever problems already exist .
I entitled this " the coming deluge . "
We may see an exponential expansion of the number of people who develop PTSD .
Were we to treat them all properly the cost will become very expensive , although we cannot morally deny treatment on the basis of cost .
We should not be seeking to reject such claims , but rather , given the reluctance of many to seek treatment , we should be actively reaching out and screening to ensure that we are not missing those suffering its effects .
The long - term impact of those not properly treated is potential a much greater problem than the cost of treating them .
That is the real deluge .
And it is also how we may have already broken much of the Army and the Marine Corps .
We have allowed far too many to suffer the insults and injuries associated with PTSD without properly addressing what has happened to them .
That makes them less effective as military personnel , more likely to violate standards of conduct , for less productive in civilian life after discharge , . . . you get the picture .
I hope you will all read the article .
I hope you will ensure that your members and senators read the article .
I hope and pray that this article will have a similar impact as did the earlier article by Priest and Hull on Walter Reed .
But all of that is insufficient .
If this is the price we as a society are paying , it is too high .
Add this on top of the 3,500 + deaths , the 20,000 + permanent physical injuries , the destruction of Iraqi lives and property , the loss of respect around the world for this nation .
When will it be enough ?
And when will our members and senators acknowledge that what we are doing is so morally wrong on so many counts ?
Let us not abandon those who have already suffered because of the dishonesty and corruption of the leadership of this administration .
Let us fulfill our responsibility to care for those who went in harm 's way ostensibly on our behalf .
And unless we want to face a deluge hard to comprehend , let us move NOW to stop the continuing madness that only worsens this problem .
Peace .
Stock Market Technical Analysis Versus Fundamental Analysis , In Pictures
People get involved in the stock market with the best of intentions : they do it to make their money start working harder for them .
When I first started dabbling in equities right out of school , I really did n’t know much .
I remember how at my first job , I received some brochures about my first 401K and an ESPP plan , but I had no idea what I was doing .
Over time , I ’ve educated myself about the stock market by studying investment videos , using stock analysis tools and subscribing to stock market educational services such as Morningstar and INO Market Club .
These materials along with more conventional investment resources such as books , periodicals and newsletters have helped me to gain a solid understanding of my investments and the markets .
Over the years , I ’ve finally learned about a couple of different ways to make money through the markets .
Here is a review of those methods .
From the Wikipedia :
Technical Analysis
This manner of playing the market assumes that non-random price patterns and trends exist in markets , and that these patterns can be identified and exploited .
While many different methods and tools are used , the study of charts of past price and trading action is primary .
It maintains that all information is reflected already in the stock price , so fundamental analysis is a waste of time .
Trends “ are your friend ” and sentiment changes predate and predict trend changes .
Investors ’ emotional responses to price movements lead to recognizable price chart patterns .
Technical analysis does not care what the “ value ” of a stock is .
Their price predictions are only extrapolations from historical price patterns .
Fundamental Analysis
This type of analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health , its management and competitive advantages , and its competitors and markets .
The analysis is performed on historical and present data , but with the goal to make financial projections .
There are several possible objectives : to calculate a company ’s credit risk ,
to make projection on its business performance ,
to evaluate its management and make internal business decisions ,
to make the company ’s stock valuation and predict its probable price evolution .
Prediction of how the stock will move , normally for the longer term , is based on the company ’s fundamentals and valuation .
For fun , I thought to share my impressions of these different financial schools of thought .
You can certainly make money using techniques rooted in any one or even both of these paradigms , but take note that patience , experience and in some cases , skill , play a large part in your success when participating in the markets .
So I ’ve made some comparisons of these strategies that people employ when playing the stock market .
On the left hand column are images that to me , appear to closely reflect technical analysis ; while the right hand column invokes images that reference fundamental analysis .
Of course , these are just my casual notions about these two divergent investing methodologies .
These differences are n’t meant to be mutually exclusive nor comprehensive .
But feel free to pick them apart .
Technical Analysis Fundamental Analysis
Stock Market Volatility is your friend Versus The Power of Compounding is your friend
Day Trading Versus Longer term investing with mutual fund managers like Peter Lynch or John Bogle
Make money out of movement from the market , with each movement often measured in pennies Versus Make money out of your stake in companies and how their products or services sell
How investors see traders Versus How traders see investors
This may yield a get rich quickly scheme , when you work on your own terms , using rapid reflexes and lightning fingers , but when you can go broke just as quickly if you do n’t know what you ’re doing .
Market timing rules your methods .
Versus
This is the path taken to grow rich more slowly , relatively speaking , but depending on how your portfolio is set up , it can actually be quicker than you think .
It often involves buy and hold and longer term investing strategies .
-ooOoo -
I hope you enjoyed our little lesson on the various ways to analyze the market .
What ’s important is that you know yourself well enough to figure out what you ’re comfortable with .
I do n’t believe that there are any wrong investment approaches in the absolute sense , just dangerous ones .
A strategy becomes dangerous if you decide to apply it without sufficient planning , knowledge or study , causing you to make reckless moves or generate heavy losses .
So the key is to go with what works for you , realizing your limitations while capitalizing on your strengths .
As for us , we ’ve always been fundamental investors and after hearing the stories of our day trader friends , we ’re convinced we ’re doing the right thing for ourselves .

Recently I ’ve been dealing with the issue of time scarcity .
Between this site , my regular job , preparations for the CFA exam , and other projects , things get busier every day .
I would n’t have it any other way , but in order to fit everything in , I ’ve been searching for new ways to use time more efficiently .
Through reading books and articles , I ’ve found a dozens of time management tips .
Some have been more useful than others , but as I continue to think about it , I ’ve realize that it comes down to one essential concept .
If you can master this one time management tip , then all the others become trivial .
There is nothing secret or revolutionary here .
It ’s a basic economic principle that I ’m betting you already know .
In fact , it ’s so simple that it ’s tempting to ignore in favor of flashier alternatives .
Ready to hear it already ?
The ultimate time management tips is :
Cut off activities at the point of diminishing returns .
Simple is n’t it ?
Problems with time management arise , not from the activities we choose , but from the amount of time we allocate to each activity .
The activities that are essential to productivity are the same ones that leach away valuable time .
Consider the example of email .
The first 15 minutes you spend reading and responding to email each day is by far the most productive .
This is when you have a ton of incoming mail to process .
You ’re focused on getting through it all as quickly as possible by identifying the relevant parts of each message and sending quick replies .
But this level of efficiency is n’t sustainable .
The longer you stay in that inbox , the lower the marginal returns on your time .
After 15 minutes you might not have any important messages left , so you start spending more time on group email lists or casual conversations with friends .
After half an hour , email has become a complete waste of time because you have nothing to do besides click “ refresh ” every 30 seconds .
Break down the productivity of any activity and you ’ll find a similar distribution .
The beginning brings in the big results until the peak is reached , followed by a sharp decline .
The trick is cutting off each activity right after the peak and switching to something new , where high levels of efficiency are possible .
This easier said than done .
It ’s hard to spot the peak when you reach it , and moving seamlessly from one task to the next is a major obstacle .
To improve your time management , focus primarily on two areas : experience and self discipline .
Experience
To apply the law of diminishing returns , you need to determine the point when returns start to decline .
This depends on many factors .
The only way to figure it out is through experience .
This does n’t come automatically .
To find the “ sweet spot ” you ’ll need to pay careful attention to your own work habits .
How long can you stay productive ?
What activities do you like to drag out ?
Where can you salvage time ?
By constantly asking yourself these questions , adjusting your behavior , and evaluating the results , you ’ll be able to gradually optimize your work habits .
Self Discipline
The second cornerstone of time management is self discipline .
You might be able to spot the perfect time to change activities , but if you do n’t have the self discipline to make the move it does n’t matter .
Developing self discipline takes time and practice .
The best way to improve is to impose time limits on yourself , then record and schedule them .
If you only make a mental note , it ’s easy to forget or ignore , but when you deliberately set alerts to remind yourself to change activities you solidify your commitment and make yourself accountable .
Speaker 's office denies ' 10,000 letters ' impeachment rumor Jason Rhyne

The office of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) on Thursday denied an internet rumor suggesting that Rep. Pelosi would pursue an impeachment measure against Vice President Dick Cheney should she receive 10,000 handwritten letters in favor of the measure .
Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly called the notion " absolutely not true " in an email sent to RAW STORY .
The rumor appears to have stemmed from a Sunday blog post at Thinking Out Loud , which claimed to have received a tip that Pelosi would reconsider moving forward with a recent impeachment resolution against Cheney brought by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) -- but only if she received enough handwritten letters demanding it .
" The following alert was in my e-mail this morning from Emily West , " stated the blog post .
" I havent verified the information , but decided its a good idea no matter what . "
That message was as follows : " Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is reported to have replied to the question of impeachment that if she received 10,000 hand - written letters she would proceed with it .
What are we waiting for ?
Letters should go to her San Francisco office . "
The blog said West was a " strong supporter of Dennis Kucinich . "
The rumor has quickly taken hold at other blogs and websites , including the popular Democratic Underground .
" Today ' there s rumors on the Internets ' ... that Pelosi will reconsider her no-impeachment stance  IF  she receives 10,000 HAND WRITTEN letters supporting the impeachment of Dick Cheney , " read one DU post on Tuesday .
" So , if you really want to see Congress  especially the Democrats  start acting like the co-equal branch of Government that they were intended to be  PLEASE write to Pelosi today . "
" It 's obvious patent nonsense , " pro-impeachment activist David Swanson told RAW STORY .
" It 's a sort - of rumor that 's taken various forms for the past year and a half . "
Swanson's own website , AfterDowningStreet.org , carries a reference to the Pelosi rumor , although he says he did n't author that particular entry and did n't realize it had been included in the post .
Although untrue , Swanson adds that the hearsay was still beneficial to the cause of those advocating for the impeachment of Cheney .
" It 's one of these false rumors that 's actually very helpful , " he added .
" There 's a burst of people sending [ letters ] and that 's good . "
Kucinich introduced a privileged resolution seeking the impeachment of Cheney to the House floor last week .
Following a failed attempt by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) to effectively kill the measure , the resolution was subsequently forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee .
PARIS , Nov. 22 — European Union environmental officials have determined that two kinds of genetically modified corn could harm butterflies , affect food chains and disturb life in rivers and streams , and they have proposed a ban on the sale of the seeds , which are made by DuPont Pioneer , Dow Agrosciences and Syngenta .
The preliminary decisions are circulating within the European Commission , which has the final say .
Some officials there are skeptical of a ban that would upset the powerful biotechnology industry and could exacerbate tensions with important trading partners like the United States .
The seeds are not available on the European market for cultivation .
In the decisions , the environment commissioner , Stavros Dimas , contends that the genetically modified corn , or maize could affect certain butterfly species , specifically the monarch , and other beneficial insects .
For instance , research this year indicates that larvae of the monarch butterfly exposed to the genetically modified corn “ behave differently than other larvae . ”
In the decision concerning the corn seeds produced by Dow and Pioneer , Mr. Dimas calls “ potential damage on the environment irreversible . ”
In the decision on Syngenta ’s corn , he says that “ the level of risk generated by the cultivation of this product for the environment is unacceptable . ”
From this day forward , EVERY person running against Rudy Giuliani can point out how most people at Yankee Stadium resoundedly booed Rudy Giuliani .
If you are Joe Six Pack or Jane Housewife going about your daily life in Missouri , you are smart enough to realize that if the people at Yankee Stadium are booing Rudy Giuliani , they must know something that the media is n't telling you .
After 3 more seconds of thought , Joe Six Pack and Jane Housewife make the connection that Rudy Giuliani is not a 9/11 Hero but that he did some awful things regarding 9/11 .
And even if Joe Six Pack or Jane Housewife agree with Rudy Giuliani 95 % of the time , Giuliani just lost their vote , even if he attains the general nomination and faces Hillary Clinton .
The people of New York City booed Rudy Giuliani because they know what a scumbag he truly is .
Giuliani could n't get elected dogcatcher in New York City today unless the only other candidate running was named Michael Vick .
The people of New York City know about Giuliani 's command center , the defective firefighter radio equipment , Bernard third grade detective Kerik , his phony crime statistics , his lousy education policies , his tax increases on the middle class combined with tax cuts and welfare for the top 1 % , Thomas Von Essen , Judy Nathan , his defense of Abner Louima 's torturers , his attempt to close down a museum over one painting , his mistreatment of Donna Hanover and their two children , Amadou Diallo , Patrick Dorismond , his halting of rescue and recovery at 9/11 on behalf of a contractor , his 2004 GOP Convention speech , his cheerleading of Bush , his silence about Osama Bin Laden , his exploitation of the 9/11 tragedy , his avaricious attempts to profit from the tragedy , his raiding of the widow 's victim funds for his cronies , his business links to many of the same groups that he calls terrorists , etc ...
The people most affected by 9/11 ( in terms of numbers ) are the people of New York City ( and our surrounding suburbs ) .
The pain of that horrific day still lives inside of me as it does most New Yorkers .
If you ever want to see righteous anger , all you have to do is be a politician ( Democratic or Republican ) who would exploit this tragedy for personal purposes while giving a big FU to the city of New York .
( Example - I and many others REFUSED to vote for Mark Green when he ran an exploitive commercial of 9/11 just weeks after the tragedy .
This issue goes way beyond party labels . )
Rudy Giuliani is that exploitive politician ten times over .
It 's why he got booed louder than any person at Yankee Stadium since Ed Whitson .
SIDENOTE : All a Democratic candidate has to say is this .
If people realized Rudy Giuliani 's real record on 9/11 , he'd be less popular than ___________ ( fill in blank with favorite villain , i.e. Paris Hilton , Michael Vick . )
Giuliani did _____________________
( fill in with your 3 - 5 best facts . )
The people who know Giuliani best wo n't support him .
It 's why he was roundly booed at Yankee Stadium .
ENDNOTE : If Giuliani is the GOP nominee and America knows his real record , we are talking about the biggest landslide in presidential politics history .
( Democrat 72 % - Giuliani 28 %)
If need arises , we will conduct N- tests : PM

Intervening in the Lok Sabha debate on the India - United States civil nuclear deal , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh [ Images ] said if the need arises , India would conduct a nuclear test .
Dr Singh was forced to make the statement following charges levelled against the government by the opposition .
" There is nothing in the agreement that prevents us from carrying out tests , " Dr Singh said and resumed his seat , but not before accusing the National Democratic Alliance government of announcing a unilateral decision not to test after May 1998 .
Criticising the government , Leader of Opposition Lal Kishenchand Advani said the United Progressive Alliance had pawned India 's national security .
He quoted an article by The Hindu 's editor - in - chief N Ram that said a similar agreement had been ready for signing during the summit meeting between Dr Singh and Russian President Vladimir Putin [ Images ] , but ' the Indian side backed out ' .

This video , from the dashboard camera of a police vehicle , shows a man being shot with a taser gun by a police officer for arguing over a speeding ticket and not signing said ticket .
There are many incidents of people dying after receiving taser shocks , so such action should only be taken as a replacement for deadly force , which was not necessary in this case .
The man just wanted proof that he was speeding before he signed the ticket .
Another thing worth pointing out is that after the officer told the man to turn around , a command which he obeyed , yet he was still shot with the taser gun .
Is it because the man said " What the hecks wrong with you ? "
And why shoot someone in the back who is apparently unarmed ?
The man asked the officer why he was under arrest and the officer said , " Because , you would not sign the citation and you did not follow my instructions . "
The man also repeatedly requests to have his rights read to him , which the cop consistently refuses .
He also asks how fast he was going , a question that the officer is unable to answer .
Later , another cop can be heard in the background asking what was going on .
" Oh , he took a ride with the taser , " the arresting officer replied .
" How was it ? " , the new voice asked the shock victim .
" Painful is n't it ? , " the arresting officer replied .
The officer then goes over to the mans wife , who is sitting in the automobile , to tell her that her husband is being arrested .
" He should have signed the citation , " the cop said , " and he should have turned around when I said to turn around . "
Is it actually a punishable offense not to sign a citation ?
I 've heard of people not signing citations before , but it usually ends in the ticket getting mailed to them .
At the end of the video the arresting officer can be seen giving his take of the events to the other officer .
His explanation seems incongruent with the events that the video shows .
Just to be fair , the video does show that the man receiving the ticket was possibly wrong .
There is a 40 MPH sign that can be clearly seen before the officer pulls him over .
So why did the officer not take him to see the sign to prove he was wrong ?
However , the officer pulls him over immediately after he passes the sign which gave the man little time to slow down after seeing it .

Joe Wilson : Bush either ' out of touch ' or accessory to a crime David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday November 21 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush is either " out of touch " or an accessory to a crime in connection to the outing of ex-CIA agent Valerie Plame , according to Plame 's husband , Ambassador Joseph Wilson .
Appearing on CNN's American Morning program , Wilson told anchor John Roberts that an excerpt from a book penned by former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan -- which charged that the president was " involved " in the passing along of false information about the Plame leak to the media -- confirmed Vice President Dick Cheney 's involvement in the affair .
Wilson also said that a " cloud " of suspicion had now shifted to the office of the president .
" I think it now makes it very clear the extent to which the vice president was involved , " said Wilson .
" And now , because of McClellan 's statement , that cloud is over the president himself .
He 's either completely out of touch or he's an accessory to obstruction of justice both before the fact and after the fact . "
In the book , McClellan states that he had " unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the President 's chief of staff , and the president himself . "
As reported by CNN on Tuesday , however , the book 's publisher is now contending that McClellan was not charging that the president was involved in a ' conspiracy to mislead the public . "
In 2006 , Wilson and Plame brought a civil lawsuit against Vice President Cheney , the vice president 's former chief of staff Scooter Libby , and ex-White House adviser Karl Rove .
The suit alleges that Plame 's outing was a retaliation for Wilson 's political criticisms of the president and amounts to a violation of the couple 's Constitutional rights .
The book excerpt could strengthen that case , which is currently on appeal , according to Wilson .
" The argument that we 've made in our civil suit is that public officials were abusing the public trust in the exercise of their official duties in support of a private political vendetta , " he told CNN .
" I think what McClellan says certainly makes that very clear .
At a bare minimum , for openers , I think it 's incumbent on the president and vice president now to release the transcripts of their statements to the special prosecutor so that we now have a fuller understanding of what they knew , when they knew it and what they said to Justice . "
Later in the segment Wilson said Congressional hearings into the matter would be justified .
" This is a betrayal of the national security of the country , " he continued . " This is essentailly treason .
Had the vice president told Libby to tell the Russian military attache my wife 's name , there would be no question about what we'd be calling this .
The fact that he brokered it through a bottom - feeder like Bob Novak does n't make it any different . "
Three Democratic contenders for the presidency have already weighed in on the McClellan excerpt , including Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who called for an investigation into the president 's role in the Plame leak .
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - CT ) said that President Bush should " immediately come forward and explain any action taken by him or his administration to mislead the American public ... it appears from McClellan 's account that the president himself was ' involved ' in spreading false information .
That is outrageous . "
Fellow presidential hopeful Gov. Bill Richardson ( D - NM ) stated that it was " a low point in our history when the leader of the free world fights to deceive the American public . "
Added the governor : " Rather than defend the Constitution , President Bush has bamboozled the country .
Whether it is outing a CIA operative , illegally spying on Americans , or advocating the use of torture , the Bush administration has made a mockery of our legal system . "

Peak oil has made us aware that many of the resources on which civilization depends are limited .
M. King Hubbert , a geophysicist for Shell Oil , found that oil production over time followed a curve that was roughly bell - shaped .
He correctly predicted that oil production in the lower 48 states would peak in 1970 .
Other analysts following Hubbert 's methods are predicting a peak in oil production early this century .
The depletion analysis pioneered by Hubbert can be applied to other non-renewable resources .
Analysts have looked at peak production for resouces such as natural gas , coal and uranium .
In this paper , Patrick Déry applies Hubbert 's methods to a very special non-renewable resource - phosphorus - a nutrient essential for agriculture .
Satire became reality Friday afternoon when half a dozen armed federal agents wearing body armor showed up at this author ’s home and detained everyone in the house for nearly 90 minutes to determine who might pose a threat to the government .
Marshal John Bolen of the U.S. Marshals Office of Protective Intelligence traveled to Manchester , N.H. , to investigate threats of violence allegedly made against Steven McAuliffe , a federal judge in the district court in Concord , and other federal officials in the area .
He brought along with him other marshals and agents who would only say that they were with the Treasury Department .
Later in the afternoon the federal agents detained and interrogated another Manchester resident for nearly 30 minutes trying to locate yet another person of interest to them , and then after having set up a Saturday meeting with this person of interest , did n’t even bother to show up .
The threats allegedly originated with convicted tax protesters Ed and Elaine Brown , late of Plainfield , and supporters of their cause .
Marshals took the Browns into custody Thursday night to begin serving 63 - month prison terms after a nine - month standoff in which the couple remained in their home , supporters brought food , supplies and firearms , and staged concerts and press conferences on the property .
Reports Friday morning stated that a supporter of the Browns left a threat of retaliatory violence on a MySpace page Thursday night after the arrest , but this author was unable to find such a threatening message .
Nevertheless , according to media reports , some militant supporters of the Browns have threatened violence against government officials in the past .
And the marshals , under fresh criticism for failing to protect federal judges properly , desperately needed to look like they were doing something .
A report ( PDF ) released Wednesday by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that marshals ’ efforts to protect federal judges had “ languished , ” with growing backlogs of threats to be assessed and investigated , and improper assessment of threats leading to misallocation of resources .
So , apparently unable or unwilling to face the people who have said they want to shoot government agents , they came to my house instead .
And misallocation of resources certainly seems to describe Friday ’s incidents .
Bolen ’s investigation in Manchester seemed to center around members of the Free State Project , a group whose members pledge to move to New Hampshire in order to help reduce the size and scope of government .
“ Anyone who promotes violence , racial hatred , or bigotry is not welcome ” in the Free State Project , according to a statement on its Web site .
As I have said repeatedly here , I do not believe that using violence against government officials is an appropriate method to effect positive change .
For one , it would not have the desired effect .
Those of you who have read Matthew Bracken ’s Enemies Foreign and Domestic know that shooting government agents is a significant part of the plot in that novel .
But to see what would happen , you should read the sequel , Domestic Enemies .
This would be a significant step backward for a freedom movement .
In contrast to those espousing violence , Free State Project members spent the last three days trying to determine if Ed and Elaine Brown were truly unharmed , as Marshal Stephen Monier said , and seeking a loving home for the Browns ’ presumably abandoned dog .
Hopefully the U.S. Marshals , and other law enforcement agencies , will learn something from this misallocation of resources , and start spending their time going after actual threats .
One final note .
Bolen told everyone here that he was seeking our help in preventing acts of violence from being perpetrated .
Yet he and the agents who came with him gave numerous conflicting statements to each of us .
Normal people call this lying .
I would suggest that it ’s not a good idea to lie to people whose support you ’re trying to enlist .
It tends to foster resentment and distrust , and that is the last thing that an intelligence organization should be doing .
Home Kourier is now live I just stumbled across the February 28 development - blog posting from the commercial online game Vendetta Online :
The new erlang based system is now in production .
For those who have n't been following , we ran into problems with our existing Lisp - based system ( named " Deliverator " ) which handles high - level AI behaviour .. large groups of NPCs , large battles and the like .
Over the last couple of months , we 've been in the process of migrating to a much more scalable architecture ( named " Kourier " ) based on Erlang , an elegant distributed - programming platform .
... I do enjoy starting the day with a nice cup of coffee and an interesting read like this .
:-)

You can understand why an unpublished writer might resort to blooking ; but when a successful author with a best - selling business title behind him gives away a chapter a week , it piques curiosity .
Gerd Leonhard is an ex-muso , with a message for the recording industry .
Judging by the RIAA 's triumphant win receiving $ 220,000 in damages for the downloading and sharing of 24 songs , it 's a message they are n't ready to hear .
But Gerd is sharing his ideas - free - in book form .
There is ( he says ) a better way of getting money out of people 's wallets than going to court .
The book is " The End Of Control " and chapter one is already out .
It follows his highly successful business title The Future Of Music which has been translated into several languages , including Japanese , since its publication two years ago .
When I spoke to Leonhard he was in the airport in Singapore on his way to the next stop of a consulting trip to the Far East , and he was anxious to make sure the world knew about the Radiohead venture - to allow fans to download their tracks for " as little as 1 p - plus a mandatory 45 p credit card fee " , and he was touting this as a sign of the times .
His message for the middlemen : " You are about to become squashed between hundreds of managers and artists that want to go direct , large retailers like amazon that re-write the rules of online music selling ( think bundles ... think flat - rate ) , telcos and operators that are getting fed up with the tedious and outmoded licensing practices , and search engines that are powering or becoming music communities and the next generation of radio . "
And , he told his blog readers : " If [ the industry tries to ] keep up the strategy of ' you need us badly and therefore we make the rules ' you will lose the artists , their managers ... and the audience .
Another 12 months for this Radiohead experiment to become the default approach .
Get engaged or get outmoded .
And do it soon . "
His catchphrase seems to be " move the tollbooth further down " .
What I wanted to know was whether he thought he'd make more money per copy , selling his new book chapter by chapter at zero price , than he did by giving it to a publisher .
This turns out to be a tricky question to answer , because ( as with many / most music deals ) the publisher wo n't let people tell the world how much they get paid .
" But suppose , " said Leonhard " you have a reasonably successful business book , which sells 50,000 copies , and your royalty is around 10 pence per copy , that 's $ 10,000 more or less " .
The money , however , is n't made on the book .
Gerd works as a consultant ; his fees go up and his assignments increase according to his web exposure .
By giving the book away , clearly , he reckons people will read it who might otherwise not read it .
" That 's also true in music , " says Leonhard .
" The real money is not in the CDs .
It 's in the gigs , the merchandising , the sponsorships .
To make that money , you have to let people further down the highway before they arrive at the tollbooth . "
The people formerly known as consumers , he says , are now the bosses .
The other half of the argument , which Radiohead was also pointing out in its own announcement , is the idea that giving away the content does n't necessarily mean you do n't sell the book or the CD .
Radiohead is asking an astonishing forty pounds sterling for the boxed CD set of its " In Rainbows " songs and , as one of the group remarked : " How many football matches can you watch for that amount ? "
Gerd Leonhard puts it slightly differently : " If people like the book , they 'll buy a copy , rather than printing out the PDF . "
A schedule for release - along the lines of DVD regions - simply loses sales , he thinks .
" The new channel is ' who is quickest ? ' and ' who is best ? ' and not ' who has the best control ? ' any more . "
He 's predicting that the Wall Street Journal will go " open " onto the web shortly , and regards the New York Times ' decision to start an RSS subscription feed as another marker of the changes .
" Today , in our world of Googles , Facebooks , YouTubes , and iPhones , all content is just zeros and ones , and trying to prevent its ' leakage ' is simply futile . "
Bet that does n't stop the RIAA suing its customers , all the same . ®
ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) --
Making sense of the stock market 's reactions is never easy .
But it appears to be especially inscrutable in the face of unexpectedly weak news on the employment front .
Sometimes it will rally in the face of such news .
Yet , at other times , such as Friday , it will plunge .
Believe it or not , the market 's behavior may not be so mysterious after all .
Let me start by reviewing what happened Friday .
The Labor Department reported before the market open that nonfarm payrolls had dropped by about 4,000 , far worse than the 115,000 increase that was the consensus expectation of a group of economists that MarketWatch had polled .
See Economic Report
The stock market plunged on the news .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % dropped some 160 points at the open , on its way to losing 250 points for the session .
To make sense of the market 's varied reactions to seemingly bad news , I turned to an academic study from several years ago that examined the reaction to unemployment news . , " The Stock Market 's Reaction to Unemployment News : Why Bad News is Usually Good News for Stocks , " was conducted by finance professor John Boyd of the University of Minnesota , Jian Hu of Moody 's Investors Service , and finance professor Ravi Jagannathan of Northwestern University .
See study
The researchers found that when the economy was in recession - as later determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research , the unofficial arbiter of when recessions begin and end - the stock market typically fell when the unemployment news was unexpectedly bad .
But when the economy was in an NBER - declared expansion , more often than not the market rallied .
The reason the market reacts differently during recessions than during expansions , according to the researchers :
When the economy is growing , the positive effect of a strong jobs report is more than outweighed by the negative effect of the interest - rate increases that such a report makes more probable .
Just the reverse is the case following a weaker - than - expected jobs report .
Now the bad news of the jobs report is more than outweighed by the good news that the Fed will have less pressure on it to raise rates .
During recessions , in contrast , interest rate hikes are less of a threat .
So a strong jobs report is taken at face value as good news , and a weaker - than - expected report is considered to be bad news .
The researchers ' findings are summarized in the accompanying table .
Economy expanding Economy contracting Job news unexpectedly good Stock market likely to fall Stock market likely to rise Job news unexpectedly bad Stock market likely to rise Stock market likely to fall
Based on the patterns the researchers found in their study , we can use the stock market 's behavior as a barometer of whether the economy is more likely to be expanding or contracting .
Why , you might ask , do we even need such a barometer ?
Do n't we already know if we 're in a recession ?
Unfortunately , not .
Recessions typically are n't declared to have started by the NBER until months later .
In some cases , in fact , the recession is over before the NBER confirms that it had even started .
So such a barometer could be helpful .
What does all this mean for today ?
The market 's plunge Friday in the face of unexpectedly bad job news is yet another straw in the wind that the economy may be a lot weaker than previously had been thought .
As with all conclusions based on a statistical analysis of the historical precedents , this one comes with no guarantees .
But I for one would be more confident in the economy 's health if the stock market had risen Friday rather than fallen .
Value is a subjective thing .
I could never personally justify spending thousands of dollars for a chair just because somebody says it 's an antique .
That said , I spend a ridiculous amount of money buying the latest videogames that I 'm sure others would find a complete waste of one 's funds .
Perhaps with this in consideration , it 's wrong to call somebody who spends € 7000 ( roughly $ 9,500 ) to buy someone else 's World of Warcraft account an idiot .
Perhaps it is , but ... let 's face it , he 's a complete idiot .
Zeuzo is a rogue from the Method guild with the kind of loot that sweaty bearded nerds would kill to get their virtual hands on ... or at least spend a ludicrous amount of money .
One of only two players to have the Twin Blades of Azzinoth , Zeuzo gave player Shaks his hard earned loot for the kind of money most of us never see in one place at one time .
Shaks apparently then used his newfound power to play quite badly .
Of course , with such an insane transaction , it would be foolish to expect things to run smoothly .
In fact , it would seem that Shaks has n't updated his profile for much of this month , indicating that his nutty purchase was discovered by Blizzard before news of the transaction even exploded .
In short -- if Shaks has n't earned himself a $ 9,500 ban , he will have done before the week is out .
Hahaha .

Explaining why Smalltalk developers like their images is a hard experience to convey to someone who 's accustomed to working with files .
Here 's a video I found that shows what it is to work on a running program .
He 's demonstrating some of the features of the refactoring browser on a running instance of the classic Asteroids game .
He extracts a method to a component , changes the color of the asteroids , then shows off undo and redo .
He does so while the game is running without ever having to break his flow with something as silly as a compile , debug , run cycle that we 've all grown so accustomed to in most other languages .
It does n't matter how fancy modern refactoring browsers get , as long as they 're still working on dead files instead of a live running program , they 'll never be able to compete with Smalltalk when it comes to developer productivity and maintaining flow .

Four years ago , without public input , the FCC rolled back 30 yr old rules that limited a single company 's ability to be able to dominate local TV , newspaper and radio media markets .
Thankfully , the rules changes triggered a massive public response and through legislation and lawsuit , they were defeated .
Now FCC chair Kevin Martin is attempting to do it again by trying to push through a similar set of changes allowing further media consolidation as soon as December 18 .
This time , we need n't wait until we have been sandbagged .
You can help by contacting Congress and the FCC now to stop Kevin Martin before he gets away with slipping this one by us .
Bill Moyers then goes one further and focuses on one glaring example of how our media is already failing us today :

BILL MOYERS : It 's important who owns the press , as we 've just seen and heard ... but it 's also important who decides what is news .
Why was n't it news last weekend when more than 100,000 people turned out in 11 cities across the country to protest the occupation of Iraq ... but if you blinked while watching the national news , you would n't have known it was a story ?
...( transcript )
It 's no wonder why groups like Code Pink must go to such lengths to make sure the overwhelming voice of public opinion against the war is n't ignored entirely .
Thankfully we at least still have Bill Moyers to help make sure that does n't happen .

I thought this would be a great idea for Halloween ( I love Halloween ! ) so in my usual over the top fashion I went , well -- over the top .
A buddy of mine wanted to do it as well .
We tried to get his roommate into it too so we could have a third Ghostbuster but he did n't think we'd be able to do it ......... :D
I made two complete packs , suits , belts and goggles in just over two weeks working mostly nights and weekends .
I also made a ghost trap and pedal - it clips onto the belt just like in the movie .
The guns come off the packs and the packs light up , as does the trap .
I made two lighting circuits for each pack using a simple homemade 555 timer circuit , a few LEDs and 9v batteries .
The trap weighs around six or seven pounds and the packs weigh about twenty - five pounds .
The packs and trap are pretty movie accurate - they were made from plans that were drawn up from one of the original movie " hero " packs on display at Planet Hollywood .
The A.L.I.C.E. pack frames are the same as the movie and were purchased from an Army surplus store .
Most of the small parts on the pack are movie accurate and were located at a local electronics surplus store .
Even our coveralls were from the original movie supplier .
The " no ghost " patches were bought online .
I made the goggles from hardboard , Bondo and thin plywood .
I turned the aluminum and glass lenses on a lathe .
All the labels on the packs and goggles are accurate and were printed on my computer .
Like I said - over the top .
But come Halloween it is oh sooo worth it .
People go absolutely flippin ' nuts when they see the whole getup .
They absolutely cannot believe they were homemade .
This is a BIG project so I 'll basically outline what I did to make it go a lot faster .

The Home Video Prince Does n't Want You to See
Pa. Mom Fights Back With Lawsuit Against Music Company
A bouncing YouTube baby has be -bopped his way right into the legal cross-hairs of the pop star Prince , sparking a lawsuit that could test the boundaries of U.S. copyright law .
Holden Lenz , 18 months old , is the pajama - clad star of a 29 - second home movie shot by his mother in the family 's rural Pennsylvania kitchen and posted last February on the popular video site YouTube .
In the video , the child is seen bouncing and swaying for the camera , as , faintly , the Prince hit " Let 's Go Crazy " plays on a CD player in the background .
Twenty eight people , mostly friends and family , had viewed the YouTube video by June , when mom Stephanie Lenz said she received an e-mail from YouTube informing her that her video had been removed from the site at the request of Universal Music Publishing Group , the recording industry 's largest label , and warning her that future copyright infringements on her part could force the Web site to cancel her account .
' Frightened , Then Angry '
" All of my [ YouTube ] videos are home videos , so I thought it was some kind of scam , '' Lenz told ABC News ' Law & Justice Unit .
When she realized YouTube had actually taken her video down , she said she was shocked .
" At first it frightened me , because I saw who had filed '' the takedown notice , she said .
" It was Universal Music Publishing Group , and I was afraid that ... they might come after me .
...
And the more afraid I got , the angrier I got .
... I was afraid that the recording industry might come after me the way they 've come after other people for downloading music or file sharing .
" I thought even though I did n't do anything wrong that they might want to file some kind of suit against me , take my house , come after me .
" And I did n't like feeling afraid , '' she continued .
" I did n't like feeling that I could get in trouble for something as simple as posting a home video for my friends and family to see . "
Lenz filed a " counter - notice " with YouTube , and the Web site put her video back up about six weeks later .
What Constitutes a Ripoff of an Artist 's Work ?
But Lenz was angry , and she said she was n't ready to let it go .
She contacted a leading cyber rights legal organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and filed a civil lawsuit against the music publisher , claiming they were abusing the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act by sending out reams of what are known in the industry as " take down notices " to Web sites like YouTube , claiming their artists ' copyrights had been infringed upon -- when in fact , sometimes they may not have been at all .
Universal Music Publishing Group has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint , a spokesman said .
File - sharing and illegally downloading of music has devastated a once - booming music industry .
Some observers say the industry is just trying to protect itself .
" I think the large copyright holders believe that if they do not police every single use of their copyrighted work -- no matter how benign -- that somehow that will open the floodgates to massive piracy , '' said Gigi Sohn of the Washington think - tank Public Knowledge .
" The problem with that is that viewers , Internet users , consumers , have rights under copyright law as well , and one of those rights is the ability to make fair , lawful uses of copyrighted work , for a variety of reasons , " she said .
" The ' Let 's Go Crazy baby ? ' " she asked rhetorically .
" When you look at the facts , it 's obvious that a take down notice should never have been sent .
... I mean , nobody downloads a video from YouTube with a song on it -- particularly 29 seconds of a song and says , ' OK , I do n't have to buy the song ' -- so clearly this was a type of use that did n't violate copyright . "
Source : Prince ' Scours the Internet ' Looking for Violations
For it 's part , Universal said it was simply acting at the behest of one of its top artists .
" Prince believes it is wrong for YouTube , or any user - generated site , to appropriate his music without his consent , '' the company said in a statement released to ABC News Thursday .
" That position has nothing to do with any particular video that uses his songs .
It 's simply a matter of principle .
And legally , he has the right to have his music removed .
We support him and this important principle .
That is why , over the last few months , we have asked YouTube to remove thousands of different videos that use Prince music without his permission . "
A well - placed source directly involved in the situation confirmed to ABC News that Prince was directly involved in seeking the takedown of Lenz 's video .
" This guy scours the Internet , '' the source said of the legendary artist , who once changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol and wrote the word " Slave ' " on his cheek until he won back the rights to his music from another publishing company .
" He 's really intense about this stuff , " the source said , adding that Lenz 's video " happened to be one of many ' ' that artist apparently located online and demanded be taken down .
A publicist for Prince directed ABC News to the artist 's personal assistant 's cell phone .
The assistant did not return a call for comment .
The case is part of what some cyber rights advocates says is an alarming trend in aggressive copyright protection that can sometimes go too far .
Entire companies have sprung up to troll the Internet and send thousands of take down notices , warning of legal action if videos that could be deemed to violate a copyright are not immediately removed .
" This is the first major case that we 've seen where someone like a housewife is being targeted by a major recording company , but we 're starting to see more and more of these kinds of abuses , '' said Jason Schultz , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" Because of the way the law is set up , it 's very easy for people to send copyright complaints to any Web site and demand that videos come down or music comes down , and a lot of providers can't verify .
" What 's going on here is that people like Universal are abusing the copyright law in order to censor , take down videos they frankly do n't like , but are n't actually infringing copyright , '' Schultz said .
" They are n't violating copyright law .
So here Stephanie Lenz posted a video of her kids dancing , '' Schultz said .
" It 's just a home video .
She wanted her friends and family to see it , and Universal had no right to [ have it ] take [ n ] down .
And by sending an abusive copyright complaint , they really abused the law . ''
Lenz and E.F.F. are seeking unspecified damages from the music company .
" I 'd like to see [ Universal ] say that I was n't a copyright infringer , '' Lenz said .
By Law , YouTube Honors Takedown Notices -- and Counter - Notices
A YouTube spokesman told ABC News that under the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , hosting platforms like YouTube are legally obligated to take both the original takedown notices and the counter - notices at face - value , and to honor them .
" This litigation does n't involve us , '' Ricardo Reyes , a spokesman for YouTube said .
" We are what the DMCA call a hosting platform , " he said .
" We provide a platform for people to post their content and share it .
When we 're notified that something is infringing , we take that [ content ] down .
To not take it down would put us in violation of the DMCA .
What we have to do is take them at face value .
What you are saying under penalty of law is saying you are the owner .
If you say you are the owner and you 're not , you can be sued . "
Conversely , Reyes said , " When we 're counter notified , we basically have to take the counter notice at face value too .
Our responsibility is to abide by the notices or counter notices . "
Caught to some extent in the middle of the takedown notice wars , Reyes declined to address the Prince controversy directly , but said YouTube had been down this road before .
He cited the case of a North Carolina school board council candidate , Christopher Knight , who produced a daffy commercial in which he donned a " Star Wars " - like light saber and promised to protect the school district 's students from a metaphorical Death Star .
The VH1 cable television show " Best Week Ever , " which highlights amusing online content , featured a clip of the video on their show .
Knight " thought that was so cool he put up the VH1 clip up on his channel on YouTube , '' Reyes said .
" And VH1 sent us a take down notice . "
( To view Knight 's video , go to YouTube and search " Christopher Knight . " )
Lenz , a blogger and fiction writer , said she 's sympathetic to the plight of the music industry and its artists .
" I do understand where the record industry is coming from , '' she said .
" They should go after people who infringe on their copyrights .
Artists and musicians are owed the money for the product that they create , but I did n't take their product .
I bought my CD at my local record store and I played it for my kids , and I was n't trying to make any money or pass it off as anything other than a home movie of my child . "
But the legal controversy has changed the way Lenz thinks , she said , every time she picks up her digital camera .
" I 'm constantly thinking about what 's going on in the background , what 's on the TV , what 's on the CD player , the characters on my kids ' clothes , the characters on the toys that they are playing with , '' she said .
" I 'm cognizant of what 's going on at every step , instead of focusing on my kids , which is where my attention should be . "
As for Holden , the toddler has moved on to punk music .
" He loves music , '' his mother said .
" He likes all kind of music .
At the time [ of the video ] he liked anything that was funk or anything that was R & B , and Prince fit perfectly in with that .
" I have n't played Prince for him lately , '' she said , laughing .
" But he 's getting a little bit more into punk now , so I 'm trying to turn him on to Nirvana . "
The U.S. military has expelled the son of a leading peace activist for going AWOL after returning from a year tour in Iraq .
Specialist Shaun Manuel , whose father Michael McPhearson directs the organization Veterans for Peace , was given a bad - conduct discharge last month after failing to report for training for a second tour .
When Manuel signed up for the Army in December 2003 , his father , Michael McPherson , tried to talk him out of it .
A veteran of the first Gulf War , McPherson was a vociferous opponent of the second .
But Manuel would n’t listen to his father ’s admonitions .
He was assigned to the 101 Airborne Division and in September 2005 deployed for a year - long tour running convoys and warehouse operations in Tikrit .
As he dealt with the daily danger of mortar rounds and roadside bombs , Manuel said , he began to share his father ’s perspective .
" It was like I was over there for no reason , " he said .
" We were n’t accomplishing anything .
It was like we were doing the same thing every day and they would n’t tell us nothing about what was going on at the Pentagon . "
Manuel said he repeatedly asked his chain of command , " Why am I over here ? " but they did n’t provide him with an answer .
It was " like they were ready to come home too , " he said .
" What I was thinking  it was on their face . "
While Manuel was in Iraq , his wife gave birth to their third son , Jeremiah .
But the joyous occasion turned sour when Jeremiah was diagnosed with a genetic disease called Muscular Spinal Atrophy and died in January of this year .
Manuel said the situation was made even more painful when his superiors ordered him to begin training for a second tour in Iraq .
" My son passed away , " he said .
" You gonna ’ send an emotionally distressed soldier to Iraq  who knows what he ’s going to do ?
I ’m ready to just blow the whole world up because I did n’t see my son being born and then he just passed away on me with no warning . "
Manuel never filed paperwork to medically excuse him from the deployment .
Instead , he withdrew and buried himself in alcohol .
He estimates he drank three fifths of liquor a day .
At one point , his wife had to call the police during a domestic disturbance .
In response , the Army threw him in a local county jail and kicked him out of the military with a bad - conduct discharge , which will deny him medical benefits he might have been able to use to get his life back together again .
It ’s a common story .
In the first four years of the Iraq war , for example , 1,019 Marines were dismissed with less - than - honorable discharges for misconduct committed after overseas deployments .
Navy Capt .
William Nash , who coordinates the Marines ’ combat stress program , told USA Today last week that at least 326 of the discharged Marines showed evidence of mental health problems , possibly from combat stress .
Nash told the paper he hoped that " any Marine or sailor who commits particularly uncharacteristic misconduct following deployment … be aggressively screened for stress disorders and treated . "
" If a Marine who was previously a good , solid Marine  never got in trouble  commits misconduct after deployment and turns out they have PTSD { Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ) , and because of justice they lose their benefits , that may not be justice , " Nash said .
David Walker is a Vietnam veteran and police chaplain who ’s been helping returning soldiers work their way through military bureaucracy .
He notes that most American soldiers are only being given six months in the United States between deployments  five months of which is generally spent training for the next tour .
Cases like Shaun Manuel ’s , he said , are increasingly common .
" It ’d be like sending out your first - string football team and there ’s no defense , no offense , there ’s no kickoff team , there ’s no punt return team  everybody that ’s on that line is on the line for the duration of the game , " Walker said .
" When it ’s over with , you get an hour break and you play another team with the same string of guys . "
" It ’s burning people out , " he said .
Like many soldiers who have returned from Iraq , Manuel has never seen a military psychiatrist .
He never asked to see one and now that he ’s been chaptered out of the Army he wo n’t be able to see one in the future .
His father , Veterans for Peace Director Michael McPhearson , is helping Manuel file an appeal to regain his medical benefits .
In the meantime , McPhearson sees the glass as half full .
" I feel relief , " he told OneWorld .
" I was so concerned about him going into the military in the first place .
Then he goes to Iraq , so there was a year of me saying ‘ Oh my God , is my son going to come back ?
How guilty am I going to feel if something happens to him ? ’
Now I ’m through all that .
The worst thing that could happen now is that he does what many young people do , which is not to follow a good path in life . "
" But he ’s not going to be killed in Iraq , " McPhearson said .
" I know that .
So I ’ve just got be a good father and help him as best I can . "

Perhaps you noticed that United States dimes , quarters , half - dollars , and silver dollars have ridges , or grooves , around their edges .
They were not put there for decoration , but had a very important purpose at one time in history .
During our country ’s earlier years , all coins were made of gold or silver , and did not have ridges .
Each coin ’s value was based on the amount of gold or silver in it .
For example , a $ 10 gold piece contained ten dollars worth of gold , and silver dimes contained ten cents worth of silver .
But some dishonest people sought to make an illegal profit from these coins .
They filed off the edges and sold them for their value in gold or silver .
The smaller - sized coin often went unnoticed , but this dishonest practice decreased the value of the original gold or silver coin .
To prevent this , the government began milling , or grooving , the edges so a coin could easily be identified if it was trimmed .
Coins today are no longer made of pure gold or silver , but the milled edges remain because people are accustomed to seeing them that way .
At the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia , one single stamping machine can produce 10,000 coins every minute of every hour of every day of the week !
Mr Blair said politicians who talk about religion " get into trouble "
In an interview for BBC One 's The Blair Years , he said that his faith had been " hugely important " to his premiership .
His ex-spokesman Alastair Campbell once told reporters : " We do n't do God . "
Mr Campbell has now acknowledged to the programme that his former boss " does do God in quite a big way " , but that both men feared the public would be wary .
' Pretty irreverent '
During the interview , Mr Blair said having faith was a crucial component for him in having the character to take on the prime minister 's job .
" For me having faith was an important part of being able to do that , " he said .
If he sees a very attractive woman his eye will wander and all that stuff , he does n't look like your classic religious sort of guy
Alastair Campbell
But while it was commonplace in the US and elsewhere for politicians to talk about their religious convictions , he added , " you talk about it in our system and , frankly , people do think you 're a nutter " .
British voters imagined that leaders who were informed by religion would " commune with the man upstairs and then come back and say ' Right , I 've been told the answer and that 's it ' " .
Mr Campbell 's refusal to discuss his faith was not due to any opposition to his beliefs , but because " you always get into trouble talking about it " , Mr Blair continued .
Mr Campbell added that the former prime minister always asked his aides to find him a church to attend , wherever he happened to be , each Sunday .
" Because he 's pretty irreverent , he swears a fair bit , if he sees a very attractive woman his eye will wander and all that stuff , he does n't look like your classic religious sort of guy , " said Mr Campbell .
But he added : " I think his close circle always understood that there was a part of him that was really , really important .
" On that kind of spiritual level it did inform a lot of what he talked about , what he read ... what he felt was important . "
Mr Campbell said the UK electorate were " a bit wary of politicians who go on about God " .
He had also been concerned that the Conservatives would accuse Labour of trying to claim faith as its own .
' Ethical values '
Peter Mandelson , a close confidant of Mr Blair , said : " He 's not an exhibitionist when it comes to religion but deep inside him it is very , very important .
" This is a man who takes a Bible with him wherever he goes and last thing at night he will read from the Bible . "
Sir Menzies Campbell , the former Liberal Democrat leader , suggested that Mr Blair may not have been so politically successful had the relationship between his beliefs and his actions in office been better known .
" The public might have been less willing to give him the triumph of three consecutive general election victories if they 'd known the extent to which ethical values would overshadow pragmatism , " Sir Menzies said .
With the latest advances in treatment , doctors have discovered that they can successfully neutralise the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
The so - called ‘ combination therapy ’ prevents HIV from mutating and spreading , allowing patients to rebuild their immune system to the same levels as the rest of the population .
To date , it represents the most significant treatment for patients suffering from HIV .
Professor Jens Lundgren from the University of Copenhagen , together with other members of the research group EuroSIDA , have conducted a study , which demonstrates that the immune system of all HIV - infected patients can be restored and normalised .
The only stipulation is that patients begin and continue to follow their course of treatment .
HIV attacks the body ’s ability to counteract viruses
Viruses are small organisms that have no independent metabolism .
Consequently , when they enter the body they attack living cells and adopt their metabolism .
The influenza virus occupies cells in the nose , throat and lungs ; the mumps attaches itself to the salivary glands near the ears ; while the Polio virus plays on the intestinal tract , blood and salivary glands .
In all these instances , our immune system attacks and eliminates the invading virus .
HIV is so deadly because the virus attaches itself to a crucial part of the immune system itself : to the so - called CD4+T lymphocytes , which are white blood corpuscles that help the immune system to fight infections .
The Hi-virus forms and invades new CD4+T - lymphocytes .
Slowly but surely , the number of healthy CD4+T lymphocytes in the blood fall , while HIV relentlessly weakens the body ’s ability to defend itself from infection .
Finally , the immune system erodes to such an extent that the infected patient is diagnosed with AIDS .
The Hi-virus mutates constantly as it forms and this is why , scientists face a constant battle to find a cure or a vaccine .
Combination therapy knocks out HIV
Combination therapy prevents the virus from forming and mutating in human beings .
When the virus is halted in its progress , the number of healthy CD4+T cells begins to rise and patients , who would otherwise die from HIV , can now survive .
The immune system is rejuvenated and is apparently able to normalise itself , providing that the combination therapy is maintained .
The moment the immune system begins to improve , the HIV - infected patient can no longer be said to be suffering from an HIV infection or disease , already declining in strength .
Findings from the study are published in the medical journal The Lancet - Vol. 370 , Issue 9585 , 4 August 2007 , Pages 407-413
In the 2002 run-up to the Iraq War , President Bush stopped for a photo - op at the East Literature Magnet School in Nashville , Tennessee .
Using the opportunity to justify his impending invasion of Iraq to middle and high school students , he shared with them his mangled version of a Texas truism , â€ œFool me once , shame on â€ ” shame on you .
Fool me â€ ” you can't get fooled again . "
It seems a majority of us can get fooled again . . . and again . . . and yet again .
In fact , a critical mass of the American electorate is taken in as easily as a photon of light is sucked down a black hole .
Who would have thought that while the United States is embroiled in a war and occupation predicated on impeachable liesâ € ” that all but the comatose or Fox News devotees are aware ofâ € ” a slight majority of Americans could be duped into supporting a pre-emptive attack on Iran based on â€œintelligenceâ€ provided by the Bush - Cheney administration .
But sadly , thatâ€™s exactly what we seem prepared to do .
According to a recent Zogby Poll , 52 percent of those interviewed supported a military strike to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weaponâ € ” which experts believe will take at least another five years .
Time enough for a diplomatic resolution .
Granted , gullibility is inherent in our species and one can imagine its survival value in our evolutionary past .
But we no longer live in caves or fight with clubs .
Believing everything we hear or read does not enhance survival when smoking guns can turn into mushroom clouds .
So how is it that weâ€™ve let ourselves become such a Foolish Generation ?
Is the root of our foolishness nourished by the fact that 70 percent of Americans actually believe there is a devil in hell ?
Given the mega - church mentality , with its crusader zeal and apocalyptic vision that has hijacked our generationâ€™s collective conscience and political discourse , itâ€™s not a large leap of faith to believe that Lucifer can turn his minions loose in Iraq or Iran or wherever .
And if that faith is cynically exploited by corporate - owned Neocons bent on the conquest of the oil rich â€ œLand of Evilâ€ in the name of God and freedom , is our goose - stepping off to war really such a conundrum ?
President Bush raises the specter of World War III should Iran develop a single nuclear weapon ( the U.S. and its allies have thousands ) , just as then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice conjured up imagines of mushroom clouds in the march to war with Iraq .
Our attack on Iran could very possibly unleash WW III , but not for the reason Bush imagines .
Nuclear - armed countries such as China , Russia , India , Pakistan and Israel , and all non-nuclear Muslim nations are inextricably bound in a web of strategic , economic and religious interests in the â€ œLand of Evilâ€ that cannot withstand our foolishness indefinitely .
And the mushroom clouds weâ€™ll see over Iran will not be from jihadist suicide bombers , but from our tactical bunker - busting nuclear missiles , which are an integral part of the militaryâ€™s attack plan .
Lest we get fooled again :
People will die in this new war in Iran as they are in Iraq , as they did in Vietnamâ € ” as people do in warâ € ” by the tens of thousands or millions . . . one irreversible death at a time .
Families will be vaporized as they huddle together and cry and fowl themselves in fear and pray to whichever god they believe is listening .
A child will die from a single bullet to the brain or in pieces .
The dead will become carrion and the dogs and the rats and the crows will grow fat .
And when the bombing stops and the blood and pieces of flesh and viscera are washed away and down the sewer , history will have been made and the Foolish Generation will be indicted .
We will not be able to camouflage our culpability within the mottled grey of words such as â€œterrorismâ€ and â€œgenocide .â€ 
We will have committed the murder of innocent daughters and sons and mothers and fathers on a massive scale .
There can be no mincing of words .
It is mass murder .
And our foolishness is no defense .
During his warmongering at the East Literature Magnet School , President Bush stressed the importance of youngsters understanding history because it gives them â€œa better sense of what it means to be an American .
â€ 
Imagine youngsters in Berlin in 1939 listening to a similar speech by their warmongering Furher .
Now imagine their sense of what it meant to be a German in 1945 , tainted as they were by the blood on their parentsâ€™ hands .
History has not been kind to those youngsters .
If our Foolish Generation cannot find a way to extricate itself from the black hole of history into which it is plunging , our childrenâ€™s blood - spattered generation will face the court of world opinion with a weak defense :
â€ œFool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice , shame on me . . . and my issue in perpetuity .â€ 

Human pressures are changing the behaviour of moose mothers
US scientists say Yellowstone moose have adopted the strategy to try to outwit their road - shy predators .
The study in Biology Letters suggests human pressures are having unexpected effects on wild animals .
Other species , including monkeys , deer and elephants , have also been shown to use people as cover from predators .
Wildlife Conservation Society biologist and study author , Dr Joel Berger , said moose mothers were " using human infrastructure as a shield " .
" The study 's results indicate that moose and other prey species find humans more benign and hence move to humans for safety , whereas predators do not because we humans tend to be less kind to predators , " he explained .
Danger zones
The study was carried out in the mountains in and around Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park .
Road - shy brown bears can prey heavily on moose calves
Given that bears seldom venture within 500 m ( 1,600 ft ) of roads , moose were effectively protecting their offspring from attack .
Dr Berger told the BBC : " Moose figure out very quickly where the danger zones are and how to buffer against them .
" If we 're using our national parks to understand pristine conditions , the presence of humans is altering interactions in very subtle but important ways . "
実のところ機械語はマシンに対する高レベルな挙動を示す命令であって実行を厳密に写像したものではない。（何を言っているんだわたしは？）
「マシン語ってどんな感じか知りたくなった方へ」という大人気のエントリと、ニコニコ動画を見て、昨今の最新マイクロプロセッサでは機械語がもはや機械の挙動と一対一に対応しなくなっちゃったのである、というツッコミをしたくなった。http://d.hatena.ne.jp/shi3z/20070913
「 水野拓宏 のTK-80講座」これが素敵すぎる。http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1048903
最近のプロセッ サ( Pentium 4 と かXeonとか ) は機械語を機械が直接実行するのではなく（じゃあ、なんで機械語というだよというツッコミは諸般の事情で却下（ｗ））、機械語をμOPという機械語と一対Nに対応する命令に変換し実行するのである。JavaのJITみたいな感じである。
機械語を逐次的に解釈実行するのであれば、昔のマイクロプログラミングという、機械語を機械が直接実行するのではなく、マイクロプログラムというインタプリターによって逐次実行するのと変わらないので、機械語レベルのセマンティックスと実行の順序は変わらない。
昨今のプロセッサは、機械語をμOPというのに変換してそれを「並列」に実行しちゃうのである。（ここで、ふーんと思ったあなた、感動が足りません。ここはのけぞるところです）
並列に実行しちゃうこと をOut of Order ( OOO）実行とか言っちゃうのだけど、（厳密に言えばOOOは並列に実行することを含意していない。実行順が機械語の順番と違うことを言っているだけ）、それによって、ある命令列によって引き起こされる効果を、他の人が観察すると機械語と違う順序で観察されるのである。例えば、あるアドレス（X )
に Aレジスタの値を代入し、次のアドレス（X+1）にBレジスタの値を代入するなんていう命令列では、Aレジスタの値が代入されてからBレジスタの値が代入されるなどという順序は、プロセッサは保証していないのである。（ああああ〜）
さらに怖いことに、あるアドレス（X ) の内容 をAレジスタに入れて、それを別のアドレス（Y )
に移動し、そしてそれをアドレスを増加しながらNバイト移動する、なんていう典型的なコード（イディオムと言ってもいい）は、X , X+1 , X+2 , …を A0 , A1 , A2 , … へ移動し、その後、Y , Y+1 , Y+2 , … へ移動するみたいなμOPに変換され、OOOで並列に実行される。ここでA0 , A1 , A2,…ってなんだよということになるのだが、内部的なレジスタで機械語からはAレジスタと見えるものである。？？？なのだが、Aレジスタが内部的にはN個あって、それぞれ処理が独立であれば並列に実行可能なので、並列に実行されて、機械語的には、プロセッサがよきにはからって、プログラマにその挙動が観測されるのである。この内部的なレジスタをよきにはからって実行することを register renamingなどと呼ぶ 。
Aレジスタがいくつの内部的なレジスタに対応するかはIntelのマニュアルには一切記されていない。昔のプロセッサにはregister renaming なんてものはなくて実直に一個一個実行していたのであるが、昨今のプロセッサでは性能向上のために山のように内部レジスタあるので、ループをアンローリングして、山のようにmov命令を繰り返すとそれに比例してスループットが上がるのが観測される。
例えば下記はarch/i386/lib/usercopy.c の __copy_user_zeroing_intel_nocache ( ) からの抜粋である 。EAXレジスタとEDXレジスタにfrom , from+4、の内容をコピーし、それto , to+4へコピーしている。（つまりfromで示されるアドレスの内容をtoで示されるアドレスへひたすらコピーしている）
EAXレジスタとEDXレジスタへの移動が並列に実行できるのはよいとして、from , from +8 , from +16 , from + 24 , from +32 , from +40 , from +48 , from+56へのコピーも機械語的にはEAXレジスタという同じレジスタを利用しているにもかかわらず、OOOで同時並列でμOP的には実行されるのである。

このとき、いつキャッシュミスが発生し（それはμOPの実行を数百命令浪費する）、いつキャッシュヒットするかはプロセッサの状態によるので、後ろの命令が先の命令を追い越して先に実行するというのは通常に発生している。上の命令列のどれが最初に終了するかは、誰もわからないのである。（すげーな、これは）
こんなことは通常のプログラマのうかがい知れないところで実行されているのである。しかも誰もそんなことは教えてくれない。わたしも知らなかった。こーゆー実行の挙動は外部から、観測するしかないのである。
μOPがどのくらい同時実行されているかは各プロセッサ（Xeonとか）の実装に依存する。モデル番号とか怪しげな番号ごとに微妙に実装を変更しているようで、実装の違いはステッピングというさらに細かい単位で観測されるようである。Intelの中の人の情報によれば〜1000μOPを超えるらしいが定かではない。
OOO とregister renamingだけでも、機械語とμOPの挙動の差はあるのに、ジャンプ命令なんかは、その先の命令も投機的に実行しちゃうので、もうわけがわからないというのが実態である。投機的実行というのは、条件分岐のどっちかを実行するだろうとプロセッサが予測して、条件が真であるか偽であるか分からない状態で、どっちかに決めうちをして、あらかじめ実行してしまうのである。決めうちが成功すれば、既に実行しているので性能が向上してしまう。どう決めうちするかは、以前ジャンプした方へジャンプするだろうとか、結構アバウトな予測でも意外とうまくいったりするのである。
機械語の実行というのは、機械語をメモリから取り出し（これをフェッチという）、解釈し（デコードという）、実行し、PC（プログラムカウンタ）を一つ増やし、それを繰り返す、ということになる。ジャンプ命令の実行というのはPCを直接変更することに他ならない。ジャンプの場合、機械語をメモリから取り出すというのがあらかじめできなくなるので性能を出すために、どれだけ命令をプリフェッチできるかにかかっている。
ジャンプというのは数命令に一回程度発生し、命令のフェッチをパイプラインするためにできるだけジャンプ命令がないほうが性能向上に役立つのであるが(loop unrolling ) 、投機的実行はジャンプ命令があってもおかまいなしにがんがん行っちゃうという方法なのである。
ちなみに命令をデコードしてμOPに変更するのは、コストがかかるので、一度変更されたものはTC（トレースキャッシュ）と呼ばれる命令キャッシュに格納され、2度目以降はTCからμOPを直接実行する。そしてデコードされていない命令の実行は命令キャッシュミスを発生させて実行コストが非常に高くてうれしくない。閑話休題。
というようなことで昨今のプロセッサではメモリのコピーと言う非常に単純な操作ですら、外部からは命令の実行順を保障した形では観測できないのである。
シングルプロセッサでは、そーゆめんどうな事は、通常は観測できない。しかし、マルチコアになると、あるコアで書き込んだものを別のコアで利用するなんていうことが日常茶飯事で発生するのであるが、それについては別途なにがしかの方法が必要になってくるのである。
性能向上のためのバイナリハックのネタ満載の今日この頃である。
「 メモリアクセスは遅い 」http://blog.miraclelinux.com/yume/2007/09/post_b3bc.htmlというユメのチカラも参考にしてほしい。キャッシュのお話である。

Everybody seems to know that airplanes and storms are a bad mix .
At least for the airplane anyway , the storm will be just fine either way .
A common concern is that the airplane might be “ hit by lightning ” .
This kind of makes sense because the airplane is flying and the lightning is flying all around .
It just seems like the two could run into each other with terribly negative result .
It just does n’t happen that way at all .
There is a phenomenon we call a “ lightning strike ” for lack of a better aviation terminology .
An airplane can build up an incredible electrical charge when flying through dry snow , dust or near a thunderstorm .
This is similar to walking across carpet on a dry day .
The same if the carpet was at thirty nine thousand feet and you were walking at about five hundred miles per hour .
You may have noticed little pointy things hanging off of the back of the wings and tail of an airplane .
These are “ Static Discharge Wicks ” , and are intended to dissipate the static potential in a controlled and non-impressive manner .
Sometimes when the static potential is excessive an electrical field becomes evident by the discharge of electrons .
These little guys get kicked around and knock some photons loose .
This causes Saint Elmo ’s fire , which at night looks like the blue sparky animation R2 - D2 had all around him when the sand people zapped him .
Below is an unretouched picture I took of Saint Elmo in action .
This is looking out the front window , you can see part of the wiper on the left .
St. Elmo ’s fire will dance around on the windshield and engine intakes .
The stuff does n’t really hurt anything but it does make radio communications difficult .
Sometimes passengers can see it stream off of various parts of the wings , tail , and antennae .
Saint Elmo is the Patron Saint of sailors , the “ fire ” was first noticed at sea and must have scared the absolute beegeezez out of the guys in masted ships on stormy nights .
That , of course , assumes they could be scared any worse that they already were in a storm at sea in a wooden boat .
If the static potential is kicked up a notch in intensity things start to get a bit interesting .
Not dangerous , but weird .
This is about the point where pilots stop playing with the windshield wipers to make Saint Elmo dance around , and turn the instrument lighting all the way up .
A cone shaped aura will project forward , ahead of the airplane .
Usually the cone thing will go away quietly but once in a while you might notice a tiny little “ stringer ” of static discharge going off in one direction .
This is a great time to squint your eyes since just about instantly a flash as bright as an arc welder is accompanied by a really loud clap of thunder .
Hearing thunder in a jet going about 80 percent of the speed of sound is impressive .
Most passengers whoop or scream .
So , to me at least , it has always seemed that the airplane is providing the potential for a static discharge , creating an ionized path through the air .
The “ lightning ” follows this ionized path right back to …. the airplane .
Good news for us , “ the occupants ” is that an airplane provides a nice protective bubble in the dynamic of the electrical field .
Airframe components are grounded together , sensitive equipment is shielded , and the aluminum skin provides very good conductivity and helps route the massive electrical discharge safely .
Airliner damage during one of these events is generally limited to little holes burned through the skin here and there , radio damage , and some odd system behaviours .
A “ lightning strike ” event requires a maintenance inspection so a delay should be expected if you are n’t finished for the day .

Corporate information - technology workers are mad .
Laws governing how employees use technology have gotten increasingly strict , as lawmakers try to keep companies from spilling private information about their employees and customers .
Meanwhile , employees themselves have become increasingly creative at finding ways to break the IT rules -- and that is putting IT departments in a bind .
Many office workers are circumventing their IT departments by bringing nonapproved technology into the workplace , sending giant files using Web - based services , sneaking forbidden software onto their personal computers , accessing work email on their handheld devices and so on .
( The Wall Street Journal recently detailed some of these workarounds in a story titled " Ten Things Your IT Department Wo n't Tell You , " which generated many angry responses from IT workers . )
" The typical user treats their computer at work like their computer at home , " said Robert Lamm , president of computer - services company Lamm Technical Resources LLC in Sedalia , Mo . " The difference is that when the computer at work encounters a service issue like a virus , malware infection or running out of disk space , the company -- not the user -- pays for the repair . "
In the end , IT workers said they get blamed both by employees who feel too restricted and by company executives who , when things go wrong , fume that policies must not have been restrictive enough .
In his most detailed comments on the Iraq war , Mayor Bloomberg last night suggested the United States was in the same difficult position as the British in the Revolutionary War – facing a determined band of insurgents .
Bloomberg said the comparison occurred to him when he visited his mother recently and was driving through Lexington , Mass. , where a scrubby group of farmers rose up against a well - trained militia more than 200 years ago .
“ We ’re the British , ” the mayor said during an interview with Tom Brokaw at Cooper Union , part of a series featuring potential presidential contenders hosted by former Gov. Mario Cuomo .
“ I ’m not suggesting the motives are the same .
But I ’m just pointing out that this was an insurgent kind of attack on trained , disciplined , uniformed soldiers who fought in a rigorously planned way .
And we ’re trying to adjust to that . ”
Bloomberg called on the press to demand more detailed answers from the presidential candidates on a wide range of issues , including Iraq .
But he readily admitted , “ I do n’t know the solution more than anyone else . ”
Surprisingly , only about three - quarters of the 900 - seat Great Hall was filled as the mayor spent 45 minutes discussing the war , education and health care .
Those hoping for a hint of Bloomberg ’s presidential plans left disappointed .
The mayor deflected a direct question from Brokaw about whether he was “ absolutely ruling out ” a White House run by veering into harmless sports talk , saying his priority right now is a Yankee - Met showdown in the World Series .
“ The door has not been closed , ” Brokaw immediately pointed out .
As he has before , Bloomberg maintained that the United States is in “ big trouble and said , “ Somebody ’s got to pull it out . ”
He did n’t specify who that somebody should be .
“ There is an arrogance and willingness to go it alone that quite understandably I think does n’t play well around the world , ” he added in one of his most striking attacks on the Bush administration .
One seasoned observer , former Rep. Herman Badillo , said he remained skeptical about Bloomberg ’s presidential chances .
“ Just because Abraham Lincoln spoke here and that propelled his presidency does n’t mean history is going to repeat itself , ” said Badillo , who lost the GOP mayoral primary to Bloomberg in 2001 .

Plucking Low - Hanging Fruit
Neocon officials in the Defense Department call them “ low - hanging fruit ” — as though countries were produce ripe for picking and eating .
The term refers to nations targeted for regime change that might be achieved with minimal strain , at least when compared with the effort needed to topple the regime in Iran .
Some neocons are beginning to concede that the effort might not be feasible at this time ( not that they would be climbing the tree and plucking the fruit ; they ’d stand below advising on how it should be done ) .
They ’re advocating instead that the Bush administration move soon against Syria .
From late 2003 to late 2005 it looked to me as though Syria would be the next “ Terror War ” target , largely because of Bush ’s rhetoric , Israeli aggression against Syria and the Israeli propaganda campaign against Syria ( suggesting that the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq had been transported over the border into the Arab state ) .
But then the Israeli government and Lobby urged the Bush administration to focus its energies on attacking Iran .
( Asked by the administration for suggestions for a new leader in Syria to be installed after the toppling of Bashar al - Assad , the Israelis said they could n’t think of one .
This position has been repeated as recently as March 2007 . )
In any case the Israeli government sees Iran as the “ existential threat ” to itself , Syria more of an irritation .
But the advocated Iran attack has been long - delayed .
The neocons have lost some influence , although they remain highly dangerous and influential .
Rapid Islamophobes like Elliott Abrams , David Wurmser , Eric Edelman and Eliot Cohen retain their posts , while neocon ideologues such as Bill Kristol enjoy access to cable TV audiences and readers of op - ed pieces in the most widely - read newspapers .
The latter very often articulate the view of Vice President Cheney ’s circle .
Cheney is known to be frustrated at the postponement of the planned Iran attack .
In this context , former Bush speechwriter and Christian rightist Michael Gerson published an op-ed in the Washington Post last Friday calling for an attack on Syria to stop its alleged support for the resistance in Iraq .
He revives the horticultural metaphor .
“ Syria . … is what one former administration official calls ‘ lower - hanging fruit , ’ ” Gerson writes , adding “ Syria ’s Baathist regime provides a base of operations for its Iraqi Baathist comrades involved in the Sunni insurgency . ”
He immediately adds , “ Suicide bombers from Saudi Arabia and North Africa arrive by plane in Damascus , and , with the help of facilitators , some 50 to 80 cross into Iraq each month .
The Syrians say they lack the ability to stop them ; what they lack is the intention . ”
He calls for “ forceful action against Syria ’s Ho Chi Minh Trail of terrorists . ”
Absent here is any indication of a mature understanding of the complexity of the Arab world .
We ’re to believe that Syrian Baathists ( secularists ) are helping their “ Iraqi Baathist comrades ” by facilitating anti-Baathist , Islamist Saudis and North Africans ’ passage into Iraq ?
It does n’t make sense .
Those jihadis , the Los Angeles Times reported last month , include 45 % Saudis ; 15 % are either Syrian or Lebanese , 10 % North African , 30 % other .
U.S. generals on the ground have repeatedly acknowledged that these fighters are a tiny fraction of the forces resisting the U.S. occupation .
The Saudis are responsible for the bulk of suicide bombings , and through their actions acquire a disproportionate ability to affect the overall political and military situation , but they have become increasingly shunned by the mainstream Iraqi resistance .
They certainly feel little camaraderie with Baathists of any nationality !
The Syrian government has repeatedly stated that it is trying to prevent the passage of jihadis over its long border with Iraq into the U.S. occupied country .
It ( like Iran ) enjoys cordial relations with the Iraqi regime brought to power by the U.S.
The idea that it would help create a “ trail of terrorists ” at a time that it ’s in the Bush administration ’s crosshairs , accused of responsibility for the Hariri assassination and support for Palestinian and Lebanese “ terrorism , ” is inherently implausible , and the suggestion that the existence of such a trail is a product of Syrian and Iraqi Baathist cooperation is laughable given the composition of the “ insurgency . ”
The Syrian government , concerned about its own survival , has indeed been seeking negotiations with the U.S. to resolve differences between the countries .
The Ho Chi Minh Trail analogy is stupid .
That Trail was a well - coordinated logistical system that brought fighters and supplies from one part of Vietnam to another part of Vietnam through Laotian and Cambodian territory controlled by Marxist allies .
The Syrian “ Ho Chi Minh Trail ” to which Gerson alludes is the supply line from the Euphrates ( Iraqi ) border town of al - Qaim to Baghdad , through which foreign fighters interested in joining the jihad against the U.S. invaders often pass .
It is not the production of a state in alliance with a movement seeking national reunification .
It ’s a route for the movement of international Islamist fighters produced by the power vacuum created by an invasion .
But why should facts matter to Michael Gerson ?
As Bush ’s chief speechwriter from 2001 to June 2006 , he may have come up with the “ axis of evil ” phrase ( although some attribute this to David Frum ) .
As a member of the White House Iraq Group , tasked to disseminate frightening disinformation about Iraq preparatory to the attack on Iraq in March 2003 , he proposed the “ smoking gun turns into a mushroom cloud ” metaphor used by Bush , Cheney and Rice in late 2002 to frighten the nation into war .
He was selected as on of the top 25 Christian evangelicals in America by Time magazine in 2005 .
His is a faith - based notion of geopolitical reality .
Many evangelical activists look forward to the violent transform the Greater Middle East , that biblical prophecy might be fulfilled and Jesus come back soon .
According to the Book of Revelation , there must be a great war surrounding Israel before that happens , involving kings to the east of the Tigris and Euphrates .
That implies war with Persia ( Iran ) .
So some want the U.S. to provoke war with Iran .
But if that ’s not doable just now , why not attack evil Syria ?
I find Gerson ’s orchard imagery interestingly biblical .
Expanding on it , I ’d suggest he wants to pluck the most succulent fruit : the Iranian peach .
But if that fruit is out of reach , he urges , let us snatch up the Syrian date !
( But dates are actually higher up than peaches so it might not be so easy .
Date harvest , by the way , is typically in October . )
I personally see the Devil at work here .
I hear the snake telling innocent Eve : “ Eat of the fruit ! ” Recall how in the myth that bold little bite led to absolute disaster .
SC Dems nix Colbert bid Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Updated : Colbert denied spot on presidential primary ballot South Carolina Democratic officials apparently are n't big Comedy Central fans .
The state party decided Thursday to deny comedian Stephen Colbert a place on its presidential primary ballot , CNN reported .
Colbert filed the necessary paperwork and paid a $ 2,500 fee to get on the ballot , but the state party had final say over whether his name could appear , according to the Associated Press Democratic officials discussed the relative viability and seriousness of all nine candidates who have filed , and apparently decided Colbert did not meet the necessary threshold .
" This vote is very important .
They have a critical job to do to keep this primary in shape , " Joe Werner , the party 's executive director , told The State newspaper .
The host of The Colbert Report told his audience on Wednesday that he had officially filed for the Democratic race .
Colbert then uncharacteristically broke character for a moment in announcing -- to loud applause -- that " I am not willing to write a $ 35,000 check to the Republican Party .
... I understand you have to keep a club exclusive but I paid less for my black - market liver . "
However , Colbert 's deeper concern was with defining just what his fellow - candidates see as the job description when they say they want to be president .
" By that , do they mean the chief executive as defined by the Constitution ? " he asked .
" Or are we talking about George Bush 's job ? ...
Bush has got a job with some balls .
A job where you can tell the Congress and the US Supreme Court to open wide for a Texas teabagging . "
Possibly influenced by finding himself a candidate only on the Democratic side , Colbert then made it more apparent than usual that his sympathies are on the side of the Constitution and against anyone who would emulate George Bush .
He demonstrated that Mitt Romney is " clearly applying for the new job " with a clip of Romney stating , " I hear from time to time people say , ' Hey , wait a second .
We have civil liberties we have to worry about . '
But do n't forget , the most important civil liberty I expect from my government is my right to be kept alive . "
" That speech will play great in New Hampshire , what with their state motto , ' Live Free or Do Whatever It Takes So I Don't Die , ' " Colbert commented .
Colbert also noted with obvious approval that when the Constitution was written , " the theory was that if you had three equal branches of government , they'd be too busy fighting amongst themselves to oppress the people . "
But then -- moving for the moment back into his right - wing pundit persona -- he added that " while checks and balances are great in theory ... the Constitution is not a suicide pact .
In a time of extraordinary danger , executive power must be extraordinary . "
Finally , with his two personas converging in one brilliant summation , Colbert concluded by saying , " I would like to be the first candidate to make my position clear .
I am not running for president .
I am running for President Bush .
Why ?
Because I believe in freedom -- and I would be crazy to let anybody else have that kind of power over me . "

Think you 're smart ?
Take the FREE IQ Test now .
In short , Iraq is a huge profit center for Global Corporation , Inc. , and George Bush and Dick Cheney are the Senior Vice Presidents of the United States Government Division of that money - making concern .
An article in the current issue of Rolling Stone does the best job I have ever seen anywhere in laying out in nauseating detail the workings of this criminal money - laundering scheme that some people have called " the Iraq War . "
In it , Matt Taibbi descends into - quite literally - the fecal underbelly of the world of Iraq war profiteering .
Giving example after infuriating example , Taibbi relentlessly pushes the needle on his readers '
Outrage Meters harder and harder against the peg , until finally one cannot read anymore without leaping up from one 's chair and screaming out in sheer , visceral , well , outrage .
Operation Iraqi Freedom , it turns out , was never a war against Saddam ­Hussein 's Iraq .
It was an invasion of the federal budget , and no occupying force in history has ever been this efficient .
George W. Bush 's war in the Mesopotamian desert was an experiment of sorts , a crude first take at his vision of a fully privatized American government .
In Iraq the lines between essential government services and for - profit enterprises have been blurred to the point of absurdity -- to the point where wounded soldiers have to pay retail prices for fresh underwear , where modern - day chattel are imported from the Third World at slave wages to peel the potatoes we once assigned to grunts in KP , where private companies are guaranteed huge profits no matter how badly they fuck things up .
And just maybe , reviewing this appalling history of invoicing orgies and million - dollar boondoggles , it 's not so far - fetched to think that this is the way someone up there would like things run all over -- not just in Iraq but in Iowa , too , with the state police working for Corrections Corporation of America , and DHL with the contract to deliver every Christmas card .
And why not ?
What the Bush administration has created in Iraq is a sort of paradise of perverted capitalism , where revenues are forcibly extracted from the customer by the state , and obscene profits are handed out not by the market but by an unaccountable government bureauc­racy .
This is the triumphant culmination of two centuries of flawed white - people thinking , a preposterous mix of authoritarian socialism and laissez - faire profit­eering , with all the worst aspects of both ideologies rolled up into one pointless , supremely idiotic military adventure -- American men and women dying by the thousands , so that Karl Marx and Adam Smith can blow each other in a Middle Eastern glory hole .
Those two paragraphs are the best summary of the shame / clusterfuck / outrage / crime that is the " Iraq war " that I have ever read .
Taibbi writes of the incredible abuses of Halliburton / KBR , Parsons , Bechtel and Custer Battles .
Virtually all of his examples are familiar to diligent readers of DailyKos , with the possible exception of the unbelievable story of Russell Skoug , an Air Force vet who went to work for a contractor named Wolfpack , and was crippled in an IED explosion while convoying at night .
You 've just gotta read the article ; I cannot possibly do it justice here .
Suffice to say , I insisted my wife read it .
She could n't get all the way through it ; it was too much for her .
But she said , " Ca n't something be done about this ? "
I told her , short of impeachment , not really .
" So , is anyone doing something about impeachment ? "
I had no heart to tell her the answer to that question .
I like to believe that Taibbi 's article , if it were read by everyone in America , would bring the occupation of Iraq to an end in a hurry .
My guess is that it would make people 's blood boil to the point that American taxpayers and military families would be screaming for justice upon those responsible for such a travesty .
Please read it , and make sure as many people as you can , read it as well .
Better yet , show Rolling Stone some love , and go out and buy a hard copy or three at the newsstand , and leave them around where others can read them .
Of course , even if all of this mind - boggling malfeasance ever gets the public airing it deserves , even that revelation itself will serve the agenda of the Grover Norquistian rightwingers :
It will utterly undermine faith in government :
According to the most reliable ­estimates , we have doled out more than $ 500 billion for the war , as well as $ 44 billion for the Iraqi reconstruction effort .
And what did America 's contractors give us for that money ?
They built big steaming shit piles , set brand - new trucks on fire , drove back and forth across the desert for no reason at all and dumped bags of nails in ditches .
For the most part , nobody at home cared , because war on some level is always a waste .
But what happened in Iraq went beyond inefficiency , beyond fraud even .
This was about the business of government being corrupted by the profit motive to such an extraordinary degree that now we all have to wonder how we will ever be able to depend on the state to do its job in the future .
Perfect .
" Mission Accomplished , " indeed .
Page six is reporting that Gisele Bundchen and Victoria ’s Secret are parting ways after contract negotiations broke down .
A source for page six has been quoted as saying :
“ Victoria ’s Secret does n’t care .
They have five new hotter , younger girls debuting next year . ”
Though not one of the originals , Gisele has been with Victoria ’s Secret long enough to be considered the main face of the lingerie label , so who will replace her ?
Fashionista.com suggests the Brazilian Caroline Trentini or Canadian Heather Marks , who both appeared in Victoria ’s Secret last seasons runway show .
Despite not being blonde we ’d also like to put forward Australian model Miranda Kerr ( who is at Rosemount Australian Fashion Week this week ) as a contender , or maybe Victoria ’s secret will come completely out of left field with one of the girls from US Vogue 2007 May cover .
No matter who is chosen Gisele ’s shoes will be hard to fill .
Sen. Bernie Sanders : ' Bush clearly does not understand the Constitution ' RAW STORY
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) stood up to voice his concerns over Judge and then - nominee for Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Thursday .
Sanders found himself " deeply disturbed " by Mukasey 's answers on the interrogation technique " waterboarding , " not giving a direct answer on whether or not he considered the practice a form of torture .
Sanders insists that we need an Attorney General that can match the consensus among the American public and the rest of the world on what waterboarding really is , concurrent with the Geneva Convention .
" For the last six years , " says Sanders , " it is clear that we have had a president that does not understand what the Constitution of the United States is about .
What this president believes , essentially , is that he can do anything he wants , at any time , against anybody , in the name of fighting terrorism .
And he happens to believe that the " war on terrorism " is unending ; it 's going to go on indefinitely .
And I think it is very important that we have an Attorney General who can explain the Constitution to a President who clearly does not understand it .
Unfortunately , Mr. Mukasey is not that person . "
Adds Sanders ,
" We have the right to demand an Attorney General who supports strongly the Constitution and is prepared to tell the President of the United States when he is acting against the Constitution . "
In addition to waterboarding , Sanders points to constitutional violations under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , including data mining , warrantless wiretapping , politically motivated pogroms within the Office of the U.S. Attorney , suspension of habeas corpus , and the indefinite detention of " enemy combatants " at Guantanamo Bay .
" The time is long overdue , " says Sanders , " for [ Congress ] begin to stand up and explain to this president , who thinks that he can veto virtually every piece of legislation we send him ; that ignores the Constitution of this country -- I think it is time that we begin to stand up . "
The following video is from C - SPAN 's Senate debate on Mukasey nomination , broadcast on November 8 , 2007 :
One night last summer she noticed on Loopt that friends she was meeting for dinner were 40 miles away , and would be late .
Instead of waiting , Ms. Fong arranged her schedule to arrive when they did .
“ People do n’t have to ask ‘ Where are you ? ’ she said .
Image A phone with Buddy Beacon , a tracking service offered by Helio , a mobile phone service provider .
Ms. Fong can control whom she shares the service with , and if at any point she wants privacy , Ms. Fong can block access .
Some people are not invited to join  like her mother .
“ I do n’t know if I ’d want my mom knowing where I was all the time , ” she said .
Some situations are not so clear - cut .
What if a spouse wants some time alone and turns off the service ?
Why on earth , their better half may ask , are they doing that ?
What if a boss asks an employee to use the service ?
So far , the market for social - mapping is nascent  users number in the hundreds of thousands , industry experts estimate .
But almost 55 percent of all mobile phones sold today in the United States have the technology that makes such friend - and - family - tracking services possible , according to Current Analysis , which follows trends in technology .
So far , it is most popular , industry executives say , among the college set .
But others have found different uses .
Mr. Altman said one customer bought it to keep track of a parent with Alzheimer ’s .
Helio , a mobile phone service provider that offers Buddy Beacon , said some small - business owners use it to track employees .
Kucinich not stopping with Cheney , plans Bush impeachment resolution too Jason Rhyne

This ( Update at bottom : GOP blocks Dem - led motion to kill impeachment resolution ; measure sent to House Judiciary ) Presidential hopeful Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , who brought an impeachment resolution against Vice President Dick Cheney to the House floor on Tuesday , says he is also planning a similar resolution to impeach President Bush .
The news came during a conference call Kucinich held with supporters Monday evening , although technical problems kept most on the call from being able to hear the congressman .
But activist David Swanson , who spoke directly with Kucinich during the call , summarized the contents of his conversation in an email : " He is going to introduce a privileged resolution on the floor of the U.S. House Tuesday morning to force a vote on his resolution to impeach Cheney , " confirmed Swamson .
" While that bill includes offenses related to Iraq and Iran , Kucinich plans to focus his remarks on Iran and the fact that the current Pentagon bill includes funding to retrofit bombers to carry 15 - ton bombs . "
Concerning the possible resolution against Bush , Swanson said Kucinich " wanted to let everyone know that he will not only continue pushing for the impeachment of Cheney but will also take up the impeachment of Bush with a new resolution . "
It 's unclear as to when such a resolution would brought to the floor , or how dependent its introduction would be on the success of today 's move against Cheney .
The former Cleveland mayor will hold a press conference today at 3:00 p.m. Swanson added that Kucinich was prepared for a debate on the substance of the charges against Cheney , but also mentioned the measure could be tabled -- a move that effectively kills a pending matter by ending debate -- or sent to committee .
If the latter option happens , the committee in question will be the House Judiciary .
The Kucinich campaign 's website states that the technical problems with the conference call were because " public interest in the issue exceeded technological capacity . "
The call will be rescheduled .
Kucinich's " privileged resolution " on the Cheney matter is a maneuver which will require a vote from all House members -- and allows him to act in spite of protestations from Democratic leaders , who do n't want a vote to come to the floor , according to Politico 's Ryan Grim .
According to The Hill newspaper , Kucinich 's idea -- which would put legislators on the record about Cheney 's impeachment -- is making some Democrats uneasy .
" If he pulls it off , it could make for an uncomfortable situation for Democratic leaders and centrist Democrats , " The Hill 's Mike Soraghan writes of Kucinich 's plan .
" Liberal activists are pushing for impeachment , while leaders worry such a move could turn off independent voters .
They have made it clear that impeachment of Cheney or President Bush is off the table . "
Democrats might be tempted to opt to send the resolution to committee , according to Soraghan , who says that such a move " avoids an immediate floor vote and might be the most appealing option to the Democratic leadership . "
Despite its apparent unpopularity among Democratic legislators , the Kucinich proposal is not necessarily out of line with American public opinion : a July poll from American Research Group found that 54 % of those surveyed favored the " US House of Representatives beginning impeachment proceedings against Vice President Dick Cheney . "
 Congress must hold the Vice President accountable , " Kucinich said in a statement last week .
" The American people need to let Members of Congress know how they feel about this .
The Vice President continues to use his office to advocate for a continued occupation of Iraq and prod our nation into a belligerent stance against Iran .
If the Vice President is successful , his actions will ensure decades of disastrous consequences .
House Republicans vote against Democratic - led move to table Cheney impeachment measure ; resolution sent to House Judiciary
In an unexpected move , House Republicans on Tuesday voted against a measure to kill an impeachment resolution introduced against Vice President Dick Cheney by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
A motion to table , which would have ended debate on the resolution , had been brought by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) soon after Rep.
Kucinich took to the floor to read from his proposed articles of impeachment .
" Impeachment is not on the agenda , " Rep . Hoyer had told Fox News earlier on Tuesday .
" We have some major priorities .
We need to focus on those . "
Although the roll call vote had initially appeared to favor Hoyer 's motion , Republicans -- who had at first voted in with the majority leader -- later began to switch their votes .
That decision is being widely interpreted as an attempt to embarrass the Democratic leadership , which is not keen on seeing further action on the impeachment resolution .
 I am surprised that Republicans would treat an issue as important as the potential impeachment of a vice president of the United States as a petty political game ,  Hoyer said in a statement .
" Republicans gleefully said they wanted the debate to show the public how many Democrats would actually support impeaching Cheney , which they consider a move supported only by a fringe element of anti-war activists , " reports the Washinton Post .
According to The Hill newspaper , Republican sources credit Congressman John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) with the idea of trying to keep the debate afloat .
The final vote count on the measure was 251-162 .
Following the failure of his motion , Rep .
Hoyer immediately moved to have the resolution sent to the House Judiciary Committee , which the House eventually approved in a 218 - 194 vote along strict party lines .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) told Fox News on Monday that moving forward with impeachment was not in the best interests of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
" If she were to let this thing out of the box , " said Conyers , " considering the number of legislative issues we have pending ... it could create a split that could effect our productivity for the rest of the Congress . "
The Baltimore Sun 's blog , The Swamp , describes the resolution as now " buried in committee . "
But a spokeswoman for the House Judiciary did not rule out the committee 's consideration of the measure .
" We were surprised that the minority was so ready to move forward with consideration of a matter of such complexity as impeaching the Vice President , " she said .
" The Chairman will discuss today 's vote with the Committee members but it would seem evident that the committee staff should continue to consider , as a preliminary matter , the many abuses of this Administration , including the Vice President . "
Kucinich said in a press conference late Tuesday afternoon that he believed the measure may still have a life .
" I 've spoken to Mr. Conyers and I 'm quite confident that the ball is in good hands , " said Kucinich .
One of Rupert Murdoch 's leading pundits on the Fox News television channel , Bill O'Reilly , has become embroiled in the latest public row over the depiction of black people in the mainstream media .
O'Reilly , who describes himself as a populist and traditionalist , has been accused of " velvet racism " for comments on his radio show about the famous Harlem restaurant Sylvia's .
The remarks referred to a dinner the commentator had enjoyed there with the Rev Al Sharpton , the black preacher and political leader .
The dinner itself passed off uneventfully , by all accounts .
But when O'Reilly reminisced about the evening he portrayed it in a way that set alarm bells ringing across the blogosphere .
He started out by praising the staff and largely black clientele of the restaurant for being " very , very nice " and " tremendously respectful " .
Warming to his theme , he said : " I could n't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia 's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City .
I mean , it was exactly the same , even though it 's run by blacks . "
To compound matters , in a separate radio broadcast he referred to the dinner again .
" There was n't one person in Sylvia 's who was screaming , ' M - Fer , I want more iced tea . '
You know , it was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all - white suburb .
People were sitting there , and they were ordering and having fun .
And there was n't any kind of craziness at all . "
O'Reilly insists he was making positive points about the American melting pot - a common theme of his radio and television shows in which he frequently lambasts " race - based " activists such as Mr Sharpton .
But the tone of surprise in his voice , and the implication that he had previously assumed black restaurants to be less civilised than their white counterparts , has caused outrage .
As a black law professor , Anita Allen of Pennsylvania University , put it to ABC News : " He does n't realise dinner can be a civilised affair and we do use table napkins . "
The furore is the latest evidence that previously untouchable rightwing talkshow hosts are now vulnerable to scrutiny as a result of blogs .
The pundit 's comments were publicised by the liberal monitoring website Media Matters , which pointed to previous O'Reilly remarks including a 2005 broadcast in which he said many poor residents of New Orleans failed to evacuate the hurricane - stricken city because " they were drug - addicted " .
O'Reilly will be aware of the fate of his fellow rightwing controversialist Don Imus , who was sacked by CBS five months ago when he referred to a black women 's basketball team as " nappy - headed hos " .
Imus , who was also exposed by new media activists , has yet to be taken back on air .
The issue of how black people are represented by the media , as well as by themselves in terms of racial slurs by black rappers and comedians , reached Capitol Hill this week when a congressional committee opened a hearing entitled From Imus to Industry : the business of stereotypes and degrading images .
A senior Fox executive said the latest row was " nothing more than leftwing outlets stirring up false racism accusations for ratings " .
O'Reilly himself sought to dampen the row by claiming his words were taken out of context .
Paul Waldman of Media Matters fired back : " If Bill O'Reilly got caught robbing a bank he would say he was taken out of context . "
I 'm sure those of you who are n't in the cattle business do n't understand the issues here .
But to those of us who who 's living depends on the cattle market , selling cattle , raising the best beef possible ... this is frustrating .
As far as my family , we do n't eat at McDonald 's much ( Subway is our choice of fast food ) , but this will keep us from ever stopping there again , even for a drink .
The original message is from the Texas Cattle Feeders Association .
American cattle producers are very passionate about this .
McDonald 's claims that there is not enough beef in the USA to support their restaurants .
Well , we know that is not so .
Our opinion is they are looking to save money at our expense .
The sad thing of it is that the people of the USA are the ones who made McDonald 's successful in the first place , but we are not good enough to provide beef .
We personally are no longer eating at McDonald 's , which I am sure does not make an impact , but if we pass this around maybe there will be an impact felt .
Please pass it on .
Just to add a note , all Americans that sell cows at a livestock auction barn had to sign a paper stating that we do NOT EVER feed our cows any part of another cow .
South Americans are not required to do this as of yet .
McDonald 's has announced that they are going to start importing much of their beef from South America .
The problem is that South Americans are n't under the same regulations as American beef producers , and the regulations they have are loosely controlled .
They can spray numerous pesticides on their pastures that have been banned here at home because of residues found in the beef .
They can also use various hormones and growth regulators that we can't .
The American public needs to be aware of this problem and that they may be putting themselves at risk from now on by eating at good old McDonald's .
American ranchers raise the highest quality beef in the world and this is what Americans deserve to eat , not beef from countries where quality is loosely controlled .
Therefore , I am proposing a boycott of McDonald 's until they see the light .
I 'm sorry , but everything is not always about the bottom line , and when it comes to jeopardizing my family 's health , that is where I draw the line .
I am sending this note to about thirty people .
If each of you send it to at least ten more ( 30 x 10 = 300 ) ... and those 300 send it to at least ten more ( 300 x 10 = 3,000 ) ... and so on , by the time the message reaches the sixth generation of people , we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers .
I 'll bet you did n't think you and I had that much potential , did you ?
Acting together we can make a difference .
If this makes sense to you , please pass this message on .

A magazine photoshoot of singer Michael Jackson managed to conceal the harsh reality that the ageing singer 's looks are clearly fading .
But unretouched photos show a face ravaged by serial cosmetic surgery procedures , a jowly jawline , and heavily veined hands .
Earlier this week a photoshoot for US magazine Ebony showed Jackson looking smooth - faced , and whiter than ever , with a creamy , flawless complexion .
Scroll down for more ...
But pictures of the star , seen last night in Los Angeles at a dinner celebrating activist Jesse Jackson 's 66th birthday show the reality is somewhat different .
Jackson revealed his youthful visage is nothing but a carefully created , digitally enhanced image as he looked pale , drawn , and far from youthful on the red carpet .
Scroll down for more ...
The troubled singer unveiled a startlingly pale new look on the cover of Ebony magazine in a heavily airbrushed photograph .
And that paleness remains the only similarity between Jackson , and how he really looks without the artistry of the magazine retouchers .
Jacko , seen in a light - coloured suit on the cover of the magazine for black Americans , and his once curly afro hair is now bone straight , leaving no trace of the handsome youth who became a superstar along with his brothers in group The Jackson Five .
Scroll down for more ...
In another picture , he appears dressed in a top hat and tails , a nod to one of his dance idols , Fred Astaire .
Despite ongoing rumours that he has bleached his skin , Jackson has regularly insisted that his changing colour is not intentional .
He has maintained that his light skin was the result of vitiligo , a rare disease that discolours the face and body .
Jackson gave his first interview for ten years to the magazine to celebrate 25 years of his seminal Thriller album .
Chrysler to launch Chinese - made car in US next year
BLOOMBERG AND AFP
Chrysler Group will introduce a Chinese - made small car in the US next year that retails for about half the price of its cheapest model , as it seeks to win back market share from Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co .
The carmaker will begin selling Chery Automobile Co's A1 hatchback in the first quarter of next year , Chery president Yin Tongyao ( 尹同耀 ) said in Beijing yesterday .
The 1.3 - liter A1 is priced from 53,800 yuan ( US $ 7,100 ) in China .
Chrysler 's least expensive US model is the US $ 13,850 Dodge Caliber , according to Edmunds.com .
Yin did n't say how much the A1 would cost in the US .
Chrysler , set to be the first US automaker to import cars from China , also plans to close a plant at home after reporting a loss last year and slipping to fourth place in US sales .
Working with Chery will allow the company to add models able to compete with Toyota 's Yaris with less investment .
" This is the start of a very long relationship between Chrysler and Chery , " Chrysler Group president and chief executive Tom LaSorda said in a statement yesterday .
" Chery 's participation in this agreement and their focus on small and sub - compact cars will have a nearly immediate effect on Chrysler Group 's offerings in the small - vehicle segments , " LaSorda said .
" This strategic partnership is part of a new business model that is allowing us to introduce all - new products more quickly , with less capital spending , " he said .
Chrysler plans to sell current and future Chery models worldwide .
Chery may eventually build as many as 100,000 vehicles a year for Chrysler , Yin said at a signing ceremony yesterday , without providing a timeframe .
The capacity can also be expanded in future , he added .
The US automaker aims to begin selling Chery - made vehicles under its Dodge brand in Latin America and Eastern Europe by the end of the year , LaSorda said .
For years , we'd been setting our side - view mirrors so that they gave us a view of the back corner of our cars .
This is the way it 's been done for generations - from grandfather , to father , to us !
But we finally discovered something very interesting .
The back corner of the car never moves .
It always stays in the same exact place .
So there 's really no reason to keep an eye on it .
By moving the side mirrors farther out , you can line up all three of your mirrors so they have minimal overlap -- and you can see everything behind you and beside you .
Here 's how to do it .

VIEWPOINT
John Feeney
The growth in human population and rising consumption have exceeded the planet 's ability to support us , argues John Feeney .
In this week 's Green Room , he says it is time to ring the alarm bells and take radical action in order to avert unspeakable consequences .
We 're out of our league , influencing systems we do n't understand
Despite increasing climate change coverage , environmental writers remain reluctant to discuss the full scope and severity of the global dilemma we 've created .
Many fear sounding alarmist , but there is an alarm to sound and the time for reticence is over .
We 've outgrown the planet and need radical action to avert unspeakable consequences .
This - by a huge margin - has become humanity 's greatest challenge .
If we 've altered the climate , it should come as no surprise that we have damaged other natural systems .
From deforestation to collapsing fisheries , desertification , the global spread of chemical toxins , ocean dead zones , and the death of coral reefs , an array of interrelated declines is evidence of the breadth of our impact .
Add the depletion of finite resources such as oil and ground - water , and the whole of the challenge upon us emerges .
Barring decisive action , we are marching , heads down , toward global ecological collapse .
Web of life
We 're dismantling the web of life , the support system upon which all species depend .
We could have very well entered the " sixth mass extinction " ; the fifth having wiped out the dinosaurs .
Human activity is threatening the web of life , warns Mr Feeney
Analysts worry , for example , about the future of food production .
Climate change - induced drought and the depletion of oil and aquifers - resources on which farming and food distribution depend - could trigger famine on an unprecedented scale .
Billions could die .
At the very least , we risk our children inheriting a bleak world , empty of the richness of life we take for granted .
Alarmist ?
Yes , but realistically so .
The most worrisome aspect of this ecological decline is the convergence in time of so many serious problems .
Issues such as oil and aquifer depletion and climate change are set to reach crisis points within decades .
Biodiversity loss is equally problematic .
As a result of their ecological interdependence , the extinction of species can trigger cascade effects whereby impacts suddenly and unpredictably spread .
We 're out of our league , influencing systems we do n't understand .
One thing is certain : continued inaction or half - hearted efforts will be of no help - we 're at a turning point in human history
Any of these problems could disrupt society .
The possibility of them occurring together is enough to worry even the most optimistic among rational observers .
Some credible analyses conclude we 've postponed action too long to avoid massive upheaval and the best we can do now is to soften the blow .
Others hold out hope of averting catastrophe , though not without tough times ahead .
One thing is certain : continued inaction or half - hearted efforts will be of no help - we 're at a turning point in human history .
Though few seem willing to confront the facts , it 's no secret how we got here .
We simply went too far .
The growth which once measured our species ' success inevitably turned deadly .
Unceasing economic growth , increasing per capita resource consumption , and global population growth have teamed with our reliance on finite reserves of fossil energy to exceed the Earth 's absorptive and regenerative capacities .
Getting a grip
We are now in " overshoot " ; our numbers and levels of consumption having exceeded the Earth 's capacity to sustain us for the long - term .
Many regions are experiencing the strain of water shortages
And as we remain in overshoot , we further erode the Earth 's ability to support us .
Inevitably , our numbers will come down , whether voluntarily or through such natural means as famine or disease .
So what can get us out of this mess ?
First comes awareness .
Those in a position to inform must shed fears of alarmism and embrace the truth .
More specifically , we need ecological awareness .
For instance , we must " get " that we are just one among millions of interdependent species .
It 's imperative we reduce personal resource consumption .
The relocalisation movement promoted by those studying oil depletion is a powerful strategy in that regard .
We need a complete transition to clean , renewable energy .
It can't happen overnight , but reliance on non-renewable energy is , by definition , unsustainable .
But there is a caveat : abundant clean energy alone will not end our problems .
There remains population growth which increases consumption of resources other than energy .
The demand for more goods means we need more energy
We have to rethink the corporate economic growth imperative .
On a finite planet , the physical component of economic growth cannot continue forever .
In fact , it has gone too far already .
As a promising alternative , the field of ecological economics offers the " steady state economy " .
We must end world population growth , then reduce population size .
That means lowering population numbers in industrialised as well as developing nations .
Scientists point to the population - environment link .
But today 's environmentalists avoid the subject more than any other ecological truth .
Their motives range from the political to a misunderstanding of the issue .
Neither justifies hiding the truth because total resource use is the product of population size and per capita consumption .
We have no chance of solving our environmental predicament without reducing both factors in the equation .
Fortunately , expert consensus tells us we can address population humanely by solving the social problems that fuel it .
Implementing these actions will require us all to become activists , insisting our leaders base decisions not on corporate interests but on the health of the biosphere .
Let 's make the effort for today 's and tomorrow 's children .
John Feeney PhD is an environmental writer and activist in Boulder , Colorado , US .
His online project is growthmadness.org
The Green Room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website
Do you agree with John Feeney ?
Are the growing demands of an expanding population too much for the planet ?
Do we face unspeakable consequences if we fail to act now ?
Or will humans and the Earth find ways to cope when the need arises ?
As a species we have been defying population control for a long time .
Drugs and medical treatments cure the diseases that would normally limit us .
Technology allows us to provide for many more people than in the past .
And in the background there is this goal of populating the earth as much as possible .
There is a basic evil to the way the world has become and continues to develop , and how anyone cannot see it I do not know .
Aaron , Bloomington , IL
Not only is he correct I think he might be understanding the severity of the problem .
The crux of the problem lies in human nature , our tendency to use our rationality to justify our baser instincts .
Our baser instincts will rule in this situation as in all others : Consume until nothing remains .
Logic cannot prevail even in this life or death scenario .
We , and this entire biosphere , are are irrevocably doomed .

Amen and Amen , for years I have tried to explain to my head - in - the - sand friends that we are n't just trying to save the planet , we are ultimately trying to save ourselves .
It is critically important not to wait for governments to get behind it , it is the individuals .
Ride a bus , start a compost bin , buy used , buy less .
And while it is true , as rss of Cambridge said , that we waste amazing amounts in this country , population control is just as important as consumption control .
Otherwise we will find ourselves back here again in the very near future .
Katrina Hawley , St. Paul , Minnesota , USA
it 's about time somebody brought this grave issue to the fore .
seeing all these pictures of malnourished kids .
all 8 or 12 of them , their mothers looking haggard and depleted ...?
economic growth at what cost ?
more consumers to buy more unnecessary plastic junk like we so unfamously do here ?
I truly believe the tipping point is gone and some major global pandemic of other upheaval is in the offing .
howard nelson , portland , oregon USA
Gloomy thoughts indeed , but what I want to know is : what can I really , honestly do ?
There is so much information available that my head spins ... where do I start ?
How do I start ?
Why is there no definitive guide to help individuals ?
I suppose , once the individuals know what to do , they will help larger groups and then eventually corporations and government to ... well , what ?
Dvarkholm , Newport
I do agree , but try getting the politicians to get off their butt and do something to change anything that does n't involve money , power , or other types of personal gain .
The problem is that most politicians are dinosaurs who do n't expect to be around when the stuff really hits the fan , and therefore , will not have to see their children 's / grandchildren 's suffering .
Why should they care ?
Instead of being known for saving the world ( or at least attempting to do so ) , they 'd rather go down in the history books as the one who made the most money for his retirement nest egg , or the one who dragged out a stupid , senseless , retarded , war the longest .
The Earth is over populated , yes , but no one would dare tell people to stop having kids .
This is up to the individual to exercise some common sense and stop at one kid .
Or even two .
Not breed an army and think it 's cute .
Even if you can afford to have a large family , the time for such has passed .

It is good to know that I am not alone in my prognostications .
Sometimes I feel as if I have been shouting at deaf people .
As Ian Anderson once said , " My word 's been a whisper your deafness a shout " .
Predictably I see a nay sayer .
Peter Hood , Somewhere in the south of England .
I agree with John Feeney , and you don´t have to go too far to see the effects of over population and over consumption .
The fact is that the human being doesn´t want to stop destroying his environment , for he is moved by economic interests that have given him some momentaneous wealth and pleasure .
But in the near , very near future , this same environment will prove him and his descendants that this world is limited .

BOI -YOI -YOI -YOINNNNNGGGGGGG !!!
( Sound made when ones eyebrows arch and their eyes pop wide - open as the realization hits them of what the true meaning of the Charlton Hesston movie " Soya Green " really was )
L. Nichols , West Texas , USA
Anyone who thinks that continued popoulation growth at current rates is sustainable is clearly living on a different planet !
It is time that our politicians recognised the reality that is described here .
Green policies and control of increasing consumption will be quite futile whilst the overall population continues to grow .
The pressures on resources , particularly fuel and water will , I believe , be an even greater source of conflict as the century goes by than the current ' religion based ' ideological struggles .
Every biological empire will grow until it outstrips its resources , ( and then die back to a level of sustainability if it is lucky ! ) .
Humanity is the only species capable of influencing its own destiny , but to do that it has to open its collective mind to the issues raised here and control population growth .
Unfortunately it is probably 50 years too late .
We need to create societies with stable population numbers , and with good standards of living for all members .
A Utopian ideal perhaps , but when we fail the final result of outstripping the global resources will be a shrinking population .
Shrinking through starvation , thirst and conflict .
Not a pleasant prospect .
Russell Millner , Blackpool UK
John Feeney presents a very plausible analysis of the current state of our planet and the inherent consequences .
I am also heartened by the number of correspondents who agree with his thesis and appear willing to adapt to more sustainable lifestyles .
I am alarmed , however , by the minority of apparently ignorant and self - deluding reactionaries who still claim that the analysis is merely alarmist or just wrong .
What makes these reactionaries so sure of their own beliefs - or are they just too scared to face the facts ?
The present situation of the planet may be more than just the problem - but the start of ' nature ' finding a solution .
In addition to the direct effects of climate change ( more energetic and extreme weather - local variations on the themes of hot , dry , wet or windy ) the near future is likely to see the rapid spread of diseases ( carried by pesticide - resistant migrating insects etc ) and wars , as people fight over the remaining resources .
This denouement may no !
t happen instantly - it may take decades - but it would certainly look like ' instantaneous ' from some hypothetical future perspective .
Dr Peter Laity , Cambridge UK
For those , thankfully very few , doubting thomas's .
Try reading the United Nations Geo4 Report .
576 pages clearly stating that we are over utilising resources world wide .
We live in a consumer society , with more and more economies becoming consumer orientated .
You could say we are becoming consumer based planet .
In reality we are CONSUMING the planet .
For those that say nature is self correcting - I fully agree .
Just do not forget that Mother Nature is not selective .
Things will correct themselves over millennia , in the mean time humans will suffer greatly .
This needs to be on the Political agenda worldwide , and now .
Unless we curb population , set targets for 2050 , 2075 etc , we will have famine / global conflict etc .
What is more humane ?
Ignore it , and let billions die , and suffer greatly in the process .
Or retrict growth now .
Human rights complaints over population restrictions now should not stop discussion / action .
It is not our right to ignore issues and put billions at peril .
Mark Williams , UK
Indeed .
However , you only have to broach this subject to be decried as a racist , or whatever mud that it 's fashionable to sling this week .
Ade , Dudley , UK
I could n't agree more , most of the western world appears to be slowing in its population growth perhaps due to infertility or choice .
However , there are others who have opt or happen to have for other reasons large families , which is causing even more more over population , perhaps China has it right .
We are all living too long and too well , over eating , over consuming the earths resources .
Some of are not respecting this planet and most of these individuals seem to be the ones people like us are trying to protect the planet for .. the youngsters , the next generations as these are the people who will be directly affected by our actions or lack of .
I really hope we can get it together before we destroy this planet .
I would like to point out , that the earth goes through cycles and we are over due the next ice age .
The main Ozone layer in the stratosphere repairs itself
The main problem with ozone is that all the waste gases we release are trapped in the troposphere ( first atmosphere ) and this is causing the photochemical smog , breathing problems and acid rain we hear so much about .
As I said we need to respect our planet , its animals , plants and our own lives .
Tracey , Redditch
It distresses me that so many people agree with Feeney without looking critically at what he is saying .
Environmental degradation has more to do with government and corporate priorities than over population .
Distribution is the greatest challenge - not population .
Industrialized nations use around 70 % of the worlds energy even though they only make up roughly 25 % of the world population .
As for his argument that population growth increases consumption of other resources , I agree .
However , these resources already exist and are quite productive ( I'm thinking export oriented commercial agriculture ) .
We will ' face unspeakable consequences ' ONLY if we do not find an equitable way to allocate them .
Hannah Doherty , South Hadley USA
It 's so easy to point the finger at population growth ( how very Malthusian , which has been thoroughly discredited by scholars ! ) , especially since it involves a subtle blaming of the Third World where the population growth is the fastest .
What about the hyper - consumption and over - wastages in the First World ??
It 's about mal - distribution of resources , and unsustainable lives of a few , not the starving masses globally !
Please stop trying to revive the ghost of Malthus , again .
Farhana Sultana , London , U.K .
The veil is being lifted from the face of humanity .
I do not wish it to be a black veil .
As a trained ecologist it is painful to watch the demise of organic systems that we barely have come to understand in the simplest of ways .
Yes , cascades are enviable given the alterations already underway .
We still have a chance to save some of what is part of who we are as sentient , highly evolved , hominids .
We need to exercise all the wonderful " higher " brain function that has taken in excess of 10 million years of evolution to develop .
Thank you Dr. Feeney .
Mead , Olympia / Washington , USA
Human population growth and the mad consumption of this planet 's resources is directly responsible for the extinction of many species of animals and plant life and this extinction rate will grow exponentially until it will eventually cause our own demise .
Too many religious factions , totally against birth control , are hell bent on racing towards this armageddon that is , according to some religions , our eventual fate .
It is in our hands to prevent it .
W J Andrews , London England
I wholeheartedly agree !
The largest danger to this planet and all life on it comes from profligate human reproduction and consumption .
30 years ago I took the decision not to reproduce , and to consume as little as possible , as even then I could see the world was overpopulated .
I have tried , with varying degrees of success and failure , to persuade my peers to do likewise .
I hope those who did not heed my call now realise the consequences .
Ian Prior , Storrington , West Sussex
I totally agree .
John Fenney may well be stating the obvious but this is a taboo subject as far as politicians and reporters are concerned .
Evan Davis seems to think there is plenty of room for more and Mick Hume in the Times believes that people who talk about this sound like Daleks .
Rowan Williams , the Catholic Church and rss in Cambridge ( see above ) believe that it has nothing to do with population but with consumption .
There are plenty of people who are in denial so nothing will actually change .
The simple and undeniable fact is that the more people there are then the more people there are who be consuming .
There is absolutely no point in talking about reducing consumption unless that half of the equation is dealt with .
Until then we may as well as consume as much as we like as all our efforts to recycle , go green or reducing consumption will amount to absolutely nothing .
Jason Mead , Bristol
Population growth is the fundamental cause of all the world 's social , economic , political and environmental problems .
It seems that no - one is willing to address this most basic fact .
Brontus Horace , Truro UK
I agree that population growth has to be stopped and reduced .
We will have to deal with the ageing population when it happens , but it 's not like we can't do that , it will just take sacrifice .
We also seriously need to think about our " need " for the products we buy and how important they really are for our lives and happiness .
A start for governments would be to start looking at the economy on a per capita basis .
A declining economy is not a problem in a declining population ( as long as the reat of decline is proportional ) .
I would go a step further and say that " the economy " is not the most critical thing to us as a species anyway and should n't always be number one on politicians agenda .
S Bennet , London
Great , so you 've managed to dig out an article which you think supports your twisted ideas on a population cull ( " kill them all , they are just a drain on natural resources " ) .
Perhaps if you neocons simply stopped using your depleted uranium to bomb anyone you fancy , the environment would n't be in such bad shape .
Pete Cameron , london
I suggest banning use of cars for a year .
Public services only .
Or something less dramatic , get the other countries in the world interested .
One hand gives another hand takes , for every action people take , something will eventually change lets hope it's a good reaction .
I suggest banning selling useless food in UK and any Western country , or ban trade with the East , which economically would be destructive , but it would create jobs over here as we'd have to make our own clothes and metal .
At the very least kick the Chinese government in the backside and tell them that economic advance is only a good thing if you 're alive to enjoy it they clearly create huge amounts of pollution why can't the larger countries sort out the problems of the environment instead of relying on the West to aid them .
The article is right population is a major problem , ironic really the one survival technique that stayed humans through harsh times works against them , i wonder when the world will end .
who knows what to do , i suppose one extreme thing to do would be to annihilate as many people as possible in a nuclear apocalypse but that might increase levels of depression , perhaps a miracle would be a good idea if there really is a god now would be a good time for one
Peter , Dundee
Hopefully there is room here for a counter opinion and not just " me too " comments .
John 's concerns are the old Malthusian ones cast in a modern light .
Since the population has increased by many times since Malthus without his predicted catastrophe , why is a catastrophe more imminent now ?
What Malthus underestimated is our creative ability to find new ways to solve difficult problems .
Unless our ingenuity suddenly disappears we will continue to solve problems .
Malthus also was not aware of the demographic transition , which by itself leads to a plateau of population .
In many European countries TFR is already below replacement ratio ( excluding immigration ) .
The most likely scenario , especially now that we are alerted to the problems , is that we will find ways to solve the difficult problems of climate change , energy , water etc , without requiring draconian measures , or undergoing a catastrophe .
Bob Cousins , London , UK

The main problem is the pyramid selling version of economics that all governments espouse .
To keep that going they need new markets / population to sell to .
What we need is steady state or even reducing demand economics .
Either that or find another planet !

I just do n't think that capitalism will be able to deal with population decline .
Just imagine the world economy contracting , smaller markets and reducing stock markets .
Also everybodies beloved house prices going down because of gross oversupply .
Having said that i'd much rather this outcome than the mad scramble for resources and the survival of the fittest ( or the most populated ! ) that would ensue .
Adam Walker , Nice , France
This is pure hogwash .
What the world desperately needs is 5,000 coal fired power plants , and 1,000 big nuclear power plants .
I have engineered scores of both .
Mr. Feeney is ignorant of basic technical and economic laws .
It is a tragedy that responsible news organization print such claptrap .
His only valid point is that each of us should conserve .
R. L. Hails Sr. P. E. , Olney MD
i did not like the tone of karan 's response .
it is all very well to blame india and china to begin with and say they are adding to the pollution but just to let you know , in the whole of england , there isnt 1 single recycling plant that can recycle plastic bags and all the bags are shipped to india for recycling .
this was told to my by my local council if you please .
i cannot believe that a developed nation like the uk cannot even recycle its own rubbish .
the wastage here is phenomenal .
if you thro a bag of old food into a bin here , it will just sit and rot but the same bag of food in a dustbin in india will be eaten either by dogs or some really poor rag pickers .
nothing really goes to waste in india .
its educated people and developed nations which have to set a trend for others but thast is sadly not happening so dont blame other countries

It 's a simple problem with a simple solution .
There are far too many people on this planet and we 're asking for more than the planet can give .
Unfortunately , certain individuals and nations are obsessed with making money and do n't seem to care at all about the consequences of their selfish behaviour .
We should do what China have done and instigate a 1 or maybe 2 child policy for a couple of generations .
If we can bring the population down our problems will begin to ease .
Mark , London , UK
Surely this is all part of the natural evolution of planet earth .
When we have destroyed the planet 's capability to sustain our ' span ' , earth will enter a fallow period before the next life form emerges .
Why should we humans be so arrogant as to think that we have the earth for all time ?
alan slater , london , uk
Agree 100 % with this article .
The only thing it does n't say is just how far into overshoot we are .
The global economy is on the brink of collapse , because our economy is predicated on exponential growth of energy consumption , and our premium energy supply , oil , is already in global decline .
The only positive thing is , the sooner the collapse , the fewer people will eventually die prematurely ,
It will be brutal , but it will curtail CO2 and other pollution damage faster than any other way .
There will be more resources and biodiversity remaining for any future civilisation to build on towards a sustainable society .
Ralph Williams , Cambridge
I do n't know what depresses me most - the fact that this is true or the fact that this is the first mainstream article I 've read on it .
This points in this article are and have been so manifestly obviously true , yet ignored for so long now that I frankly beleive humanity deserves what it gets .
Basic GSCE biology covers the web of life , and straightforward concepts such as population growth and decline based on resource ( usually prey ) availability .
How is it that people think it does n't apply to us ?
Radical new technologies , or their unpleasant alternative ( population growth controls and legislation ) need to be rolled out NOW , not in ten year 's time if we hope to mitigate , let alone prevent , the effects of our species uncontrolled greed .
The third alternative is completely unattainable at the moment , to the point that its pretty much laughed at as an alternative , and that is to implement a diaspora to other worlds .
Our technology and society is in no way ready for that yet .
We therefore must control our population growth or get some new science - sharpish .
Jez Lawrence , leeds , uk
Absolutely I agree with John Feeney , it 's about time someone publicly stated that it 's overpopulation of the human species ( for we are animals as much as we'd like to think we 're above it ) that 's the root cause of our planet 's plight .
It amazes me that we 're willing to cull other creatures for environmental damage , but we can't stop popping out hungry and resource needy offspring ourselves .

going back to my euthanasia solution ; it sounds far out but if you put it to every parent that the only way to ensure the survival of their offspring and their family line was to take a pill at the age of 80 and end it all , the vast maority would sign up straight away .
richard jones , kent
the only feasible way of stopping a catastrophe in my mind is compulsorary euthanasia .
One could use an age ... say 80 ... as , let 's face it , the return on the earth 's resources used up by the aged is minimal ... but the better way would be after the birth of your first great grandchild or when your first grandchild reaches the age of 21 ; in the latter cases you would see less people having kids in their teens as it signs their death warrant and there is a chance that ' selfish ' humans would get bred out .
it'll never happen though , so we are doomed
richard jones , kent
I agree completely .
We cannot expect to have economic growth all the time .
To reduce the population we need to expect a downturn in economic growth .

rick moore , bandon , oregon
John is 100 % correct .
Here in the UK we have transplanted all our manufacturing industry out of the country to third world or growing ecconomies such that our carbon footprint looks far better than it actually is .
Add to this the deceit of carbon trading and it is clear to me at least that UK politics remains a slippery customer on the green issue .
Further , unless we address the over population issue not only in our own countries but right across the world we will very quickly come to the end of the road and it is the likes of the religious leaders who really need to step into the frame to decry anything other than safe sex rather than promoting life from the point of conception .
This goes not for just one particular race but all colours , creeds , races and religions .
Unfortunately Politicians bury their heads in the sand at the very thought of population control .
Dave T , Chatham UK
Excellent , its about time we had someone acknowledging the underlying problem with climate change .
Its never been about emissions , its always been about the amount of emissions and this has a direct link to the planets population .
The only problem I see with this article is that no politician will pick up this issue , to discuss limiting birth numbers in a ' free world ' is tantamount to political suicide .
Bill , Midlands
Whilst I do not profess to have all of the facts it's not hard to conclude that as our population has more than trebled in the last 80 years , a living persons current lifetime , we ( humans ) can be considered a plague of biblical proportions .
Whilst admirable in principal , reducing individual consumption by some small quanta is an irrelevance if we continue to multiply the number of consumers .
Education is key , I suggest .
If we can educate the population to control the population human kind may have a foreseeable future .
In the end , whatever we do , nature will take it 's course however .
The Sun will cool and engulf the Earth and life on Earth will end for all species .
If humans suffer mass or total extinction prior to this apocalyptic inevitability then nature will carry on down some other evololutionary branch without us and I doubt she could care less .
We can't expect any help from nature ; as my , and probably your , mother always said : ' you make your bed , you lie in it !'

I agree that we are facing many problems in the coming decades and century .
Many more problems than what we usually tend to think about .
Although John Feeney 's artical does seem to truthfully point out many of the problems that we as a species are facing and what would need to be done about the problem ;
He , like many others , has n't really mentioned how we actually implement real solutions to them .
Like how do we ' end world population growth ' or ' have a complete transition to clean renewable energy ' ?
I mean how do we really do that ?
Ask every one to stop reproducing ?
Pull energy out of thin air ?
Yes we need to identify the problems we are up against but then we need practical , implementable , ethical solutions .
Chris Burton , Newcastle
I have read many articles of this nature some more recent , some warning of the coming problems decades ago .
I am lucky ( or maybe unlucky ) enough to study the real issues every week on my Environmental science course .
We get real facts and real examples that relate the big issues with local effects .
I realise that something drastic needs to be done but , often feel like a little fish in a big ocean .
Part of process i have no control in changing .
Where do I go and how do I get there when others , particularly the big players seem to be pushing me in a direction i dont want to go .
I would like action , action and more action but not sure if anyone is listening .

As the number of people on the planet increases further , then human height can be reduced in inverse proportion , to 30 cms , 15 , 10 , even 5 , ad infinitum .
Obviously potential predators like cats and ferrets would need downsizing at the same time .
They say that there is a lower limit on brain size below which people are not so clever but that might not be a bad thing .
How is it that humans with their huge brains are an endangered species , yet seagulls with their smaller brain are not ?
Why is it that seagulls are already top dog in many Atlantic seaside towns .
For those attracted by the idea , further genetic research could turn us all into seagulls ...
No worries then about planes and their carbon , no need for body searches at airports ....
No problem about heating houses .
Yes , I know , seagulls do n't pay taxes so that would ruin government budgetary planning , and of course there 's the impact of a seagull population bubble on fish stocks ...
Well nothing is 100 percent pefect .
Anyway , downsizing may be the only piskey solution Making the planet bigger would be a logistical nightmare .
Getting everyone to volunteer for negative growth ( in the sense of consuming less ) shows no sign of working .
And reducing population numbers by drawing straws , euthanasia for the over 20s , bombing the **** out of other countries , etc. , is unfair , unjust , immoral and wrong and would create an uncontrollable backlash .
Downsizing people may be the only equitable option .
There are plenty of communities of Elves , Korrigans , fairies , spriggans , hobbits , etc where I understand it has been tried with success .

WWF 's Living Planet Report 2006 , shows that we are currently using planet Earth 's resources far faster than they can be renewed .
On current projections , this means that as a whole , humanity will need at least two planets ' worth of natural resources by 2050 .

To the foolish who think the planet cares about humans or feels pain from our actions .
This planet recycles its surface , continents move around , combine , and split .
New land is created at tectonic rifts and the process continues until the sun engulfs us all .
The earth 's long - term natural state may not even include life on the surface .
We are extremely fortunate not to have had the oceans boiled recently by cosmic collisions .
Raising surface temperatures by 20 degrees and reducing fresh water supplies by 30 % are worse case projections for us and those are small events when compared what the planet has done and can do to itself without our interference .
Unless we can move our orbit this planet will outlast all life on it .
Zane , Tennessee , USA
I fully agree .
Two main social problems : increasing population and their demands .
Kim Sour , Phnom Penh , Cambodia
I agree wholeheartedly that human overpopulation is the " elephant in the living room " of environmental concern .
Nobody likes to mention it , but solve it and many of the other environmental problems will simply go away .
However , this would precipitate a demographic crisis with an increasingly elderly human race , supported by a reducing number of young people .
The situation is beginning to emerge in Japan and will only get worse if the size of the human race is ever to reduce .
Ian , London , UK
I absolutely agree we all face ' the end of the world ' , if you like , with only few surviving , if at all .
Systemic global efforts by the best religious , scientific , political , business and grass - root forces are desperately needed to avert this situation .
For that , an international governance , higher in status and capacities than the United Nations , with a well - balanced strategy and adequate resources is needed .
Otherwise , each individual country will continue to pursue own interests and ambitions until the planet resources depletion becomes irrevocable .
It will then be too late to stand together in an effort to save ourselves from extinction .
It is ' a project ' we should launch and effectively manage now .
The overlapping steps might be , first , to get all aware , second , to rally , third , to get efficiently organized to meet this challenge , fourth , to develop and lead to a consistent implementation , being ready to sacrifice our present comfort and well - being , if required . !
Serguei Burundukov , St Petersburg , Russia
Yes , I agree with Feeney .
We are over consuming , over manufacturing , over packaging .. it seems that humans will only learn their lesson when we have an enviromental collaspe ..
Davd , Canada
I totally agree with Dr. Feeney .
Massive consumption , driven by economic growth , leads us blindly into a path of no return .
We must act individual and collectively to regain a proper perspective on our position as one species interdependent on all others .
If we regain our humanity enough to celebrate life for all our fellow inhabitants , we have a chance to stop the destruction .
Live simpler .
Give thanks to the plants and animals on whom you depend for sustenance .
Live more comfortably with less instead of endlessly driving for more .

Henry , London
I agree wholeheartedly but I cannot see a resolution whilst there are too many national and business interests to accept change .
What worries me , is that this planet has a habit of being able to purge itself when required - it just requires a tipping mechanism and we are creating that mechanism that could inevitably end in disaster for our species .
john sunderland , portsmouth
Yes , certainly i agree with the writer .
Looking at the unabated growth in the population of my country ... i could not agree more with him .
It is just too sad , that because of the teachings of the Roman Catholic religion ( majority here belong to this sect ) , the go forth and multiply and fill the earth instruction is still being followed .
Yes , up to the point that a lot of people already exist in sub-human conditions .
The educated certainly know what to do , how to live their lives better and even think about the future of the earth ... however , these are just a few ... a drop in the bucket , so to speak .
If only the govt officials lead the way ... but for now , they have other things they are pre-occupied with .

Any animal will breed and consume until it reaches equilibrium with the factors that tend to reduce it 's population - then it 's poulation will stabilise .
Our intelligence allows us to sidestep most of these factors - although as you imply this is not something that can continue indefintely .
We have already used some 300 - 400 billion tons carbon equivalent fossil fuels , we have some 5000 ( yes thousand ) billion tons carbon equivalent fossil fuels to go ( mainly coal ) .
That 's about 14 times as much to go .
So fossil fuel avaliability is not a limiting factor .
If we can carry on emitting a re-run of the Permian - Triassic extinction event seems within our grasp .
I had previously thought that Global Warming ( and the resultant climate change ) would not be a limiting factor on our CO2 emissions .
However after this year 's Arctic " collapse " and the pattern of reduction of ocean uptake of CO2 I am not so sure .
It could be much later than we think and the IPCC could be wrong - massively understating future impacts .
However despite such evidence the majority of people I know and work with still do n't have this issue " on their radar " , and seem committed to " Plan A " - carry on regardless .
It seems to me that we face the gravest test of our right to the term " sapiens " in our species designation " Homo Sapiens " .
It 's a test I think we will fail , I hope I am proven wrong .
Chris Reed , Blackpool UK .
There has to be a sea change in attitudes to man 's ever increasing population / demands on finite resources mainly water / fossil fuels / food .
How can progress be made to curb excesses when all economies are based on continuous growth ?
Our efforts should be directed at reducing population and consumption ; not increasing them ! will our benighted short sighted Goverment have the guts to propose susch measures or even discuss them ?
I doubt it ; think of the reduction in revenues !
k.a.brett , Hampstead London
Yes , yes and yes .
Categorically .
We now have a heard of elephants sitting in the middle of the room .
Cognitive dissonance reigns .
We have engineered this situation with astonishing efficiency .
Imagine what we could do it we all actually tried to put it right ?
We might even manage it ...
Manda Brookman , Cornwall
John Feeney is entirely right .
Human population growth is the most siginificant factor contributing to all our environmental problems .
It seems impossible that any of the contributors to global warming , desertification , species extinction , and water shortages will be anything but dramatically increased with a projected doubling of the human population over the next 40 years .
As John notes , however , our numbers will come down .
The real question is whether it will be the result of an unprecedented correction that will cost billions of lives and follow an equally tragic loss of natural resources or whether it will be a consequence of some less - dramatic shift .
I 'm afraid I can't envision what a gentle route will be .
I 'd love to be convinced there is one .
I work in biodiversity science and I grew up immersed in the natural world .
The wild places and wild things that we took for granted will be gone when my children ( 2 boys ) are my age .
In it 's place will be a rather u!
npleasant scramble for what 's left that I fear will dwarf the human tragedies of the 20th century .
David Remsen , Copenhagen , Denmark
I agree with John , he has hit the nail on the head .
Many politicians are ignorant , do not do not want to acknowledge that population growth is fully out of control .
Certain politicians for demographic reasons , taxes , economic growth even want to raise the birth rate " help we need more children " but technological advances will not need excess " workers " .
What 's the fun in having an over - populated world , with its resource wars and hunger ?
Let 's colonize the seabed the Moon , Mars and eat algae !
Who can control population growth ?
Who can save mankind from itself ?
Antony Hewitt , Cologne Germany
Dear John Feeney ,
An amazing piece of article .
I usually read a lot of stuff on the net but I rarely write any comments , but this article really has made me write my thoughts .
The article is absolutely amazing and educative of the whole issue .
I really hope that people around the world understand the concerns that you pointed out .
But this is not what is happening .
An economist ( forgot the name ) has said that people are more concerned with what is happening to their personal life rather than what is happening to the world .
Look at India and China , when people said that both these countries are making a lot of pollution and they should also curb their pollution levels .
Both countries have declined on the subject .
China even stated that pollution and global warming is the problem of the western world .
China also stated that Global warming was caused by Western world as they grew economically and now when China is growing rapidly , they can't stop us .
Talk of some ****!!!.
China has become the bi ! ggest polluter in the world .
Come on people , Global warming is a crisis on a global scale and countries should realise it .
This blaming game is not the answer but rather thinking of a solution before our world ends up in a big crisis .
Karan , Delhi , India
Absolutely spot on !
Changing all the lightbulbs in the world wont matter a bit if the population continues to grow so quickly and unsustainably .
More people = more demand = more energy used .
Unfortunately we 're going against humun nature where most people believe the meaning of life is to procreate .
Maybe the Chinese way is too extreme for Western tastes , but something has to be done .
It 's a whole new meaning to the word " sacrifice " when you 're telling people they should n't be having children though .
I 'm not confident about our future .
Stephen , Plymouth
The green movement are starting to sound like fundamentalists who want to impose their views on others , by force is necessary .
This goes against the recognition of human rights .
We have seen the results of this fanaticism with population in the forced abortions in countries such as India and China and the anti-child and anti-family policies supported by green politicians in Europe .
Given the choice of living under a totalitarian green state and the results of global warming I prefer the latter .
Sue Eaton , London , UK
Sadly , your probebly preaching to the converted here .
On another note , prehaps Global Warming is our , and the Earths way of solving all these problems .
If the Earth becomes unsuitable to support us we will die in the billions , thus correcting the problem .
After all the Earth has been here for 4 Billion Years .
Humans ?
About 100,000 years in our current form .
We could have a war using atomic weapons , eradiating the planet for 10,000 years and the Earth would carry on merrily , after all 10,000 years is nothing in a lifetime of 4 Billion .
Andy G , Leeds
I see our species akin to organisms that infest their habitat , a parasite of sorts .
We 're infesting the planet and being on top of the social pyramid , it 's sad that we are n't doing much to bring the situation under control although we possess superior faculties .
Perhaps , the situation is beyond our control .
But it is n't too late to reverse the situation by each playing an active role in boycotting commercialization and such .
If nothing is done , we 'd either blow ourselves & the planet to bits ( through ensuing conflicts which has all probability to turn into nuclear wars ) or go extinct , whichever happens earlier .
Diana F , Mumbai , India
Absolutely agree .
It 's about time we woke up to the cold , hard realities facing us all , but what 's really needed is a shift in [ global ] consciousness .
It 's not enough for people like John Feeney to make noises - we need action from our governments , united action from all governments .
We desperately need to move on and act as One World rather than bicker & fight over what resourses are left .
Time is very short .
Perhaps the Mayans were right afteral .
Ralph Davies , Woking
An excellent article .
Something that politicians and most environmentalists are unwilling to talk about is to encourage people in developed countries to have smaller families .
It is the developed nations resource consumption per capita that is more significant than those in developing nations .
Provide incentives through taxes or benifits for people to have less children and educate as to why it is of benefit to the population as a whole .
bruce phillips , bristol U.K .
John Feeney Welcome to the top of the hill .
I have waited 14 years for you to get here ; my God I have never been so glad to see another human being in my life ;
Because now we can mend this !!
Thank you for climbing up ; I know how tough it has been , and I know how tough it is to look down and wonder why nobody else is looking up here .
But they will come .
They have to .
Climbing up here , is the only way they can climb down from this precarious place .
Thank you ; I have waited 14 years ; you have made my day ; and you have made life for all of us .

steven Walker , Penzance
John Feeney states the obvious , but politicians will not acknowledge the truth as they think that more population equals more support for them .
Thats the case in the UK and this country is more overpopulated than the States .
We in the developed world cannot expect the third world , as they develop , to forgo all the amenities that we enjoy , so we should all be made to curb our fertility , especially fertility treatment .
It is sad when a desired baby is not forthcoming but previous generations had to cope with disappointment and so should we .
There are more than enough babies being born elsewhere on the globe .
S.A. Hall , Hants UK
I thank John Feeney for raising some controvertial truths .
Thanks to decades of ignoring environmentalists , we now face a huge problem : resource depletion and climate change .
There is no doubt that the global population would never have reached 6 + billion without the energy from conventional oil entering our agricultural system .
Those who should be ashamed are those who built this society on non-renewable resources without any sensible debate over what might happen when this energy ceased to be available so cheaply .
Global population will fall - the choice is how we manage the transition .
Mandy Meikle , West Calder , West Lothian
I agree ,
Over population is the largest problem , yet there has been no attempt at addressing this .
Unfortunately I think the vast majority will just scream about there human right to spawn more and more instinct driven ignorant breeders .
We are lost , and as Nietzsche said ' The Mediocre will inherit the earth . '
Toran Lee , London
Finally someone with the guts to say the truth .
The human population is out of control .
Years ago disease kept the population size under control , now with medical breakthroughs on an almost daily basis and the longer life expectancy it brings means we are headed into oblivion as a planet .
All problems in the natural world today are down to the greed and selfishness of the human race .
Maybe it 's time we introduce a limit on the number of children a couple can have .
In the past childhood mortality rates were higher so people had more children as they were n't all expected to survive to adulthood , with survival rates now being so high it 's time to limit the number of births .
Drastic times need drastic measures .
Alan , Anglesey
The world is a finite resource ; just like oil , it 's demand will eventually overbalance supply and we will be faced with a decision on what road to take .
when that time comes , world leaders should be ready for the problem .
My point being ; leaders of major world countries should make commitments right now , instead of taking emergency measures in the future .
for example , a limit on water consumption , similar to what is going on in Australia , but on a more global .
This problem facing us is becoming more and more apparent , but since EMDCs need more workers right now in any case , I imagine that leaders wont be willing to try and cut down on birth rates .
I doubt that humans will be ready for this matter , since we are seemingly sluggish with the reaction to global warming .
World leaders wont be quick at making urgent desicions , therefore the people will have to take matters into their own hands and make commitments .
Kieran Miyamoto , Yokohama , Japan
The problem we face has to be tackled at all levels - individual , businesses and governments - because it affects all of us in all aspects of our lives .
As we are the cause for the mess , we cannot rely on things sorting themselves out eventually but have to take the responsibility for it and do so now .
The biggest single issue is recognising that we are part of nature and need to live in a sustainable and equitable manner .
I say equitable not just when referring to other lifeforms with which we share this planet , but also with other humans .
The inequality that exists within our species in particular is not the result of food shortages or lack of wealth .
It 's political , plain and simple .
The disgraceful overconsumption and waste in the world is a prime example of why some people go hungry while other die of obesity .
UK households alone waste £ 10s billions per year due to overconsumption and unnecessary wastage of food .
This is poignantly indicative of the inappropriate attitude we have to our own wellbeing and our place here on Earth .
David , Congleton
Inactivity is the biggest enemy that we face .
In the year since the Stern report was published - which urged urgent action - what exactly has happened ?
Politicians have wrung their hands , and repositioned themselves to display their " green credentials " while doing very little to prove that those credentials are not just a smokescreen designed to win more votes .

Dr.M.W. Pharaoh , Cov / UK
yes agree with John Freehy 's account of population growth and industrial growth as being a major factor in the lack of awareness in people about sharing the planet with the plants and animals .
Our ignorance is the level to which we ignore this and allow the continued growth of companies to take the lead on creating an unsustainable future for us , without questioning their motivations and using our buying power as a way of saying stop .
The population question is not being faced because no one has the guts to address it and the issues that it raises .
I think it will be addressed when the situation has caused the problems it will cause , then it will be addressed .
Jacqueline Redmond , Glastonbury
Feeney 's argument is surely just a form of Green Fascism , since the logic what he proposes is that a substantial proportion of the world 's population should just shuffle off - or alternatively that draconian measures such as one child per family be adopted .
Why should I believe him , when his predecessors told me 40 years ago that " growth " was unsustainable and catastrophe would strike in 1980/90/2000 ?
Al , Southampton , UK
Complete agreement and good to see some clear thinking for a change .
We collectively need to change to an economic system that is based on resource efficiency and not year - on - year ongoing " growth " .
It is that very economic growth that is killing us , ever so slowly , but killing us it is .
Thank you Dr Feeney and thank you BBC for publishing it .
Hans Schreuder , Ipswich , UK
When the oil runs out other technologies that are already available will be used .
The oil giants want our money first though .
The projected food shortages of the future are another myth .
If we can set aside millions of hectares for the production of ' bio - fuels ' then there is scope for much greater food production .
Population is self regulating .
Take the UK for instance .
If it were not for increases in immigration the UK population would still be stable as it has been for the past 40 years !
Compared to the UK India and China are vast countries therefore their population has n't peaked yet .
I do agree that recycling is the way forward .
Stop the 'use and throw away ' society .
With a proper recycling system we can sustain ourselves indefinately .
Mr Feaney you talk about population control in the same way Hitler did !
Your views are dangerous and misguided .
R Taylor , Chesterfield , UK
I totally agree with John .
We definitely face unspeakable , even unimaginable consequences .
But we can't do anything now .
Infact this is an inevitable scene in this world drama .
No one should be blamed for this , not even we as human beings !
This is the very law of entropy , where everything in order has to come in a state of disorder .
We are facing an unimaginable destruction by natural calamities and the nuclear third world war which is not too far away !
After the massive destruction there will be a new begining , with a completely pure atmosphere and life .
The new golden age .

I totally agree with you John , but unfortunatly there is so much apathy around us .
Most of the population are caught up in their own life circle and cannot see outside of it .
As long as they can get in their car , go to work , come home and watch tv , they are happy .
I have recently started to travel by public transport and I am appalled at the behaviour of my fellow specis .
We have become a very selfish uncaring society here in the Uk , I think the expression is " Im alright Jack " , How we turn this around I cant hazaed to guess , But hopefully more people will start to understand that Mother Nature will take so much before kicking back .
Anyhow good luck with your projects , there are people out here that do understand , we will do whatever we can to try to help yours faithfully g. Kemp
garry , Hayes , London ,

Whistling in the dark will not help - Dr Feeney is quite right .
It ought to be obvious to even the densest and most obtuse optimist that there are simply too many people .
People do reduce the size of their families - this has a great deal to do with economic status .
If H. sapiens is really not just sapiens , but also cogitens , then we have a chance .
If H. sapiens is just wise ( in his / her own estimation ) , but takes no action , then the wisdom does rather disappear , does n't it ?
D. Fear , Heidelberg , Germany
I am so pleased that there are people out there dedictaing themselves to discussing and bringing this issue to the forefront of political and environmental realms .
Knowing what I know about the Human Race , it sadly seems to me we wo n't be able to control ourselves enough to save ourselves .
but thats no excuse not to try .
But can we please stop celebrating framilies who have ten or more children in the UK ?
It 's hugely irresponsible .
Thanks Elly
Elly Ward , Norwich
It 's very easy to say " We must end world population growth , then reduce population size " , but how exactly is this to be accomplished ?
Mr. Feeney claims that ' expert consensus ' claims that this problem can be solved humanely , which is good to know .
But how exactly ?
What are the ' social problems ' that drive population expansion , and how can they be countered ?
China , for example , has a largely successful 1 - child policy but even then its population conitnues to grow , and will not begin to decline for decades to come according to the latest poulation forecasts .
Rory Mitchell , Hong Kong
Very good article .
99 % of the articles like yours on Globle Health focuses on issues other than percapita consumption .
Being in one of the poorest countries in the world and with one of the lowest consumer of natural resourses ( nonrenewable ) I see it quite obvious that percapita consumption of the natural resourses are more important than the population number .
An example :
The international school I work at consumes roughly the same amount of electrical energy as 1000 same size other rural schools in Nepal !!!!
Thanks
suman koirala , Kathmandu Nepal
I total support Johns comments , their does seem a reluctance to discuss the impact of out of control population growth .
It is a subject that cuts to the core of human existance .
Essentially if we do n't take the political decisions to control population size , then the natural systems and multipling interdependant problems will control our growth for us .
Unfortunately this could be a very painful process .
Historically its interesting to note that civalisations have reached a crises when inter-connections reach a certain level of complexity .
One break in a chain and the whole complex edifice comes crashing down .
Melanie Blizard , Brisbane Qld Australia
At last a rational article on the Earth 's true environmental ills - but it 's probably too late , Mother Earth will look after itself .
Crowcatcher , Shropshire
John Feeney is right for the most part , and in fact his tone is very gentle .
The crisis is already far worse than all but a small group of specialists can grasp .
Certainly , the idea of infinite growth was dead - wrong : embedded within it was self - destruction .
And population , indeed , must be reduced .
So why do we offer " treatment " for infertility , and life support for the not - quite - dead ?
Is it cruel to deny someone children they are not readily conceiving ?
Is n't it more cruel to speed up & intensify the suffering those children will face ?
The counterpoint to Mr Feeney 's argument on reducing total population is one that also must be articulated explicitly : mere numbers wo n't do the trick unless we also begin to teach ways of living better with less .
Consider the latest fad , ' guyliner . '
Instead of doing with less make - up ( to reduce consumption ) , some propose we extend cosmetic use to the male half ...
What this tells me is that we are not really serious about trying to ensure huma !
n civilisation survives .
We just hope it will be someone else having to die , to endure the discomfort we are choosing to avoid having to prevent through intelligent action .
Maria Amadei Ashot , London , the UK
I agree with John Feeney but unfortunately am very pessimistic about our will or desire to curb our habits which have put us on this course .
I totally agree that overpopulation is a big part of the problem but religion enters the picture and torpedoes any efforts to control population growth .
The idea that " be fruitful and multiply " is no longer appropriate has not sunk in .
And many people will say they want to help curb consumption , but not if it affects their life style .
I hope I 'm wrong but I do n't think so .
Raymond Day , Baton Rouge , Louisiana , USA
Absolutely !
I have a degree in Ecology and once you study the subject and realize that the earth is built upon a delicate balance of interdependent species which all have a niche that creates a living organism of the earth .
Anything that spreads like humans have is a cancer on the planet and Mother Nature or Gaia is about to destroy us when the weather patterns change world wide and more than half the worlds population lives within a few miles of the world 's oceans and less than 100 ft above sea level .
They will all be destroyed very quickly when one domino falls and a cascade event , propably the release of tons of Methane into the air when siberia heats up .
Did you know there are three rivers in Siberia larger than the nile ?
Methane will throw the delicate balance into unbalance .
Droughts , floods , supercyclones , supertornadoes , and disease create food shortages , cities will experience riots for food and water and mass migration to northern latitudes to escape the heat .
This is hist !
ory repeating itself , only nothing in history has ever been more serious than the situation we face as a result of our greed , stupidity , and the genocide of all life on the planet as we cleared the way for " modernization " and the Industrial Revolution was our demise .
Sweet dreams mankind ... as you join the dinosour !
Kyle Neville , Reseda , California
I agree with Feeney .
Finding ways to make resource recovery part of capitalism is long overdue .
The world was already over - populated in the 1960s if you work out any sort of model of sustainability , that becomes apparent .
It is unfortunate that people and their country 's economies are gridlocked into the have babies , consume to keep up with the Jones way of life , or have babies as a method of having someone to take care of you when you are old ...
Developing nations could follow Thailand 's ( very sucessful ) model for decreased population growth .
Developed nations could do so much by implementing real cost pricing of consumer goods which whereby the actual cost of goods is arrived at by including toxicity costs to the environment , additional cancers , costs to the land , disposal , etc .
I think there are hidden costs everywhere now that people have to drink bottled water ( which yes pollutes more ) , and need air filters just to alleviate asthma that they would n't normally have ! .
And cancer ... you may not be able to but a price tag on it , but really the polluted environment / cancer link is just a obvious and just a ignored a global warming .
Polluters should pay , and consumers who buy products from polluters should pay more of a real cost .
Exporting the pollution to Countries like China , Korea , Mexico is what the U.S. does ... maybe that concept would be more acceptable if our trade partners were mass - producing solar panels , compost bins , parts for mass - transit systems , and grey water irrigation components .

This is real and it is here now .
In areas of the south , 45 % bee hives have been destroyed by an Israeli virus .
Without pollinators , crops yield little or no food .
The system is being uprooted from the bottom up .
Why ?
Because pesticides weakened the immune systems of the bees .
Pesticides used to protect the very crops wasting away without pollination .
Bryon Drown , North Easton , MA , USA
This is alarmist crap .
Even he knows it its why hes so defencive about alarmism .
People have been predicting the end of the world for hundreds and hundreds of years and this guy is no different .
He can use as many buzz words as he wants and dress them up as fact but it won make it any more real .
Climate change isnt happening that fast and humans are doing fine , people in developed countries have too much food so how can he predict famine ?
Simply he cant and is either a little nuts or just wants some attention .
Nick , England
With respect , I think Mr. Feeney has been reading too much of his own propaganda .
Walter Moore , Indianapolis U.S.A .
Yes it is absolutely .
If birth - rates and fertility - rates are not curbed world population will reach to an unsustainable level
Syed , Troy
I agree with Mr. Feeney .
It would be nice if all of the religious conservatives around the globe , would preach a little common sense about things like family planning .
Unfortunately , since that might cause a reduction in their ' coffers ' in the long term , it is unlikely to happen in any chuch with the exception of those who actually " practice [ & comprehend the original intention of the messages ] they preach " .
[ ]s mine .
Thank you for the excellent article , Keith
keith stengl , santa rosa / united states
I agree with Feeney , that the Earth is too crowded , but with billionaires , not with people in general .
Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen and UN studies all show that populations stabilize with elimination of poverty and empowerment of women in society .
To be sure , radical changes must be made in the way we live , but they will realize the goal of global sustainability that Feeney claims is impossible to attain .
Only rapid solarization of our energy infrastructure , demilitarization and conversion of industrial and GMO agriculture into agroecology can prevent global warming ecocatastrophe looming in a few decades .
The real challenge is political and economic , not the global population size .
Another world is possible if the " excess " population of the planet is sufficiently organized to force it into being , starting with constraining the rule of capital enriching the few and immiserating the many .

This is an extremely well written article , clear and to the point .
I could not agree more with the facts presented .
Alex Godfrey , Phitsanulok , Thailand
All living populations expand and contract in tune with resources , we are not exempt .
Unfortunately the Judeo - Christian tradition has taught that we are outside nature and a special case , and some still cling to that primitive world view derived from a long gone situation .
" When I was a child , I thought as a child .. now it is time to put away childish things " summarises it perfectly .
If we do n't get ourselves under control we will be rudely put back a few millenia by disease , starvation , and WAR .

WE THE HUMAN RACE ARE AN INFECTION OF THE PLANET EARTH .
WE WILL CONSUME THE RESOURCES OF OUR HOST UNTIL OUR OWN TOXINS DESTROY US THRU DISEASE OR POLLUTION .
WE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN A LOWLY BACTERIA OR VIRUS KILLING ITS HOST ORGANISM .
WE AS A RACE ARE TOO IGNORANT TO EVEN HEED THE WARNINGS OF OUR BEST & BRIGHTEST SCIENTISTS .
THE FUTURE IS INDEED BLEEK !
HARRY B , DETROIT /USA
From what I have read on the internet and from what I have seen in films such as " The Corporation " and " An inconvinient truth " , people like John Feeney have a point .
One part of my mind says fight the current global ( and largely economic ) institution´s method of government .
It says lets protest and make as much noise as possible .
Lets hope that a change comes about and that humanity can prove itself as humane and resonable .
Overcoming this crisis would put my faith back in humanity .
The other part of my mind asks why not let humanity continue on it´s current course ?
Why not just let our politicians and minders continue to wreak their havock ?
Why not continue and let our current problems escalate to the " sixth mass extinction " event that some predict ?
The dinosaurs died out but the Earth survived .
Life survived .
Even if we are all gone what does out life mean in the billions of years long history of the planet ?
Not much ?

Kudos to John Feeney for his fascinating article .
I would like to add that emergence of organized religions devoid of animastic foundation have lead to uncontrolled human population increase .
Women held in slavery as baby making machines in Christianity and Islam .
Humanity trying to defeat the natural law of " Survival of the fittest " .
These are major parts of the conundrum of life .
E.Bruce Wolff , Pusan , So. Korea
I could n't agree more .
Unfortunately , the things John mentions are n't even remotely on anyone 's radar screen - tropical forest continue to be cut down to the last bit here in Borneo , and nobody of those responsible seems to either understand or care for their own children ' future .

WOW congratulations John Feeney , that is the most articulate and powerful analysis of our current situation that I have read to date !
Let us all strive to break the inertia and accelerate action on this , our greatest challenge .
David Power , Sydney
I agree with John , nice to hear this view get published , it 's not often .
However , this view is contentious and needs scientific validation and quantification to be fully backed .
But can you find a scientist with these views who has n't been silenced ?
And I doubt you 'll ever hear a politician or company director entertain the idea .
And how do we stop / reduce population growth ?
Create a 2.1 family policy ( with a 0 pension policy for free ) ?
Kick off shows like the running man ( how about " I'm a drain on this planet , get me out of here " ) ?
Joe , Oxford , UK
John Feeney has highlighted several unpalatable truths .
First , there are far too many of us .
I recently completed an ecological ' footprint ' survey which indicated that we would need 3.9 earths for everyone to sustain a lifestyle such as mine - which is one I do not consider too extravagant .
So how could it be possible for those in developing nations to enjoy the lifestyle of the " West " even while the advanced economies strive for an economic development of 2 - 3 % per year .
The short answer is that it wo n't happen .
Second , the climate changes already adequately highlighted by the IPCC are frightening and recent data shows that even the worst case scenarios in their models are too optimistic .
Anthropomorphic changes are occurring faster than modellers feared and yet many deny there is even a problem .
While I am not a pessimist by nature , I am rapidly becoming convinced that within a couple of lifetimes from now the human race will start to become the victim of its own success and will join those species destined for extinction - not necessarily very soon but certainly inexorably .
In the grand scheme of things there is nothing special about homo sapiens as a species to suggest that it is immortal .
Richard , Montpon , France
The world is already telling us that it 's reaching its limit .
Natural catastrophes are just some of the ways it is reacting towards our abuse and inconsideration .
We have to stop waiting for others to take action and solve the problem ; this is something that involves the understanding and cooperation of everyone .
Let us unite for once in this common cause :
To save our home , our only home , and that of millions of other creatures .
Elisa , San Juan / Puerto Rico
Aldo Leopold , one of the founders of the wildlife management profession , once said , " To be an ecologist is to live in a world of wounds . "
For anyone with a background in ecology , the answer is obvious :
Of course our growing demands are too much for the planet .
Will the consequences be unspeakable ?
That depends on what is meant by " unspeakable . "
The consequences are already significant and mounting , and are on their way to being unprecedented , dire .
It is hard to believe that one really needs a background in ecology to recognize these trends and causes .
Common sense should suffice .
Unfortunately , however , there has been so much rhetoric spewed out by corporations and their politicians that the common sense of citizens has been suppressed .
For decades , citizens have been intoxicated by claims that " There is no conflict between growing the economy and protecting the environment . "
Now comes the dreaded hangover .
It is commendable that BBC posted Mr. Feeney 's insights .
BBC could have done a better job with its questions to the readership , though .
Feeney 's article was n't all about an " expanding population , " but rather the combination of growing population and per capita consumption .
This combination is called economic growth .
Economic growth gauged by increasing GDP and is a primary , perennial policy goal of virtually all nations .
Feeney suggested the only sustainable alternative : the steady state economy .
As a visiting assistant professor who teaches ecological economics at Virginia Tech , I am encouraged to see some macroeconomic sanity entering the mainstream media .
Brian Czech , Arlington , Virginia , USA
Perhaps next week 's announcement by Governor Ritter here in Colorado of the first real energy plan for Colorado will be the decisive action that will give people hope so they stop going along with their heads down .
Our state can do a lot to change the world in a big way with our education system , National Center for Atmospheric Research and labs for renewable energy research .
Combine that with the infrastructure we have in place in our county , state and nation and I think you will find that people were simply looking to the side rather than going along in despair toward some sort of environmental collapse .
If people align their priorities with what they do on a daily basis I think you will find that it 's not too late for change .
The present situation is like a hang glider that has one wing stalled in a turn with a mountainside coming up if nothing is done .
We can either freeze and do nothing or go with the turn and dive for airspeed to bring this thing around and wind up hav !
ing a good flight .
It 's our duty to do so .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado USA
What a load of rubbish !
It 's not population that matters , it 's consumption of resources .
If places like the USA would do more to curb their seemingly infinite consumption of natural resources this earth could , and would , support many more !

Let me also add this - the budgets of these organizations have increased considerably over the last few years and their efforts have sped up considerably .
In other words , as the political influence and clout of the Christian right has ebbed somewhat recently , fundamentalist influence in the military appears to be growing .
The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is the only organization devoted to fighting abuses of religious liberty in the US military .
Of the roughly 6,000 complaints MRFF has received from US military members , approximately 90 % have been from Christians .
Here is a PDF of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation 's most recent lawsuit , filed in mid September 2007 , that alleges a widespread pattern of religious abuses in the military .
An earlier MRFF lawsuit with similar allegations and centering around the " Christian Embassy " video ( see below ) .
That lawsuit was dismissed for " lack of standing " but many of MRFF 's charges were later vindicated in a Pentagon Inspector General Report ( link to PDF of report )

For the great atomic power ?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the air ?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high ?
Are you ready for the great atomic power ?

That they call atomic power
Are we all in great confusion
Do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion
May rain down upon our land
Meting horrible destruction
Blotting out the works of man Refrain
There is one way to escape it
Be prepared to meet the lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus
He will be your shielding sword
He will surely stay beside you
And you 'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
And eternal peace and rest Refrain
There 's an army who can conquer

image , right : click on picture to see short promotional video from Military Ministry , which is one of the several ministries from Campus Crusade For Christ that target the US military and whose Christian Embassy ministry evangelizes in the US Pentagon .
Another Campus Crusade ministry , Officers Christian Fellowship , has roughly 15,000 members in the US military officer corps .
Campus Crusade is only one of many fundamentalist , evangelical , and typically apocalyptic religious organizations that target the US military for recruitment , and the operating budgets of many of these organizations have greatly increased in the last several years .
Raising Up A ' Godly Military '
The Officer 's Christian Fellowship motto is : Christian officers exercising Biblical leadership to raise up a godly military .
The OCF has roughly 15,000 members in the officer corps of the US military , on around 200 US bases worldwide .
Christian Embassy evangelizes in the Pentagon , on Capital Hill , and among foreign diplomats .
One top Pentagon official claims that there are more than 350 Christian Embassy affiliated Bible study classes , using Christian Embassy Bible study curriculum , held regularly among the 25 to 30 thousand members of the Pentagon .
Military Ministries targets enlisted members of the military .
The three ministries are subsidiaries of the Campus Crusade For Christ , which promotes fundamentalist , apocalyptic Christianity and whose founder , Bill Bright , promoted the formation of " cell groups " ( originally a communist tactic ) and said in the 1970's that Campus Crusade was a " conspiracy to overthrow the world " .
Campus Crusade For Christ ministries are not the only fundamentalist , apocalyptic Christian ministries evangelizing in the United States military , and the yearly operating budgets of these nonprofit ministries may range , in aggregate , up to 100 million dollars or more .
Some of these ministries also receive US government contracts and target the children of military families .
" Christian Embassy "
For a quick overview , " Christian Embassy " is a fundamentalist group that evangelizes in the Pentagon , and at any given point there are as many as twenty or so high level Pentagon military officers and civilians leading regular " Christian Embassy " Bible study lessons .
Christian Embassy lesson plans use terms such as " spiritual warfare " , call faith a " force multiplier " , have titles such as " Warfare in Christ " , and include lessons on " wifely submission " .
Christian Embassy 's website has featured a description of " grace " rendered in the tale of an adult belt - whipping a child .
The image , below , links to the " Christian Embassy " video .
In the Pentagon Inspector General report summarizing the ensuing investigation about the fact that top Pentagon officials had appeared , in uniform and filmed within the Pentagon , to endorse a partisan , fundamentalist Christian group that targets the Pentagon for it evangelizing efforts , one of the Pentagon officials appearing in the video said he thought Christian Embassy was a " quasi federal " entity because it had been given , for decades , access to the Pentagon .
( click on image to watch video )
Most , if not all , of the Pentagon officials who appeared in the Christian Embassy video have since received career promotions .
For example , Pete Geren is now Secretary of The United States Army , and Bob Caslen is Commandant of Cadets at West Point
The US military , from the Pentagon on down , has become dominated by a particular , sectarian form of Christianity with a religious outlook that is not at all representative of the American public :
It is fundamentalist and apocalyptic , and inherent in the outlook is an expectation of an immanent and catastrophic religious war with Islam .
Typically part of the package are also Christian Zionist beliefs , expectations that during the end - time , expected very soon , Israel will devastated during the battle of Armageddon , after which the surviving " remnant " of Jews will convert ( or be converted ) to Christianity .
That is to say that what is coming to be the dominant , institutionalized outlook in the United States military includes an expectation , for Israel 's near future , of inevitable and close to genocidal slaughter , in a vision to rival or even exceed public statements on Israel from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
On the domestic front , this sectarian form of Christianity tends to evince Creationist , " Young Earth " even , views .
Along with the ideological package tends to go , also , Global Warming denialism , fake American history , nearly Medieval views on women 's rights and reproductive rights , and a complaint narrative holding that the Unites States , in the mid to late 20th Century , " walked away from God " thus causing , allegedly , widespread moral decay and a prolonged national decline .
This , so the story goes , is the fault of " secularists " who have stolen America 's true , Christian heritage and chased God from the public sphere .
There is no precedent for this MRFF research project .
It is groundbreaking , and there are only a handful of experts on the subject - they all work for , and with MRFF .
We know this because collectively we have logged probably , at this point , thousands of hours of research time .
So , if anyone else were doing significant research into this subject we 'd likely know .
Our research forms a significant part of MRFF's new lawsuit that seeks to demonstrate a pervasive pattern , in the US military , of the abuse of religious liberty rights of military members .
To be honest if anyone had predicted , early last Spring , that in coming months I would demonstrate that the United States Pentagon was riddled with apocalyptic Christian religious belief , or that I 'd uncover evidence that the Pentagon might actually be promoting those apocalyptic views to US troops in Iraq I might have quipped " yeah , sure , and monkeys will fly out my butt . "
Well ...
No monkeys yet , but very little these days would surprise me now that I 've discovered a 2005 case of an apocalyptic evangelist preaching in the Pentagon courtyard during lunch hours and found the Pentagon promoting , in several different ways , apocalyptic Christianity to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Surveying the scope of efforts to evangelize the military has been an enormous undertaking , and many facets of the enterprise have only come very slowly into focus in my mind .
Initially I would n't have thought all the Christian " para church " ministries targeting the military were apocalyptic Dispensationalist , but that 's proven to be the case .
And , I would n't have believed the Pentagon could possibly be promoting such views , but lately I 've come to the opinion that has become unofficial DoD policy , and the image , above , is only one data point in a growing mosaic I 'm building that , as its filled in , seems to depict a US military that has , in the last few decades , changed radically and in ways that must be taken seriously .
image , below : the Lifeway / Army deal described , in text of picture , is not an anomaly .
It is part of a pattern that I will soon outline in future posts and writing .
We can safely assume that the " Christian materials " in question conform with the " rapture ready " theological stance of Lifeway 's parent organization , the Southern Baptist Convention .
The Problem With " Nuts "
It 's currently in fashion , among many public voices that address the American Christian right , to describe those lumped into that fuzzy grouping as " nuts " .
But here 's the problem ...
The problem with brushing Christian fundamentalists off as " nuts " is that they have become a dominant force in the most powerful military on Earth .
The " nuts " have the Pentagon , they 're around nuclear weapons , and they 're pushing for a religious war between Christianity and Islam .
The " nuts " appear now to be , based on the research of Chris Rodda and me , largely running America 's military .
They have n't fully converted the military ( yet ) to fundamentalist Christianity and their particular , bellicose vision of Jesus but they are aggressively pursuing that end : converting all US military personnel into government funded fundamentalist missionaries for Christ , in uniform .
Calling fundamentalists " nuts " - while they , meanwhile , are busily ( and successfully ) converting the United States military soldier by soldier , sailor by sailor , USAF cadet by USAF cadet , into a Christian nationalist and apocalyptic engine revving up for Armageddon - is in my opinion indicative of a very deep sort of societal dysfunction .
Yes , I do find efforts , of Christians who try to exorcise demons from their busted cars , to be blackly funny , and evangelists who try to rebut Evolution with bananas or jars of peanut butter are just ridiculous .
Actually I 've even recently written on the subject myself , in a meditation provoked by a short God-Tube video which promotes the notion that kitchen blenders can become satanic or demon- infested and thus electrocute their owners .
So , even though I would n't call people who harbor such ideas nuts I can understand why some see those approaches to car repair and kitchen appliances as " nutty " - such beliefs are not substantially different from those of classic cargo cultists .
Where does stuff come from ?
- secret magic formulas that conjure down planeloads of " cargo " .
Why do cars break down ? - Demons .
Satan
But , labeling people with such beliefs as " nuts " is a convenient way of dismissing them as ineffectual and that can hinder actual , clinical observation of what they 're up to .
Per Sun
Tzu ( whose work is required reading in many US military officer curricula ) it is wise to learn all of can about one 's adversary , with the wisest default strategic position being that one 's adversary constitutes a deadly threat and is thus worthy of the utmost respect .
Thus , unless required for tactical reasons , taunts are generally inadvisable .
Over the course of the last six months I have become one of a tiny handful of experts on the influence of the fundamentalist Christian right in the US military .
It was unexpected , and what truly floors me is that no one has previously thought to pay attention and I attribute that , in part , to dismissals of the fundamentalist Christian right as " crazy " .
Fundamentalist Christians tend hold beliefs that I disagree with and might characterize as types of magical thinking , but I 've come to understand that people who I think harbor localized pockets of insanity ( as we all tend to , each in our own way ) can nonetheless be astonishingly effective .
One way of thinking about this is by way of a figure - ground reversal .
So :
Who is crazier ?
The " A's " say the " B's " are crazy because of their religious beliefs ...
Meanwhile the " B's " are working , quite methodically and with tremendous determination and conviction , to convert all members of the United States military to their religious beliefs and have been strikingly successful , to the extent that they 've now enlisted the machinery of the state , in the military , to help out with their evangelism efforts .
But the " A's " , during the 20 or so years that project has been underway , are almost totally oblivious .
The question is - which group is crazier , the " A's " or the " B's " ?
One definition of insanity might be " an outlook or set of beliefs that impede either ability to engage with consensus reality ( ' insanity ' vis a vis society ) or impede ability to deal with basic survival issues , at a practical level ( paying bills , cleaning , etc. ) or in simple biological terms ( eating , etc . ) . "
In the case above what 's notable is that the " A's " have labeled the " B's " and then simply ignored them , perhaps in the belief that the religious beliefs of the " B's " render them ineffectual .
Meanwhile , the " B's " - who most certainly have noticed being labeled by the " A's " - proceed to take advantage of their status of quasi-invisibility , for having been been dismissed by the " A's " , to methodically take over , in religious and ideological terms , the most powerful military on the planet - which possesses a nuclear weapons capacity to vaporize a good deal of the Earth 's surface and maybe even kill of most of it 's biological life .
The " B's " in fact seem to believe that such catastrophic destruction would be a fine thing .
That 's built into their religious outlook which was the reason the " A's " dismissed them in the first place .
So which group is " nuttier " - the " B's " with " nutty " views who nonetheless concocted a very effective strategy for spreading those views in a manner that might threaten or even define the fate of the Earth , or the " A's " who let that happen ?
The image , right , is from a current Fort Benning chaplains page entitled " Protestant Religious Education " .
" Coerced Religious Practice Americans United has received reports from former and current cadets — confirmed by members of the U.S. Air Force Academy ’s " Permanent Party " - that Academy faculty , staff , members of the Chaplains ’ Office , and upperclass cadets frequently pressure members of the Cadet Wing to attend chapel and undertake religious instruction .
... We have been informed , for example , that , during a Basic Cadet Training session attended by a team of observers fromthe Yale Divinity School , one of the Academy chaplains — Major Warren " Chappy " Watties — led a Protestant worship service in which he encouraged the attending cadets to return to their tents
and proselytize cadets who had not attended the service , with the declared penalty for failure to accept this proselytization being to " burn in the fires of hell . "
Although literally hundreds of witnesses can attest to the fact that Major Watties ran the service and encouraged attendees to proselytize their non-attending classmates , we are informed that the Academy has downplayed the significance of the incident , reporting to the Air Staff at the Pentagon that the chaplain who conducted that service and encouraged proselytization of cadets was not a member of the Academy ’s Permanent Party but instead was merely a visiting Air Force reservist .
That report is incorrect : Major Watties is a full - time chaplain at the Academy .
Indeed , he enjoys the distinction of having been named as the U.S. Air Force ’s current Chaplain of the Year .
What is more , the Air Staff has now expressly condoned Major Watties ’ actions — at the same time that the Academy is denying that Major Watties ever made the statements reported by the Yale Divinity School team and the other attendees at the service .

( Colo . Springs ) , Apr. 27 , 2005 . " - From Report of Americans United
for Separation of Church and State
on Religious Coercion and Endorsement of Religion at the United States Air Force Academy source :
When doctors told John Kanzius he had nine months to live , he quietly thanked God for his blessings and prepared to die .
Then 58 , he had lived a good life , with a loving wife , two successful adult daughters and a gratifying career .
Now he had leukemia and was ready to accept his fate , but the visits to the cancer ward shook him .
Faces haunted him , the bald and bandaged heads , bodies slumped in wheelchairs , and children who could not play .
Like him , they had endured chemotherapy treatments that caused their weight to plummet , hands to shake , bodies to weaken , and immune systems to break down to the point that the slightest germ could be deadly .
Kanzius knew their agony .
He believed if cancer did n’t kill him first , the treatments surely would .
Advertisement
He thought there had to be a more humane way to treat cancer .
Kanzius did not have a medical background , not even a bachelor ’s degree , but he knew radios .
He had built and fixed them since he was a child , collecting transmitters , transceivers , antennas and amplifiers , earning an amateur radio operator license .
Kanzius knew how to send radio wave signals around the world .
If he could transmit them into cancer cells , he wondered , could he then direct the radio waves to destroy tumors , while leaving healthy cells intact ?
Awake in bed one night in 2003 , as the clock ticked past 2 , Kanzius pulled himself from beneath the covers , leaving his sleeping wife , Marianne .
He staggered down a flight of stairs , grabbed some copper wires , boxes , antennas and Marianne ’s pie pans , and began building a machine .
For months , Kanzius tinkered , using the pie pans to create an electronic circuit , often waking Marianne with his clanging .
By day , he sent her out with supply lists : mineral mixtures , metals , wires .
Advertisement
His early - morning experiments would lead him to one of the nation ’s top cancer researcher centers , and earn the support of a Nobel Prize winner .
When it came to electronics , Marianne had always known her husband was gifted .
But still she worried : Was he going mad ?
“ My God , honey , ” she thought , “ none of the doctors can fix this .
How can you ? ”
--
Kanzius ’ mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor , but he followed his father , a technician and ham radio operator who taught his son to love electronics and told him they would soon take over the world .
Advertisement
When Kanzius was 22 , after two years of trade school , he got a job at RCA as a technical assistant .
On his first day , he fixed the company ’s color television transmitters , which had been the subject of lawsuits because they did not comply with Federal Communications Commission guidelines .
He was promoted to the engineering department .
He worked at RCA for two years .
In 1966 , he took a job at a television station as director of engineering .
Kanzius became president and co-owner of a television and radio station company in 1984 .
He retired in 2001 .
In the winter of 2002 Kanzius felt soreness in his abdomen .
On Good Friday , he went in for a CT scan .
Doctors told him he had five to seven years to live .
The drive home felt like the longest of his life .
On the way , he called Marianne .
She noted that moment in her journal :
Advertisement
“ I had n’t heard from him .
Then the phone rang .
‘ Honey , it ’s bad .
I have a tumor in my stomach .
They ’re not certain , but they think it ’s non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma . ’
The phone went silent . ”
He underwent chemotherapy , a few times a week for six months -- but he stayed upbeat , and doctors told him the cancer had gone into remission .
A year after his diagnosis , on Good Friday again , doctors gave him bad news :
He had an aggressive type of cancer that had not actually gone into remission .
They gave him nine months .
Doctors said he needed a bone marrow transplant , and Kanzius traveled to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a second opinion .
During his visit , he noticed the children in the cancer ward .
Kanzius went home thinking about them , and soon mapped out his idea .
He knew that metal would heat when exposed to radio waves .
He wanted to focus the waves by inserting metal particles into tumors .
The infused cells would be placed in a radiofrequency field .
The waves would pass through the human body , and the particles injected into the cancer would heat and kill the cells without harming anything else .
Advertisement
He built a machine to send the waves , while undergoing his second round of chemotherapy .
This time the treatments nearly killed him .
He spent three or four days a week at the hospital , sometimes for as long as eight hours .
He came home to rest , only to toil over his project .
By Christmas 2003 , Kanzius could barely walk .
Around that time , his 83 - year - old mother died from lung cancer .
Kanzius was too weak to board a plane for her funeral .
He drew pictures for Marianne , leaving them around the house .
One showed him as a stick figure curled over a toilet as she took care of him .
“ A sign of real love , ” he wrote .
“ You are my reason for living . ”
Weary and weak , he tested his machine with hot dogs , then liver , then steak .
He injected minerals into the meat and placed the slabs into his machine .
To his delight , the injected portions of meat burned .
But would it work on people ?
Advertisement
Marianne marveled at his ingenuity and determination .
She took a walk one night and noticed the brilliant colors of leaves soon to fall from trees .
“ Is it a lesson in life ? ” she wrote in her journal .
“ Do we see how wonderful , how beautiful , how magnificent someone is , just as we ’re about to lose them ? ”
--
The worst of Kanzius ’ treatment was over by spring 2005 , and the cancer this time was in remission .
Advertisement
Reinvigorated , Kanzius knew he needed to get the word out about his discovery .
He had lunch with a competitor from his days in the news industry , the managing editor of a local newspaper .
He told him about his project , and the editor assigned a reporter to find out more .
By summer , articles began to appear , and the community grew interested .
Dr. David A. Geller , co-director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ’s liver cancer program , read about Kanzius ’ machine and called him .
Kanzius had secured a patent for his machine , and asked a company that made transmitters to build a model .
He sent it to the medical center so Geller could perform tests .
Kanzius shared his theory with his leukemia doctor at M.D. Anderson .
Kanzius said he wanted to show his machine to Dr. Steven A. Curley , an oncologist on staff who specialized in radiofrequency cancer treatment .
Advertisement
Doctors already use a treatment called radiofrequency ablation to kill cancer .
The method involves inserting needles into tumors and killing them with electrodes .
The invasive procedure is limited because it can only reach certain sites , mostly small tumors , and it can damage healthy cells in the surrounding area .
Kanzius ’ doctor contacted Curley and told him he did not know whether his patient was mad , but his idea had attracted a lot of attention .
Curley called Kanzius and asked whether he could find a substance that could attach to cancer cells and burn when hit with radio waves , sparing healthy cells .
Kanzius said he might be able to use nanoparticles , which are so small that 75,000 to 100,000 lined up side by side equal the width of a strand of human hair .
He thought nanoparticles could potentially be directed to travel through the bloodstream and stick only to cancer cells -- a patient would swallow a pill or take a shot containing them .
But would they burn ?
Kanzius needed to get his hands on some nanoparticles .
Advertisement
Curley knew that Nobel Prize - winning chemist Richard Smalley , who specialized in nanoscience , was also being treated for cancer at M.D. Anderson .
Curley got in touch with Smalley and explained Kanzius ’ theory .
Smalley did not think the nanoparticles would burn but agreed to give Curley two vials .
In June 2005 , Curley met with Kanzius and Marianne .
He pulled the vials of nanoparticles out of his suit jacket pocket , and Kanzius placed them in the radio field of his machine and turned it on .
They burned .

Marianne captured that day in her journal :
“ John asked , ‘ Is this what you expected ? ’
For the first time in my life , I realized that a smile starts behind the eyes before it starts at the mouth , for Steve responded , ‘ This is much more than I expected . ’
I watched his smile engulf his entire face . ”
Marianne finally realized : “ Could what John ’s working on be real ? ” Curley phoned Smalley to tell him the news .
He remembered Smalley ’s response : “ Holy God . ”
Advertisement
Smalley asked his colleagues at Rice University to work with Curley ’s team at M.D. Anderson on the project .
Shortly before he died in October 2005 , Smalley made a final request to Curley , who would not forget his words : “ Nothing has the potential to help people , to help patients , more than this .
You have to promise me to keep doing this work . ”
--
With the project moving along , Kanzius invited scholars , politicians and scientists to Erie for demonstrations .
This spring , a Canadian health minister had a random thought , after noticing how quickly condensation formed on the test tube walls during the process :
With the world ’s need for fresh water , he asked Kanzius , could his machine be used to desalinate water ?
Advertisement
A few weeks later , Kanzius tried to heat and distill water mixed with Morton ’s salt in a test tube , which he placed into his generator .
He turned on the radio frequencies and held a match to the salt water .
Flames erupted .
The radio waves had weakened the bonds that held together the elements that made up the water , and ignited the hydrogen .
The results left scientists excited by the possibility of separating hydrogen -- the most abundant element in the universe -- from salt water to use as a fuel .
Rustum Roy , a Penn State University chemist and water science expert , called it the most remarkable discovery in water science in the last century .
His team is working on the saltwater project at Penn State , using Kanzius ’ machine .

The saltwater discovery pleased Kanzius , but the cancer project took precedence .
Four years after he came up with his idea , researchers continued experiments and killed human cancer cells in petri dishes using nanoparticles and his machine .
They recently killed 100 % of cancer cells grown in the livers of rabbits , using Kanzius ’ method .
Curley said the treatment is the most promising he has ever seen because it has the potential to kill cancer -- without invasive treatment or surgery -- that doctors currently have no way of detecting .
The next step for scientists is to perfect a method of binding nanoparticles with antibodies that , when introduced into the bloodstream , will attach only to cancer cells while avoiding normal cells .
He said the treatment could work on any kind of cancer , and he estimates clinical trials are three to four years away .

“ Possible ? ” Curley said .
“ Yes .
Not simple . ”
Last year , Kanzius began raising money for his research with the help of his neighbors .
High school students held fundraisers , foundations offered grants , and children sold lemonade .
Donations soon reached more than $ 1 million .
This May , Erie officials gave Kanzius a key to the city and declared an official John Kanzius Day .
A former Erie mayor announced a goal of raising $ 3 million to fund research .
But the accolades meant little if the wider medical community did not recognize the research .
It had to be reviewed by a panel of medical experts and published in a scientific journal .
In June , scientists submitted manuscripts based on the findings to journals .
Three months later , Curley called Kanzius with news :
The manuscripts , with Kanzius listed as a co-author , would be published in December in Cancer , an oncology medical journal .
The results appeared online last week .

Kanzius hung up and yelled the news to Marianne , who was watching television downstairs .
She screamed .
At 63 , Kanzius is still receiving treatment for his cancer , which has recurred .
He knows the process he developed may not be ready in time to save his life , but the project was never about him .
“ I want to see the treatment work , ” he said .
“ That would be my thanks . ”
For Marianne , the journey led her to question her faith in God , only to have it reaffirmed .
She is hopeful the invention will help future generations , but she lives in terror , staying up at night to make sure Kanzius is still breathing .
She can not imagine waking up without her husband beside her .

“ I ’m selfish , ” she said .
“ If something can help him , I would like this to help him .
“ Yes , I hope . ”

Lead Front End Developer Paris , France | Berlin , Germany
Optimization and refactoring of main intranet site for 60.000 users on a MS Sharepoint platform .
My task was to decrease the load time and increase the overall performance .
We went from 16 sec per page load to 2 sec .
In addition we added responsive web design to make the site easier available across platforms and devices .
Humans revel in touch .
Touch - spoiled babies grow up healthier ; lovers can't keep their hands off each other ; and people who master the subtle touch are perceived as friendlier .
Touch could also be key to making robots accepted by humans as social peers , scientists say .
On average , robots today can hold human interest for only about 10 hours , but in a new study , a humanoid robot dubbed QRIO ( pronounced " curio " ) was accepted by human toddlers as " one of them " for 5 months before it was taken away .
The secret ?
QRIO was programmed to have a crude sense of touch .
" We put in this simple contingency where if the children touched the robot , the robot would giggle , " said study leader Javier Movellan of the University of California , San Diego .
" That completely changed everything . "
The finding , detailed online in the Nov. 5 issue of the journal for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggests robots do n't have to look human to be accepted as one .
Robot child
In the study , QRIO was introduced into a classroom of toddlers aged 18 months to 24 months .
Children of this age group were chosen because they have no preconceived notions of robots and they communicate using touch as much as speech .
" The children accepted the presence of QRIO very well , " Movellan told LiveScience .
" There were a few children who were very interested but maintained distance .
Over time , the relationship between children and QRIO evolved positively . "
In phase I of the experiment , which lasted 27 sessions , QRIO was instructed to interact with the children using its full behavioral repertoire , which included head - turning , dancing and giggling .
At first , the children would touch the robot on its face , but as they warmed to him , the majority of their touches were to its hands and arms — a pattern the children also displayed toward each other .
During phase II , which lasted 15 sessions , QRIO ignored the children 's touches and danced throughout the session .
" At that point , the [ children ] quickly lost interest , " Movellan said .
When QRIO 's ability to respond to touch and giggle were returned for three sessions in phase III , the children became friendly with the robot again .
When robot 's batteries died and it laid on the floor , some of the children cried .
Others put a blanket over him and said , " nigh - nigh . "
Like R2-D2
QRIO 's success shows robots do n't need to be entirely " life - like " to be successful , Movellan said .
QRIO stood only about 2 - feet ( 58 centimeters ) tall , and its only resemblance to a human was that it had two hands and walked on two legs .
And because speech - recognition technology does n't work well in noisy environments , QRIO could n't even talk .
" QRIO was kind of like R2 - D2 [ in " Star Wars " ] , " Movellan said .
" It expressed emotions but not speech . "
The ability to respond to touch is relatively easy to program into robots , Movellan said .
" We had things like computer vision in the robot , and touch was the easiest thing , " he said .
" And it turned out to be the most important to get things going . "
Adults were n't completely immune to QRIO 's charms either , Movellan said .
Even though the researchers said it was OK , teachers supervising the children would try to stop them when they poked QRIO in the eye .
However , the teachers did not try to stop the children when they poked the eyes of an inanimate toy robot , named " Robby , " that looked like QRIO .
QRIO " elicits these feelings on us , " Movellan said .
" First of all , we feel badly if the children are doing that to the robot .
And secondly , there is this problem that if you do n't tell the children not to treat the robot as another person , they may actually be learning bad things about how to treat other people . "
Author : Bush 's nominee for Attorney General is primed to keep lid on Qaeda spying disaster ; Patrick Fitzgerald 's missing witness Peter Lance
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This In Part One , Peter Lance described how Bush nominee for Attorney General Judge Michael B. Mukasey prevented defense lawyers from telling the full story of FBI informant and al Qaeda master spy Ali Mohamed at the 1995 " Day of Terror " trial .
Today he reveals how a full vetting of the Ali Mohamed story in 1995 might have ripped the lid off the FBI 's failure to stop the first World Trade Center attack .
Lance provides even more details with declassified FBI memos and other documents in the new edition of his latest HarperCollins investigative book , Triple Cross .
In this piece , he also reveals how then - New York attorney Patrick Fitzgerald -- later the CIA leak czar -- also kept Mohamed off the stand -- while the Feds cut a deal to keep Qaeda 's " master spy " in a witness protection program .
The ex-federal prosecutor and judge President Bush wants to run the Justice Department has repeatedly supported tweaking the constitutional guarantees of privacy and due process when it comes to the all - encompassing " war on terror . "
In a New York Times piece on September 18th , Phil Shenon and Ben Weiser described how " Mr. Mukasey now in private practice in Manhattan , has repeatedly spoken out to support the administration 's claim to broad powers in pursuing terrorism threats , especially surveillance of terrorism suspects and imprisoning them before trial . "
But as I 've chronicled now in three investigative books focusing on the failures of the two " bin Laden offices of origin "  the SDNY and the FBI 's NYO  none of the post - 9/11 draconian counter - terrorism initiatives ( including The Patriot Act ) would have been necessary , if the Feds had simply utilized the intelligence they had in their own files .
That 's not just my opinion :
It 's a conclusion admitted to last week by Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell , who told members of the House Judiciary Committee that " 9/11 should have and could have been prevented it was an issue of connecting information that was available . "
Al Qaeda 's New York cell circa 1989 Mukasey 's most significant terror - related resumé credit  as touted by his supporters  was his role as judge in the 1995 trial of blind Sheikh Omar Abdel - Rahman and nine other defendants .
As noted yesterday in Part One of my series , the blind Sheikh was accused by prosecutors for the Southern District of New York ( SDNY ) of leading a " jihad army " in a plot to blow up a series of New York " landmarks " from the United Nations building to 26 Federal Plaza , the FBI 's New York Office ( NYO )  not to mention the bridges and tunnels leading into Manhattan .
As reported in the Times coverage of the trial on February 8th , 1995 , as early as July of 1989 the FBI had spent four weekends in surveillance of two of the blind Sheikh 's co-defendants : El Sayyid Nosair and Clement Rodney Hampton - El .
Both of those terrorists had been trained by al Qaeda 's master spy , Ali Mohamed , an ex-Egyptian intelligence officer who had infiltrated the CIA in 1984 and the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg , N.C. from 1987 - 89 .
Ali was strangely absent from the trial , despite the attempts of defense attorney Roger L. Stavis to subpoena him .
But as noted by the Times , Judge Michael B. Mukasey was presented with some startling evidence that should have provoked him to write a bench warrant to get Mohamed on the stand .
It came during the testimony of FBI agent Robert Fogle , who had been part of a black bag surveillance team from the FBI 's elite Special Operations Group ( SOG ) , which had followed five Middle Eastern men ( dubbed " ME's " ) from the al Farooq mosque on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn to a shooting range at Calverton , Long Island .
Photographing Ali's Trainees
In dozens of color photos , the SOG team captured Nosair , Hampton and three other terrorists later convicted for the World Trade Center bombing  Mahmoud Abouhalima , Mohammed Salameh and Nidal Ayyad  as they fired AK - 47's , pistols and semi-automatic weapons .
The Times piece also noted that a " crucial witness " in the " Day of Terror " trial before Judge Mukasey would be another Egyptian intelligence officer named Emad Salem .
Wrote Times reporter Richard Bernstein , " In 1993 , after the trade center attack , Mr. Salem recorded conversations he had with his F.B.I. contacts in which he seemed to scold them for ignoring his warnings that a terror attack was being planned . "
FBI 's chance to break the Blind Sheikh 's cell As I reported in the first of my three 9/11 investigative books , 1000 Years For Revenge , Salem had been recruited in 1991 by FBI Special Agent Nancy Floyd , a Texan who worked Russian Foreign Counter Intelligence in the FBI 's New York Office .
Risking his life for $ 500.00 a week , Salem got so close to the blind Sheikh that he became his bodyguard .
For more than half a year he burrowed into the al Qaeda - funded cell around Abdel Rahman , interacting with Hampton - El and regularly visiting Nosair , then in Attica for the Kahane murder , as well as reporting back to SA Floyd an incipient al Qaeda plot to blow up " 12 Jewish locations " in New York , including the Diamond District in midtown Manhattan .
Meanwhile , while she chased Russian spies during the day , the tenacious Nancy Floyd had to work double duty debriefing Salem each night .
It seems that Salem 's two " control " agents , NYPD Detective Lou Napoli and Special Agent John Anticev , were rarely around when he needed to talk to them .
Since Salem was n't wearing a wire , he had to spill his guts each night to Floyd , playing for time as he sought to defuse the bombing plot .
Then , in the summer of 1992 , Salem was effectively forced out of his undercover job by Carson Dunbar , an Assistant Director In Charge ( ADIC ) of the FBI 's New York Office who had zero terrorism experience .
Once Salem withdrew from the cell , Sheikh Rahman contacted Pakistan and Ramzi Yousef , an engineer trained in Wales , was shipped to N.Y. to begin building a real weapon of mass destruction .
Starting in early September , 1992 , in the waning days of the first Bush presidency , Yousef connected with Abouhalima , Salameh and Ayyad , all trained by Ali Mohamed , whom the FBI 's elite SOG had under surveillance three years earlier .
The " lone gunman " shooting Incredibly , way back in 1990 , the red - headed Abouhalima and Salameh had been the getaway drivers on the night Ali Mohamed 's other Egyptian trainee , El Sayyid Nosair , gunned down Rabbi Meier Kahane .
They 'd even been taken into custody the night of the killing at Nosair 's Cliffside Park , N.J. home where the FBI recovered top secret memos stolen by Mohamed from the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg .
The murder of Kahane , a world figure , had international conspiracy written all over it , especially when the Feds recovered bomb formulas and pictures of the World Trade Center from the home .
But the very next day , after the NYPD declared the murder a " lone gunman " shooting , " The Red " and Salameh were released .
Over the next two years , Det. Lou Napoli and SA John Anticev made some attempt to track the six foot , two inch Abouhalima , born with red hair , as his fellow jihadis would joke , because of his " Crusader 's Blood . "
Posing as Con Ed workers , they searched his Brooklyn apartment , and he later bragged that he led them on wild goose chases up into Connecticut  where he continued his gun training .
One of the most astonishing discoveries I made in researching Triple Cross , was an FBI # 302 memo written by Napoli  a member of the NYO 's Joint Terrorism Task Force ( JTTF )  just days after the Kahane murder in November of 1990 .
In an interview with the officer of the shooting range in Connecticut , Napoli learned that every weekend for two years , a group of " Mid-Easterners " had been seen firing up to 1,000 rounds per day at silhouette targets vs. bullseyes .
Think about that .
Napoli's office had 1989 surveillance photos of Abouhalima , Ali Mohamed 's trainee , firing an AK - 47 at a Calverton , Long Island range .
The next year , Abouhalima was the getaway driver for Nosair , the Egyptian killer of a world figure like Meier Kahane , and a few days into the murder investigation , Napoli learned that up to 15 " Mid-Easterners " were firing two thousands rounds each weekend in Connecticut , one of the most densely populated states in the Northeast .
Later , he and his partner FBI agent Anticev attempted to follow " The Red " on those shooting sprees into the Nutmeg State , but they failed , somehow , to connect the dots .
In an episode of CSI , the cops would have wrapped that one up in a tight little package and gone to a grand jury .
But , this , please understand , was the New York Office of the FBI  which spent 12 years from the 1989 Calverton surveillance to 9/11 seemingly disconnecting the dots on al Qaeda 's New York cell .
The Way They Got Gotti ?
Flash forward to early September of 1992 , just weeks after Yousef 's arrival in New York .
Napoli and Anticev summoned Abouhalima and a number of other " ME's " down to 26 Federal Plaza in a ham - handed attempt to shake them .
They had the Egyptians fingerprinted .
Next they showed them pictures of the Calverton surveillance and demanded details of the Kahane homicide , asking them if they knew Nosair or the blind Sheikh .
Anticev warned them that eventually the Feds would get Sheikh Rahman the same way theyd gotten John Gotti .
But Abouhalima , a hardened Ali Mohamed - trained operative , just thumbed his nose at the Feds and went back to New Jersey to help Ramzi Yousef morph the " 12 Jewish locations " plot into the World Trade Center bombing conspiracy .
Later , in a bomb factory on Pamrapo Avenue in Jersey City , with Salameh 's help , they constructed the 1,500 pound device that they later planted on the B - 2 level beneath the WTC's North Tower .
" Do n't call me when the bombs go off "
By this time , Emad Salem , Nancy Floyd 's asset , was out of the cell .
But the FBI continued to pay him through the summer , weaning him until he got a new job .
In October , 1992 he met Floyd at a Subway sandwich shop near 26 Federal Plaza to get his last cash payment of $ 500 .
During the brief encounter , Salem tried to warn her .
He 'd caught wind that something was being planned , and he begged her to follow Nosair 's two getaway drivers , Abouhalima and Salameh .
But Floyd 's hands were tied .
She told Salem that in the weeks since he'd left , she 'd been frozen out of the terrorism investigation by ASAC Dunbar .
She would try and pass on the word and encourage the surveillance , but there was little else she could do .
Still , insistent that something terrible was about to happen , Salem issued a chilling warning .
If the FBI would n't follow " The Red and Salameh , " as he'd warned , them , then they should n't " bother to call " him " when the bombs go off . "
Floyd passed on Salem 's warning , but the FBI made no effort to track Salameh and " The Red . "
If they had , they would have led federal agents straight to Yousef and the bomb .
Later , when I asked Det. Lou Napoli why they 'd dropped the ball and failed to follow the highly visible red-headed Abouhalima , he said , " Abouhalima beat feet on us ...
We were trying to locate him but he went to Jersey .
You 've got to remember , there are boundaries .
The Hudson River separates New York and New Jersey . "
But as anybody who watched The Sopranos knows , that 's absurd : The Feds have multi-state jurisdiction to track terrorists .
Yousef 's first WTC attack Around noon on Feb. 26 , 1993 , after the FBI 's New York Office had ignored Salem 's warning , Ramzi Yousef 's gigantic urea - nitrate device went off , blowing through four floors of eleven - inch thick rebarred concrete beneath the Twin Towers .
Six people died , including a pregnant woman .
A thousand were injured .
The night of the blast , as I reported for the first time in 1000 Years For Revenge , a worried Mary Jo White  about to become the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY  was pacing in the office of James Fox , then Assistant Director in Charge ( ADIC ) of the FBI 's New York Office .
At that moment the FBI was putting word out to the press that they suspected " Serbian terrorists " in the blast .
But Napoli and Anticev knew the truth , so they mentioned to White that they'd had an asset " that was very close to these people . "
" Asset ?
What asset ? " snapped White .
When told of Emad Salem , she immediately demanded that Napoli and Anticev " get him in here . "
" Well , " said Lou , " We were paying him , like , five hundred a week .
This time , you know , considering what 's happened , he 's probably gonna want  a million dollars . "
" I do n't give a damn what he wants , " she shot back .
" If he can deliver , give it to him . "
Going back undercover Within days the SDNY prosecutors coaxed Salem into going back under , this time wearing a wire .
Over the next three months , he uncovered the " Day of Terror " plot , later testifying in front of Judge Mukasey as the star witness for prosecutors Andrew McCarthy and Patrick Fitzgerald .
Salem was ultimately paid one and a half million dollars by the Feds for doing what he could have done in the summer of 1992 if FBI officials like Carson Dunbar had n't forced his withdrawal .
So the " Day of Terror " case  which is one of the biggest hash marks on Judge Mukasey 's c.v.  was really nothing more than a " make good " for the Justice Department 's earlier negligence .
Worse , Mukasey 's refusal to shine a light for the jury ( and the press ) on Ali Mohamed , the bin Laden spy who had trained the bombing cell , gave the Feds an excuse for disconnecting dots that did n't come together until Ramzi Yousef 's second date with the Twin Towers on 9/11 .
As reported in 1000 Years For Revenge , as far back as 1994 in Manila , Yousef had hatched the " planes as missiles " plot .
It was merely executed by his uncle Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after Ramzi 's capture in 1995 .
But Yousef was the real " mastermind . "
And by the fall of ' 95 , after the Feds ' " sweeping victory " in the blind Sheikh 's trial , Ali Mohamed was planning al Qaeda 's next attack .
" The Most Dangerous Man " Desperate to get him to turn , the Southern District Feds scheduled their second California sitdown with Ali in the fall of 1997 .
By then , Patrick Fitzgerald was directing I - 49  the bin Laden Squad  in the FBI 's New York Office .
He actually flew across the country to meet Mohammed face to face .
Keep in mind that Fitzgerald had convicted " the blind Sheikh " of seditious conspiracy in the " Day of Terror " case before Judge Mukasey .
But in a Sacramento restaurant , in the presence of FBI agents , Mohamed professed that he " loved " bin Laden and did n't need a fatwa to attack the US ( his adopted country ) .
Further , he admitted to having a network of sleepers who he could make operational at any moment .
For a naturalized citizen and Army vet who had sworn oaths to protect and defend America , Ali 's threat to attack the United States was sedition on its face .
But the handcuffs never came out .
Fitzgerald left the meeting shaken and told FBI agent Cloonan , " Ali Mohamed is the most dangerous man I have ever met .
We can not let this man out on the street . "
And yet Fitzgerald and the Feds left him on the street for another ten months , even though they 'd linked him directly to the Kenyan Embassy bombing cell .
Only after the bombs went off in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam , killing hundreds , was Mohamed finally arrested .
We can only wonder if that carnage might have been prevented if the President 's nominee for Attorney General had pushed for Ali Mohamed 's testimony in 1995 .
Clearly Mohamed would have been outed , terminating his ability to slip in and out of Africa unheeded .
Keeping
Ali off the stand again
In 2001 , when Patrick Fitzgerald convicted the Embassy bombing co-conspirators , paving the way for his appointment as U.S. Attorney in Chicago and the CIA leak czar , Ali Mohamed was , once again , strangely absent from the stand .
The former Egyptian army officer - turned - spy was the one man in custody who could personally identify bin Laden as the person who had fingered the position of the suicide truck bomb in Nairobi .
Under an exception to the hearsay rule for co-conspirator testimony , Ali 's eyewitness testimony would have been both admissible and highly probative .
Yet in the trial against Osama bin Laden , the man who was arguably the most important single adversary to the United States since Adolf Hitler , Fitzgerald risked losing the case rather than using Mohamed , his best witness .
His motivation in hiding Ali from public view may have been similar to that of Andrew McCarthy , who 'd sought to keep Ali off the stand before Judge Mukasey .
" Mohamed would have been opened up by defense lawyers and told the whole sad tale of how he'd used the Bureau and the CIA and the DIA for years , " says retired says retired special agent Joseph F. O'Brien .
" The Bureau could n't risk that kind of embarrassment . "
The Ali Mohamed Enigma Ultimately , the Feds cut a deal with Mohamed .
In return for his silence , he would be spared the death penalty and end up in custodial witness protection .
Today , his case file remains one of the most tightly sealed in the history of the " war on terror . "
As commentator Rory O'Connor later described the Feds ' handling of Mohamed , " it was a conspiracy to cover up incompetence . "
As the new attorney general , Judge Michael B. Mukasey could change all of that .
He could push to get Mohamed 's file unsealed so that the public could finally get a full vetting of the Justice Department 's track record when it came to stopping al Qaeda in the 12 years from when the FBI began tracking its New York cell up through the attacks of 9/11 .
But how likely is that , given Judge Mukasey 's pedigree as an SDNY veteran who joked about Ali 's significance as far back as 1995 ?
Time for Hardball Questions on Mukasey
It 's time for Democrats to start reading the transcript of the " Day of Terror " trial .
It says more than the 9/11 Commission Report about how the New York Feds and the FBI 's New York Office allowed a top al Qaeda spy to eat their lunch for years .
It speaks reams about the judgment of the man Mr. Bush wants to put in charge of a Justice Department hemorrhaging from the U.S. Attorney scandal and reports of unauthorized wiretaps .
Where was Michael Mukasey when he had a chance to put a bona fide al Qaeda terrorist on the stand and connect the dots on bin Laden 's decade - long plan to attack this country ?
He was cozying up to his former colleagues in the Southern District , letting in just enough evidence to get a conviction , but not enough to tip reporters and the public to the sheer failure of the FBI to stop the first Trade Center attack .
He ought to be remembered as the man who kept the Ali Mohamed skeleton in the Justice Department 's closet .
Perhaps now , as Mukasey 's confirmation hearings approach , some lawmakers will have the courage to open the door and shine a light in .

Test your knowledge and common sense in this simple 10 - question test .
Caution :
This section contains sound science , not media hype , and may therefore contain material not suitable for young people trying to get a good grade in political correctness .
It does n't get madder than this .
Swaziland is in the grip of a famine and receiving emergency food aid .
Forty per cent of its people are facing acute food shortages .
So what has the government decided to export ?
Biofuel made from one of its staple crops , cassava .
The government has allocated several thousand hectares of farmland to ethanol production in the district of Lavumisa , which happens to be the place worst hit by drought .
It would surely be quicker and more humane to refine the Swazi people and put them in our tanks .
Doubtless a team of development consultants is already doing the sums .
This is one of many examples of a trade that was described last month by Jean Ziegler , the UN 's special rapporteur , as " a crime against humanity " .
Ziegler took up the call first made by this column for a five - year moratorium on all government targets and incentives for biofuel : the trade should be frozen until second - generation fuels - made from wood or straw or waste - become commercially available .
Otherwise , the superior purchasing power of drivers in the rich world means that they will snatch food from people 's mouths .
Run your car on virgin biofuel , and other people will starve .
Even the International Monetary Fund , always ready to immolate the poor on the altar of business , now warns that using food to produce biofuels " might further strain already tight supplies of arable land and water all over the world , thereby pushing food prices up even further " .
This week , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation will announce the lowest global food reserves in 25 years , threatening what it calls " a very serious crisis " .
Even when the price of food was low , 850 million people went hungry because they could not afford to buy it .
With every increment in the price of flour or grain , several million more are pushed below the breadline .
The cost of rice has risen by 20 % over the past year , maize by 50 % , wheat by 100 % .
Biofuels are n't entirely to blame - by taking land out of food production they exacerbate the effects of bad harvests and rising demand - but almost all the major agencies are now warning against expansion .
And almost all the major governments are ignoring them .
They turn away because biofuels offer a means of avoiding hard political choices .
They create the impression that governments can cut carbon emissions and - as Ruth Kelly , the British transport secretary , announced last week - keep expanding the transport networks .
New figures show that British drivers puttered past the 500bn kilometre mark for the first time last year .
But it does n't matter : we just have to change the fuel we use .
No one has to be confronted .
The demands of the motoring lobby and the business groups clamouring for new infrastructure can be met .
The people being pushed off their land remain unheard .
In principle , burning biofuels merely releases the carbon the crops accumulated when growing .
Even when you take into account the energy costs of harvesting , refining and transporting the fuel , they produce less net carbon than petroleum products .
The law the British government passed a fortnight ago - by 2010 , 5 % of our road transport fuel must come from crops - will , it claims , save between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes of carbon a year .
It derives this figure by framing the question carefully .
If you count only the immediate carbon costs of planting and processing biofuels , they appear to reduce greenhouse gases .
When you look at the total impacts , you find they cause more warming than petroleum .
A recent study by the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen shows that the official estimates have ignored the contribution of nitrogen fertilisers .
They generate a greenhouse gas - nitrous oxide - that is 296 times as powerful as CO2 .
These emissions alone ensure that ethanol from maize causes between 0.9 and 1.5 times as much warming as petrol , while rapeseed oil ( the source of more than 80 % of the world 's biodiesel ) generates 1 - 1.7 times the impact of diesel .
This is before you account for the changes in land use .
A paper published in the journal Science three months ago suggests that protecting uncultivated land saves , over 30 years , between two and nine times the carbon emissions you might avoid by ploughing it and planting biofuels .
Last year the research group LMC International estimated that if the British and European target of a 5 % contribution from biofuels were to be adopted by the rest of the world , the global acreage of cultivated land would expand by 15 % .
That means the end of most tropical forests .
It might also cause runaway climate change .
The British government says it will strive to ensure that " only the most sustainable biofuels " will be used in the UK .
It has no means of enforcing this aim - it admits that if it tried to impose a binding standard it would break world trade rules .
But even if " sustainability " could be enforced , what exactly does it mean ?
You could , for example , ban palm oil from new plantations .
This is the most destructive kind of biofuel , driving deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia .
But the ban would change nothing .
As Carl Bek - Nielsen , vice chairman of Malaysia 's United Plantations Berhad , remarked : " Even if it is another oil that goes into biodiesel , that other oil then needs to be replaced .
Either way , there 's going to be a vacuum and palm oil can fill that vacuum . "
The knock - on effects cause the destruction you are trying to avoid .
The only sustainable biofuel is recycled waste oil , but the available volumes are tiny .
At this point , the biofuels industry starts shouting " jatropha " .
It is not yet a swear word , but it soon will be .
Jatropha is a tough weed with oily seeds that grows in the tropics .
This summer Bob Geldof , who never misses an opportunity to promote simplistic solutions to complex problems , arrived in Swaziland in the role of " special adviser " to a biofuels firm .
Because it can grow on marginal land , jatropha , he claimed , is a " life - changing " plant that will offer jobs , cash crops and economic power to African smallholders .
Yes , it can grow on poor land and be cultivated by smallholders .
But it can also grow on fertile land and be cultivated by largeholders .
If there is one blindingly obvious fact about biofuel , it 's that it is not a smallholder crop .
It is an internationally traded commodity that travels well and can be stored indefinitely , with no premium for local or organic produce .
Already the Indian government is planning 14 m hectares of jatropha plantations .
In August , the first riots took place among the peasant farmers being driven off the land to make way for them .
If the governments promoting biofuels do not reverse their policies , the humanitarian impact will be greater than that of the Iraq war .
Millions will be displaced , hundreds of millions more could go hungry .
This crime against humanity is a complex one , but that neither lessens nor excuses it .
If people starve because of biofuels , Ruth Kelly and her peers will have killed them .
Like all such crimes , it is perpetrated by cowards , attacking the weak to avoid confronting the strong .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp. MSFT.O said on Thursday said it would take a more than $ 1 billion charge to fix " an unacceptable number of repairs " to its Xbox 360 video game consoles and had missed shipment targets for the end of June .
A file photo of visitors playing with Microsoft Corp .'s Xbox 360 game consoles during the opening day of Madrid 's International Data Processing , Multimedia and Communications SIMO Fair November 7 , 2006 .
Microsoft Corp. said on Thursday " an unacceptable number of repairs " to its Xbox 360 will force it to take a charge of more than $ 1 billion for its most recent quarter , and it announced a new , extended warranty for the video game console .

Microsoft is under pressure with mounting complaints about Xbox 360 failures on the Internet and growing expectations that Sony Corp. 6758 .
T could slash the price of its rival PlayStation 3 console at a video game exposition next week .
So far Microsoft has the lead on Sony in the battle for high - end video game machines , but it shipped only 11.6 million 360s by the end of June , compared with a target of about 12 million , Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday .
Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft ’s entertainment and devices division , said the timing of the announcement about the charge for the quarter ending in June and a new extended warranty were unrelated to any potential move by Sony .
“ This is just one of those things that happens when it happens , ” Bach said in an interview .
“ We reached our conclusion early this week and because it ’s a financially meaningful issue we had to announce it immediately . ”
The hardware issue has marred a string of successes for Xbox 360 , which has built an early lead over the PlayStation 3 with Microsoft ’s strong lineup of games and popular online service .
But it is also finding increasing competition for some parts of its business , such as Apple Inc. 's AAPL.O incursion into television shows delivered over the Web , which is also a feature of the Xbox online service .
RED FLASHING LIGHTS
Microsoft said it had investigated the sources of hardware failures indicated by three red flashing lights on the console and had identified “ a number of factors ” that can cause such failures .
Bach said many of those factors took time to show up in the consoles , explaining why the number of repairs had grown in the second year of the Xbox 360 ’s release .
He would not say exactly how many Xbox 360s had been returned due to hardware issues except that “ the number is too large . ”
The company said it would extend warranty coverage to three years to cover the problem and would reimburse customers who had previously paid for repairs related to the three - flashing - lights error message .
It also said it has made improvements to the Xbox 360 console .
The charge will be in a range of $ 1.05 billion to $ 1.15 billion , before taxes , for the quarter ended June 30 , Microsoft said .
Microsoft had already cut its forecast for Xbox 360 shipments in January .
It had previously forecast shipments of 13 million to 15 million by the end of June .
“ What you have to ask yourself as an investor is , should Microsoft be in the hardware business ? ” said Kim Caughey , senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group , which oversees about $ 1.2 billion , including Microsoft shares , for clients .
She added , however , that the charge should not be a concern for long - term investors .
“ It ’s a lot of money , let ’s not say it is n’t , ” Caughey said .
“ But if you ’re a long - term holder , I do n’t think it ’s going to have that great an impact . ”
Bach said the new warranty would not impact the Xbox division ’s plan to turn a profit in fiscal 2008 , which started this month .
He was also mum on the issue of whether Microsoft would announce a price cut for the Xbox 360 console if Sony made a similar move .
“ We will assess what we do with pricing and other aspects of our business based on our own business , ” he said .
Microsoft shares dropped slightly to $ 29.91 after closing at $ 29.99 on Nasdaq .

Oh no ... it 's alive !
In spite of its astounding commercial success , x86 is almost certainly the world 's most - maligned instruction set architecture ( ISA ) .
Predicting the death of x86 used to be a favorite pastime of everyone from bearded mainframe geeks to Mac-using AOLpersons ( especially the latter ) .
But like various bad 80s fashions , x86 may be ugly , but it just keeps coming back .
These days , I do n't field nearly the volume of " When do you think x86 will finally roll over and die ? " questions that I used to .
Indeed , it has been over nine months since I last faced this particular question , in a radio interview for a program called GeekSpeak — this has to be some kind of record for me .
Perhaps the public is finally catching on to the fact that x86 is n't going anywhere .
If so , then that 's progress , but here 's the next reality that x86's ( technically justified ) detractors will have to deal with : not only is x86 not going anywhere , but in 2008 , it 's going everywhere .
Mark my words : in 2008 , you 'll see x86 processors win the first few major battles in a multiyear war to displace the likes of ARM , PowerPC , and MIPS in the pockets , purses , and briefcases of everyone from corporate executives to mall - hopping Paris Hilton wannabes .
2008 will be the year of the must - have x86 - based ultramobile PC ( UMPC ) and mobile Internet device ( MID ) , and from there it's a straight march into a future iteration of the iPhone .
No , I 'm not just mindlessly regurgitating Intel marketing materials ; this prediction is a matter of physics and economics .
The 45nm process node that Intel has brought online and will soon begin ramping up marks an important milestone in the evolution of the world 's most commercially successful ( and most perpetually " old and busted " ) instruction set architecture .
This is the point at which the bulky and bloated x86 ISA elbows its way into the embedded space like a 250 - pound man squeezing into coach class , carrying with it the billions of lines of legacy code that give it such powerful economic and technological inertia .
With a 45 nm x86 processor , you can boot decades ' worth of Windows software without a recompile on a device that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and boasts a four - to six - hour battery life .
This makes 45 nm the point at which things will get really , really interesting on the mobile front .
Of course , it has been possible for some time now to squeeze an x86 - based PC into an ultramobile form factor , but it has n't been cheap or attractive .
Intel may yet find some success with its 90nm , Pentium M-derived " McCaslin " UMPC platform , which just recently launched , but the party wo n't really get started until McCaslin 's 45 nm successor , Menlow , arrives in 2008 .
Menlow and its successor , Moorestown , will fundamentally change the complex cost / power / thermals / compatibility equation that dictates what kind of hardware goes into a commercially viable pocket - sized widget .
Menlow : UMPC and MID
The first major step on the road to a truly portable x86 - based device is the " Menlow " platform that Intel touted at the most recent IDF .
Menlow , which pairs Intel 's 45 nm mobile " Silverthorne " CPU with a special ultramobile chipset called " Poulsbo , " will feature support for 802.11n and WiMAX , so that the whole Menlow package can deliver a full wireless Internet experience by running standard ( x86 ) Linux and Windows browsers .
Speaking of operating systems , Intel is pretty aggressively showcasing Linux as the OS of choice for the UMPC .
Nonetheless , Microsoft is working on something for the devices , which will support Direct3D 9ex and WMV9 .
The iPhone has shown that interface is key — no one should ever have to manipulate a tiny scrollbar with a stylus — and the Linux software that Intel showed me on a Menlow demo unit back at Research@Intel Day looked remarkably iPhone - like .
So we 'll see what Redmond comes up with on that front .
The UI for the Mobile Linux Internet Project .
Source : Moblin.org
The Menlow slides that Intel was showing at IDF are variations on a slide deck that has been around at least since May of this year and IDF Beijing .
One of the slides compares the king of hearts to a similarly sized Menlow motherboard , to show that Intel can now fit an x86 PC in an area not much bigger than a playing card .
One of the major factors behind this high level of integration is Silverthorne .
The Silverthorne CPU .
Source : Intel
Menlow 's Silverthorne CPU as miniscule as you might expect of a 45 nm single - core design .
The whole package for this CPU , which will also power some of Intel 's notebook offerings , is smaller than a penny .
In spite of its small size , however , the processor will pack more horsepower than a similarly - clocked Core Solo ( that is , if it 's a Penryn variant , and I believe it is ) , which is more than enough performance to give a full Web experience using the same binaries of Firefox , Internet Explorer ( and Safari ? ) that run on x86 desktops .

Gingrich is once again straying from the officially sanctioned GOP playbook :
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday the Bush administration is waging a " phony war " on terrorism , warning that the country is losing ground against the kind of Islamic radicals who attacked the country on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
A more effective approach , said Gingrich , would begin with a national energy strategy aimed at weaning the country from its reliance on imported oil and some of the regimes that petro- dollars support .
" None of you should believe we are winning this war .
There is no evidence that we are winning this war , " the ex-Georgian told a group of about 300 students attending a conference for collegiate conservatives .
Newt went on to make the case for Democratic control next year :
" We were in charge for six years , " he said , referring to the period between 2001 and early 2007 , when the GOP controlled the White House and both houses of Congress .
" I do n't think you can look and say that was a great success . "
And he continues to talk as if he wants to take on the pygmies currently running for the nomination of his party :
" I believe we need to find leaders who are prepared to tell the truth ... about the failures of the performance of Republicans ... failed bureaucracies ... about how dangerous the world is , " he said when asked what kind of Republican he would back for president .
So to recap -- Gingrich says Republicans were horrible at governance , that we 're losing the Iraq War , and that Bush 's " war on terror " formulation is , as Edwards has argued , a fabrication .
Hidden Taxes Are Easier to Raise " Time spent paying taxes is important for keeping taxes visible and salient to taxpayers , thereby making it politically harder for the government to raise taxes ...
The introduction of electronic toll booths causes drivers to pay higher tolls - some 20 to 40 percent higher - than if electronic collection had never been introduced . "
Every year , as April 15 approaches , taxpayers must take the time to calculate - and then pay - their federal and state income taxes .
Indeed , economists have estimated that for every dollar paid in taxes , taxpayers incur an additional 10 cents in time costs associated with record keeping and tax filing .
Many policymakers and economists have conjectured that time spent paying taxes is important for keeping taxes visible and salient to taxpayers , thereby making it politically harder for the government to raise taxes .
In E - ZTAX : Tax Salience And Tax Rates ( NBER Working Paper No. 12924 ) , NBER Research Associate Amy Finkelstein investigates this conjectured link between the visibility of taxes and the level of taxes .
She studies the impact of electronic toll collection systems - such as E - ZPass in the Northeast or Fast - Trak in California - on toll rates .
Because these electronic systems automatically deduct the toll as the car drives through the toll plaza , and the driver therefore need no longer actively count out and hand over cash for the toll , electronic payment arguably reduce the visibility of tolls .
Finkelstein finds that this reduced visibility of tolls comes at the cost of higher tolls .
She estimates that the introduction of electronic toll booths causes drivers to pay higher tolls - some 20 to 40 percent higher - than if electronic collection had never been introduced .
For her study , Finkelstein collected 50 years of toll data on 123 publicly owned roads , bridges , and tunnels in the United States .
Starting in 1987 , electronic tolling was introduced on these facilities .
By 2005 , about two - thirds of the facilities used electronic tolling .
Once a facility introduces electronic tolling , drivers start to use the technology , and eventually usage levels out at about 60 percent of toll payments .
Finkelstein finds that as drivers switch to paying tolls electronically , toll authorities raise the toll rates .
As a result , even though many facilities offer discounts to drivers who pay electronically , the toll that drivers end up paying electronically is still higher than it would have been had the facility not introduced electronic tolling ( although it 's lower than what their fellow drivers who still pay with cash have to fork over ! )
The most plausible explanation for the phenomenon , Finkelstein argues , is that drivers who pay the toll electronically do n't notice price hikes as readily as manual - toll users do .
So public resistance to toll increases lessens as more and more drivers pay electronically , and thus transportation authorities are able to push through more toll increases .
Automated tolls , after all , are fairly hidden .
A driver only has to slow down so that her car 's ID tag can be scanned and the toll automatically deducted from her account .
When her balance falls below some preset minimum ( typically $ 10 ) , the transportation authority automatically debits her credit card or bank account .
Small wonder , then , that survey evidence shows that drivers who pay electronically are much less aware of how much they have paid than drivers who pay using cash .
Also supporting the " decreased visibility hypothesis " , Finkelstein finds that traffic decreases less in response to toll increases when a larger share of the tolls are paid electronically ( rather than in cash ) .
The study examined other possible explanations ( than the decline in toll visibility ) for the increase in tolls when the use of electronic tolling rises .
For example : drivers may like the convenience of paying electronically so much that they 're willing to pay more for it .
But that thesis did n't hold up in two telling instances , Finkelstein says .
First , on roads where manual tollbooths really slowed drivers down , the change to electronic tolling saved them much more time .
Yet , these roads did not see unusually high price increases .
Second , drivers saw similarly large savings of time when bridges and tunnels switched from charging tolls in both directions to charging tolls in only one .
But again , the toll increases were not out of line with the norm .
Other possible explanations - that toll authorities had to raise rates because of the costs of installing the automated system or that they used higher rates to battle congestion or recoup revenue - did n't hold up either to the evidence , the study found .
That leaves the original conclusion as the leading explanation : the more hidden the tax , the less resistance it breeds , and the easier it is for governments to raise taxes .

The Java Plug - In has been around for years helping to bring Java to browsers .
It has also brought along its share of headaches and frustrations for users and developers .
Many consumers experienced browser incompatibility issues , browser freezing and even JVM crashes .
However , a few weeks ago it was reported that Sun was rewriting the Java plug - in from the ground up to bring a product to developers and consumers which has been desired for a long time .
InfoQ recently interviewed Nicolas Lorain , the product manager for Java SE , and discussed the rewrite of the Java plug - in slated for Java SE 6 Update N .
What were the main issues with the existing Java Plug - In that warranted a complete rewrite ?
Reliability , portability and functionality .
The existing version of the Java Plug- in was developed " organically " over a period of several years , supporting different combinations of operating system and browser family .
The complexity of the existing code base has resulted in some inconsistent behaviors across different browser families .
This is particularly true for scripting support ( Java / JavaScript interaction ) across different browsers , making it difficult to write cross - browser applets that interacted with the surrounding web page .
While this is by far not unique to Java scripting support , cross platform interoperability is something Sun takes seriously .
Features available to Java Web Start applications such as JRE version selection and JVM command line argument specification , could not be supported in the previous Java Plug - in 's architecture .
A ground - up rewrite was necessary to make applets as powerful as applications launched via Java Web Start .
Sun will provide the new plug - in for Solaris , Linux and Windows which it directly supports .
Apple will continue providing support for the Mac OS , however , Sun is collaborating closely .
With the new plug - in being provided on the aforementioned operating systems Sun has been testing it with Internet Explorer 6 , Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3 Alpha .
InfoQ asked about the lack of support for the widely adopted Firefox 2 ,
Why not design the plug - in to work with the well - adopted Firefox 2 to begin with ?
One of the major changes in the new Plug - in is how we interface with the Firefox browser .
Due to historic reasons , the current Plug - in uses a complex , Java - specific interface called the OJI .
In the new Plug - in we have switched to using the more industry - standard NPAPI and NPRuntime interfaces used by other browser Plug-ins .
We found that there were a couple of minor API additions necessary to both the NPAPI and NPRuntime to support multithreaded plug-ins portably , and to support certain advanced JavaScript interoperability .
These API additions are not Java - specific , but are needed by any suitably complex Plug -in .
There are also some assumptions in the Firefox 2 code base that the Java Plug - in was implemented via the OJI that had to be changed to support an NPRuntime - based Java Plug - in .
Additionally , we expect Firefox 3 to be available within a few months of the Java SE 6 Update N release , which means most Java and Firefox users will have upgraded to Java 6 Update N and Firefox 3 respectively within a short period of time .
For these reasons , we 've decided to first focus on the new Java Plug - in support on Firefox 3 , while addressing Firefox 2 support in a second phase .
We do not have any announcements for explicit Safari or Opera support at this time , but given the fact that the new Plug - in is extremely easy to port , we do not expect this to be an issue overtime , although we cannot make any commitments on behalf of Apple with regards to the JRE for MacOS support for Safari .
Nicolas did mention that ports for other browsers such as Safari and Opera could be done rather easily ,
The new plug - in will be shipped with the JRE starting with Java SE 6 Update N ( aka 6uN ) , however , the new plug - in will be turned off by default .
Therefore , end users will have to configure the plug - in ( through Windows control panel or by changing a symlink on Unix platforms ) to use the latest and greatest .
Finally , InfoQ wrapped the interview with Nicolas Lorain to find out why consumers would want to adopt the new plug -in ,
Absolute reliability Better user experience : no more browser pauses as applets start up or shut down Robust support for advanced applet content incorporating 3D graphics and other features .

Japan 's space agency today launched its much - delayed lunar probe in the most ambitious mission to the moon since the US Apollo space flights .
The Selenological and Engineering Explorer — or Selene — probe was launched on board an H - 2A rocket from Tanegashima , the remote island location of the agency 's space centre .
Footage of the launch carried live on the internet showed the rocket racing through slightly hazy skies .
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( Jaxa ) said the craft 's engines and navigation systems appeared to be operating normally .
" We 're very pleased with how the flight is proceeding so far .
The satellite has separated from the rocket as expected , " said the Jaxa spokesman Hiroshi Sekine .
The 32bn yen ( £ 138.3 m ) Selene is designed to orbit twice around the Earth before going to the moon , a journey expected to take about three weeks .
The launch came four years behind schedule .
The project is the most ambitious lunar mission since Apollo , which began in 1960 , and bigger in scope than Russia 's Luna programme or Nasa 's Clementine and Lunar Prospector projects , according to Jaxa .
Selene involves placing the main satellite in orbit at an altitude of about 60 miles and deploying the two smaller satellites in polar orbits .
Researchers will use data gathered by the probes to study the moon 's origin and evolution .
The main orbiter will remain in position for about a year .
Japan 's mission comes at a time of renewed interest in the moon .
China plans to send a probe , the Chang'e 1 to the moon , possibly this month .
The Chang'e 1 orbiter will use stereo cameras and x-ray spectrometers to map three - dimensional images of the lunar surface and study its dust .
China 's official Xinhua news agency has reported that a manned probe could be launched within 15 years .
Japan is also considering a manned mission by 2025 .
Meanwhile , Google has launched a $ 20 m ( £ 9.9 m ) competition to send a robotic mission to the moon .
To claim the prize , a team of researchers will need to send a rover to the moon , make it roam for a minimum of 500 metres and send video , images and data back to Earth , all before December 31 2012 .

The shift occurred for a variety of reasons , including to prepare for the possibility the case could be referred later on to the U.S. Justice Department or Iraqi authorities for further action , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
“ It is in a sense a hedge against the possibility that an investigation leads to the point where there may need to be a referral ( to the Justice Department or the Iraqi authorities ) , ” he told reporters .
“ It made sense to clearly designate ( who is in charge ) from the beginning , ” he added .
The FBI is the main investigative arm of the Justice Department and has the authority to investigate suspected crimes that could later result in charges being filed .
But McCormack stressed the shift in lead agency did not indicate “ in any way , shape , or form ” that there had been any findings so far that could lead to such a referral .
“ This is an ongoing investigation and no body has come to any conclusions , ” said McCormack .
The September 16 incident , which occurred when Blackwater was protecting a diplomatic convoy , enraged Iraqis and has led to closer scrutiny of the use of security contractors in war zones .
It has also raised questions over laws governing contractors abroad .
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to make all U.S. government contractors accountable under U.S. law for their actions .
A senior U.S. official , who asked not to be named , said if the justice department opened a case against Blackwater it would make it easier to work with FBI investigators who had the lead and were already gathering evidence .
An FBI spokesman confirmed the change in control .
“ The FBI will work closely with the State Department on this matter , ” FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said .
FOUR INVESTIGATIONS
Criminal charges have not been filed against North Carolina - based Blackwater , which has more than 1,000 security staff in Iraq protecting U.S. embassy personnel under a State Department contract .
Blackwater , which has received U.S. government contracts worth more than a billion dollars since 2001 , is also under scrutiny over other shooting incidents involving Iraqis .
The Justice Department has been asked to look into the case of a drunken Blackwater employee accused of shooting dead a security guard for Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul - Mahdi on December 24 , 2006 .
No charges have been filed in that case either .
There are four separate investigations into the September 16 incident , which occurred as Blackwater escorted a diplomatic convoy in Baghdad .
The State Department and FBI are looking into the incident , as are the Pentagon and a joint U.S. - Iraqi team .
In addition , the State Department has appointed a panel of experts to examine the September 16 incident and conduct an overall review of private security contractors in Iraq .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice is expected to get an initial report from the panel on Friday .
Usually , the private contractor would guard U.S. officials visiting Baghdad , but the FBI said the U.S. government would handle security for its agents in Iraq as they investigate .
“ To avoid even the appearance of any conflict , the FBI team deployed from Washington to assist the State Department in the investigation of the events of September 16th will have any additional security needs provided by U.S. government personnel , ” FBI spokesman John Miller said in a statement .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Researchers who launched an experimental cyber attack caused a generator to self - destruct , alarming the federal government and electrical industry about what might happen if such an attack were carried out on a larger scale , CNN has learned .
Department of Homeland Security video shows a generator spewing smoke after a staged experiment .
Sources familiar with the experiment said the same attack scenario could be used against huge generators that produce the country 's electric power .
Some experts fear bigger , coordinated attacks could cause widespread damage to electric infrastructure that could take months to fix .
CNN has honored a request from the Department of Homeland Security not to divulge certain details about the experiment , dubbed " Aurora , " and conducted in March at the Department of Energy 's Idaho lab
In a previously classified video of the test CNN obtained , the generator shakes and smokes , and then stops .
DHS acknowledged the experiment involved controlled hacking into a replica of a power plant 's control system .
Sources familiar with the test said researchers changed the operating cycle of the generator , sending it out of control .
Watch the generator shake and start to smoke »
The White House was briefed on the experiment , and DHS officials said they have since been working with the electric industry to devise a way to thwart such an attack .
" I can't say it [ the vulnerability ] has been eliminated .
But I can say a lot of risk has been taken off the table , " said Robert Jamison , acting undersecretary of DHS 's National Protection and Programs Directorate .
Government sources said changes are being made to both computer software and physical hardware to protect power generating equipment .
And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it is conducting inspections to ensure all nuclear plants have made the fix .
Industry experts also said the experiment shows large electric systems are vulnerable in ways not previously demonstrated .
" What people had assumed in the past is the worst thing you can do is shut things down .
And that 's not necessarily the case .
A lot of times the worst thing you can do , for example , is open a valve -- have bad things spew out of a valve , " said Joe Weiss of Applied Control Solutions .
" The point is , it allows you to take control of these very large , very critical pieces of equipment and you can have them do what you want them to do , " he said .
Adding to the vulnerability of control systems , many of them are manufactured and used overseas .
Persons at manufacturing plants overseas have access to control system schematics and even software program passwords , industry experts say .
Weiss and others hypothesize that multiple , simultaneous cyber-attacks on key electric facilities could knock out power to a large geographic area for months , harming the nation 's economy .
" For about $ 5 million and between three to five years of preparation , an organization , whether it be transnational terrorist groups or nation states , could mount a strategic attack against the United States , " said O. Sami Saydjari of the nonprofit Professionals for Cyber Defense .
Economist Scott Borg , who produces security - related data for the federal government , projects that if a third of the country lost power for three months , the economic price tag would be $ 700 billion .
" It 's equivalent to 40 to 50 large hurricanes striking all at once , " Borg said .
" It 's greater economic damage than any modern economy ever suffered .
...
It 's greater then the Great Depression .
It 's greater than the damage we did with strategic bombing on Germany in World War II . "
Computer experts have long warned of the vulnerability of cyber attacks , and many say the government is not devoting enough money or attention to the matter .
" We need to get on it , and get on it quickly , " said former CIA Director James Woolsey on Tuesday .
Woolsey , along with other prominent computer and security experts , signed a 2002 letter to President Bush urging a massive cyber - defense program .
" Fast and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid a national disaster , " the letter said .
But five years later , there is no such program .
Federal spending on electronic security is projected to increase slightly in the coming fiscal year , but spending in the Department of Homeland Security is projected to decrease to less than $ 100 million , with only $ 12 million spent to secure power control systems .
Despite all the warnings and worry , there has not been any publicly known successful cyber - attack against a power plant 's control system .
And electric utilities have paid more attention to electronic risks than many other industries , adopting voluntary cyber - standards .
" Of all our industries , there are only a couple -- perhaps banking and finance and telecommunications -- that have better cyber - security or better security in general then electric power , " Borg said .
And DHS notes that it uncovered the vulnerability discovered in March , and is taking steps with industry to address it .
While acknowledging some vulnerability , DHS's Jamison said " several conditions have to be in place .
...
You first have to gain access to that individual control system .
[ It ] has to be a control system that is vulnerable to this type of attack . "
" You have to have overcome or have not enacted basic security protocols that are inherent on many of those systems .
And you have to have some basic understanding of what you 're doing .
How the control system works and what , how the equipment works in order to do damage .
But it is , it is a concern we take seriously . "
" It is a serious concern .
But I want to point out that there is no threat , there is no indication that anybody is trying to take advantage of this individual vulnerability , " Jamison said .
Borg notes that industry will have to remain forever vigilant at protecting control systems .
" It will always be an ongoing problem .
It 's something we will have to be dealing with [ for ] lots of years to come , " he said .

WORKERS in Asia and Eastern Europe will get the biggest pay rises next year , according to Mercer , a consultancy .
Its “ Global Compensation Planning Report ” sets out projected increases for white - collar and manufacturing positions in 62 countries .
After inflation , India will see the biggest average increase of 9.8 % as offshoring to the country continues to grow .
Bulgaria benefits from its proximity to big markets in richer western Europe .
Employees in rich countries have less to look forward to , with increases ranging from 2.6 % in Ireland to just 0.9 % in the Netherlands .

Six Asiatic wild elephants were electrocuted as they went berserk after drinking rice beer in India 's remote north - east .
The 40 - strong herd uprooted an electric pole while looking desperately for food on Friday in Chandan Nukat , a village nearly 150 miles west of Shillong , the capital of Meghalaya state , said Sunil Kumar , a state wildlife official .
" There would have been more casualties had the villagers not chased them away , " said Dipu Mark , a local conservationist .
The elephants are known to have a taste for rice beer brewed by tribal communities in northeastern India .
Four wild elephants died in a similar incident in the region three years ago .
Also last week , five rare Asiatic lions were found electrocuted on the edge of Gir National Park , in western India .
Authorities said the lions were killed on an electrified fence a villager had put up illegally to protect crops near the sanctuary .
The north - east of India accounts for the world 's largest concentration of wild Asiatic elephants , with the states of Assam and Meghalaya alone estimated to have 7,000 of them .
" It 's great to have such a huge number of elephants , but the increasing man-elephant conflict following the shrinkage in their habitat due to the growing human population is giving us nightmares , " said Pradyut Bordoloi , a former environment minister in the state of Assam .
Wild elephants have killed more than 600 people in Assam in the past 16 years .
Satellite imagery by the National Remote Sensing Agency , a federal body , shows that as much as 280,000 hectares of thick forests in Assam have been cleared by human encroachment between 1996 and 2000 .
Villagers have also been killing elephants with poison .
Nineteen wild elephants were killed in 2001 after feasting on standing crops and demolishing several homes in Assams Sonitpur district , 180 kilometres north of Gauhati , the capital of Assam .
As I wrote awhile back , Montenegro has gotten approval for its own top - level country code domain ( ccTLD ) .

I put a question in to the registry as to what their policy will be for those living outside of the country .
I ’m sure they are well aware of the revenue implications of a more relaxed registration policy .
UPDATE : I was just told that the registry does intend to open this domain to the world , which means there could be quite a run on domains when it becomes available .
They still have not yet selected a registrar to handle registrations for the public .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
One of Hillary Clinton 's most important courtships began early last year , around a formal dinner table at Georgetown 's Four Seasons Hotel .
Her targets were Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack and his wife , Christy .
Mack was already active politically - but on behalf of Clinton 's political opponents .
A Bush " Ranger , " he had raised at least $ 200,000 for the President 's reelection bid and was one of the most prominent business names on GOP donor lists .
At one time his name had circulated as a potential Bush Treasury Secretary .
But these are strangely fluid political times , with long - held alliances shifting under the weight of an unpopular President , an unpopular war and no obvious White House heir on either side .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY ) Senator Barack Obama , ( D - IL ) Rudolph Giuliani , former Republican Mayor of New York City Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) More from Fortune Will Mmmhops be a hit ?

You do n't have to be an early leader to earn big - name backers .
Through personal connections and home - state political relationships , business leaders also turn out for the latecomers and long shots .
Behind in fundraising but not forgotten by friends Fred Thompson Supporter : James A. Haslam II CEO , Pilot Corp .
The late arriver is snagging undecideds like the Knoxville convenience - store mogul .
Mike Huckabee Supporter : John Tyson CEO , Tyson Foods Former governor is backed by Arkansas business , including Wal - Mart heir Jim Walton .
Tommy Thompson Supporter : Darshan Dhaliwal President , Bulk Petroleum Thompson courts local big cheeses like the Milwaukee - based gas - station tycoon .
Joseph Biden Supporter : Charles Cawley Former CEO , MBNA
The founder of the Delaware - based bank has supported Biden for many years .
Bill Richardson Supporter : William Greehey CEO , Valero Energy Richardson , a Clinton Energy Secretary , served on Valero 's board in 2001 -- 02 .
Chris Dodd Supporter : Steve Cohen Founder , SAC Capital Many Greenwich hedge fund heavies turn out for Connecticut 's senior Senator .
Morgan Stanley ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) chief administrative officer Thomas Nides , a former Clinton trade official and one of the Democratic Party 's more astute strategists , understood the possibilities better than most .
That 's why he had invited the Macks to a fundraiser for Clinton 's Senate reelection at his Washington home - and then completed the evening by taking the trio to dinner at the Four Seasons .
The subject of a Clinton presidential bid never came up that night - except in Nides 's whirling brain .
He knew that the prospect of persuading his Republican boss to support a Clinton presidential bid was a long shot .
But he also appreciated the importance of trying .
Adding such a prominent GOP executive to the Clinton roster would counteract business fears that the former First Lady is a big - government , big - spending , big - taxing liberal .
" It would say to the business community , ' It 's safe to swim here , ' " Nides recalled .
The conversation that night ranged widely , but always returned to one subject : health - care reform .
John Mack chairs the board of trustees at New York - Presbyterian Hospital .
Christy Mack , the daughter of a doctor , helped found the Bravewell Collaborative to promote health care that treats " the whole person , not just the disease . "
Hillary Clinton was on familiar territory - and managed to charm the couple not only with her " intelligence and educated responses , " as Christy Mack recalls , but also with her one - on - one charisma .
" You have these preconceived ideas about people you see in the public eye , " says Christy .
" But we were extremely impressed with her ability to connect with every single person .
She was an amazing listener , with tremendous warmth . "
The relationship could have ended there - a New York Senator engaging her local constituents .
But early this year Clinton upped the ante with a phone call to the Morgan Stanley CEO , asking him to support her presidential bid .
When he demurred , she asked for a meeting .
Once again - this time over coffee - John and Christy Mack found themselves enticed .
When Mack returned to his office , he told Nides he was ready to commit .
" John , you can wait , you do n't have to commit yet , " Nides responded .
" No , " Mack replied , " early support is better support . "
Days later Mack picked up the phone and sealed the deal .
Clinton , Nides recalls , " put the time in . "
Multiply that effort many times over , and you can understand why the safe to swim signs are sprouting up all over Clinton Inc .
Yet she is not the only Democrat to achieve surprising success in a realm traditionally taken for granted by Republicans .
Her leading Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , has made forays into Wall Street and Hollywood to nab business support .
He , too , has found admirers among top Republicans , most notably John Canning Jr. , CEO of Chicago private - equity firm Madison Dearborn .
For their part , top GOP candidates like Rudy Giuliani , John McCain and Mitt Romney have lined up a small army of pinstriped pitchmen .
But what 's different this time is that CEOs are up for grabs on both sides .
A Fortune survey of where business leaders are lining up in the 2008 race , based on dozens of interviews with top executives , reveals a concerted push by Democratic candidates to secure the blessing of big business while they continue to take their swipes at corporate America on behalf of the little guy .
Even at this early stage of the primary race , the business endorsements of Clinton alone rival - in size , scope and prestige the list of CEOs publicly supporting the Kerry - Edwards ticket in the 2004 general election .
The more than 150 top executives who have raised money for Clinton represent such brand names as Anheuser - Busch ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Comcast ( Charts ) , Est�e Lauder , Palm ( Charts ) , Sun Microsystems ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Qualcomm ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Venture capitalist James D. Robinson III , the former CEO of American Express and a longtime Republican , told Fortune he now supports Clinton for President , citing her " breadth of experience , especially on the international level , which is critical for going forward . "
Crossing party lines
A difficult war tests loyalties among business leaders , just as it does among other voters , who increasingly identify themselves as Democrats .
But Iraq is only one factor behind this year 's wide - open race for business support .
With the scandals of the early part of the decade behind them , corporate leaders are once again emerging as opinion leaders - not only speaking out on such issues as health care , taxes and the environment , but calling for government action .
" This has been an important period for businesses of all sizes , " Clinton told Fortune .
" They really can't control health - care costs . "
And Clinton 's Senate tenure has been a significant antidote to her controversial stint as a First Lady proposing health - care reform , which critics decried as an attempt to nationalize medicine .
" There has been a real opportunity to know me and work with me , " she says , " and to develop personal friendships . "
Not to be discounted is that corporate America likes to bet on winners .
Coming on the heels of the Democratic takeover of Congress , the party has a real shot at winning the White House .
For Republican candidates , a sour political environment is only the beginning of the battle .
With several strong candidates and no clear front - runner , a business community that largely united behind George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 is now more fractured , with most major Bush donors still sitting on the sidelines .
" Even in 2000 , Bush was the presumptive nominee , " notes longtime GOP fundraiser and Thayer Capital chairman Fred Malek .
" Signing up with Bush was a no - brainer . "
Business leaders can provide added heft to a candidate 's fundraising efforts - the major candidates are expected to raise a record $ 1.4 billion in this race - but they also help a candidate 's image branding .
Democrat John Edwards , who offers sharp - edged populism , is a tougher sell to business .
But Clinton and Obama view CEO support as a key part of their crossover appeal .
A roster of business endorsements " says to voters that you 'll be strong on the economy , " says Clinton campaign chair Terry McAuliffe .
Most of the top - tier candidates - Republican and Democrat - have made pilgrimages to the Business Roundtable 's offices in Washington to pitch some 60 CEOs at a time .
Longtime Republican Harry Sloan , chief of MGM Studios , told Fortune he had been approached by Obama and Clinton , as well as supporters of second - tier candidates Christopher Dodd and Joseph Biden .
But he 's sticking with McCain , whom he calls " the most principled political leader of our generation . "
Still , Sloan notes that McCain is a more difficult sell than in his 2000 run , when he even drew admirers from liberal - dominated Hollywood .
Those days are over .
" Because of the Iraq war and John 's position on the war right now , the same people are n't prepared to fully support him , " says Sloan .
" And many have n't given money for that reason . "
Despite Democratic inroads into the business community , the three top declared GOP candidates have long careers that give them connections to name - brand players .
Former Massachusetts Governor Romney has used his deep roots in business to enlist the likes of Miami Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga and Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller , as well as Staples founder Tom Sternberg .
In Silicon Valley he counts on eBay CEO Meg Whitman and Next Solutions CEO Doug Wilson , while onetime colleagues like Bain & Co. founder William Bain , his former boss , stand by their man .
" It 's the strength of his leadership ability , his get - it - done attitude , " says Marriott CEO Bill Marriott .
Giuliani's Wall Street support is n't as broad as that of fellow New Yorker Clinton , but he has culled important business support in Texas and elsewhere .
Billionaire hedge fund manager T. Boone Pickens has raised nearly $ 1 million for the candidate .
" In New York he cleaned up the city , ran Mafia convictions , then [ handled ] 9/11 , " Pickens says .
Giuliani also has the support of Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks , billionaire investor Sid Bass , and superstar activist Carl Icahn .
McCain has won the backing of FedEx chief Fred Smith , Cisco CEO John Chambers , New York Stock Exchange chief John Thain , and Boston Scientific 's Pete Nicholas .
In contrast to the grass - roots conservative voters McCain is trying to woo in his primary battle , top executives applaud the Senator 's willingness to work with Democrats on issues like immigration reform .
Mixed loyalties
This year 's scramble for the business seal of approval can make it hard for candidates to pin down a loyal commitment .
Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman and Amgen CEO Kevin Sharer have written checks to McCain - and to Romney .
Verizon CEO
Ivan Seidenberg has donated to John McCain - but also to Clinton .
Among Democrats , too , looks can be deceiving .
Much attention was lavished on hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones 's splashy May 19 fundraiser for Obama at his waterfront mansion in Greenwich , Conn .
Less noticed was the $ 2,300 check he wrote to Giuliani just two months earlier .
David Geffen invited presidential prospect Michael Bloomberg to his Beverly Hills home June 19 for an intimate dinner - but he 's formally supporting Obama .
" I 'd say 75 percent of the donor community in Hollywood has given to multiple candidates , " says Andy Spahn , longtime political advisor to top entertainment figures .
" For these people $ 2,300 [ the legal cap on donations ] is not a stretch . "
Regardless of their personal feelings , many CEOs avoid publicly aligning themselves with a candidate , concerned about offending boards , employees and customers .
" If you 're a consumer products company and you get your head up too high , you 're going to alienate some customers , " notes Malek .
" Even if you produce industrial products - there are customers who are Democratic and customers who are Republican . "
But FedEx CEO
Smith insists that his personal support for McCain aligns with his company 's interest in reducing America 's dependence on foreign oil and maintaining a robust free - trade stance .
" Those would be two of the issues that loom very large in this election that would be directly on point with FedEx 's business interests , " he told Fortune .
Likewise , supporters of Democratic candidates say their companies would benefit from federal action to reform the health - care system .
When I told a leading GOP fundraiser the news that John Mack had thrown his weight behind Clinton , she was stunned .
" You 're kidding me , right ? " ( Actually she expressed the sentiment more graphically . )
Says GOP veteran Malek , a McCain supporter : " It concerns me that any solid - thinking top businessperson would go the Democratic route , given the party 's liberal ideology . "
Clinton 's critics say a close reading of her Senate record should give business leaders pause .
The Chamber of Commerce estimated that she voted with that group 's position 45.8 percent of the time ; for the National Association of Manufacturers , it was 16 percent in the last Congress .
Still , notes a conservative investment banker , " I do n't think Hillary Clinton scares people the way she did in the ' 90s . "
And that gives her an opening with former opponents .
Jeffrey Volk , global head of Citigroup 's agency and trust business , was with his wife and freshman daughter at Tulane University when Hurricane Katrina struck .
( Like others interviewed for this story , Volk stressed that his political views are personal and not his firm's . )
The family was stranded in a hotel room , fearful - like others - as power faltered , water levels rose and chaos engulfed New Orleans .
His many efforts to reach Washington officials ended in a black hole of automated voicemail .
That was when this lifelong Republican called his home - state Senator 's office .
The Clinton staffer who took his case was n't able to produce an airlift for stranded New Yorkers and others , as Volk requested , but he did call the family several times a day to check on them .
" When I was in harm 's way , her office was there to help me and my family , " Volk says .
When he returned to New York , Volk made it a point to meet Clinton at a small event at the home of a mutual friend in White Plains .
He went there simply to thank her , but at the end of a two - hour policy discussion , Volk - who once helped Ronald Reagan craft an economic platform - had decided he wanted to support her .
What converted him : " Her knowledge of issues , the tradeoffs you have to make for a pragmatic policy , her grasp of details on subjects ranging from fiscal policy to taxes and trade . "
But Clinton does n't always go over with business executives - especially outside Wall Street , Silicon Valley , and Hollywood .
Obama Democrats insist that Clinton remains a polarizing figure , which gives their candidate - with his " let 's all get along " theme book - his own opening in the business community .
Obama 's inclusive style is often an easier sell to corporate leaders looking for someone with whom they can do business .
Obama supporters say that while Clinton is relying on establishment Democratic players , they 've tapped into a new pool of business leaders who were n't politically active before now .
" That pool of people is vastly larger " than the usual suspects , says Boston Provident partner Orin Kramer , a leading Democratic figure in New Jersey .
Wall Street in particular began leaning Democratic in the 2006 congressional election , making it a ripe target for Obama and Clinton .
Their GOP foes are bemused by the trend .
" A lot of hedge fund managers and others who are younger do n't remember when you had bad tax policy and how powerful the negative effects can be on the economy , " says investor James Higgins , co-founder of the conservative Monday Meeting in Manhattan .
Indeed , on tax policy especially , most business leaders are out of sync with Democrats , who want to limit the Bush tax cuts , penalize companies that build plants overseas , and increase taxes on private equity and tax funds .
Asked about this , Clinton 's GOP business supporters say they have other priorities .
Volk wants to see the federal budget balanced .
Robinson wants healthcare and education policies that will improve America 's competitiveness .
Hillary Clinton says simply , " It 's important not to have a tax discussion separate from [ deciding ] what are our goals . "
For Clinton , there is an underlying tension between the candidate who can do business with business - and the candidate who must curry support from the party 's left wing to win the nomination .
At a speech before grass - roots activists in Washington on June 20 , she was booed by antiwar activists but applauded when she took corporate America to task .
Deriding the country 's " highest concentration of wealth ... since 1929 , " she declared , " Let 's start holding corporate America responsible , make them pay their fair share again .
Enough with the corporate welfare !
Enough with the golden parachutes !
And enough with the tax incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas .
We have to make sure there is not a single benefit they would get for doing that . "
Five hours later she was on the phone with Fortune - and her tone was far more measured .
Asked how she could balance an appeal to business with that sharp rhetoric , the Senator answered , " To me it 's about getting back into balance .
It 's the search for that balance that 's appealing to a lot of business leaders .
They know I 'm trying to figure out how we can have shared prosperity . "
As any CEO can tell you , it ai n't as easy as it sounds .
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Through persistence and patience , Clinton has assembled what is probably the broadest CEO support among the candidates , ranging from Wall Street to Hollywood .
John Mack CEO , Morgan Stanley Winning over the longtime Republican sent a signal about Clinton 's clout on Wall Street .
Sheryl Sandberg VP , global online sales , Google " I was always hoping she 'd run for President .
She 's uniquely qualified . "
Steve Rattner Managing principal , Quadrangle Group " I 've been a longtime supporter of the Clintons .
I knew I 'd end up in her camp . "
Steven Spielberg Co-founder , DreamWorks
The mogul co-hosted a fundraiser at the home of News Corp. president Peter Chernin .
Haim Saban CEO , Saban Capital Group " I endorsed Hillary before Hillary decided to endorse herself .
I 'm on a mission . "
James D. Robinson III General partner , RRE Ventures
The former AmEx CEO likes her " breadth of experience , especially on the international level . "
Rudolph Giuliani
The former New York City mayor has built a team of fundraisers he has known since early in his career , but his support on Wall Street suffers a bit from lingering feelings that he was overzealous as a prosecutor .
Carl Icahn Billionaire investor and activist " Republicans have to pick the candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton .
Rudy is the one . "
T. Boone Pickens Founder , BP Capital hedge fund " Every time they rang the bell , the guy was there .
He finished every fight . "
Paul Singer Founder , Elliott Assoc. hedge fund " I believe the mayor is the strongest and most conservative candidate in the race . "
Bill Simon Venture capitalist " When you 're the mayor of New York , you do have a foreign policy . "
James Turley CEO , Ernst & Young Besides creating a business alliance with Giuliani in 2002 , Turley is a fundraiser .
Randy Levine President , New York Yankees
" He did an outstanding job during and after 9/11 .
Overtime he 's become a great leader . "
Barack Obama
The Illinois Senator has a solid base of business support in Chicago but has also fared well with Hollywood media moguls and has aggressively moved into Clinton 's turf among East Coast financiers .
Oprah Winfrey Founder , Harpo Productions
Her endorsement of Obama was the first ever forthe billionaire media powerhouse .
Penny Pritzker Chairman , Classic Residence by Hyatt " I 've watched him dialogue with CEOs .
Heads are nodding , people are excited . "
David Geffen Co-founder , DreamWorks
He endorsed Obama - but first took a public swipe at his old friends , the Clintons .
Jeffrey Katzenberg Co-founder , DreamWorks
" His sense of right and wrong , what 's just and fair , is what 's needed for these times . "
James S. Crown President , Henry Crown & Co .
The investor says his family , one of Chicago 's wealthiest , " is solidly behind " the candidate .
Orin Kramer General partner , Boston Provident " We 're tapping into people in business who have n't been involved in the process . "
Mitt Romney
Romney has accumulated an impressive business lineup just by courting the " low - hanging fruit , " as Bill Marriott puts it , of friends and associates from private equity , Boston , and the Mormon community .
Bill Marriott CEO , Marriott International Tapping his deep Rolodex in the hotel industry .
" People like what he did with Massachusetts . "
David Neeleman Founder and former CEO , JetBlue Trying to bring
Mitt into the middle ground .
" I think he 's moderate in a lot of ways . "
Bill Bain Founder , Bain & Co. �ber - consultant and longtime mentor .
" Mitt understands why companies decide to invest . "
Meg Whitman CEO , eBay Serves as campaign chair .
" Democrat or Republican , he would hire the right people . "
Wayne Huizenga Owner , Miami Dolphins Courted by Rudy , but likes Mitt 's " conservative principles , like smaller government . "
Bill Harrison Former CEO , J.P. Morgan Chase Hosts Greenwich , Conn. , and New York City events .
" Mitt connects unbelievably well with people . "
John Edwards
As a former trial lawyer campaigning on a pro-union platform , Edwards is not the go - to guy for big business .
Yet he has important allies , including many at a hedge fund where he once consulted .
James Sinegal Co-founder and CEO , Costco stores
The lifelong Democrat threw his support behind Edwards after hearing his plans on health care .
Wesley Edens CEO , Fortress Investment Group About 100 of the secretive financier 's employees have donated to Edwards 's campaign .
Leo Hindery Chairman , InterMed Advisors Edwards has made the former cable - TV magnate his senior economic advisor .
Howard Schultz Chairman , Starbucks
The coffee mogul hosted a fundraiser at his Seattle home for about 150 potential donors .
Andy Rappaport Venture capitalist , August Capital " I believe that if the 2004 ticket had been reversed , John Kerry would be Vice President today . "
Jason Flom CEO , Capitol Music Group Flom has sought support for Edwards within the music industry by hosting fundraisers .
John McCain
The Senator from Arizona has gone head - to - head with the Senator from New York to win Wall Street support .

After more than a year of living in a shack , my husband and I will be moving .
This will be the third time in three years–and hopefully the last for a very long time .
Every time I move , I vow it will be the last time I do it without hiring movers .
And then I found out the cost of hiring movers .
Even at the cheapest rate with the minimum number of hours from decent Orlando based auto movers , we were still looking at at least $ 300 .
“ What is $ 300 in the grand scheme of things , ” I tried to convince myself .
And then I found out that we were going to have to put every penny we had into our deposit and first and last month ’s rent .
Ouch .
So the whole idea that we would hire movers quickly went out the window–and the new plan is How to Move in the Cheapest Way Possible .
Here are some ways on how to save money on your move :
Not Paying for Boxes
A lot of companies I know have boxes in their mailing or shipping department they end up just throwing away .
For the past two weeks , I ’ve become best friends with the mail crew and visit them everyday to get a brand new batch of boxes .
I heard the dumpsters behind TJ Maxx are also great places to conjure up some boxes of all shapes and sizes .
And if you ’re not in the mood for a little dumpster diving , Craigslist always has offers of free boxes .
There are , of course , those meanies who try and sell you each box for $ 1 but if you plan enough in advance , you can mostly likely score some free boxes .
Making lots of friends
I ’m lucky that my husband works for a fire department , which means lots of able - bodied men willing to help out .
Yes , your friends may hate you when you ask them to help you move , but just know you ’ll be the first person they call to repay the favor .
To be the best possible moving hostess , make sure to pack everything up before they arrive .
And also , use their manpower for the heavy stuff , like beds and furniture .
Let the weaklings ( like me ) carry the boxes .
Extending your move - in date
We find ourselves very lucky that we have a landlord who is willing to start letting us move stuff in before our lease actually begins .
This will allow us to make a lot of small trips to drop off boxes .
And we do n’t have to pay double rent while we ’re moving .
Ask your landlord if they ’d be willing to add this as a perk to your lease .
Using large cars
We plan on using my dad ’s truck and my husband ’s trucks to transport all the boxed items .
We ’ll be renting a 17 - foot U - haul truck to transport all the big items in one big swoop .
Try to limit your rented vehicle to the items that you must import in it .
If you use it for small boxes , you may have to do more than one trip and this will cost a lot of money as most vehicle renting agencies charge by the mile .
Claiming your move as an expense
If all else fails , you may be eligible to at least claim your move as a taxable expense if you had to move due to a job .
Check the tax code to make sure you are eligible .

One popular trick is to hide a room behind a bookcase that looks like a standard built - in but is equipped with hidden hinges , rollers and handles , as at the Beghous ’ house .
Contractors can either build the bookcases themselves or buy a piece from a growing collection of companies , including Niche Doors , the Hidden Door Company , Hide a Door , Secret Doorways and Decora Doors .
Prices range from about $ 800 for the most basic models to more than $ 10,000 for custom - made versions .
Steven Humble is the owner and chief engineer of Creative Home Engineering , a two - year - old business in Tempe , Ariz. , that specializes in mechanized doors that conceal rooms or safes .
He echoed others in the business in saying that his customers are evenly split between those who plan to use their hidden rooms for security ( either to hide valuables or to hide themselves in an emergency ) and those who just think they are “ really cool . ”
His company has built about 25 customized doors , bookcases , safes and assorted pieces , for new and remodeled homes , including a fireplace with a rear wall that swings open to reveal a room beyond , for a house in Arkansas .
Prices run from about $ 5,000 to $ 25,000 .
Last month Mr. Humble installed a pair of hidden doors in a house in a town north of Sioux Falls , S.D. , for ABC ’s “ Extreme Makeover : Home Edition . ”
“ Whether it ’s for home security or people ’s images of living like James Bond , it seems to be something people respond to , ” he said .
James Bond , or Herman Munster .
When Louise Kircher , a retired teacher , and her husband , Dennis , a former accounting manager at Boeing , moved into their year - old , 4,300 - square - foot contemporary home in Mesa , Ariz . , in January , the staircase in the master bedroom was “ something extra that came with the house , ” Mrs. Kircher said , and reminded them of something out of “ The Munsters . ”
It rises to reveal a hidden room , where she and her husband store an antique bedroom set and a replica of a gilded mummy ’s coffin .
“ The ceiling is only five and a half feet in there , ” she said .
“ I think it would make a great playroom for grandkids . ”
Secret rooms speak to the homeowner ’s sense of playfulness and perhaps to something deeper .
“ When we started the company we thought we were going to only attract eccentrics , ” said Krystal Strong , co-owner of Hide a Door in Humble , Tex. , whose doors ’ average cost is $ 1,600 .
“ But I think everybody is on the eccentric side ; they want to make their home unique . ”

To Sarah Susanka , a residential architect based in Raleigh , N.C. , and author of “ The Not So Big House , ” a hidden room is “ a way to individualize your house . ”
She said , “ For a house to feel like a home , people have to put more of themselves in their house . ”
She remembered a woman in St. Paul who asked for a room hidden behind the rear wall of a closet .
“ She said she wanted a secret room for her art studio , ” Ms. Susanka said .
“ She was a very introverted person , and she had to hide in order to let this expressiveness out . ”
The magic wand tool has always fascinated me : it is a common tool to find in a bitmap editor , it can select a complex array of pixels , and until I started studying image processing , it was n’t at all intuitive how it was implemented .
Since it is such a common tool , and Cocoa / Quartz does n’t provide an obvious way of implementing it , I thought I would attempt to tackle how to implement it here .
There is a lot more involved in implementing a magic wand tool than I originally thought .
Although generating a bitmap mask that selects pixels is the obvious thing that I had to do , implementing the marching ants around the bitmap selection was also surprisingly involved .
After figuring out both the image mask generation and marching ants , I decided the article would n’t be complete unless I also implemented a basic copy operation , so the user could copy the selection into another application .
Although not technically part of the magic wand tool , implementing a copy command shows how you would actually use the selection generated by the magic wand tool .
Overview
The idea of a magic wand is simple .
The user clicks on a point in the image , and the magic wand tool finds all the pixels around that point that are similar in color , given a tolerance level , and selects them .
For example , given the following picture :
If the user clicked in the middle of the blue , magnifying glass - like shape , the magic wand would select all the blue pixels connected to it , and draw marching ants around it , like so :
From here , the user can select the Edit >
Copy menu item to copy the selected pixels to the clip board .
In this case , the contents of the clipboard would look like :
There are three interesting things happening here , that I ’ll dig into deeper .
First is the determination of which pixels around the clicked point should be selected , and the generation of an image mask .
Second is the generation of a vector path from the image mask , that can be used to render the marching ants around the selection .
Finally , there is using the image mask in conjunction with the original image , to pull out the selected pixels and put them on the clipboard .
The selection
Before I delve into how to generate a bitmap selection , I wanted to touch on what the selection is made up of .
In bitmap applications the selection is merely an image mask the same size as the canvas .
For each pixel in the original image , there is a pixel in the image mask that says whether that pixel is in the selection or not .
You can think of an image mask as an image with a grayscale color space and no alpha .
Each pixel has a range of 0 to 255 , where 255 means the corresponding pixel is off , or not in the selection , while a value of 0 means the corresponding pixel in the image is in the selection .
Although each pixel in the image mask has a range of 0 to 255 , we only use the values 0 and 255 for the purpose of pixel selection .
CoreGraphics allows an image mask to be used to clip the drawing context .
So by setting the image mask ( i.e. selection ) as a clip before drawing the image , you can draw just the pixels in the selection .
Determining the selected pixels
The algorithm for determining the selected pixels is basically a flood fill algorithm , which has been well documented .
The basic idea is , given a point , look to the top , bottom , left and right and see if they match the specified color .
If they do , then mark the corresponding point in the mask .
The pseudo - code for the naive algorithm is :
void Select ( float x , float y , Color colorToMatch ) { Color color = GetColor( x , y ) ; if ( color == colorToMatch ) { SetPixelOnInMask(x , y ) ; Select( x - 1 , y , colorToMatch ) ; Select( x + 1 , y , colorToMatch ) ; Select( x , y - 1 , colorToMatch ) ; Select( x , y + 1 , colorToMatch ) ; } }
Please note that the above is pseudo - code and leaves out a couple of implementation details , such as stopping at the edge of the image , not revisiting pixels it has already visited , and the implementations for GetColor ( ) and SetPixelOnInMask ( ) .
It is provided merely to illustrate how logically the algorithm should work .
If the specified point matches the color we want , then we mark it in the image mask as part of the selection , and recurse on all four points around the matching point .
This algorithm will work as is , except that it would be exceptionally slow and possibly blow the top off of the stack from all the recursion .
So although the pseudo - code is a good logical demonstration of what we want to do , no one actually implements a flood fill algorithm this way .
Instead of using recursion , the algorithm I will describe uses a loop and a stack of line segments to keep track of the pixels that need to be examined .
In this algorithm , the selection is created one horizontal line segment at a time .
The algorithm starts out searching to the left and right of a specified point , looking for adjacent pixels with the same color that we want to select .
The search left or right stops when a pixel that does n’t match the specified color is encountered .
A line segment is created from this search .
This line of pixels are in the selection , so they are marked in the image mask , and the line segment is pushed onto the stack for later processing .
Then the algorithm loops until the stack is empty , processing each line segment on the stack one at a time .
For each line segment encountered , it will walk the points directly above and below it , repeating the line search at the beginning of the algorithm .
Any line segments found in this search will be added to the stack .
This is continued until the stack is depleted .
To ensure the algorithm does n’t loop back on itself , a map is used to mark which pixels have already been examined .
Take the following zoomed image as an example .
Let ’s assume the user clicks at the point ( 4 , 1 ) , which is where a blue pixel resides .
At the start of our algorithm , all the mask pixels are white , meaning nothing is selected :
The first thing to do is perform a line search .
We do that by traveling left of the the specified point ( 4 , 1 ) and see how far in that direction we can go before we hit a pixel that is not blue .
As you can see we can only go one pixel before we hit a white pixel .
So our leftmost edge for the current line segment is 3 .
Next we travel right from the specified point ( 4 , 1 ) until we reach a non - blue pixel .
On the right side we also only go one pixel , leaving our rightmost edge as 5 .
Now that we have identified an entire line segment as being in the selection , we can mark it as such in the mask .
Our mask now becomes :
Finally , we push the line segment we just found , [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] onto the once empty stack .
We enter the part of the algorithm where we pop the top line segment , [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] , off the stack and process it .
First we walk each integer point on the line segment , checking the point directly above it .
Since our line segment is [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] , we will check points ( 3 , 0 ) , ( 4 , 0 ) , and ( 5 , 0 ) .
Checking point ( 3 , 0 ) , we find the color blue , so we start the line search again .
We search left and find that 0 is our left most edge .
We then search right of ( 3 , 0 ) , but there are no blue pixels there , so our right edge is 3 .
Since we found a new line segment , [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 3 , 0 ) ] , we mark it on the mask like so :
Then we push the line segment [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 3 , 0 ) ] onto the stack to be further processed .
We finish checking above the first line segment we found , [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] , by looking at the pixels at ( 4 , 0 ) , and ( 5 , 0 ) .
However , they are not blue , so we do n’t do anything with them .
Before we can be finished with the [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] line segment , we have to look at the points directly below it , or points ( 3 , 2 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 2 ) .
When we examine point ( 3 , 2 ) , we see a blue pixel so we process it by doing a line search .
However , after searching left and right , there are no addition pixels , so our final line segment is just [ ( 3 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) ] .
We mark it on the mask so it is selected :
We are now done processing the first line segment , [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] .
There are two line segments that are still on the stack , waiting to be processed : [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 3 , 0 ) ] and [ ( 3 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) ] .
Since there are not any additional line segments either above or below them , they would not mark any additional pixels in the mask , and the algorithm would terminate .
Converting an image mask to a bounding path
One of the things we need to do with the image mask is convey to the user which pixels are selected .
Traditionally , this has been done by rendering marching ants which precisely bound the pixels in the selection .
In order to implement marching ants , we need to know the path that precisely bounds the pixels in the selection .
We need to convert our image mask into a vector path .
The algorithm to do this happens in two phases .
In the first phase , we convert the image mask into a dictionary full of line segments that make up the path around the image mask .
The dictionary maps a point to an array of line segments that have end points there .
The second phase , walks the dictionary and concatenates all the line segments into a closed vector path .
In the first phase , we walk the entire image mask and detect where the edges of the mask are .
We do this by examining each pixel to determine if it is black ( in the selection ) .
If it is , then we look at the four pixels around it .
If a pixel on a side of it is not in the selection ( white ) , then we add a one pixel line segment to the dictionary for that side .
In the second phase , we pull a starting point out of the dictionary , and add the first line segment found there to the vector path , also removing that line segment from the dictionary .
Using the end point of the line segment we just added to the path , we pull another line segment from the dictionary .
Like the first line segment we pulled from the dictionary , we add it to the path , and remove it from the dictionary .
We continue pulling line segments from the dictionary until we reach a point that has no corresponding line segments in the dictionary .
This means we have completed the path , and we close it .
Take our previous image mask as an example :
In the first phase , we just walk the entire mask examining each pixel in turn .
The pixel at 0 , 0 is black , meaning it is on .
Because it is on , we search the four pixels around it for pixels that are off ( white ) .
We find that the pixels on the top , bottom , and left are off ( we assume any pixels out of bounds are off ) .
Because of that , we add line segments for all three sides , top , bottom , and left , respectively , to the dictionary :
[ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 ) ]
Note that although in the image mask data we count the centers of the pixels , in the vector path we ’re constructing , we count the grid lines .
i.e. ( 0 , 0 ) is the top left corner of the first pixel , while ( 0 , 1 ) is the bottom left corner of the first pixel .
Also note that although I ’m listing the line segments out , they are in a dictionary keyed off of the end points .
So if you were to look up ( 0 , 0 ) in the dictionary , you would get an array back of the following line segments :
[ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 ) ]
because they intersect at that point .
Although the dictionary is n’t really used in the first phase , it ’s integral to the second phase .
If we continued the first phase to completion , we ’d end up with 18 line segments , which are listed in the table below , sorted by which pixel generated them .
Pixel at Line segments 0 , 0 [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 ) ] 1 , 0 [ ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 1 ) ] 2 , 0 [ ( 2 , 0 ) , ( 3 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 3 , 1 ) ] 3 , 0 [ ( 3 , 0 ) , ( 4 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 4 , 0 ) , ( 4 , 1 ) ] 3 , 1 [ ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) ] 4 , 1 [ ( 4 , 1 ) , ( 5 , 1 ) ] , [ ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 2 ) ] 5 , 1 [ ( 5 , 1 ) , ( 6 , 1 ) ] , [ ( 5 , 2 ) , ( 6 , 2 ) ] , [ ( 6 , 1 ) , ( 6 , 2 ) ] 3 , 2 [ ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 3 ) ] , [ ( 3 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) ] , [ ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 4 , 3 ) ]
Note that only pixels that are on generate line segments , and that the line segments are not in order .
In the second phase , we start by asking the dictionary for the first key .
Let ’s suppose the dictionary gives back the key ( 0 , 0 ) , which is a point .
We tell the path to start at ( 0 , 0 ) .
We immediately do a dictionary look up for all the line segments that intersect at ( 0 , 0 ) .
This returns :
[ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ] , [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 ) ]
We choose whatever line segment is first in the array , and remove it from the dictionary , to ensure we do n’t track back on ourselves .
In our example , that gives us the line segment [ ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) ] .
Since the point we started with was ( 0 , 0 ) , we tell the path to create a line to ( 1 , 0 ) .
Next we do a dictionary look up for all the line segments at ( 1 , 0 ) .
Like before , we simply choose whatever line segment is first , and repeat the previous steps to add a line to the path and move to the next point .
By the completion of the second phase , we have a path around the selection .
We can then use the resulting path to stroke a pattern around the pixels , creating marching ants .
Code architecture
Like my previous article on bitmap brushes , I have provided sample code along with this article to demonstrate the algorithms I discuss .
There are six classes that make up the sample code : MyDocument , CanvasView , Canvas , MagicWand , SelectionBuilder , and PathBuilder .
MyDocument is your standard NSDocument based class .
In this example , it simply loads an image when the user picks one from File >
Open and then hands it off to CanvasView .
Since this class is so simple , and rather tangential to the topic here , I wo n’t mention it the rest of the article .
CanvasView is an NSView derived class that draws the Canvas to the screen and accepts user input .
It passes off mouse downs to the MagicWand tool to be processed , but handles the copy operation itself .
The selection is a property of the view , so it is stored in this class .
The CanvasView is also responsible for rendering marching ants if there is a selection .
It invokes the PathBuilder helper class to convert the image mask into a NSBezierPath .
The Canvas class represents the surface the user interacts with .
It contains the pixels the user can select and copy .
In this sample code , Canvas does n’t really do anything exciting , because it passes the pixel selection off to a helper class , SelectionBuilder .
Other than that , the Canvas class simply renders its contents into a NSGraphicsContext .
We will ignore the Canvas class for the rest of the article , although it is in the sample code .
The MagicWand class represents the tool the user acts upon the canvas with .
It is a rather thin class in that it only processes a mouse down event .
It does so by asking the Canvas for a selection mask , while providing where the user clicked and a tolerance parameter .
It then passes the returned selection mask off to the CanvasView .
SelectionBuilder is a helper class that implements the flood fill algorithm for determining the selected pixels , as described in the previous selection .
It takes a source image , a point to start at , and a tolerance level and returns an image mask .
SelectionBuilder was broken off into its own class because it builds up a lot of intermediate state during the algorithm , and the algorithm is somewhat complex to implement , requiring several methods .
PathBuilder is a helper class that implements the image mask to vector path algorithm described in the previous section .
There are four classes worth digging into in the sample code : CanvasView , MagicWand , SelectionBuilder , and PathBuilder .
We will handle them in that order .
CanvasView
The CanvasView is interesting because it is the window into the rest of the system .
It responds to user input ( mouse downs and Edit > Copy ) and displays both the canvas and the selection , if there is one .
The init method is very simple :
- ( id)initWithFrame : ( NSRect ) frame { self = [ super initWithFrame : frame ] ; if ( self ) { //
Create both the canvas and the magic wand tool .
Create the canvas // the same size as our initial size .
Note that the canvas will not // resize along with us .
m Canvas = [ [ Canvas alloc ] initWithSize : frame.size ] ; mMagicWand = [ [ MagicWand alloc ] init ] ; //
The following members are only used when we have a selection .
m Selection = nil ; mCachedPath = nil ; m Phase = 0.0 ; } return self ; }
Like in the previous article , the CanvasView creates both the canvas and the tool the user will interact with .
Since the selection is a property of the view , it also initializes some variables that are used to hold and render the selection .
Note that mSelection is a CGImageRef and that mCachedPath is a NSBezierPath .
The former is used in the copy operation to mask everything out that is n’t the selection , and the latter is used to render the marching ants feedback .
There is a dealloc method as well , that simply releases all the member data .
Handling mouse down
The view is where the mouse handling occurs .
Since the magic wand tool only cares about mouse down events , that is the only mouse event method we override here :
- ( void ) mouseDown :( NSEvent *) theEvent { //
Simply pass the mouse down to the magic wand .
Also give it the canvas to // work on , and a reference to ourselves , so it can translate the mouse // locations .
[ mMagicWand mouseDown : the Event inView:self onCanvas : mCanvas ] ; }
As you can see we immediately pass the mouse down event off to the magic wand tool .
The magic wand determines what the selection should be , but then , since the view owns the selection , calls back into the CanvasView class to set the selection :
- ( void ) setSelection :( CGImageRef ) mask { //
First free up the old selection , which includes the mask and the // path feedback .
CGImageRelease ( mSelection ) ; mSelection = nil ; [ mCachedPath release ] ; mCachedPath = nil ; //
If the caller gave us a new selection , retain it if ( mask != nil ) m Selection = CGImageRetain ( mask ) ; //
We render selection feedback , so we need to invalidate the view so it // is rendered .
[ self setNeedsDisplay : YES ] ; }
As mentioned earlier , the selection is just an image mask ;
In our sample code it is represented by a CGImageRef .
When we get a new selection we have to free up the old selection , which includes the image mask and bezier path .
We then retain the selection ( copying is expensive ) and mark the entire view as needing a redraw , so that the marching ants will draw .
Note that the bezier path is n’t created here , but will be lazily initialized later on , when we try to render .
Rendering the selection
Speaking of rendering the CanvasView , we just did an invalidate which will cause a redraw .
The first part of drawRect is the standard “ draw the contents of the canvas ” code :
- ( void ) drawRect :( NSRect ) rect { //
Simply ask the canvas to draw into the current context , given the // rectangle specified .
A more sophisticated view might draw a border // around the canvas , or a pasteboard in the case that the view was // bigger than the canvas .
NSGraphicsContext * context = [ NSGraphicsContext currentContext ] ; [ mCanvas drawRect:rect inContext : context ] ;
This is exactly like the previous sample code , in that we ask the canvas to draw into a specific context .
The drawing of the marching ants is a little more involved , so I ’ll cover it in segments :
// Since the selection is a property of the view , we need to render it here .
//
First ask for the selection path .
If we do n't have one , then we do n't // have a selection and can bail .
NSBezierPath * path = [ self selectionPath ] ; if ( path == nil ) return ;
The first thing to do is to check to see if we even have a selection .
If we do n’t , then we can stop now .
This is where we generate the bezier path for the marching ants , by using the selectionPath helper method .
Next we render a phase of the marching ants , which will consist of alternating white and black line segments , each four pixels in length .
//
We do n't want anti-aliasing since we 're drawing 1 pixel lines around // the selection [ context setShouldAntialias : NO ] ; // First , layer on a 1 pixel line of white .
We do this because the line // dash alternates between black and transparent , so the white shows // up where the line dash draws transparent .
We set a line dash pattern // here to clear the one we set below , the last time we drew .
float fullPattern [ ] = { 1.0 , 0.0 } ; [ path setLineDash : fullPattern count :2 phase:0 ] ; [ [ NSColor whiteColor ] set ] ; [ path stroke ] ; //
Next draw a 1 pixel line that alternates between black and transparent // every four pixels .
This gives the selection marching ants around it .
float lengths [ ] = { kPhaseLength , kPhaseLength } ; [ path setLineDash : lengths count:sizeof ( lengths ) /sizeof( lengths [0 ] ) phase : mPhase ] ; [ [ NSColor blackColor ] set ] ; [ path stroke ] ;
We turn off anti-aliasing for the rendering of marching ants because they will be 1 pixel lines , and we want them precise , not fuzzy 2 pixel lines .
First we have to render the white background , because the actual line dash pattern rendered by the second NSBezierPath stroke alternates between black and transparent .
Also note that the line dash has to be cleared from the white line , since we do n’t keep two paths around : one for the the white background , and one for the black dashed foreground .
Notice that on the second NSBezierPath stroke , there is a m Phase member variable used .
This is used to animate the marching ants by shifting the pattern by one pixel each time the marching ants are rendered .
The last thing we want to do is make the ants actually march .
In order to animate them , we set a timer when we finish rendering one phase of the ants :
//
The marching ants need to animate , so fire off a timer half a second later .
//
It will update the mPhase member and then invalidate the view so // it will redraw .
[ NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.5 target:self selector:@selector(onSelectionTimer :) userInfo:nil repeats : NO ] ;
Note that the timer does not repeat .
It will wait until after the next phase of the ants is rendered before setting off a timer to move the subsequent phase .
The actual timer method is fairly simple :
- ( void ) onSelectionTimer :( NSTimer *) timer { //
This timer is set from inside of drawRect : if it rendered the marching // ants .
It advances the phase then marks the view for a redraw .
//
Increase the the phase so the ants appear to march .
Let the phase wrap // around when we reach the end of the phase .
m Phase = m Phase + 1.0 ; if ( m Phase > ( 2 * kPhaseLength - 1.0 ) ) m Phase = 0.0 ; //
It would be more efficient to take the bounds of the selection path ( mCachedPath ) // and only invalidate that .
[ self setNeedsDisplay : YES ] ; }
As stated earlier , the timer just increments the phase by one so the ants appear to move .
If we reach the end of the pattern , we just reset it back to the beginning , where the pattern repeats , so the animation looks smooth .
Finally , we mark the view as needing display , so the newly moved ants will render .
Like in previous examples , we invalidate the entire view , although we could get away with just invalidating the bounds of the NSBezierPath .
The final method used in rendering the marching ants , that we conveniently skipped over earlier , takes the selection image mask and converts it into a NSBezierPath :
- ( NSBezierPath *) selectionPath { //
This method will lazily generate a bounding path around the image mask // and cache it for later use .
//
If no selection , then there 's no path around it if ( mSelection == nil ) return nil ; //
If we 've already created the selection path , then just return it if ( mCachedPath != nil ) return mCachedPath ; // OK , we have to build a path from the selection .
Create a PathBuilder object // and pass it our selection .
Ask for a path back .
PathBuilder * builder = [ [ [ PathBuilder alloc ] initWithMask : mSelection ] autorelease ] ; mCachedPath = [ [ builder path ] retain ] ; return mCachedPath ; }
Generating a path from the image mask is expensive , so we attempt to be efficient here .
First , if there is no selection , then there are no marching ants to render , so we return nil .
Second , if we have already created a NSBezierPath for the current selection , just return it .
Since generating a path from an image mask is involved , and potentially reusable in other classes , the actual algorithm is implemented in a helper class , PathBuilder .
Here we instantiate one , and use it to create our NSBezierPath , which we immediately cache for later use .
Copying the selection
The final responsibility of the CanvasView class is to copy the selection to the clipboard , when the user picks the Edit >
Copy menu item .
This happens in three phases : checking to see if we have a selection ( always important ) , rendering the selection into an image , and putting the resulting image on the clipboard .
First we start out with a sanity check :
- ( IBAction ) copy :( id ) sender { //
If we do n't have a selection then we do n't have anything to copy if ( mSelection == nil ) return ;
As you can see we simply override the standard copy event handler .
Of course , if this were a real system , we would n’t even enable the Copy menu item if there was no selection .
Next , we render the selected pixels into an image :
//
We 're going to render the canvas into an NSImage that we can then hand // off to the pasteboard .
So create an NSImage the same size as our canvas .
NSSize canvasSize = [ mCanvas size ] ; NSImage * image = [ [ [ NSImage alloc ] initWithSize : canvasSize ] autorelease ] ; [ image lockFocus ] ; //
Before we ask the canvas to draw itself into our image , we want to clip // it .
So drop down into CoreGraphics and clip the context with our image // mask .
NSGraphicsContext * context = [ NSGraphicsContext currentContext ] ; CGContextRef cgContext = [ context graphicsPort ] ; CGContextSaveGState( cgContext ) ; CGContextClipToMask( cgContext , CGRectMake(0 , 0 , canvasSize.width , canvasSize.height ) , mSelection ) ; //
Ask the canvas to draw itself in its entirety .
[ mCanvas drawRect : NSMakeRect(0 , 0 , canvasSize.width , canvasSize.height ) inContext : context ] ; CGContextRestoreGState( cgContext ) ; [ image unlockFocus ] ;
This starts out simply .
We create an NSImage the size of our canvas , and focus it for drawing .
This will be the image we draw into , and ultimately place on the clipboard .
Although most of our drawing thus far has stayed in the Cocoa layer , we have to drop down into CoreGraphics in order to clip to an image mask .
After we clip to our selection , we ask the canvas to draw itself into our image .
Since we masked out all the pixels not in the selection , only the selected pixels will be drawn into our image .
Finally , we restore the clipping state and unfocus the image .
The last bit of copying to the clipboard is the mechanics of putting our newly created image on the clipboard :
// Now that we have the selection drawn into an NSImage , give it to the // pasteboard as a TIFF .
NSPasteboard * pasteboard = [ NSPasteboard generalPasteboard ] ; NSArray * types = [ NSArray arrayWithObjects : NSTIFFPboardType , nil ] ; [ pasteboard declareTypes : types owner : self ] ; [ pasteboard setData : [ image TIFFRepresentation ] for Type : NSTIFFPboardType ] ; }
Since it is easy to get a TIFF representation out of an NSImage , and TIFF is a publicly known pasteboard type , we stuff our image onto the clipboard as a TIFF .
MagicWand
The MagicWand class represents the magic wand tool the user wields to interact with the canvas .
It is a simple tool , and the only really interesting thing it does is hold the threshold parameter .
Threshold
The threshold parameter is a float that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 , and determines how close a given color is to the selected color , before it is selected .
If threshold is 0.0 , then colors have to exactly match the chosen color .
If it is 1.0 , then every color will match , and be selected .
By default , the threshold is 0.125 , or , in other words , colors can be up to 12.5 % different from the specified color , and still be selected .
Example selections from different threshold values :
m Threshold Image Selection 0.0 0.125 0.5 1.0
Handling mouse down
The only real action in the MagicWand class happens in the mouseDown method .
This method is called by the CanvasView class , as we saw earlier :
- ( void ) mouseDown :( NSEvent *) the Event inView :( CanvasView *) view onCanvas :( Canvas *) canvas { //
Translate the event point location into a canvas point NSPoint currentPoint = [ self canvasLocation : the Event view : view ] ; //
Ask the canvas to generate an image mask that selects the pixels around // the point the user clicked on , that are within the tolerance specified .
CGImageRef mask = [ canvas floodFillSelect:currentPoint tolerance : mTolerance ] ; //
The selection is really a property of the view , so give the mask to the // view [ view setSelection : mask ] ; //
We 're done with the selection mask , so free it up CGImageRelease ( mask ) ; }
mouseDown here essentially acts as a moderator between the canvas and the view .
After translating the mouse down point from window to canvas coordinates , it simply asks the canvas to construct an image mask based on the point and tolerance .
It then immediately hands the image mask to the CanvasView .
Since I ’m not going to cover the Canvas class in detail , I should mention that its floodFillSelect method immediately calls through to the SelectionBuilder class , without any further processing .
As you can see , there ’s not a whole lot to the actual MagicWand class .
It simply contains a parameter and moderates between the canvas and view .
SelectionBuilder
The SelectionBuilder class implements the flood fill algorithm described at the beginning of this article .
The algorithm requires a decent amount of state data , which are stored as member data .
The init initializes the member data , starting with the source image :
- ( id ) initWithBitmapImageRep :( NSBitmapImageRep *) imageRep point :( NSPoint ) point tolerance :( float ) tolerance { self = [ super init ] ; if ( self != nil ) { //
Just retain the source image .
We do n't want to make a heavy copy of it // ( too expensive ) but we do n't want it going away on us mImageRep = [ imageRep retain ] ; //
Record the width and height of the source image .
We 'll use it to // figure out how big to make our mask .
m Width = [ mImageRep pixelsWide ] ; mHeight = [ mImageRep pixelsHigh ] ;
The source image is represented by a NSBitmapImageRep , mainly because that ’s what the Canvas is implemented with .
We simply retain the source image , since copying is expensive and we ’re not modifying the source image anyway .
We also cache off the size of the source image because we use it in several places , including to create the output mask and the visited pixels map .
Next we create our output image mask , which will represent the selected pixels :
// Calloc marks the mask as all black , or all masked in ( i.e. the image // would be all there , by default ) .
So use memset ( ) to mark them all // transparent .
mMaskRowBytes = ( mWidth + 0x0000000 F ) & ~0x0000000 F ; mMaskData = calloc( mHeight , mMaskRowBytes ) ; memset ( mMaskData , 0xFF , mHeight * m MaskRowBytes ) ;
For efficiency reasons , we align the mask rows to 16 byte increments .
Also note that we want all pixels to start out not selected , so we fill the image mask with 0xFF .
Recall that image masks are essentially 8 - bit grayscale images , so our mask starts out a solid white .
As described in the overview , we need a map of BOOLs to keep track of which pixels we have examined :
// Calloc marks them all as not visited mVisited = calloc ( mHeight * m Width , sizeof ( BOOL ) ) ;
The visited map is the same size as the source image and output mask .
By default , none of the pixels have been examined , so their value is set to NO .
Next we remember the user clicked point , and the color at that point , so we can use it for comparing to other colors later :
//
If the user clicked on a non-integral value , make it an integral value .
//
We only deal with raw pixel data , not interpolated values .
Also flip // the y component because pixels start at the top left , but the view // origin was at the bottom left m PickedPoint.x = floor ( point.x ) ; mPickedPoint.y = m Height - floor ( point.y ) ; //
Grab the pixel data at the location the user clicked on .
[ mImageRep getPixel : mPickedPixel atX:( int) mPickedPoint.x y:( int ) mPickedPoint.y ] ;
For the the user specified point , we need to do a little processing .
First , we need to snap any floating point values to an integral value .
That ’s because we will be dealing directly with raw pixel data , which only exists on integral points .
Also , the coordinates for the pixel data start at the top left , while the point passed in has its origin at the bottom left , so we flip the y coordinate .
We also grab the raw pixel data of the user selected point .
m PickedPixel is an unsigned int [ 5 ] , and holds the raw color components .
It is statically sized a five components , with the thought that CMYKA probably has the highest number of components that we ’ll encounter .
However , in a real system it would be wise to ask the colorspace of the source image how many components there are , and dynamically allocate mPickedPixel accordingly .
When we compare the raw pixel data of mPickedPixel to a given point , we have to take the tolerance parameter into account :
// We need to scale the tolerance from [ 0..1 ] to [ 0.. maxSampleValue ] , but to // do that , we first need to figure out what the maximum sample value // is .
Compute how many bits are in a pixel component , then use that .
int bitsPerSample = [ mImageRep bitsPerPixel ] / [ mImageRep samplesPerPixel ] ; int maxSampleValue = 0 ; int i = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < bitsPerSample ; ++i ) maxSampleValue = ( maxSampleValue << 1 ) | 1 ; mTolerance = tolerance * maxSampleValue ;
Although the tolerance parameter passed in tells us how different pixels are allowed to be , it is not properly scaled such that it can be used directly .
We need to know what the tolerance is , in the range of a pixel component .
That is , if the tolerance parameter passed in is 1.0 , then the mTolerance member should be the maximum value for a pixel component ( e.g. 255 for a 8 - bit component ) .
We simply use the number of bits per pixel component to calculate the maximum component value , then multiply that by the tolerance parameter , to get the absolute tolerance .
Finally , the algorithm uses a stack of line segments to know which parts of the image need to be further processed :
// Create an intermediate stack to hold the line segments that still // need to be processed .
m Stack = [ [ NSMutableArray alloc ] init ] ; } return self ; }
To keep things simple , I elected to not create a custom class for a stack , but instead simply used a NSMutableArray in that capacity .
Also , the line segments on the stack are simply NSDictionarys , with three values for the left , right , and y coordinates of the line segment .
There is also a dealloc method that frees up all the data :
- ( void ) dealloc { //
Let go of our source image , free up our visited buffer , and our stack .
[ mImageRep release ] ; free( mVisited ) ; [ mStack release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; }
Note that we intentionally do not free up the mask data because we will be returning it to the caller .
Algorithm overview
After constructing a SelectionBuilder object , the caller will call the mask method to actually create the selection mask .
The mask method is fairly high level and matches up with the overview description of the algorithm at the top of the article :
- ( CGImageRef ) mask { //
Prime the loop so we have something on the stack .
searchLineAtPoint // will look both to the right and left for pixels that match the // selected color .
It will then throw that line segment onto the stack .
[ self searchLineAtPoint: mPickedPoint ] ; //
While the stack is n't empty , continue to process line segments that // are on the stack .
while ( [ mStack count ] > 0 ) { //
Pop the top segment off the stack NSDictionary * segment = [ [ [ mStack lastObject ] retain ] autorelease ] ; [ m Stack removeLastObject ] ; //
Process the segment , by looking both above and below it for pixels // that match the user picked pixel [ self processSegment : segment ] ; } //
We 're done , so convert our mask data into a real mask return [ self createMask ] ; }
As in the original algorithm , we start off by doing a line search on the horizontal line that the user clicked on .
This is done by invoking the searchLineAtPoint , which implements the line search algorithm .
If it finds a matching line segment , then it marks it in the image mask , and pushes it onto the stack for later processing .
We then loop until the stack is empty .
For each line segment on the stack , we pop it off the stack , and invoke the processSegment method on it .
This method simply walks the line segments above and below and repeatedly performs a line search on each point , by invoking the searcheLineAtPoint method .
If more matching line segments are found , they are marked in the mask and pushed onto the stack .
Finally , after we are done processing all the line segments , we have to convert our raw mask data into a CGImageRef that the caller can use .
This is done by calling createMask .
As you can see , the algorithm is implemented at a high level by invoking three main functions : searchLineAtPoint , processSegment , and createMask .
processSegment simply invokes searchLineAtPoint repeatedly , and createMask quickly converts raw pixel data into a CGImageRef.
searchLinePoint is where the real meat is , so we ’ll quickly cover processSegment and createMask , then dig into searchLinePoint .
Processing a line segment
As stated earlier , processing a line segment that we already know to be in the selection involves walking the points directly above and below it , and performing a line search on them :
- ( void ) processSegment :( NSDictionary *) segment { //
Figure out where this segment actually lies , by pulling the line segment // information out of the dictionary NSNumber * leftNumber = [ segment objectForKey:kSegment_Left ] ; NSNumber * rightNumber = [ segment objectForKey:kSegment_Right ] ; NSNumber * yNumber = [ segment objectForKey:kSegment_Y ] ; float left = [ leftNumber floatValue ] ; float right = [ rightNumber floatValue ] ; float y = [ yNumber floatValue ] ; //
We 're going to walk this segment , and test each integral point both // above and below it .
Note that we 're doing a four point connect .
float x = 0.0 ; for ( x = left ; x <= right ; x = x + 1.0 ) { [ self searchLineAtPoint : NSMakePoint( x , y - 1.0 ) ] ; // check above [ self searchLineAtPoint : NSMakePoint( x , y + 1.0 ) ] ; // check below } }
This is a very simple method .
As you can see , most of the method is just pulling the coordinates of the line segment out of the dictionary .
After that , we just walk the line segment , checking above and below it by invoking searchLineAtPoint repeatedly .
Creating a CGImageRef
At the end of the algorithm , we have to convert our raw mask data into a CGImageRef that CoreGraphics can use for clipping .
Since we set up our mask in the init method to be properly formatted , we just need to hand it to CGImage :
- ( CGImageRef ) createMask { //
This function takes the raw mask bitmap that we filled in , and creates // a CoreGraphics mask from it .
// Gotta have a data provider to wrap our raw pixels .
Provide a callback // for the mask data to be freed .
Note that we do n't free mMaskData in our // dealloc on purpose .
CGDataProviderRef provider = CGDataProviderCreateWithData(nil , mMaskData , mMaskRowBytes * mHeight , & MaskDataProviderReleaseDataCallback ) ; CGImageRef mask = CGImageMaskCreate ( mWidth , mHeight , 8 , 8 , mMaskRowBytes , provider , nil , false ) ; CGDataProviderRelease( provider ) ; return mask ; }
Note that we ’re creating an actual image mask , and not just an image with a grayscale colorspace .
This is why white means off and black means on .
If it were an actual image , the colors would be reversed .
Also , as noted in the dealloc method , we do n’t free up the raw mask data , mMaskData , because the CGImageRef needs it .
Instead we set a release callback , which is invoked when the CGImageRef is freed :
//
We allocate the memory for the image mask here , but the CGImageRef is used // outside of here .
So provide a callback to free up the memory after the // caller is done with the CGImageRef. static void MaskDataProviderReleaseDataCallback ( void * info , const void * data , size_t size ) { free ( ( void * ) data ) ; }
The callback invokes free on our mask data .
Line search algorithm
The line search algorithm is the heart of the flood fill algorithm .
It takes a point and looks for the largest horizontal line segment that matches the given color .
The line search is pretty straight forward , but the method to implement is a touch long , so I ’ll cover it in three sections .
First , we do what any good programmer does : try to get out of work .
- ( void ) searchLineAtPoint :( NSPoint ) point { //
This function will look at the point passed in to see if it matches // the selected pixel .
It will then look to the left and right of the // passed in point for pixels that match .
In addition to adding a line // segment to the stack ( to be processed later ) , it will mark the mVisited // and mMaskData bitmaps to reflect if the pixels have been visited or // should be selected .
//
First , we want to do some sanity checking .
This includes making sure // the point is in bounds , and that the specified point has n't already // been visited .
if ( ( point.y < 0 ) || ( point.y >= m Height ) || ( point.x < 0 ) || ( point.x >= m Width ) ) return ; BOOL * has BeenVisited = ( mVisited + ( long ) point.y * m Width + ( long ) point.x ) ; if ( * hasBeenVisited ) return ; //
Make sure the point we 're starting at at least matches .
If it does n't , // there 's not a line segment here , and we can bail now . if ( ![ self markPointIfItMatches : point ] ) return ;
If the specified point is out of bounds , then we do n’t even bother searching .
This case happens when we are processing a line segment who is at the edge of the source image .
Next we check to see if we ’ve already visited this point , and return if we have .
This prevents infinite looping , by disallowing the situation where a segment is processed , looks above the segment and finds another segment , processes the above segment , and looks below and sees the original line segment , and processes it , etc ad infinitum .
Finally , we check to see if the initial start point even matches the chosen color .
If it does n’t , then there ’s not a connected line segment here , and we can stop processing .
Now that we have determined that we have to do work , we do it :
// Search left , marking pixels as visited , and in or out of the selection float x = point .x - 1.0 ; float left = point.x ; while ( x >= 0 ) { if ( [ self markPointIfItMatches : NSMakePoint( x , point.y ) ] ) left = x ; //
Expand our line segment to the left else break ; //
If it does n't match , the we 're done looking x = x - 1.0 ; } // Search right , marking pixels as visited , and in or out of the selection float right = point .x ; x = point .x + 1.0 ; while ( x < m Width ) { if ( [ self markPointIfItMatches : NSMakePoint( x , point.y ) ] ) right = x ; //
Expand our line segment to the right else break ; //
If it does n't match , the we 're done looking x = x + 1.0 ; }
The algorithm here is simple : just walk left one pixel at a time and check to see if the current pixel matches the chosen color .
As soon as we reach a pixel that does not match the chosen color , we stop looking , and remember the left most point that matched our color .
We then do the same thing , but working to the right .
Note that we skip the initial point , since we already checked it at the top of the method .
The last step in the line search is to add our newly discovered line segment to the stack for further processing :
// Push the segment we just found onto the stack , so we can look above // and below it later .
NSDictionary * segment = [ NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys : [ NSNumber numberWithFloat:left ] , kSegment_Left , [ NSNumber numberWithFloat : right ] , kSegment_Right , [ NSNumber numberWithFloat: point.y ] , kSegment_Y , nil ] ; [ m Stack addObject : segment ] ; }
As stated before , instead of creating a custom class to hold a line segment , we just stuff the left , right , and y values into an NSDictionary .
As you probably noted , we ’re using a helper function , markPointIfItMatches , to determine if a given point matches our chosen color .
However , as the name implies , the helper function also marks the point in the mask , if it matches , and the point in the visited map .
So although the algorithm described in the overview marks one line segment at a time , in practice , we mark one pixel at a time .
- ( BOOL ) markPointIfItMatches :( NSPoint ) point { //
This method examines a specific pixel to see if it should be in the selection // or not , by determining if it is " close " to the user picked pixel .
Regardless // of it is in the selection , we mark the pixel as visited so we do n't examine // it again .
//
Do some sanity checking .
If its already been visited , then it does n't // match BOOL * has BeenVisited = ( mVisited + ( long ) point.y * m Width + ( long ) point.x ) ; if ( * hasBeenVisited ) return NO ; //
Ask a helper function to determine if the pixel passed in matches // the user selected pixel BOOL matches = NO ; if ( [ self pixelMatches : point ] ) { //
The pixels match , so return that answer to the caller matches = YES ; //
Now actually mark the mask unsigned char * maskRow = mMaskData + ( mMaskRowBytes * ( long ) point.y ) ; maskRow [ ( long ) point .x ] = 0x00 ; // all on } //
We 've made a decision about this pixel , so we 've visted it .
Mark it // as such .
* hasBeenVisited = YES ; return matches ; }
The first thing we do when checking a pixel to see if it matches , is we look it up in the visited map .
If we ’ve already visited the point , then it does n’t match for sure , so we bail early .
Next , we compare the color at the point with the user chosen color .
If it matches , the corresponding point in the mask is set to black , thus including it in the selection .
Finally , no matter if the color matches or not , we mark the point in the visited map , so that we do n’t process this point again .
Matching colors
Something that we have ignored this entire time is how we actually compare colors and see if they match , given a tolerance level .
There are many different ways to do this , but here I ’ll present a very simple , yet efficient , way of doing it .
The pixelMatches method is the function that determines if color at a specified point matches :
- ( BOOL ) pixelMatches :( NSPoint ) point { //
We do n't do exact matches ( unless the tolerance is 0 ) , so compute // the " difference " between the user selected pixel and the passed in // pixel .
If it 's less than the specified tolerance , then the pixels // match .
unsigned int difference = [ self pixelDifference : point ] ; return difference <= mTolerance ; }
The idea here is to compute the “ difference ” between the color at the point and the chosen color , and then see if the difference is less than the tolerance level .
Note that difference is in the color component range , so it will change based on the source image format .
i.e.
If you have pixel format with 8 - bit components , then difference will range between 0 and 255 .
Computing the difference between colors is the heart of color matching :
- ( unsigned int ) pixelDifference :( NSPoint ) point { //
This method determines the " difference " between the specified pixel // and the user selected pixel in a very simple and cheap way .
It takes // the difference of all the components ( except alpha ) and which ever // has the greatest difference , that 's the difference between the pixels .
//
First get the components for the point passed in unsigned int pixel [ kMaxSamples ] ; [ mImageRep getPixel : pixel atX:( int ) point.x y:( int ) point.y ] ; //
Determine the largest difference in the pixel components .
Note that we // assume the alpha channel is the last component , and we skip it .
unsigned int maxDifference = 0 ; int samplesPerPixel = [ mImageRep samplesPerPixel ] ; int i = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ( samplesPerPixel - 1 ) ; ++i ) { unsigned int difference = abs ( ( long ) mPickedPixel [ i ] - ( long ) pixel [i ] ) ; if ( difference > maxDifference ) maxDifference = difference ; } return maxDifference ; }
The first thing we do when computing the difference is to retrieve the raw pixel components from the current point .
As with the chosen color , we assume that we wo n’t get more than five components , including the alpha channel .
In real system , we ’d want to ask the colorspace for the number of components , and dynamically allocate the raw pixel components .
The general idea here is to compute the absolute difference between each component in the chosen color versus the current color .
We say the difference between two colors is the largest difference between the individual color components .
Note that we skip the alpha channel , which we assume is going to be the last component .
This is not always true , and in a real system we should ask the NSBitmapImageRep where the alpha channel is .
Also note that humans do n’t process colors this way .
We might end up selecting colors that do n’t look all that similar in one instance , but fail to select colors that look very close in another instance .
…
Wow , that ’s a lot of information , but that completely covers the flood fill algorithm .
It takes a source image and a staring point , and returns an image mask .
PathBuilder
The PathBuilder class implements an algorithm that converts an image mask into a vector path .
It has two phases : one to build up all the one pixel line segments around the mask , and one to convert all those one pixel line segments into a closed vector path .
PathBuilder actually gets down into the mask pixel data and manually iterates through it .
To do that , we need to convert our mask back from a CGImageRef into an array of unsigned chars .
This is done in the init method :
- ( id ) initWithMask : ( CGImageRef ) mask { self = [ super init ] ; if ( self != nil ) { // CGImageRef does n't allow use to easily grab the pixels and walk them // manually ( which is what we want to do ) .
So we 're going to create // a grayscale CGBitmapContext , use the mask to draw white pixels in // the area defined by the mask .
Then we 'll release the bitmap context // but keep the raw mask pixels around to parse through .
//
Grab the size of the mask , so we know how big to make our bitmap // context .
m Width = CGImageGetWidth ( mask ) ; m Height = CGImageGetHeight ( mask ) ; //
Allocate space for our mask data .
Calloc will zero out the data so // all pixels will be black by default .
mMaskRowBytes = ( mWidth + 0x0000000 F ) & ~0x0000000 F ; mMaskData = calloc( mHeight , mMaskRowBytes ) ; // Create a grayscale bitmap context the size of the mask CGColorSpaceRef colorspace = CGColorSpaceCreateWithName( kCGColorSpaceGenericGray ) ; CGContextRef bitmapContext = CGBitmapContextCreate( mMaskData , mWidth , mHeight , 8 , mMaskRowBytes , colorspace , kCGImageAlphaNone ) ; CGColorSpaceRelease( colorspace ) ; // Clip out everything not selected by the mask , then draw a white rectangle // so we know the pixels defined by the mask .
CGRect maskRect = CGRectMake (0 , 0 , mWidth , mHeight ) ; CGContextClipToMask ( bitmapContext , maskRect , mask ) ; CGContextSetGrayFillColor( bitmapContext , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; CGContextFillRect( bitmapContext , maskRect ) ; //
Do n't need the context anymore , we just wanted the pixels CGContextRelease ( bitmapContext ) ; } return self ; }
Although there is a lot of code here , the goal is singular : retrieve the raw pixel data from the mask .
The complication is that CGImageRef does not offer a way to directly access the pixel data .
So , we create a bitmap context with all black pixels , use the mask to define the clipping region , then draw a white rectangle to cover the entire context .
Since we clipped out all pixels not in the mask , only the pixels in the mask become white in the bitmap context .
This gives us the pixel data of the image mask in the bitmap context .
Well , technically , it gives us the inverse of the image mask ( remember that selected pixels in the mask are black , not white ) .
However since we ’re not going to use the pixel data as an actual mask , it will work just as well .
Furthermore , calloc ( ) automatically gives us the black pixels , which means it ’s more efficient since we do n’t have to do a memset ( ) on the pixels to clear to white .
There is also a dealloc method that simply frees up mMaskData .
The driver method for the PathBuilder class is path :
- ( NSBezierPath *) path { //
This method invokes two methods that will build a bounding path around // a bitmap mask .
First , it parses the mask data to build up a dictionary // of line segments .
Second , in takes all those line segments , and converts // then into a bezier path .
NSMutableDictionary * segments = [ self buildLineSegments ] ; return [ self convertSegmentsIntoPath:segments ] ; }
The path method simply invokes the first phase , implemented by buildLineSegments , then passes its results to the second phase , implemented by convertSegmentsIntoPath .
Next we ’ll cover each of the phases .
Phase 1
The first phase basically does edge detection on the image mask and creates an unordered list of one pixel line segments .
The first phase is implemented primarily in the buildLineSegments method :
- ( NSMutableDictionary * ) buildLineSegments { //
The purpose of this function is to simply walk the mask and determine where // the bounding line segments of the path should go .
It does not attempt // to make sure they are in order or connected .
//
It examines each pixel .
If the pixel is in the mask ( not black ) , then it // looks at the pixels to the left , right , above , and below the pixel .
For each of those // pixels around the current pixel that is not in the mask ( black ) it adds a // line segment on that side to the dictionary .
//
The dictionary that is return maps pixel locations to line segments , so they // can be easily connect later on .
For example , the line segment [ ( 20 , 15 ) , ( 21 , 15 ) ] // would appear in the dictionary twice : at the key ( 20 , 15 ) and the key ( 21 , 15 ) .
//
Create a dictionary for all these line segments , keyed on the points that make // up the segment .
NSMutableDictionary * segments = [ [ [ NSMutableDictionary alloc ] init ] autorelease ] ; //
This loop straight up hits every pixel in the mask in row major order int row = 0 ; for ( row = 0 ; row < mHeight ; ++row ) { int col = 0 ; unsigned char * rowPixels = mMaskData + ( row * mMaskRowBytes ) ; for ( col = 0 ; col < m Width ; ++col ) { if ( rowPixels [ col ] !=
0x00 ) { //
This pixel is on , check all around us to see if we 're bounded // anywhere .
//
Bounded on the left if ( col == 0 || rowPixels [ col - 1 ] == 0x00 ) [ self insertLineStart : NSMakePoint ( col , row ) end : NSMakePoint ( col , row + 1 ) intoDictionary : segments ] ; //
Bounded on the right if ( col == ( mWidth - 1 ) || rowPixels [ col + 1 ] == 0x00 ) [ self insertLineStart : NSMakePoint ( col + 1 , row ) end : NSMakePoint ( col + 1 , row + 1 ) intoDictionary : segments ] ; //
Bounded on the top if ( row == 0 || *( rowPixels + col - m MaskRowBytes ) == 0x00 ) [ self insertLineStart : NSMakePoint ( col , row ) end : NSMakePoint ( col + 1 , row ) intoDictionary : segments ] ; //
Bounded on the bottom if ( row == ( mHeight - 1 ) || *( rowPixels + col + m MaskRowBytes ) == 0x00 ) [ self insertLineStart : NSMakePoint ( col , row + 1 ) end : NSMakePoint ( col + 1 , row + 1 ) intoDictionary : segments ] ; } } } // Return the unsorted segments return segments ; }
This method is really straight forward .
For each pixel in the mask data , it checks to see if it is “ on ” in the mask , meaning it is white .
If it is , then further processing needs to be done .
Each of the four directions , left , right , top , and bottom are checked to see if there are pixels not in the mask ( i.e. black ) .
If that is the case , we add a line segment for that side to our dictionary .
This is handled by the insertLineStart method :
- ( void ) insertLineStart :( NSPoint ) start end :( NSPoint ) end intoDictionary : ( NSMutableDictionary *) segments { //
This function takes the raw points of a segment and ensures that the segment // is correct inserted into the segments dictionary .
This includes building // the keys for the start and end point , and inserting the segment twice ;
Once // for the start point , and again for the end point .
//
Since all the lines will eventually connect , more than one segment will // map to a given point , or entry in the dictionary .
For that reason , the // value in the dictionary is actually an array of line segments .
//
Convert from top , left origin to bottom , left origin ( bitmap to CG coords ) NSPoint startPoint = NSMakePoint ( start.x , mHeight - start.y - 1 ) ; NSPoint endPoint = NSMakePoint ( end.x , mHeight - end.y - 1 ) ; //
Pull out the values that will go in the dictionary NSString * startKey = NSStringFromPoint( startPoint ) ; NSString * endKey = NSStringFromPoint( endPoint ) ; NSArray * segment = [ NSArray arrayWithObjects : startKey , endKey , nil ] ; //
Add the segment to the dictionary for the start point .
If a segment // array is n't already at the specified point , add it .
NSMutableArray * segmentsAtStart = [ segments objectForKey:startKey ] ; if ( segments AtStart == nil ) { segments
AtStart = [ [ [ NSMutableArray alloc ] init ] autorelease ] ; [ segments setObject:segmentsAtStart forKey:startKey ] ; } [ segmentsAtStart addObject:segment ] ; //
Add the segment to the dictionary for the end point .
If a segment // array is n't already at the specified point , add it .
NSMutableArray * segmentsAtEnd = [ segments objectForKey:endKey ] ; if ( segments AtEnd == nil ) { segments
AtEnd = [ [ [ NSMutableArray alloc ] init ] autorelease ] ; [ segments setObject:segmentsAtEnd forKey:endKey ] ; } [ segmentsAtEnd addObject: segment ] ; }
Since we do n’t know which direction we will approach a line segment , we have to add the line segment to the dictionary both at its start point and its end point .
Because of this , all keys will have two line segments in their entry in the dictionary , so we actually use an array of line segments .
At the end of phase one , we have a big bucket of line segments that completely bound the image mask , but are not in order .
If we were to change insertLineStart to simply add each line segment to a NSBezierPath , it would create a path around the image mask .
However the line segments would not be properly connected , and stroking a line dash pattern would not work as expected .
Phase 2
In phase two we ’re going to take all those unordered line segments and make them into a connected , ordered vector path , namely a NSBezierPath .
The starting point for phase two is the convertSegments IntoPath method :
- ( NSBezierPath *) convertSegmentsIntoPath:( NSMutableDictionary *) segments { //
This method walks through the line segments dictionary constructing // bezier paths .
As a line segment is transversed , it is removed from // the dictionary so that it is n't used again .
Since there can be // more than one closed path , continue even after one path is complete , // until all line segments have been consumed .
NSBezierPath * path = [ NSBezierPath bezierPath ] ; //
While we still have line segments to consume , unwind one bezier path while ( [ segments count ] > 0 ) [ self unwindOneSegmentPath : segments intoPath : path ] ; return path ; }
As you can see it accepts the dictionary of line segments from the first phase as input , and returns a NSBezierPath as its output .
The primary purpose of this function is to unwind one path at a time , using the unwindOneSegmentPath method , until there are no more line segments in the dictionary .
The loop is necessary because sometimes the selection mask has “ holes ” in it , like the letter O , which means that there is more than one closed path represented in the dictionary .
The unwindOneSegmentPath method is responsible for creating one closed subpath from the dictionary of line segments .
It is fairly involved , so we ’ll cover it one section at a time :
- ( void ) unwindOneSegmentPath :( NSMutableDictionary *) segments intoPath :( NSBezierPath *) path { //
This method will grab the first line segment it can find , then unwind it // into a bezier path .
Since all the line segments are key on the points // the start and stop at , it is fairly trivial to connect them .
//
The algorithm is : // 1 . Given a point , look up the array of segments that have end points there // 2 . Grab the first segment in the array // 3 . Draw a line to point in the line segment , that we were n't given // 4 . Remove the line segment from the dictionary , so we do n't process it again // 5 . Go back to 1 , with the point we just drew a line to as the given point //
There is also an optimization so that we do n't add 1 pixel line segments // unless we have to .
It accumulates the start and end points until the // path changes direction .
At the time , it flushes out the line segment // to the path , and adds the new point to the cache .
//
Just pick the first key to start with .
It might be slightly better if // we could pick a corner to start at , so we create the path with fewer // segments .
But the cost of finding a corner might negate any gain .
NSEnumerator * keyEnumerator = [ segments keyEnumerator ] ; NSString * key = [ keyEnumerator nextObject ] ; NSMutableArray * segmentsAtPoint = nil ; //
Start the path off .
The rest of the path additions will be simple lineTo's NSPoint pathStartPoint = NSPointFromString ( key ) ; [ path moveToPoint : pathStartPoint ] ;
We need to start with a point to unravel a path .
Optimally , it would probably be best if we could pick a corner to start at , but that ’s a lot more trouble than it ’s worth .
So we simply ask the dictionary for the first key it can find .
We then convert the key from a string into the NSPoint that we ’ll start out at .
We move the current point in our bezier path here .
All other path operations will be linetos until we close the subpath .
Although adding the one pixel line segments one at a time would technically give us the correct bezier path , we ’d like to be more efficient .
As such , we keep a cache of the current line segment we ’re building around :
//
The cached points are used to accumulate lines so we do n't insert // tons of 1 pixel lines , but one large line .
NSPoint cached Point1 = pathStartPoint ; NSPoint cached Point2 = pathStartPoint ;
I ’ll dig into this a bit more later on , but in general , when a new line segment just extends the current one , we do n’t add it to the NSBezierPath , we just save it in our cache .
When we get to a line segment that changes direction , we flush the current line segment out to the NSBezierPath , and add the new line segment to the cache .
Now that we ’ve set up our starting point , we ’re going to drop into a loop and unravel this path :
// While we have n't reach the end of the path .
At the end of the path // we would normally connect back up with the start .
But since we // remove line segments as we process them , it wo n't be in the map .
That 's // our indication to stop .
while ( segments AtPoint = [ segments objectForKey:key ] ) { //
Convert the key to a NSPoint so we know the point the line segments // connect at. NSPoint connectPoint = NSPointFromString ( key ) ;
At the top of the loop we ask for all the line segments at our current point , from the dictionary .
If there are none , then we know we ’ve looped back on ourselves and have completed the subpath , so we can stop .
We know this because right after we transverse a line segment , we remove it from the dictionary .
When we get a list of line segments to follow , we have to pick one :
//
It really does n't matter which segment in this array we pick , but // it 's guaranteed to have at least one , and the first is always the // easiest to pick .
Convert its end points to real points so we can // compare .
NSArray * firstSegment = [ segmentsAtPoint objectAtIndex:0 ] ; NSPoint segmentStartPoint = NSPointFromString ([ firstSegment objectAtIndex:0 ] ) ; NSPoint segmentEndPoint = NSPointFromString ([ firstSegment objectAtIndex :1 ] ) ;
We arbitrarily pick the first line segment in the array , because it ’s guaranteed to be there .
But it does n’t really matter which line segment we pick ; we ’ll eventually make it all the way around the path .
We know that the current point in our NSBezierPath is either segmentStartPoint or segmentEndPoint , because that ’s how we arrived at this dictionary entry .
Since we ’re already at one of the points , it would n’t make much sense to create line from it , to itself .
So we want to make a line to the point we ’re not already at :
//
See which point in this segment we 've already visited .
Draw a line // to the end point we have n't visited , and make it the next key // we visit in the dictionary .
if ( NSEqualPoints( connectPoint , segmentStartPoint ) ) { //
We 've alreay hit the start point , so add the end point to the path [ self addPoint:segmentEndPoint toPath : path cachedPoint1:&cachedPoint1 cachedPoint2:&cachedPoint2 ] ; key = NSStringFromPoint( segmentEndPoint ) ; } else { //
We 've alreay hit the end point , so add the start point to the path [ self addPoint:segmentStartPoint toPath : path cachedPoint1:&cachedPoint1 cachedPoint2:&cachedPoint2 ] ; key = NSStringFromPoint( segmentStartPoint ) ; }
If we ’re already at the start point , do a lineto to the end point .
If we ’re already at the end point of the segment , do a lineto to the start point .
Either way , the point we just did a lineto to , becomes our new current point , as well as the next point we ’ll look up in the dictionary .
Note that we use a helper function , addPoint , to perform the lineto on the NSBezierPath .
This is so it can hide the details of the caching scheme we use .
The final thing we need to do inside the loop is remove the line segment we just processed from the dictionary .
We do this so we know when we have completed a subpath , and so we do n’t loop forever :
//
It 's very important that we remove the line segment from the dictionary // completely so we do n't loop back on ourselves or not ever finish .
[ self removeSegment : firstSegment fromSegmentPath : segments ] ; }
Finally , we need to do some clean up before we ’re done with this subpath :
// Since we were caching line segments to write out the biggest line segments // possible , we need to flush the last one out to the bezier path .
[ self flushPath : path cachedPoint1:&cachedPoint1 cachedPoint2:&cachedPoint2 ] ; //
Close up the sub path , so that the end point connects with the start point .
[ path closePath ] ; }
Cleaning up includes flushing out the last cached line segment to the NSBezierPath , then ensuring said bezier path is closed .
By the end of this function , we have added one more subpath to our bezier path .
Next we need to examine the implementation of some of the helper methods , such as removeSegment .
It essentially does the inverse of insertLineStart :
- ( void ) removeSegment :( NSArray * ) segment fromSegmentPath :( NSMutableDictionary *) segments { //
This method removes the specified line segment from the dictionary .
Every // line segment is in the dictionary twice ( at the start point and the end point ) // so remove it at both locations .
//
Look up both start and end points , and remove them from their respective arrays NSString * startKey = [ segment objectAtIndex:0 ] ; NSString * endKey = [ segment objectAtIndex:1 ] ; NSMutableArray * segmentsAtStart = [ segments objectForKey:startKey ] ; NSMutableArray * segmentsAtEnd = [ segments objectForKey:endKey ] ; if ( [ segmentsAtStart count ] == 1 ) [ segments removeObjectForKey:startKey ] ; // last one , so kill entire array else [ segments AtStart removeObject : segment ] ; // just remove use from this array if ( [ segmentsAtEnd count ] == 1 ) [ segments removeObjectForKey:endKey ] ; // last one , so kill entire array else [ segmentsAtEnd removeObject : segment ] ; // just remove use from this array }
All this method does is remove the line segment from the dictionary at both its start point and end point .
Since when we transverse a line segment , we enter at one of the points and leave at the other , it is fully processed afterwards and should n’t be processed again .
Also note that if the given line segment is the last one in the array , then the entire array is removed from the dictionary .
This is how we can be sure we have completed a path when a dictionary look up fails in the unwindOneSegmentPath method .
It is also why we can assume that there is at least one line segment at a point that has an entry in the dictionary .
Finally , we have a simple caching scheme to ensure that we are adding the longest possible line segments to the NSBezierPath .
Every time we want to add a line segment to the NSBezierPath , we invoke the helper function , addPoint :
- ( void ) addPoint :( NSPoint ) newPoint toPath :( NSBezierPath *) path cachedPoint1 :( NSPoint *) point1 cachedPoint2 :( NSPoint*) point2 { //
This method examines the current line segment to determine if it 's part // of the currently building large line segment .
If it is , we just make it // the new end point .
If it represents a change in direction , then we // flush the current large line segment out to the path , and create a new // line segment with the old end point and the new point .
//
Check for the special case of the path start point .
In that case , just // make the new point the new end point of the current line segment .
if ( NSEqualPoints ( * point1 , * point2 ) ) { * point2 = new Point ; return ; } //
If we 're not changing direction , then just extend the line if ( ( point1 - > x == point2 -> x && point2 ->x == newPoint.x ) || ( point1 - >y == point2 - >y && point2 - >y == newPoint.y ) ) { * point2 = new Point ; } else { //
We changed direction , so flush the current segment , and reset the cache [ path line ToPoint : * point2 ] ; * point1 = * point2 ; * point2 = newPoint ; } }
The first thing we do is check for the special case of adding the first point to the path .
In this case , the start and end cached points will be the same , so we can just overwrite the cached end point with the new point .
However , if it is not a special case , we have to check to see if the new point continues the current line segment , or changes direction .
A new point extends the current line segment if all three points have the same x coordinates , but different y coordinates .
That means the current line segment is a vertical line .
The same is true if all three points have the same y coordinates , but different x coordinates , except then it is a horizontal line .
In this case , we can just extend the current line segment by making the new point the current line segment end point .
If the new point represents a change in direction , then the current line segment is as long as it is going to be .
So we flush the current line segment to the NSBezierPath , then shift the cached points into the new direction .
This means moving the end point of the current line segment into the start point , and making the new point the current line segment ’s end point .
As you probably have noticed this caching scheme means that at the end of the loop in unwindOneSegmentPath , we might end up with a line segment that has not yet been added to the NSBezierPath .
To fix this , unwindOneSegmentPath calls flushPath :
- ( void ) flushPath :( NSBezierPath *) path cachedPoint1 :( NSPoint *) point1 cachedPoint2 :( NSPoint*) point2 { //
Just add the last line to the path .
[ path line ToPoint : * point2 ] ; }
This is an ultra-simple function , that adds the end point of the current line segment to the bezier path .
This concludes the PathBuilder class , and really , the full implementation of a magic wand tool .
The rest of this article is gravy .
Implementing a paint bucket tool
Although this article has been about implementing a magic wand tool , we are so close to implementing a paint bucket tool , I thought I would cover it briefly here .
Like the magic wand tool , the paint bucket tool would have a tolerance parameter .
On mouse down , it would ask the Canvas for an image mask back , using the floodFillSelect method .
It would then pass the image mask , and the new fill color ( or image , or pattern , etc ) into the Canvas class .
The Canvas class would need a new method to handle this .
It would look something like this :
- ( void ) fillMask : ( CGImageRef ) mask withColor :( NSColor *) color { //
We want to render the image into our bitmap image rep , so create a // NSGraphicsContext from it .
NSGraphicsContext * imageContext = [ NSGraphicsContext graphicsContextWithBitmapImageRep:mImageRep ] ; CGContextRef cgContext = [ imageContext graphicsPort ] ; // " Focus " our image rep so the NSImage will use it to draw into [ NSGraphicsContext saveGraphicsState ] ; [ NSGraphicsContext setCurrentContext:imageContext ] ; // Clip out everything that we do n't want to fill with the new color NSSize canvasSize = [ self size ] ; CGContextClipToMask( cgContext , CGRectMake(0 , 0 , canvasSize.width , canvasSize.height ) , mSelection ) ; //
Set the color and fill [ color set ] ; [ NSBezierPath fillRect : NSMakeRect( 0 , 0 , canvasSize.width , canvasSize.height ) ] ; [ NSGraphicsContext restoreGraphicsState ] ; }
First , we create a graphics context from our bitmap image representation .
Then we clip to our image mask , so that we do n’t draw on pixels that we ’re not supposed to .
Finally , we set the new color and fill a rectangle the size of the canvas .
That ’s all there is to doing a paint bucket tool .
Conclusion
Holy cows , I ’ve written so much , I do n’t think I really need a conclusion .
This was a lot of fun to figure out , and hopefully this will either satisfy someone ’s idle curiosity or help future graphics editor authors .
The only thing left for you to do is download the sample code .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Tuesday that Web loggers , website operators and e-mail list editors can't be held responsible for libel for information they republish , extending crucial First Amendment protections to do - it - yourself online publishers .
Online free speech advocates praised the decision as a victory .
The ruling effectively differentiates conventional news media , which can be sued relatively easily for libel , from certain forms of online communication such as moderated e-mail lists .
One implication is that DIY publishers like bloggers cannot be sued as easily .
" One - way news publications have editors and fact - checkers , and they 're not just selling information – they 're selling reliability , " said Cindy Cohn , legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" But on blogs or e-mail lists , people are n't necessarily selling anything , they 're just engaging in speech .
That freedom of speech would n't exist if you were held liable for every piece of information you cut , paste and forward . "
The court based its decision on a section of the 1996 Communications Decency Act , or the CDA .
That section states , " ... no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider . "
Three cases since then – Zeran v. AOL , Gentry v. eBay and Schneider v. Amazon – have granted immunity to commercial online service providers .
Tuesday 's court ruling clarifies the reach of the immunity granted by the CDA to cover noncommercial publishers like list - server operators and others who take a personal role in deleting or approving messages for online publication .
" Here , the court basically said that when it comes to Internet publication , you can edit , pick and choose , and still be protected , " said Cohn .
The case traces back to a North Carolina town in 1999 , where handyman Robert Smith was repairing a truck owned by attorney and art collector Ellen Batzel .
Smith claimed to have overheard Batzel say she was related to Nazi Gestapo head Heinrich Himmler .
He said he concluded that the European paintings he saw in her home must be stolen goods , and shared this in an e-mail he sent to the editor of the Museum Security Network , an organization that publishes information about stolen art .
Without telling Smith the e-mail would be published , Ton Cremers – the sole operator of Amsterdam - based Museum Security Network –- made minor edits , then posted Smith 's e-mail to a list of about 1,000 museum directors , journalists , auction houses , gallery owners and Interpol and FBI agents .
Three months later , Batzel learned of the post .
She contacted Cremers to deny both the stolen art and Nazi ancestry allegations .
She also said Smith 's claims were motivated by financial disputes over contracting work .
Smith said he had no idea Cremers would publish a private e-mail on the list or on the Web .
Batzel sued Smith , Cremers and the Museum Security Network for defamation and won .
Cremers appealed .
The appeals court questioned whether Cremers ' minor edits to Smith 's e-mail altered it so much that the post became a new piece of expression , and decided it had not .
But because Smith claims he did n't know the e-mail would be published , the court also questioned whether the immunity provision of the Act applied , and passed the case back to the district court .
The lower court will reconsider whether Cremers had reasonable belief that Smith 's e-mail was intended for publication .
" Some weblogs are interesting mixes of original and forwarded content , so this issue may come up again in the courts , " EFF 's Cohn said .
" Where that legal line is drawn may become a point of contention . "
Ellen Batzel says the case changed her life .
" This was a small , North Carolina mountain town – I talked to the ( district attorney ) and he said ' Get a dog , get a gun , get a security system or better yet get out of town . '
I sold my house and moved .
I 've been hurt in my professional reputation and in my private life .
" I know what free speech is , and I support it , but this is about invasion of privacy and my civil liberty .
Every time I meet someone now , I have to say , ' Hi , I 'm not Himmler 's granddaughter . "
Attorney Howard Fredman , who represented Batzel in the case , said the next legal steps could include a rehearing before the appeals court , or petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court .
By firing rapid pulses of polarized light at corn , spinach and other crops , researchers have uncovered a picture of plant health that is invisible to the naked eye .
Using a portable light source and detector technology , the researchers can differentiate minute differences in leaf colors - indicators of over - or under- fertilization , crop -nutrient levels and perhaps even disease .
The researchers hope their tractor - mountable N - Checker ( for " nitrogen - checker " ) apparatus will help farmers determine in real time how much fertilizer to apply .
By preventing waste , the system could decrease the cost of crop production and dramatically cut the nitrogen - laden runoff responsible for algal blooms and other damage to wetlands and waterways .
Steve Finkelman , Paul Nordine and their colleagues at Containerless Research , Inc. of Evanston , Ill. , Louise Egerton - Warburton and partners at the Chicago Botanic Garden , and graduate student Tim Smith of the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , will present their new technology July 19 at the InfoAg 2005 Conference in Springfield , Ill .
" With our technology , we are able to easily see what is hidden from conventional instruments , " says Finkelman .
" The system eliminates interference from light reflected at a leaf 's surface and allows us to see light re-emitting from within . "
Depending on the plant , leaves reflect , transmit and absorb varying amounts of light .
Polarized light that enters a leaf 's interior can lose its polarity and be re-emitted as " depolarized " light .
The depolarized light reveals nitrogen content and other properties the proprietary sensors in the N - Checker can detect .
Changes in nitrogen levels change the way light interacts with the molecules in the leaf , characteristically affecting the spectrum of light that re-emits from the plant .
Chlorophyll molecules , in particular , contain nitrogen atoms that play a critical role in photosynthesis .
The researchers have experimented with two versions of their apparatus .
The original version channels broad - spectrum light from a xenon flashlamp through a series of calcite crystals to illuminate each corn , sugar beet , cotton or other broad - leaf crop with a tiny , transient spot of polarized light .
Moving from leaf to leaf , that system can measure nitrogen levels in 60 plants per minute .
Instead of a broad - spectrum lamp as its source , the N - Checker uses two red - light sources that cut down on sensor and polarizer costs and increase the system speed .
The red region of the electromagnetic spectrum is important because it reveals not just total chlorophyll content , but also relative amounts of the various types of chlorophyll molecules .
" Other devices use both red and infrared wavelengths , " says Finkelman .
" Those devices tend to be imprecise because they measure bulk chlorophyll content , which can result from a number of factors . "
By using two specific , visible , red wavelengths , the N - Checker can differentiate among the several types of chlorophyll molecules and therefore reveal nitrogen - dependent plant health information .
The N - Checker can take 1000 measurements per second -- at least every 10th of an inch -- while moving at roughly 5 miles an hour .
At that speed , a farmer could survey and fertilize tens of acres in a day , or hundreds of acres per day with a multi-sensor system .
