The mayor of New Orleans , Louisiana , has been quarantined in China after possible exposure to the H1N1 virus , his office said Sunday .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin flew to China as part of an economic development trip , his office said .
Mayor Ray Nagin , who traveled to China on an economic development trip , flew on a plane that carried a passenger being treated for symptoms suspected to be from the virus , commonly known as the swine flu virus , the mayor 's office said in a statement .
Nagin , his wife and a member of his security detail have been quarantined in Shanghai , China , though all three are symptom free , the statement said .
" The mayor is being treated with utmost courtesy by Chinese officials , " the statement said .
Ceeon Quiett , the mayor 's director of communications , told CNN that Nagin had been sitting beside a passenger who " exhibited the symptoms of H1N1 , " but Nagin showed no signs of illness .

Despite the fact that Gov. Ed Rendell has been in the media bellowing and warning Rep. Joe Sestak not to challenge Sen.
Arlen Specter in next year ’s Pennsylvania U.S. Senate primary , a new poll released today by Susquehanna Polling & Research finds that 63 % say that Specter should face a primary challenger .
Despite Gov. Rendell ’s warnings that Specter will crush him the primaries , yesterday on MSNBC ’s Hardball , Rep . Joe Sestak virtually all but formally announced that he was challenge Specter next year .
Here is the video :
Sestak ’s decision to run would be very popular with primary voters who believe by a 63 % - 28 % margin that Specter should face a primary challenger .
Most PA
Democrats are well aware that Rendell is trying to make the primary as easy as possible for his pal Arlen Specter .
The problem is that rank and file Democrats , not Rendell and Joe Biden should be allowed to choose the Senate nominee .
Sestak is n’t the ideal choice to challenge Specter .
He and Specter agree on more issues than they disagree , including The Employee Free Choice Act , but Sestak makes a powerful argument when he claims that the state ’s Democratic voters deserve a choice in the primary .
The party leadership has been telling Sestak to wait his turn , but he is actually doing the Democratic Party a favor by running against Specter .
Specter came into the Democratic Party assuming that he could do whatever he wanted and would not be held accountable until the general election , but a Sestak candidacy will keep Arlen in check within the Democratic Party .
Most importantly , a contested primary gives Democrats a chance to decide if they want Arlen Specter to represent them .
All in all , Joe Sestak ’s candidacy is a good thing for the state of Pennsylvania .
Inmates said the ride would be ' a kind of escape ' from prison life Nearly 200 French prisoners are preparing to take to their bikes in the first ever penal Tour de France .
The 194 inmates , escorted by 124 prison guards and sports instructors , will set off from Lille and cycle about 2,400 km ( 1,500 miles ) , ending up in Paris .
They will have to cycle in a pack , will not be ranked and , for obvious reasons , breakaway sprints will not be allowed .
Prison authorities say they hope the race will help the inmates learn values such as team work and self esteem .
The prisoners , all serving jail terms of between five and 10 years , will make stopovers in 17 different towns , each of which has a jail .

" If we behave well , we might be able to get released earlier , on probation , " he said .
Prison official Sylvie Marion said the project aims to help the prisoners " reintegrate into society by fostering values like effort , teamwork and self - esteem " .
" We want to show them that with some training , you can achieve your goals and start a new life , " Reuters quoted her as saying .

Brazilian authorities investigating illegal deforestation have accused the suppliers of several UK supermarkets of selling meat linked to massive destruction of the Amazon rainforest .
Brazilian firms that supply Tesco , Asda and Marks & Spencer are among dozens of companies named by prosecutors , who are seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation .
The move follows a three - year investigation by Greenpeace into the trade in cattle products such as meat and leather traced to illegal farms across the Amazon region .
The Greenpeace report , revealed in the Guardian earlier this month , showed that a handful of major Brazilian processors exported products linked to Amazon destruction to dozens of blue - chip companies across the world .
Daniel Cesar Avelino , the public prosecutor handling the cases , brought by Brazil 's Federal Public Prosecution Office ( MPF ) , said : " We know that the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon is cattle .
We want all companies who are part of this destructive economic chain to be responsible for their economic crimes . "
The MPF has started legal action against 21 farms and slaughterhouse companies , including Bertin , which supplies Tesco and Princes Food with processed beef .
The MPF said the investigated Brazilian companies could be to blame for illegal deforestation across 150,000 hectares .
It is seeking £ 630 m compensation for " environmental crimes against Brazilian society " .
The accused farms include the Espirito Santo farm in Para state , which the Guardian visited in an undercover investigation with Greenpeace last month .
Bertin said it was " analysing the content of the [ legal ] action to respond later " .
The MPF has also warned a further 69 firms for buying products associated with illegal deforestation , including JBS , which supplies Princes Foods , Asda and Marks and Spencer .
Bertin and JBS , the Greenpeace report said , source cattle from illegal farms , and ship the beef and hides to facilities in the south of Brazil for export .
Greenpeace claims records show that cattle from hundreds of farms across the Amazon are mixed and processed in this way , making it currently impossible to trace the origins of products .
" In effect , criminal or ' dirty ' supplies of cattle are ' laundered ' through the supply chain . "
JBS would not comment .
Several supermarkets in Brazil , including ­Wal - Mart , have already banned beef from deforested areas .
The Brazilian Association of Supermarkets said it would cancel supply contracts with accused farms .
John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace , said : " Major supermarkets in Brazil have promised action to remove Amazon beef and leather from their stores , and now it 's time that UK companies did the same … we need to see British firms cancelling contracts with suppliers who are implicated in Amazon deforestation . "
The UK supermarkets said the beef did not come from the Amazon .
Tesco and Marks and Spencer said they had received assurances from their suppliers .
Asda said it was sending people to Brazil to audit the supply line .
Princes Foods said : " We have contacted both suppliers to discuss the claims in detail , and they are liaising directly with Greenpeace .
We will monitor the outcome of these discussions closely . "
In a separate move , the World Bank said it will withdraw a $ 90 m ( £ 54.47 m ) loan to Bertin from its private lending arm , which Greenpeace says was used to expand activities in the Amazon .
Bertin supplies several companies with leather for shoes , including Nike and Timberland .
A Timberland spokesman said it was " actively engaged with Bertin to better understand this very complex issue " .
Nike said it was meeting its tannery suppliers and investigating the supply chain .
Greenpeace wants companies to refuse to buy products sourced from farms that have carried out illegal deforestation .
It wants consumers to pressure supermarkets and high - street brands identified in the report to clean up supply chains .
Clearing tropical forests for agriculture is estimated to produce 17 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions – more than the global transport system .
Cattle farming is now the biggest threat to the remaining Amazon rainforest , a fifth of which has been lost since 1970 .
The Greenpeace report compiles government records , company documents and trade data from Brazil , China , Europe , Vietnam and the US to piece together the global movement of meat , leather and cosmetics ingredients made from Brazilian cattle .
We are starting to see the fallout from the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld most of the convictions against former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and codefendant Richard Scrushy .
In the wake of that ruling , federal prosecutors asked that Siegelman be given a 20 - year prison sentence , almost three times his original sentence of seven years .
Then the full 11th Circuit denied an en banc review , essentially putting its stamp of approval on the earlier findings by a three - judge panel .
Given the possibly drastic repercussions of the appellate ruling , we should ask this question : Did the 11th Circuit get it right , under the law ?
The answer , on multiple grounds , is a resounding no .
And our review indicates that the same politics that permeated the Siegelman case at the trial level also infected the appellate process .
As regular readers know , I am not a lawyer .
I 'm a journalist with 30 years of professional experience , and because of my personal encounter with corruption in Alabama 's state courts , I 've developed a better - than - average ability to research the law .
Since the 11th Circuit 's decision was released on March 6 , I 've spent considerable time studying its 68 - page ruling and comparing it to the 84 - page appellate brief filed by Siegelman 's legal team .
I 've also studied many of the statutory and case - law issues raised in both documents .
My conclusion ?
The three - judge appellate panel , made up of all Republicans , butchered the ruling in a way that almost had to be intentional .
I see no way that a group of judges could accidentally get a decision so wrong , on so many counts .
That means the politicization of our justice system is still going on , even though George W. Bush , thankfully , is in Texas and not the White House .
It means that politicization of our justice system goes beyond the schemes of Karl Rove and pliant prosecutors .
It goes beyond corrupt trial judges , such as Mark Fuller in Alabama ( Siegelman / Scrushy case ) and Henry Wingate in Mississippi ( Paul Minor case ) .
It also goes to our federal appellate courts , which are superseded by only one court -- the U.S. Supreme Court .
Given that the nation 's highest court hears only a tiny portion of cases brought before it , the last real hope for most wronged parties are the appellate courts .
That would be the U.S. appellate courts for federal cases and the state supreme courts for state cases .
The Siegelman case might be an exception .
On the surface , it appears to raise questions that might be worthy of the Supreme Court 's attention .
But it never should have gotten that far .
Any questions , in reality , have been created out of thin air by a corrupt trial court and now by what appears to be a corrupt or incompetent 11th Circuit .
The truth is this :
The prosecution in the Siegelman case never should have made it to first base .
That it would have to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to be correctly resolved is an absurd waste of resources .
For that , all taxpayers should send letters of " thanks " to U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller .
Now , his buddies on the 11th Circuit are adding to the massive tab .
The thought that a federal appellate court is corrupt , or grossly incompetent , should send shivers down the spines of all Americans .
But we can come to no other conclusion after studying documents related to the 11th Circuit 's ruling in the Don Siegelman case .
Why does this matter ?
In the Siegelman case , it means that a man who committed no crime could spend the rest of his life in federal prison .
And if prosecutors ask for a similar extension for Richard Scrushy , and it is granted , the same could apply to him .
How would I describe the experience of reviewing the Siegelman appeal ?
The words " frightening to the core " come to mind .
And I 'm not easily shocked anymore by judicial corruption / incompetence .
I 've already shown that , in my own case , the Alabama Supreme Court acted in a clearly corrupt fashion .
And I suspect it is hardly the only corrupt state supreme court around the country .
I admit it , I ’m a huge Apple fan !

The Obama administration is preparing to wield broad financial pressure to try to force North Korea to dial back its weapons program , building on strategies former President George W. Bush employed , but then unwound .
The Treasury Department is taking a leading role and will work through international banking channels to try to restrict funds to 17 North Korean banks and companies that U.S. officials say are central players in Pyongyang 's nuclear and weapons trade .
These firms serve as a financial lifeline to ...

What defines an exemplary social media campaign ?
What are the elements necessary to capture consumers ’ attention and bring about interest and participation in any given social media campaign ?
What are the best recent social media campaigns online ?
How can we measure the success of a social media campaign ?
A Brief Intro
It is definite that things in life are never just black or white ; they usually come in different colors and shades which naturally applies to everything we do , see , touch , feel and so on .
Recently , one of the main focuses of companies with online presence and dedicated communities is creating and designing original , top - of - the - line , creative and motivating campaigns using social media .
Here is where the colors come in play !
If we assume that colors are the intensity of a social media campaign ’s success , brighter colors being most accomplished and so on , it can be quite difficult to determine which campaign was executed perfectly !
Yet , after conducting some research , I have been able to highlight 10 brands that were able to pass the test with flying colors !
10 Social Media Campaigns that Rock :
1. “ Give Me My Chuck ” campaign – using social media to pressure the NBC to continue to broadcast the third season of Chuck !
[ See this campaign ’s Social Media by Example review on Thoughtpick ]
2. Sea World ’s
Whale social media campaign – a unique integrated campaign that “ serves as a bit of a reminder about some of the clever social media marketing that can be done beyond the typical diet of Facebook Pages , Twitter and YouTube . ”
[ See this campaign ’s Social Media by Example review on Thoughtpick ]
3 . Threadless building “ brand love ” – a great message and a comprehensive coverage on the most suitable social media channels .
4. Dunkin Donut ’s new product Facebook campaign– using the Coolatta fan page , Dunkin gave out free beverages as a twitter avatar contest !
[ See this campaign ’s Social Media by Example review on Thoughtpick ]
5 . Ford using social media to promote the new Fiesta – Ford was able to find the right target audience for its Fiesta and market to them in an intriguing manner .
6. Sony Ericsson ‘s viral approach – here , Sony used a mysterious character named Johnny X and YouTube to create an element of curiosity to promote Xperia X1 .
7. Burger King ‘s Facebook application ( in addition to other social media uses ) – the Whopper Sacrifice application on Facebook .
8 . Dell ‘s effective mix of social media tools – namely Direct2 Dell Blog .
9. Target ‘s Facebook campaign – “ Bullseye Gives ” campaign on Facebook : a voting application connected to the brand ’s existing Facebook page .
10 . Comparethemeerkat.com ‘s inclusive campaign – utilizing humor and a blend of social media channels to promote car insurance .
Elements of Success ( how can it work for YOU ? )
The success of social media campaigns , and utilization in general , does not , in any way , rely on some magical formula or any secret ingredients we might need to acquire from the belated witches of Salem !
Yet , it is a careful mixture of simple and valuable elements which need to be present before , through and after the implementation of any social media campaign .
Some elements could be very obvious , while others need some research and attention to be achieved .
Make sure that you apply smart integration with the “ right ” social media channels that suit your brand image , the product / service you are trying to promote and its value .
Not every social media channel will bring about the positive feedback you are waiting for !

Not every social media channel will bring about the positive feedback you are waiting for !
Take time to choose the team who will be in charge of executing your social media plan .
It is not about the quantity , it is about the quality , remember that !
Experience and already established online PR agents or staff members will be of a higher value to your campaign in comparison with anyone with a lot of free time to waste !

Again , content is king !
It is a must to make sure that your social media campaign ’s content is not offensive , biased or easily misinterpreted .
This could be easily used against you !

You are under the microscope ; play nice !
Always be aware that once your social media campaign has hit the hot topics ’ list , you are now being watched .
Try to be continuously involved in any conversations , posts , chats and / or forums taking place regarding your product , service or campaign .
in any conversations , posts , chats and / or forums taking place regarding your product , service or campaign .
Be innovative and try not to imitate whenever possible .
You might use the same social media channels others are utilizing but try making your benefit and reward systems varied .
Your audience is not always looking to get a free coffee !

Constantly measure the depth of your social media campaign ’s fulfillment of goals and returns .
The ROI should always be bigger , or at least equal to , the invested money , time , effort and resources that you are putting in the project .

The ROI should always be bigger , or at least equal to , the invested money , time , effort and resources that you are putting in the project .
Put effort into making the overall social media campaign ’s experience fun , engaging and proactive .
Adding games , puzzles and teasers can be very addictive !
In a nut shell , though it might be tricky to implement each of the above steps within the right time frame , remember something : impossible is nothing !
And finally , allow me to leave you with the following question to think about :
What can be done when your campaign takes a wrong turn ?
Is there a kill switch for social media campaigns ?

" My toothbrush is one of four standing upright in a cup on the bathroom sink , " wrote Ada Brunstein in ‘ The House of No Personal Pronouns ’ , a 2007 piece in the New York Times Fashion & Style section .
" These toothbrushes belong to me , my boyfriend , his wife and her lover . "
Brunstein often stays at the house with her married boyfriend , who co-owns it with his estranged wife , who also sometimes lives in the house , together with her boyfriend .
This edgy domestic relationship between two couples , one half of each of which had together once formed a different couple , depends on a delicate avoidance of topics such as the evidence of the still - undissolved marriage .
There have been negotiations concerning phone calls and visits , and in addition ( for this is Language Log , not Open Marriage Lifestyle Log ) linguistic negotiations .
Brunstein 's boyfriend says " the house " now , not " our house " ; and :
He has adopted the passive voice to make it easier on me .
I once stood in front of a bookcase in the kitchen , three shelves of which hold an impressive collection of salt and pepper shakers from across the country .
" You collect salt and pepper shakers ? " I asked .
" There are salt and pepper shakers that have come into the house over the years , " he said .
Yes , it 's that elusive butterfly of passivity again .
Passive voice is a grammatical term for a particular kind of clause construction involving the past participle of a transitive verb interpreted with its subject understood as object .
There is absolutely no instance of it in
There are salt and pepper shakers that have come into the house over the years , under any syntactic definition .
Ada Brunstein , despite her degrees in science writing and linguistics ) , does not know active from passive .
Or at least , she did not know in July 2007 when the article appeared ( Language Log has written on the topic at least ten times since then ; I try to maintain a complete catalog on this page ) .
I have suggested in an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education that inaccuracies spread by Professor William Strunk and his erstwhile student E. B .
White bear some responsibility for confusions of this sort .
But several of my critics , including some of those who wrote angry responses to my Chronicle article ( one man wrote " Shame on Pullum " ) , have claimed that I am wrong .
They accuse me of misreading page 18 of ( the 4th edition of ) The Elements of Style .
The section that begins on that page is headed " Use the active voice " , and it begins by explicitly inveighing against the use of the passive voice , illustrating with two versions of a ( ridiculously implausible ) passive clause and comparing them unfavourably with the active counterpart .
It continues with an admission that the passive should not be totally shunned because it is " frequently convenient and sometimes necessary " , and gives a sensible example of an acceptable passive .
It then says this :
The habitual use of the active voice , however , makes for forcible writing .
This is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing of any kind .
Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard .
It seemed to me when I first looked at this passage , and mostly it still seems to me , that it brackets there is together with be heard as examples of the passive voice .
( Notice , if that were true , then There are salt and pepper shakers that have come into the house would be a passive . )
The passage explicitly mentions " substituting a transitive in the active voice " for such locutions ; and there is only one class of clauses that are not active already : passive clauses .
Strunk &
White proceed to display four paired examples , the left column being putatively incorrect or undesirable writing and the right column containing the corrections .
I assumed they thought all of their " incorrect " examples were passives .
Many writing teachers across the country have assumed the same ; you can read their web materials if you Google for bits and pieces of the four examples Strunk &
White supply , namely the following ( pink is supposed to be " bad " , green is supposed to be " good " ) :
There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground .
Dead leaves covered the ground .
At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard .
The cock 's crow came with dawn .
The reason he left college was that his health became impaired .
Failing health compelled him to leave college .
It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had .
She soon repented her words .
But looking through the examples while writing my Chronicle essay , I noticed that only one of the four pairs has a passive as the left - hand member .
It is simply impossible to construe these as examples of passives needing to be " corrected " to active transitives .
And anyway , only three of the right - hand members , the " correct " versions , have a transitive verb .
I took this to be striking evidence of ineptitude on the part of both authors .
Checking back , I found that Strunk 's original 1918 version of the book had a very similar block of four examples ( see them here ) , but White made two changes in his revision .
One is trivial ( in the fourth example Strunk originally had he , but recent editions of the revised book have she — someone has been trying to lighten up on the book 's sexism ) .
The other is that White entirely replaced the second example , for unknown reasons .
Where Strunk had
The sound of the falls could still be heard as the " bad " one and The sound of the falls still reached our ears as the " correction " , which does at least illustrate a passive together with a roughly synonymous active , White 's replacements were
At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard and The cock 's crow came with dawn .
This introduced an error : came is not " a transitive in the active voice " .
More incompetence , I thought .
My critics , however , insist that it is possible to read Strunk & White 's text in a different way .
I had assumed that the authors were trying to stay on message and illustrate additional " bad " passive clauses .
My critics propose that you could see them instead as deliberately broadening the discussion .
They start with passive clauses , but then branch out to include certain other expressions that they regard as " perfunctory " ( whatever that means ) rather than " lively and emphatic " .
They may begin by condemning the passive voice , but ( says this view ) they widen their scope to cover expressions like there were , and lying on the ground , and became impaired , and was not long , and was very sorry .
Such expressions are accused not of being passive but of being passive - ish : they are like passives in some diffuse way , such as being insufficiently vigorous or definite or explicit to meet Strunkian standards of bold and forthright prose — fit only for word wimps and syntactic sissies .
( This impressionistic evaluation of clause structure does n't seem particularly plausible to me , but I 'm trying to get across the general idea that my critics seem to want me to accept . )
In the response to my critics that was published in the Chronicle of Higher Education letters column , I answered this line of argument .
You may find it hidden behind a subscription wall , but here is what I said :
" Active " and " passive " are antonyms .
Using the active voice means eliminating passives , nothing more or less .
So I read pages 18 - 19 as trying to stay on the announced topic by citing passive examples .
And indeed , web materials across the country cite the four " bad " examples as passives .
But I agree that page 18 could be read as going off message , presenting not passive examples but merely other forms of " tame " or " perfunctory " expression — active , but somehow not active enough .
However , the explicit recommendation is to use " a transitive in the active voice . "
So check their proposed " good " replacements .
Only three of the four have a transitive verb !
Personally , I think S&W were confused about passives ; but it is absolutely certain that they can't tell transitive from intransitive .
Would you buy a used grammar rule from these men ?
Well , to drag this digression back to where I started , Ada Brunstein is a professional writer with an American education who has had enough success to publish in The New York Times .
I think she has drunk the Strunkian Kool - Aid .
At some time during her education she read The Elements of Style .
She has been Strunkened and Whitened .
She thinks
There are salt and pepper shakers that have come into the house over the years is passive because her understanding of passives comes entirely from page 18 of Elements , where ( at best ) definitions are misleadingly blurred .
She learned that existential clauses ( those beginning there is or there are ) are bad in some ill - defined passive - related way , and she came to suspect that vague remarks about there being things coming into the house over the years were like vague remarks about there being dead leaves lying on the ground : lacking in the short , sharp , choppy , transitive verbs that Strunk and White insist on , and insufficiently punchy to count as full , red - blooded , two - fisted , all - American actives .
I have little to say about this as advice about how you should write : I am not a style doctor or writing adviser , and ( unlike Strunk and White ) I do n't think everyone should write like me .
My interest here is solely in the fact that we need an explanation for the fact that educated Americans today have scarcely any clue what " passive clause " means .
As Mark Liberman put it ( with humorous overstatement ) , some time between 1397 and 2009 all public understanding of what " passive voice " means in grammar seems to have disappeared .
Today people just vaguely imagine that it has something to do with not being fully explicit about personal responsibility and agency , and that 's about it .
So why are college - educated Americans so prone to think that simple active - voice intransitives like " bus blows up " or " took on racial overtones " or " were leaving " or " there will be setbacks " or " this happened " , or even transitive examples like " has instructed us to " , are in the passive voice ?
I cannot show you proof , but I have offered you an empirical conjecture .
My hypothesis is that a large number of the ten million or more Americans who bought The Elements of Style have been confused by page 18 .
And I suspect that Ada Brunstein may be one of them .

It is now time for a frank admission that my specific hypothesis about Brunstein has turned out to be false .
See this post for Ada Brunstein 's own report .
But of course , that 's only about whether her error was spawned by Strunk and White 's blunders ; she says it was n't , and claims authorship of her own error .
Everything I say above about those blunders by Strunk and White is nonetheless true .

Memphis :
We did n't cheat
Memphis says it should keep the victories from the 2007 - 08 season that ended in the national title game after an internal investigation turned up no proof that a former men's basketball player cheated on his SAT exam .
" Certainly , the University of Memphis should not suffer a financial penalty or vacation of records for the 2008 NCAA Tournament as a result of this allegation , " a report detailing the school 's investigation into NCAA allegations stated .
The report , released under a public records request , details Memphis ' internal probe into accusations that a former player allowed a stand - in to take his SAT .
The report also looked into charges of grade tampering on behalf of the player .
Most names in the report were redacted by the school because of privacy concerns , but an attorney for former Memphis point guard Derrick Rose has acknowledged that Rose , who played on that team , cooperated with an investigation of similar allegations while still a student .
Rose now plays for the Chicago Bulls .
School officials argue that the program should not be penalized because the school was unaware of any wrongdoing .
-- The Committee on Infractions responded to Florida State 's appeal of sanctions from an academic cheating scandal , but kept its answer secret and gave the school 15 days to respond .
Florida State is challenging a portion of the sanctions announced in March that would force the school to vacate as many as 14 of Bobby Bowden 's 382 career football victories - one fewer than Penn State 's Joe Paterno .

U.S. national soccer player sues over alleged racism
U.S. national soccer team defender Oguchi Onyewu is suing an Anderlecht player over an alleged racial insult , hoping the case will help eradicate on - field racist abuse in European soccer .
Onyewu , who plays for Standard Liege in Belgium , says Anderlecht 's Jelle Van Damme called him a " dirty monkey " during the Belgian league playoffs .
Van Damme has denied the allegations .

HOCKEY : Center Marek Zagrapan has signed a three - year deal to play for in a Russian league next season and plans to play there whether his North American team , the Buffalo Sabres , likes it or not .
The far right wing of the American political spectrum has begun channeling its displeasure over the federal government 's involvement in the restructuring of General Motors into calls for a boycott of the company 's products .
Reportedly spearheaded by right wing pundits and radio show hosts , the boycott would be a response to the U.S. government taking a 60 % stake in GM in exchange for forgiving most of the tens of billions of dollars loaned to the company over the last six months .
The original premise of loaning money to GM ( and Chrysler ) was certainly open to plenty of healthy debate .
But the money was given and now the task has turned to how to best proceed in order for the automaker to recover and the U.S. Treasury to get the best return on its investment .
In order for that treasury - held stock to ever regain its value , GM needs to sell vehicles and lots of them .
Therefore , a successful boycott of GM products could have the adverse effect of driving the company into liquidation .
This would eliminate any hope of getting reimbursed for the tens of billions in loans that the government has given GM .
All that taxpayer money may never be recovered anyway , but it makes sense to at least walk the path that has a chance of success .
Fortunately for GM , such boycotts are rarely successful , as Ford learned when it easily weathered a boycott by the American Family Association over its marketing in gay - centric media outlets .

Motorcycle madman Jesse James has unofficially broken the land speed record for a hydrogen - powered vehicle , and he did it in a car that packs modern technology into a vintage racer more than 40 years old .
The guy behind West Coast Choppers blazed across El Mirage Dry Lake Bed at 199.7 mph in a car he claims he spent " a couple million bucks " building .
He 'd been toying with the idea of an alt - fuel racer , but rather than start from scratch – as BMW did with the slick H2R racer that previously held the record – he modified a ' 60s - era streamliner to run on gaseous hydrogen .
" I think it 's way cooler to take an old hunk of shit that many considered useless and make it haul ass , " James told Wired.com .
" It has built - in soul and history .
Plus , it 's recycling . "
That hunk of shit is a somewhat historic machine called the Dees Milodon Engineering - Davis B streamliner , and it is no stranger to the salt .
The car once hit 237 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats using a Chrysler engine , and James says it set a record for a front - wheel - drive vehicle .
It had n't seen action for awhile , and when James first saw the car it was hanging in a friend 's shop .
" I always loved the way it looked , " James said .
" Kinda like an evil flying saucer . "
After getting some design help from renowned land speed racer Mike Cook , the crew at West Coast Choppers lengthened the car 24 inches and brought the frame and suspension up to modern safety specs .
James handled all the bodywork himself , then called on engine expert Kurt Urban to help develop the powerplant .
They went a bit nuts , building a 572 - cubic - inch twin - turbo Chevrolet engine that produces prodigious power .
" BMW set the record with liquid hydrogen , which is way easier to make a motor run on but it will never be practical for everyday cars , " James told us .
" The engine produces 780 horsepower and 900 foot - pounds of torque .
That 's some serious power from the world 's most plentiful resource . "
A Liberty airshifted 5 - speed transmission and a Winters quick - change differential round out the drivetrain .
The hydrogen is stored at 5,000 PSI in three tanks built by Quantum Technologies – the same outfit developing the plug - in electric drivetrain for Fisker Automotive .
" It sounds like an iron lung when it 's working , " James said .
James fired up the engine for the first time at 12:45 a.m. on June 8 .
He says sounds " like a real race car , just done in a non - ozone - killing way . "
( Judge for yourself by watching a video posted here . )
By that point , the only thing left to do was suit up , get in and hold on .
James made his record - setting run on Tuesday and taped it for his TV show " Jesse James Is A Dead Man . "
He fell just short of his goal of 200 mph , but it was enough to top the 186.52 mph record BMW held .
The speed was confirmed by the Southern California Timing Association , a sanctioning body for land speed racing .
So why did a guy known for building customized motorcycles decide to go alt - fuel racing ?
" I 'm not so blinded by the things I build that I can't see change is needed , " he said .
" I 'm in love with anything with wheels and a big engine .
I hope my son will be able to love the same things .
They 'll just be running on a different kind of gas . "
The episode featuring James ' record run will air Aug . 9 .
UPDATE , 12:10 p.m. ET
June 19 : Roy Creel , president of the Southern California Timing Association , sent this note to correct a point in the original post :
The SCTA ( Southern Calif . Timing Association ) was neither involved in , nor did we confirm Mr Jame 's " record . "
In fact , Mr James did not set any record .
What he did accomplish was to exceed an existing record speed previously set by BMW .
His private timing event was timed by the same folks that time SCTA events and the course was set up by the same folks who set SCTA courses .
UPDATE , 3:45 p.m. Eastern June 26 : Add " LandSpeed " Louise Ann Noeth to the list of people saying James did n't set a record .
She 's a racer and journalist who 's been covering land speed racing for the past decade , and she 's beyond peeved by all the attention James is getting .
She sent us an email calling him " a liar and a cheat when it comes to claiming a world record . "
She says his claim " is without merit since the activities were conducted without benefit of any motorsports sanctioning authority . "
" Mr. James efforts count for absolutely nothing on the world motorsports stage and amount to little more than a self - promoting ' TV racer ' PR stunt since he chose to ignore the sport 's sanctioning rules that have applied to all records certified for the past 80 years , " she wrote .
We suspect Jesse James does n't care one way or the other .

DETROIT -- Slide over Super Mario and make room on the Stanley Cup for a new batch of Pittsburgh Penguins .
Max Talbot scored two second - period goals , and the Penguins overcame the loss of captain Sidney Crosby to beat the defending champion Detroit Red Wings 2 - 1 in Game 7 and win the Cup on Friday night .
Instead of the Red Wings becoming the NHL's first repeat champion since winning titles in 1997 and 1998 , this turned into a Penguins party .
The last time Pittsburgh was crowned champion , in 1991 and ' 92 , it was captained by owner Mario Lemieux .
This one would n't have been possible without a clutch diving save across the crease by Marc - Andre Fleury , who denied four - time champion Nicklas Lidstrom with 1 second left .
" I knew there was n't much time left , " Fleury said .
" The rebound was wide .
I just decided to get my body out there and it hit me in the ribs so it was good . "
Fleury was stellar in making 23 saves and erasing the memories of a 5 - 0 loss in Game 5 at Joe Louis Arena that put the Penguins on the brink of elimination .
Pittsburgh returned home and gutted out a 2 - 1 win , behind Fleury 's 25 saves in Game 6 , and forced the winner - take - all matchup .
" When you 're playing Game 7 for the Stanley Cup , and you 're playing at home , it makes it tough to lose , " Lidstrom said .
" It 's devastating when you 're that close . "
The sting was especially strong for Marian Hossa , who spurned the Penguins after last year 's Cup loss and signed a less - lucrative , one - year deal with the Red Wings , the team he thought had the best chance to win .
" Sometimes you make choices .
I still had a great year in this organization , " said Hossa , who had no goals in the series .
" If you score one more , you can celebrate , but if not , they 're celebrating .
That 's life .
You just have to move on . "
This was Pittsburgh 's second championship in four months , following the Steelers ' Super Bowl victory in February .
Jonathan Ericsson cut the Wings ' deficit to 2 - 1 with 6:07 remaining , and Niklas Kronwall nearly tied it with 2:14 left , but his drive smacked the crossbar .
Detroit pressed further after goalie Chris Osgood was pulled , but Fleury stood his ground .
His last save started a wild scene that culminated in the awarding of the Cup .
Crosby took it from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and skated to center ice before handing it off to Bill Guerin , who joined the team from the last - place New York Islanders at the trade deadline and became a champion for the first time since 1995 with New Jersey .
" When I got traded to Pittsburgh , the Pens were in 10th and I was in 30th , " Guerin said .
" We came together and bonded quickly . "
Lemieux , the No. 1 pick in the 1984 draft by Pittsburgh , celebrated on the ice with Crosby -- the phenom who has been living in Lemieux 's house since joining the team .
The Penguins are the second team to win two Game 7s on the road , following their second - round victory against Washington -- a series they also trailed 2 - 0 .
They turned the tables on the Red Wings and captured the Cup on enemy ice , just as Detroit did in Pittsburgh last year .
The Penguins are the first to win the title the year after losing in the finals since Edmonton 25 years ago against the Islanders -- the previous finals rematch .
So much for the Detroit dynasty .
Not only were the Red Wings shooting for their second straight title , but their fifth in 12 seasons and 12th overall .
" It is hard for people to believe .
We do n't take winning for granted , " Osgood said .
" We know how hard it is .
We do have a good team but it 's very , very difficult to win in this league .
We were pushed every series . "
Evgeni Malkin , who led the playoffs with 36 points , won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason MVP .
He assisted on Talbot 's first .
Crosby , four years after being the No. 1 selection in the draft , became the youngest captain of a champion at 21 .
He played just one shift after leaving the ice during the second period after taking a hard hit along the boards from Johan Franzen that left him unable to walk due to a knee injury .
" It 's a dream come true , " Crosby said .
" It 's everything you imagined and more .
I would 've loved to do it in four .
It would have been a lot easier on the nerves . "
Pittsburgh was 1 - 5 in Detroit this year and last until Friday .
The Penguins ' other victory at " The Joe " was a triple - overtime win in Game 5 last year that kept them alive .
Talbot made it possible by scoring the tying goal with 35 seconds left in regulation .
The Penguins are the first team since the 2004 Tampa Bay Lightning to win the Cup after trailing the series 3 - 2 .
They are the first to take Game 7 on the road after the home team won the first six games , since the 1971 Montreal Canadiens .
Crosby crumpled against the boards after he was hit and got his left leg caught .
He glided to the bench hunched over and stayed bent at the waist as he was guided to the dressing room 5 1/2 minutes into the period .
He was limited to two shifts , totaling 2 minutes , 39 seconds of ice time in the frame , but his teammates doubled the lead while he was gone .
Crosby made it back to the ice midway through the third period for the one shift .
" It was so painful , being a captain and seeing what the guys are doing out there blocking shots , " Crosby said of the third period .
" You get to the point where you 've got to ask yourself whether you 're going to be hurting your team by being out there .
I knew I had everything I could to numb it or try to play through it .
" At the same time , I 'm playing against [ Pavel ] Datsyuk and [ Henrik ] Zetterberg .
One misstep and I could cost the guys a lot of hard work .
I did n't want to be the guy who did that . "
Uncharacteristic mistakes by the experience - laden Red Wings led to both Pittsburgh goals .
Malkin , the NHL's leading scorer in the regular season and the playoffs , forced defenseman Brad Stuart into making a bad pass .
Talbot intercepted the puck in front and fired it between Osgood 's pads at 1:13 .
" Max came up with some big goals there , " Crosby said .
" We do n't get to this point without everyone contributing .
I knew the guys were going to find a way to pull it off . "
Talbot snapped a wrist shot from the middle of the left circle on a 2 - on - 1 that sneaked in under the crossbar to make it 2 - 0 at 10:07 .
Fleury took care of the rest .
He was n't fazed by Red Wings crashing the net or screening him or any funky bounces off the end boards that tortured him in earlier games in Detroit .
Rookie coach Dan Bylsma became the second to win the Stanley Cup with a team he took over midseason .
Bylsma helped rescue the Penguins from a near - playoff miss by leading them to a 18 - 3 - 4 mark after replacing Michel Therrien on Feb. 15 .
Bylsma was on the losing side as a player in 2003 with Anaheim in the last series in which the home team won all seven games .
Those Mighty Ducks were coached by current Red Wings bench boss Mike Babcock .
" It definitely does fill the void , " Bylsma said .
" I have n't won a lot of things since high school .
It elevates your career to a different level .
" When you lift that Cup , Stanley Cup champion will go by your name forever . "
The Red Wings were the overwhelming favorite coming in with four players on the verge of their fifth Stanley Cup rings .
Detroit had been 11 - 1 at home in the playoffs .
Game notes
Bylsma is the 14th rookie coach to win the Cup . ...
The last road team to win Game 7 of the championship round in any major league was the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates .
Club chairman's anger at ' horrendous ' treatment of 17 naughty nun footballers arrested on tour in Crete
Members of a football team who were arrested in Crete after a scandalous night out clad in naughty nun outfits have slammed authorities for overreacting - and admitted the ordeal was one they will ' never forget ' .
Club chairman Mick Underhill and 16 other current and former players for Hanham Athletic and Hanham Sunday league team , based in Bristol , were arrested in a bar in the seaside resort of Malia on Saturday night dressed in nuns ' costumes , lingerie and wimples .
They spent a night in police cells after being arrested for causing offence to the Catholic church .
Bystanders look on in bemusement as 17 British men dressed as naughty nuns and handcuffed together appear in a Crete court yesterday
Mr Underhill , 59 , said he and his team - mates , aged 18 to 65 , were marched into a courtroom in the Crete capital of Heraklion yesterday morning still dressed in the risque garb after spending 40 gruelling hours in a ' cramped ' and ' disgusting ' prison cell .
Speaking from a bar in Malia , now a free man , Mr Underhill said : ' The last 48 hours have just been unbelievable .
It 's no doubt something we will never forget .
' The prison facilities were horrendous .
You would n't let the dog use the toilets in there .
There was graffiti all over the walls .
We were all squeezed into one cell with eight concrete beds - and we had to buy food if we wanted to eat . '
The men , all football players , ranged in age from 18 - 65
The men were part of a high - spirited football tour : The Hanham Sunday Tour , made up of current and former footballers of Hanham Athletic and Hanham 's Sunday league team , based in Bristol .
The group had been out partying in Hania , a lively Mediterranean town with a reputation for drunken antics .
Apparently the locals have decided enough is enough , however , and the footballers were arrested and accused of causing offence to the Catholic Church with their outfits .
The men had not finished their first drink of the night when they were thrown into the back of a ' riot ' van , Mr Underhill said .
' We have a couple of drinks , and then we parade around the street in costume for one night of the holiday , ' Mr Underhill said .
The men traipse off to appear before a judge and prosecutors in their ' scandalous ' gear
' It 's an end - of - season celebration and tradition .
We 're laughing at ourselves and the other people laugh at us too .
It 's harmless .
' We had n't even finished our first drink when we were arrested and in the back of a van . '
The naughty nuns even had handcuffs - not part of their costumes , but a little addition by the police .
They were held for ' scandal and misrepresentation of a costume or uniform ' - and were led into court still in their bizarre outfits .
But the tale had a happy ending when the prosecutor decided to drop all charges against the men after no one showed in court to testify that they had been offended by the odd performance .
All 17 men were released - presumably to head straight back to their hotel for a change of clothes .
Mr Underhill said that when they appeared in court there was trouble with interpretation - and some of the men signed documents without fully understanding the content .
Fortunately for the men , the prosecutors decided to drop the charges after no one showed to testify that they had been offended
' We 're all strong - minded men but we were shaken up by the experience , especially some of the younger lads , ' Mr Underhill said .
But once released , a weight was taken from the team 's shoulders , Mr Underhill added .
' We had to get back to Malia still dressed as nuns - but the costumes are in the bin now , ' he said .
' We 're going to try and relax and enjoy the rest of the holiday , but some of us have already said we 're going to look into the way we were treated .
We do n't think what happened was right or fair .
' But we 've got a lot of comedians at the club , and they 're already having a laugh about it .
It will be easier to giggle when we 're back home . '
The players will be arriving back in Bristol late tonight .
Nuns in Crete wear their habits considerably longer than these British tourists , however
The Hanham Sunday Tour is an annual trip started in the Sixties by the Sunday league team , which now plays in the Bristol Sunday League Premier division .
And you may not be surprised to hear this is not the first time the players have gone out in fancy dress while together overseas .
In previous years the men have dressed up as St Trinians schoolgirls in Portugal and babies in Cyprus .
Britons account for about 15 per cent of the 15 million tourists who visit Greece every year and some have gained notoriety for drunken and occasionally violent behaviour .
In 2007 , Malia residents staged a march against British tourists and the town was featured in a documentary ‘ Sex on the Beach ’ that followed the exploits of a group of young British holidaymakers at the resort .
A 20 - year - old British woman was charged with infanticide last summer after giving birth to a baby in her Malia hotel room while she was on holiday with her sister and a friend .
Last year , authorities on Crete arrested dozens of tourists in a crackdown on binge - drinking and crime at Greece 's coastal resorts .
Australia 's first television glass recycling plant is calling for New Zealanders ' old televisions , as environmental organisations on both sides of the Tasman sea try to stem the flow of toxic TVs to rubbish dumps .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Increasing numbers of people are dumping lead - containing cathode - ray tube televisions as they buy new flat - screen and digital televisions before the switch to digital broadcasting .
The change is due in 2013 in Australia and 2012 - 2015 in New Zealand .
Most discarded TV sets end up in landfill , with the toxins they contain such as lead , mercury and arsenic .
Adelaide company CRT Recycling has used A$ 290,000 ( £ 144,000 ) of taxpayers ' money to open the first TV glass recycling plant in Australia .
Managing director Michelle Morton said the plant , which turns lead - laced television glass into material that can be used for new television and computer screens , was running at less than five per cent of its capacity .
" This is a non-renewable resource that we can completely reuse to make new televisions but it 's mostly still going to landfill , " she said .
Two New Zealand companies are awaiting hazardous substance permits so they can send television screens to be recycled by CRT .
The recycled glass would be sent to Malaysia to make new screens , said Ms Morton .
Unlike some similar plants , CRT does not separate glass from lead .
Ms Morton said that saved TV - makers the cost of adding lead to make a new screen , saved mining of new lead and reduced CO2 emissions from the recycling process ( by lowering the melting temperature of the glass ) .
Jo Knight of charitable consultancy Zero Waste Trust said it would be ideal if New Zealand could recycle its own TV screens .
" [ But ] unless we get something in place quickly they 're all going to end up in landfill . "
She said Kiwis needed a safer way to recycle toxic old TVs than waiting for inorganic waste collections .
Zero Waste Trust wants the Government to ban sending old TVs to landfill .
It has been estimated New Zealand has 10 million cathode - ray tubes from computers and televisions still in use or waiting to be disposed of .
New Zealand company RCN dismantles old TVs and separates the lead - bearing glass from the rest of the glass in the screen .
The glass is exported to a lead smelter where it is used to help process lead .
The Ministry for the Environment said computer monitors in good condition handed in on a special recycling day last year were sent overseas to be reused .
The rest were shipped to South Korea for recycling .

Some of the physicists who made early contributions to quantum mechanics ( left to right , top row first ) : Neils Bohr , Albert Einstein , Max Planck , Wolfgang Pauli , Werner Heisenberg [ Credit : Deutsches Bundesarchiv ( German Federal Archive ) , Bild183 - R57262 ] , and Erwin Schrödinger .
Does mysticism have a place in quantum mechanics today , or is the idea that the mind plays a role in creating reality best left to philosophical meditations ?
Harvard historian Juan Miguel Marin argues the former - not because physicists today should account for consciousness in their research , but because knowing the early history of the philosophical ideas in quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the theory on a fundamental level .
In a recent paper published in the European Journal of Physics , Marin has written a short history , based on a longer analysis , of the mysticism controversy in the early quantum physics community .
As Marin emphasizes , the controversy began in Germany in the 1920s among physicists in reaction to the new theory of quantum mechanics , but was much different than debates on similar issues today .
At the turn of the last century , science and religion were not divided as they are today , and some scientists of the time were particularly inspired by Eastern mysticism .
In his analysis , Marin lays out each player ’s role and perspective in the controversy , and argues that studying the original interpretations of quantum mechanics can help scientists better understand the theory , and could also be important for the public in general .
“ Becoming aware of this subject would help general audiences realize that there are many other alternatives besides the ones offered by the disjunction between science and religion , ” Marin told PhysOrg.com .
“ Science vs. religion is a very recent forced choice that the founders of quantum mechanics would have never recognized , much less accepted . ”
Mind Matters
The controversy boils down to the age - old question of the nature of reality .
As Einstein ( a firm realist ) once asked , does the moon exist only when looked at ?
Although such a viewpoint seems unlikely in our everyday lives , in quantum mechanics , physicists ’ observations can sometimes affect what they ’re observing on a quantum scale .
As the famous Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics argues , we cannot speak about an objective reality other than that which is revealed through measurement and observation .
As Marin explains , the debate of consciousness in quantum theory began around 1927 when Einstein accused Neils Bohr of introducing a mysticism incompatible with science .
Bohr denied the accusation and blamed it on Einstein misunderstanding him when he said that humans are both actors and observers in the world .
Yet while Bohr believed that quantum processes occurred without the need for observers , he also sympathized with the idea that an extension of quantum theory might help in understanding consciousness .
Einstein , for his part , adamantly opposed any subjectivity in science .
He disagreed with Bohr ’s view that it is unscientific to inquire whether or not Schrödinger ’s cat in a box is alive or dead before an observation is made .
Einstein devoted much of his later life to searching for elements of reality to make quantum mechanics a theory based on realism .
For instance , the EPR paradox ( Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen paradox ) thought experiment in 1935 attempted to restore realism and causality to the theory .
On the other hand , Wolfgang Pauli truly did harbor some of the views that Einstein accused Bohr of .
Pauli favored a hypothesis of “ lucid mysticism , ” a synthesis between rationality and religion .
He speculated that quantum theory could unify the psychological / scientific and philosophical / mystical approaches to consciousness .
Pauli ’s perspective was influenced by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer , whose views on reality were in turn influenced by Eastern religions .
Still other physicists had different views .
Marin argues that Max Planck , an adherent of Christianity , framed the controversy as the objectivity of science and Christianity against the mysticism of Schopenhauer and his popularization of Buddhism and Hinduism .
Planck considered religion ( Christianity ) and science compatible based on his opinion that they are both based on objectivity but refer to distinct facets of reality .
Meanwhile , Paul Dirac rejected any kind of religious vocabulary , arguing that “ religion is a jumble of false assertions with no basis in reality . ”
The mysticism controversy also expanded into the public realm , starting in 1929 with first astrophysicist Arthur Eddington ’s popular book The Nature of the Physical World .
Although the book distorted many concepts , his defense of mysticism caught the attention of the international media .
( Eddington was most famous for confirming Einstein 's theory of relativity by measuring an eclipse , which catapulted Einstein into fame . )
In the next few years Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger leaned toward the side of mysticism , irritating Einstein and Planck .
For others , the choice was not clear cut .
Marin argues that the mathematician John Von Neumann intentionally used ambiguous terms when discussing the philosophy of quantum equations , meaning he could fit on either side .
“ He was a genius at linguistic innovation and came up with German terms that could support many different interpretations , ” Marin said .
In 1958 , Schrödinger , inspired by Schopenhauer from youth , published his lectures Mind and Matter .
Here he argued that there is a difference between measuring instruments and human observation : a thermometer ’s registration cannot be considered an act of observation , as it contains no meaning in itself .
Thus , consciousness is needed to make physical reality meaningful .
As Schrödinger concluded , " Some of you , I am sure , will call this mysticism .
So with all due acknowledgement to the fact that physical theory is at all times relative , in that it depends on certain basic assumptions , we may , or so I believe , assert that physical theory in its present stage strongly suggests the indestructibility of Mind by Time . "
Cultural Reflections
As Marin notes , Schrödinger ’s lectures mark the last of a generation that lived with the mysticism controversy .
As Marin explains , quantum mechanics up to World War II existed in a predominantly German context , and this culture helped to form the mystical zeitgeist of the time .
The controversy died in the second half of the century , when the physics culture switched to Anglo - American .
Most contemporary physicists are , like Einstein , realists , and do not believe that consciousness has a role in quantum theory .
The dominant modern view is that an observation does not cause an atom to exist in the observed position , but that the observer finds the location of that atom .
As Marin has shown , the mysticism controversy in quantum mechanics did not involve just a few physicists and mystics ( as it seems to today ) , but at one time it attracted the physics community at large .
Some of the ideas have since resurfaced , such as in Eugene Wigner ’s 1961 paper on the subject , which inspired popular books such as The Tao of Physics and The Dancing Wu Li Masters , which seek to connect quantum physics to Eastern mysticism for a new generation , along with the recent film What the Bleep Do We Know ?
“ But here it was scientists vs. non-scientists , ” Marin explained .
“ Today it is seen as science vs. religion , but at the time of the foundation of quantum mechanics it was not .
There were religious physicists on both sides of the controversy .
Most of the important physicists held what we could call today religious beliefs , whether Western or Eastern .
When we speak today of the ‘ two cultures , ’ sciences and humanities , we are referring to the famous early ‘ 50s lecture by C.P. Snow , in Britain , lamenting the division .
German thinkers of the previous decades were barely into that phase of discipline specialization .
At the turn of the century , mathematics and physics were still distinguishing themselves from the ‘ natural philosophy ’ that gave birth to them . ”
Marin hopes that scientists today might gain a new perspective on their research by considering how the founders of quantum mechanics viewed the theory .
“ Whenever I read scientific articles citing the classic equations conceived by German scientists , it seems to me they could have been improved by researching how the scientists themselves interpreted their own equations , ” Marin said .
“ Among contemporary quantum field theories , the important gauge theories are indebted to the work of [ Hermann ] Weyl and Pauli .
Yet many physicists today would be shocked if they learned how Weyl and Pauli understood the concept ‘ field ’ when they wrote their classic articles .
They were both immersed in mysticism , searching for a way to unify mind and physics .
Weyl published a lecture where he concluded by favoring the Christian - mathematical mysticism of Nicholas of Cusa .
Moreover , Pauli 's published article on Kepler presents him as part of the Western mystical tradition I study .
“ For those who do not favor the Copenhagen interpretation and prefer the alternative proposed by David Bohm , I would suggest reading Bohm 's many published dialogues on the topic of Eastern mysticism , ” he added .
“ Eddington and Schrödinger , like many today , joined forces to find a quantum gravity theory .
Did their shared mysticism have a role to play in whatever insights they gained or mistakes they made ?
I do not know , but I think it 's important to find out . ”

Via : Wall Street Journal :
A central tenet of Washington economic policy for the past three years has been that the key to ending the recession is stopping mortgage foreclosures , whatever the cost .
Well , another new study shows that mortgage - servicing companies are having a terrible time of it , not least because the mortgages are continuing to sour at a rate nearly as fast as they can be modified .
Yesterday ’s Journal reports that Fitch Ratings looked at mortgages bundled into securities between 2005 and 2007 and managed by some 30 mortgage companies .
Fitch found that a conservative projection was that between 65 % and 75 % of modified subprime loans will fall delinquent by 60 days or more within 12 months of having been modified to keep the borrowers in their homes .
This is an even worse result than previous reports by federal regulators .
Even loans whose principal was reduced by as much as 20 % were still redefaulting in a range of 30 % to 40 % after 12 months .

It 's an idea that most of us would rather not face -- that within the next century , life as we know it could come to an end .
Our civilization could crumble , leaving only traces of modern human existence behind .
It seems outlandish , extreme -- even impossible .
But according to cutting edge scientific research , it is a very real possibility .
And unless we make drastic changes now , it could very well happen .
Experts have a stark warning : that unless we change course , the " perfect storm " of population growth , dwindling resources and climate change has the potential to converge in the next century with catastrophic results .
Watch " Earth 2100 , " a two - hour television event , Tuesday , June 2 , at 9 p.m. ET .
In order to plan for the worst , we must anticipate it .
In that spirit , guided by some of the world 's experts , ABC News ' " Earth 2100 , " hosted by Bob Woodruff , will journey through the next century and explore what might be our worst - case scenario .
But no one can predict the future , so how do we address the possibilities that lie ahead ?
Our solution is Lucy , a fictional character devised by the producers at ABC to guide us through the twists and turns of what the next 100 years could look like .
It is through her eyes and experiences that we can truly imagine the experts ' worst - case scenario -- and be inspired to make changes for the better .
For more information on the climate change war game featured in Earth 2100 , click HERE .
The Future : It 's Nearer Than We Think
By 2015 , there are expected to be hopeful signs .
Experts predict alternative energy solutions that are currently in their infancy will gain momentum .
Windmills may sprout up everywhere .
Off the coast of Scotland , a sprawling wave farm will harvest renewable energy from the ocean .
Vatican City will meet all of its energy needs with solar power .
And the U.S. will produce cleaner , more fuel efficient vehicles in accordance with newly unveiled emissions guidelines .
But will it be enough ?
In 2015 , global demand for fossil fuels could be massive and growing , but experts say oil will be harder to find and far more expensive to consume .
" We have no new source of energy on the horizon that 's currently capable of being developed on a large enough scale to replace the supply of oil in any near - term framework , " says Michael Klare , professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College .
If the cost of gasoline skyrockets , few may be able to afford to maintain the lifestyles to which we 've grown accustomed .
There may be a mass exodus from the suburbs , as driving gas - fueled cars becomes nearly impossible economically .
But will that convince us to change our ways ?
" Until we have a crisis of some kind , I do n't think we 're going to be motivated to make the really deep changes in the way we use energy , the technologies we use , the density of our cities , our travel patterns , " says Thomas Homer - Dixon , a political science professor and author of " The Upside of Down . "
The imagined crises in Lucy 's futuristic world come in the forms of earthshaking hurricanes spawned by over - reliance on climate - damaging coal and other nonrenewable resources .
What if climate change in our world is actually much closer than we think ?
Many experts say we have to start seriously reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2015 , or we may pass a point of no return .
" If we continue on the business as usual trajectory , there will be a tipping point that we cannot avert , " says John P. Holdren , science advisor to President Obama .
" We will indeed drive the car over the cliff . "
Scientists predict that by 2020 , global catastrophes may well begin to accelerate .
The human population is expected to explode and animal species may be dying off at a rapid rate .
As the world becomes more chaotic , the costs of mending it would grow more and more daunting .
By 2030 , gradually rising temperatures may have shifted rainfall patterns around the globe , and many experts warn much of the world may face serious shortages of our most basic need -- water .
" By 2030 , two - thirds of the world 's population will be under water stress , " says Janine Benyus , science writer and founder of the Biomimicry Institute .
Some cities will have the forethought to plan ahead .
Starting in 2009 , San Diego began building huge desalination plants to turn ocean water into an abundance of fresh water .
But in the middle of the country , people may be running out -- and there may well not be funds to transport it from the coast .
If and when a place like Tucson , Ariz . , runs dry , people will panic .
" Something that will catch people 's attention is the first rich city that just runs out of water , " says Homer - Dixon .
Americans may well meet these challenges with resourcefulness and work hard to keep the threats at bay .
But even as things stabilize on the home front , experts predict hundreds of thousands of environmental refugees may begin streaming through Europe , fleeing droughts and famines .
Millions of Latin Americans could align on the U.S. border seeking entry , and some could encounter violent resistance .
" I can't imagine the horrors that will take place on the border as millions of refugees try to get into the United States , " says Klare .
History Repeats Itself
In the history of Earth , there have been five mass extinctions in which at least half the species on the planet disappeared .
Scientists believe the extinctions were brought on by natural disasters -- massive volcanic eruptions , rapid climate changes and meteors hitting Earth .
Today , scientists say we are in the middle of a " sixth extinction " -- and for the first time , it 's being caused by one species -- us .
It seems inconceivable that we could do so much damage to our planet that we actually cause society as we know it to collapse .
But historical precedent shows that it is , in fact , a very real possibility .
" Every society that collapsed thought it could n't happen to them , " says Joseph Tainter , an expert in anthropology and societal collapse .
" The Roman Empire thought it could n't happen .
The Maya civilization thought it could n't happen .
Everyone thought it could n't happen to them .
But it did . "
These populations grew too much and exhausted their resources -- and their climate suddenly changed .
People were forced to fight each other for what little was left or face starvation .
Entire societies broke down .
" Civilizations in the past have lost the fight , " says climatologist Heidi Cullen .
" They have collapsed as a result of the inability to deal with several different events going on at once .
I think the takeaway is that honestly , we are not that special . "
Our Current Course : Where We 're Headed
If we remain on the current course , it 's estimated that by 2050 , the world 's population may have increased by at least half and many parts of the world may be facing grave shortages of resources .
The Southwest U.S. could face an extended drought , while pests threaten crops .
As global sea levels rise , much of the world map could be redrawn .
People will begin to migrate back to urban areas in search of better lives .
There would likely still be beacons of green living -- massive solar farms may produce enough power to light up entire regions of the country .
Towns like Greenburg , Kan. , decimated in 2007 by a tornado and rebuilt to be completely self - sustaining , may inspire communities around the globe do the same .
But unless the rest of the world gets on board -- and fast -- some experts warn it may just not be enough .
" A few hundred years down the line , they 'll look back and say the dark ages began with the twenty - first century , " says E. O. Wilson , an award - winning evolutionary biologist and professor at Harvard University .
But just how bad could things get ?
In one scenario , scientists imagine that by the year 2100 , immense storms irreparably damage major metropolises .
Streets , subway tunnels , and buildings would flood and begin to rot .
The stagnant water would breed filth and displace residents , forcing them into homelessness .
Poverty levels and death rates could skyrocket .
A new and virulent strain of disease might develop -- then mutate and spread around the globe , potentially claiming tens of thousands of lives .
In this scenario , as the crisis explodes , looting grows rampant , major world powers go to war over water , and millions of people die from famine .
Civilization literally collapses under its own weight .
It seems unlikely that platinum - selling rap artist Soulja Boy has ever even heard of let alone visited Grotton .
But for one family in this quiet suburb of Oldham , the singer 's latest hit has bequeathed an unwanted legacy .
Ever since the Atlanta - based star 's new single Kiss Me Thru the Phone hit the UK singles charts four weeks ago the phone at their house has been ringing off the hook .
" Sunday was complete hell , " said Gerry Matley yesterday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We must have had 60 calls .
The vast majority are from 13 - year - old girls and they do n't really expect to get through so they get a bit nervy and hang up .
The others ask whether Soulja Boy is there .
I say 'he does n't live in Oldham and he does n't talk like me ' , " said the 54 - year - old father - of - two .
The problem for Mr Matley and his wife Catriona Howard - Smith is that shortly in to the Top 10 track after telling his fans " I miss ya , I miss ya , I miss ya , I really wanna kiss ya but I can 't . " , Soulja – real name DeAndre Ramone
Way – raps a 10 digit phone number – the first seven numbers of which will put local callers through to the family home .
Whilst some fans have checked out what they believe to be a hotline to the star as early as 2 am the vast majority of calls begin at 3.30 pm when teenagers come home afer school .
Unfortunately Mr Matley is unable to change his number because he runs an energy assessment business from home .
He is hoping that as interest in the song wanes as it drops down the charts the calls will cease .
" We have tried to get in touch with his record company .
But there is no way through .
We are offering to sell the number to them for his UK fan club , " he said .
No-one at the singer 's UK record label Polydor was available for comment yesterday on the plan .
Although he may be unheard of among the majority of listeners over the age of 20 , Soulja Boy has become a massive star on the rap scene in the Unted States and received a Grammy nomination in 2008 .
He famously engaged in a vicious public feud with Ice - T after the Gangsta legend lambasted his work as " garbage " and accused him of " killing hip hop " ' Soulja Boy , who as his name implies sepcialises in a more gentle , caring version of the art form , hit back with a mocking YouTube rebuff to the older man .
In December last year he found himself the victim of a terrifying robbery at his home when he was held at gunpoint by intruders brandishing AK - 47s .
The following day a video surfaced on the internet featuring two masked men claiming credit for the crime .
Ms Howard - Smith knew nothing of the singer 's colourful personal when the calls first began but later solved the riddle after being told by her daughter about the song and typing the star 's name into the internet .
" It is really bizarre .
I try to explain to them that I am nothing to do with Soulja but they will not accept it .
Some ask if I am his girlfriend , " she said .
" I suppose it is amusing but we wish it would stop , " she added .

The Secrets of the Federal Reserve : The Federal Reserve Act was legislated in 1913 to end recessions , panics and depression .
Over that almost 100 - year period they have been eminently no more successful then their predecessors .
The Fed is a private corporation , which guides US monetary policy .
Its staff is from Wall Street , banking , and transnational conglomerates and occasionally from academia .
Of the 12 Federal Reserve banks the New York bank is the most powerful .
The staffing of the Fed at the least is incestuous , because the member banks take part in the staffing , as they filter to the Fed what actions they should take .
That is done by the FOMC , The Federal Open Market Committee .
As a further example the recent stress test done by the Fed was done on many of their owners .
Sadly the public is unaware of this and even business majors and those with business masters degrees do not know that the Fed is privately owned or what they actually do .
For those of you who would like to get a better understanding read G. Edward Griffith ’s , “ Creature from Jekyll Island ” and the secrets of the Federal Reserve ” by Eustace Mullins .
Recently we discovered that $ 101.4 billion was originally secretly funneled through AIG to AIG counterparties - parties that were owed these sums by AIG , which had not collateralized derivative contracts .
That is like writing insurance and having no collateral reserves set aside for losing events .
The Federal Reserve in their wisdom paid off AIG ’s debt with what eventually will be taxpayer debt .
This is wrong and it should not have been done secretly .
When demanded by a Federal Judge to reveal to whom these monies were paid and under what circumstances , the Fed said it would harm their reputations and it was a “ state secret . ”
The biggest gun in the Fed arsenal is the New York Fed .
The recently appointed Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner was the NY Fed ’s previous governor .
Mr. Geithner had worked in government previously and was in part responsible for the Asian financial disaster in 1997 - 1998 .
He is also a Goldman Sachs alumnus .
He is part of a never - ending exchange of the denizens of Wall Street and banking being appointed to government positions .
In fact Wall Street and banking have been running our government for a long time .
Many say for too long .
This kind of relationship makes government a tool of major financial interests and it breeds corruption , as we just witnessed in the case of Stephen Friedman , formerly of Goldman Sachs , and until he resigned last week , for having purchased some Goldman Sachs stock , was Chairman of the NY federal Reserve , the position Mr. Geithner had held before him .
This raises the fundamental question of appointment and corruption .
Never mind the other issues the Fed is involved in .
this is America ’s most powerful financial institution and it is run by corrupt and perhaps incompetent people .
The NY fed has a very special position , because it is actively running markets every day via the 21 dealers it uses to manipulate and uses these markets .
This is part of the program never spoken of that exists to assist the “ Working Group on Financial Markets , which manipulates markets 24/7 , under an Executive Order signed in August 1988 by then President Ronald Reagan .
This was executed to protect against market failures such that had taken place the previous October .
The order was for emergencies .
The Treasury , the Fed , Wall Street and banking have distorted its original intent .
The Fed also sets interest rates and regulates the issuance of money and credit .
Thus the Fed holds a pivotal role in our financial well - being .
They also are to insure the soundness and stability of the banking system .
If our banking system breaks down it is the fault of the Fed .
When that happens it should not be the province of the Fed to commit trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to bail out its own owners .
You can get an idea of the incestuous nature of the Fed and Wall Street in looking at the select committee that not that long ago picked Timothy Geithner to head the NY Fed .
Hank Greenberg defrocked former Chairman of AIG , who for some reason was never criminally prosecuted in the scandal ; John Whitehead a former Chairman of Goldman Sachs ; Peter Peterson , a former Chairman of Lehman Bros . ; and Walter Shipley , a former Chairman of Chase Manhattan , now with JP Morgan Chase .
We wonder why the media never questions these kinds of connections all of which are tied together by the Council on Foreign Relations .
Then there is the composition of the NY Fed board on which six board members are public representatives .
We do not see any common business people on this board .
They are all very wealthy New Yorkers , who are all connected to one another .
There have been occasionally members of labor and academia , but they can only be considered tokens .
It is very definitely an insiders club .
This means the Fed ’s real consideration is the maximizing of profits for banking , Wall Street , insurance and real estate .
This goal of almost 100 years has made these individuals and their families ’ mega-rich .
Competent or incompetent they always win .
They have information and intelligence no one else has and you can be sure their inner circle has the same privileged information .
As usual they are essentially unregulated , which gives the Fed an additional advantage .
The lack of banking oversight of recent years has brought our entire financial system into insolvency .
We do not know how you could call it anything else when most major banks , brokerage houses , some insurance companies and other lenders are simply broke .
The Fed , and particularly the NY Fed , has been complicit in banks and brokerage houses using leverage of more than 50 times assets .
In some cases such as JP Morgan Chase the figures are much higher .
In fractional banking 8 to 10 times is considered appropriate .
This is the biggest bailout of poorly managed corrupt banks in history .
This failure is far greater than the failure of the Lombard System in Venice in 1348 , the year of the great bubonic plague that swept Europe and killed 50 % of its inhabitants .
These elitists have brought the world economy to its knees .
It is ironic , but true to insider dealing , that not one CEO or senior executive has been fired , as trillions of dollars have been lost .
That said this is the perfect segway to bring to your attention a bill calling for the Comptroller General of the US to audit the private Federal Reserve .
At last report 124 members of the House have joined Rep. Ron Paul ’s bill HR 1207 , as co-sponsors , to his Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 .
Both the Fed ’s Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks would be required to report to Congress before the end of 2010 .
This could be the most important bill in modern American history and could lead to our financial and economic recovery .
When the Congress sees what the Fed has done they might just abolish it , which is really the solution .
As Rep .
Paul says , “ Congress should reassert its constitutional authority over monetary policy . ”
The Constitution gives Congress , not the private Federal Reserve , “ the Authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency . ”
“ The Fed has presided over the near - complete destruction of the US dollar , ” says Rep. Paul .
“ Since 1913 the dollar has lost over 95 % of its purchasing power , aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve ’s loose money policy . ”
“ How long will we as a Congress stand idly by while hard - working Americans see their savings eaten away by inflation ? ”
Only big - spending politicians and politically favored bankers benefit from inflation , ” he said .
“ Since its inception , the Fed has always operated in the shadows , without sufficient scrutiny or oversight of its operations . ”
The Fed can enter into agreements with foreign central banks and foreign governments , and the GAO ’s prohibited from auditing or even seeing these agreements .
There are no enforcement powers over the Fed .
The Fed ’s funding facilities including the Dealer Credit Facility , Term Securities Lending Facility , and the Term Asset - Backed Securities Lending Facility should be subject to congressional oversight .
Every problem we have had in our economy from the Fed ’s conception and passage can be directly traced to Federal Reserve policy .
Legislation should be passed to abolish the Fed and that the OMB , the Office of Management and Budget liquidate Fed assets to insure a quick transfer of their functions to the Treasury .
HR 1207 is now in the House Committee of Financial Reserves and has been there for 3 months .
This could be the most important legislation ever submitted due to the financial conditions in America at this time .
In the Senate , Sen. Bernard Sanders ( I - VT ) has submitted a similar bill , which has been in the Senate Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs Committee for 2 months .
As Rep .
Paul says , “ auditing the Fed is only the first step towards exposing this antiquated insider - run creature to the powerful forces of free - market competition .
Once there are viable alternatives to the monopolistic fiat dollar , the Federal Reserve will have to become honest and transparent if it wants to remain in business .
Contact everyone in Congress and let him or her know how you feel about this issue as soon as possible .
As Joseph Schummpeter argues that monetary measures do not allow policymakers to eliminate economic depression , only to delay it under penalty of more severity in the future .
In a market economy , economic depressions are painful but unavoidably recurring .
Counter cyclical monetary measures to provide more money and credit to keep ill - timed investment on a high level in a depression are not creative destruction , but positive destruction , and such measures will ultimately be detrimental to the general welfare .
This is what we ’ve been preaching for some time .
Unemployment is a natural extension for stabilizing production and consumption , and its solution cannot be implemented by holding up asset prices in a depressed market economy .
Unemployment is usually reduced by deficit - financing and high wages .
Today that is not easy with a $ 2 trillion deficit , rising interest rates , monetization and the insane creation of money and credit .
Plus , how can you maintain wages , or raise them , with an army of illegal aliens working for next to nothing and offshoring and outsourcing still going at full tilt ?
Monetarist measures cannot hold up asset prices with today ’s problems , which are the worst since the early 1870s .
Looking back Herbert Hoover was wrong in starting off the Socialist - Fascist era that began the 1930 ’s Great Depression .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt carried out that program and it was a failure .
America was saved by war at a terrible price .
Andrew Mellon was right in advocating that government must keep its hands off and let the slump liquidate itself .
Purge the rottenness out of the system .
Mr. Mellon said liquidate labor , stocks , farmers and real estate .
No more high living , people will work harder and lead a more moral life .
Values will be adjusted , and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people .
The economics of monetarism are nothing more than a formula promulgated to save the financial sector and not the country , by using an elitist trickle down theory , which as recent as the 1980s had been proven unworkable .
Bail out the rich on Wall Street , the bankers and insurance companies and let the poor and working poor fend for themselves .
This is class economics and this is what turns the masses toward socialism .
Bankers , who caused the problem , are bailed out by the masses , and the public is left to drown on their own .
We are told the bankers and Wall Street must be saved or we ’ll have no economy .
We call this the myth of saving the criminals .
Under a Federal Reserve System the Fed has in private hands unlimited state power to create money and credit backed by the full faith and credit of the American people , which denies those people the rights of sovereignty .
Via the Fed and via Executive Order and the “ Working Group on Financial Markets ” we allow the Fed and the Treasury to manipulate our markets .
Thus our financial elite grow richer and richer , and worse yet even professionals do not know what is going on , never mind the public .
The creation of money and credit is effected in such a way that the financial sector is protected and the burden of loss of purchasing power is cast upon American workers .
The capitalists do business as usual .
Such pursuits have often ended in revolution .
The fruits of low wages in America , a result of free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing , have taken their toll .
The result is more than two years of recession and now more than three months of depression .
The working poor cannot afford to buy what they produce and they cannot pay the debt cast upon them by Wall Street and the banking establishment .
There are no free markets .
The markets are what these people want them to be .
Today they feed their own debt bubble hoping , hope against hope they can bail out the system again .
These miscreatants , in what is called a shadow banking system securitized mortgages and other debt by fraud via a corrupt rating system worldwide monetizing their liabilities and buried thousands of professionals worldwide .
This unpayable debt , now lost , along with derivatives present problems that are really just beginning to be addressed .
All this is done with little transparency in order for these institutions , guided by the Fed , to dump their financial risks .
There you have it .
A manmade disaster created by the Federal Reserve , banking and Wall Street , and these are the same corrupt group who our government has chosen to rectify the problem .
Their answer is to take the funds from the public to cover their losses , be it by inflation or taxes .
The answer is get rid of the Fed and purge the system once and for all .
The case is the latest in a series in New York and around the country since Sept. 11 , 2001 , and sounded familiar in some ways .
The investigation , for instance , began with the work of a confidential informant , who portrayed himself as an agent of a Pakistani terror organization , and who became a critical member of the men ’s plot .
The full nature and extent of the informant ’s role in facilitating the plot is unknown .
In other cases , defense lawyers have sought to portray these informants as engaging in entrapment , suggesting they had , in effect , provoked and fueled the actions of their clients .

But where past terror prosecutions have been based mostly on conversations about a planned or imagined attack , this one went further , the authorities alleged : the men went through critical acts in what they believed to be a deadly assault .
As for the defendants  James Cromitie , 44 ; David Williams , 28 ; Onta Williams , 32 , and no apparent relation to David ; and Laguerre Payen , 27  most of the details that emerged on Thursday stemmed from their criminal pasts .
David Williams , who lately had grown a beard and taken to reading the Koran on slow nights at a steakhouse job , was described as particularly violent by prosecutors on Thursday .
When the plan to buy guns from a woman in Newburgh fell through , it was David Williams who quickly improvised , arranging to buy a gun from a man he described as a “ supreme Blood gang leader ” in Brooklyn , Mr. Snyder said .
After buying the gun in the company of the informant , David Williams said he would have shot the gang leader if he were alone with him , and kept his $ 700 .
Mr. Payen , described as a nervous , quiet sort who took medication for schizophrenia or a bi-polar disorder , was unemployed and living in squalor in Newburgh .
His last arrest , in 2002 , was for assault , after he drove around the Rockland County village of Monsey , firing a BB gun out of the window  striking two teens  and snatching two purses .
A friend who visited Mr. Payen ’s apartment on Thursday said it contained bottles of urine , and raw chicken on the stovetop .
The government was served with a lawsuit the week of April 27th regarding the Defense of Marriage Act which bars federal recognition of same - sex couples .
Now the Department of Justice , under President Obama 's authority , has till the week of June 22nd to respond .
They can either carry out on with the lawsuit defending DOMA , or choose not to defend an unconstitutional law .
Presidents have the option refusing to defend a law they view as unconstitutional on its face , of which there is no clearer example than DOMA ( Defense Of Marriage Act ) .
President Obama himself has called the law “ abhorrent ” and he ’s a constitutional law professor .
Given these premises , we feel that President Obama refuse to defend DOMA and should instead instruct his Department of Justice to join GLAD in this historic lawsuit .
There is a deadline of June 29th for President Obama to make his decision .

They ’re a firm part of our language and even speak to us of our national culture — but some words are n’t quite as English as we think .
Terms such as ‘ law ’ , ‘ ugly ’ , ‘ want ’ and ‘ take ’ are all loanwords from Old Norse , brought to these shores by the Vikings , whose attacks on England started in AD 793 .
In the centuries following it was n’t just warfare and trade that the invaders gave England .
Their settlement and subsequent assimilation into the country ’s culture brought along the introduction of something much more permanent than the silk , spices and furs that weighed down their longboats — words .
Dr Sara Pons -Sanz in the School of English is examining these Scandinavian loanwords as part of a British Academy - funded research project — from terms that moved from Old Norse to Old English and disappeared without trace , to the words that still trip off our tongues on a daily basis .
By examining these words in context , tracking when and where they appear in surviving texts from the Old English period , Dr Pons - Sanz can research the socio- linguistic relationship between the invading and invaded cultures .
The loanwords which appear in English — such as ‘ husband ’ — suggest that the invaders quickly integrated with their new culture .
The English language soon adopted day - to - day terms , suggesting that the cultures lived side - by - side and were soon on intimate terms .
This is in marked contrast to French loanwords .
Though there are many more of these terms present in the standard English language — around 1,000 Scandinavian to more than 10,000 French — they tend to refer to high culture , law , government and hunting .
French continued to be the language of the Royal Court for centuries after the invasion in 1066 .
In contrast , Old Norse had probably completely died out in England by the 12th century , indicating total cultural assimilation by the Scandinavian invaders .
Another clear indicator of this is the type of loanwords seen in English .
The majority of loanwords tend to nouns , words and adjectives , open - ended categories which are easily adapted into a language .
But one of the most commonly - seen loanwords in English today is ‘ they ’ — a pronoun with its origins in Old Norse .
Pronouns are a closed category , far more difficult to adapt into a new language , which again indicates a closeness between the two languages and cultures not present in previous or subsequent invading forces .
Dr Pons -Sanz has ‘ cleaned up ’ the list of loanwords thought to have come to English from Old Norse by painstakingly tracking the origins of each word .
Her original texts include legal codes , homilies , charters , literary texts and inscriptions .
By comparing the texts chronologically and dialectally , the introduction and integration of words can be tracked .
For example , the word ‘ fellow ’ — which came from an Old Norse word originally meaning ‘ business partner ’— is first attested in East Anglia .
Dr Pons -Sanz said : “ Language is constantly evolving ; loanwords are being assimilated into English — and other languages — all the time .
By examining the types of words that are adopted , we can gain insight into the relationships between different cultures . ”

Exactly How Has the US Meddled in the Ukrainian Elections ?
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
Statement before the US House International Relations Committee , December 7 , 2004
Mr. Chairman : President Bush said last week that , “ Any election ( in Ukraine ) , if there is one , ought to be free from any foreign influence . ”
I agree with the president wholeheartedly .
Unfortunately , it seems that several US government agencies saw things differently and sent US taxpayer dollars into Ukraine in attempt to influence the outcome .
We do not know exactly how many millions — or tens of millions — of dollars the United States government spent on the presidential election in Ukraine .
We do know that much of that money was targeted to assist one particular candidate , and that through a series of cut - out non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) — both American and Ukrainian — millions of dollars ended up in support of the presidential candidate , Viktor Yushchenko .
Let me add that I do not think we should be supporting either of the candidates .
While I am certainly no supporter of Viktor Yushchenko , I am not a supporter of his opponent , Viktor Yanukovich , either .
Simply , it is none of our business who the Ukrainian people select to be their president .
And , if they feel the vote was not fair , it is up to them to work it out .
How did this one - sided US funding in Ukraine come about ?
While I am afraid we may have seen only the tip of the iceberg , one part that we do know thus far is that the US government , through the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , granted millions of dollars to the Poland - America - Ukraine Cooperation Initiative ( PAUCI ) , which is administered by the US - based Freedom House .
PAUCI then sent US Government funds to numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) .
This would be bad enough and would in itself constitute meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation .
But , what is worse is that many of these grantee organizations in Ukraine are blatantly in favor of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko .
Consider the Ukrainian NGO International Center for Policy Studies .
It is an organization funded by the U.S. government through PAUCI .
On its Web site , we discover that this NGO was founded by George Soros ’ Open Society Institute .
And further on we can see that Viktor Yushchenko himself sits on the advisory board !
And this NGO is not the only one the US government funds that is openly supportive of Viktor Yushchenko .
The Western Ukraine Regional Training Center , as another example , features a prominent USAID logo on one side of its website ’s front page and an orange ribbon of the candidate Yushchenko ’s party and movement on the other .
By their proximity , the message to Ukrainian readers is clear : the US government supports Yushchenko .
The Center for Political and Law Reforms , another Ukrainian NGO funded by the US government , features a link at the top of its website ’s front page to Viktor Yushchenko ’s personal website .
Yushchenko’s picture is at the top of this US government funded website .
This May , the Virginia - based private management consultancy Development Associates , Inc. , was awarded $ 100 million by the US government “ for strengthening national legislatures and other deliberative bodies worldwide . ”
According to the organization ’s website , several million dollars from this went to Ukraine in advance of the elections .
As I have said , this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
There may be many more such organizations involved in this twisted tale .
It is clear that a significant amount of US taxpayer dollars went to support one candidate in Ukraine .
Recall how most of us felt when it became known that the Chinese government was trying to funnel campaign funding to a US presidential campaign .
This foreign funding of American elections is rightly illegal .
Yet , it appears that that is exactly what we are doing abroad .
What we do not know , however , is just how much US government money was spent to influence the outcome of the Ukrainian election .
Dozens of organizations are granted funds under the PAUCI program alone , and this is only one of many programs that funneled dollars into Ukraine .
We do not know how many millions of US taxpayer dollars the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) sent to Ukraine through NED ’s National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute .
Nor do we know how many other efforts , overt or covert , have been made to support one candidate over the other in Ukraine .
That is what I find so disturbing : there are so many cut - out organizations and sub - grantees that we have no idea how much US government money was really spent on Ukraine , and most importantly how it was spent .
Perhaps the several examples of blatant partisan support that we have been able to uncover are but an anomaly .
I believe Congress and the American taxpayers have a right to know .
I believe we urgently need an investigation by the Government Accounting Office into how much US government money was spent in Ukraine and exactly how it was spent .
I would hope very much for the support of Chairman Hyde , Chairman Lugar , Deputy Assistant Secretary Tefft , and my colleagues on the Committee in this request .
President Bush is absolutely correct : elections in Ukraine should be free of foreign influence .
It is our job here and now to discover just how far we have violated this very important principle , and to cease any funding of political candidates or campaigns henceforth .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

Imagine your money growing faster than the top online savings accounts without any added risk .
Certificates of deposit ( CDs ) can do that for you .
Because the money is n't meant to be withdrawn until maturity , banks offer higher interest rates on CDs .
That 's also why they 're so good for long - term savings .
Ally Bank is one major online bank that provides CDs to customers .
It is already known for its great savings account .
Ally Bank ’s lineup of CDs are ideal for this purpose because the CD rates are exceptionally high .
Depositors get the convenience of managing and tracking their own earnings , and with Ally being an online - only bank , there are fewer fees that could reduce your earnings than you might pay at a walk - in bank location .
In this Ally Bank CD Account review , we 'll compare rates , fees , and services to other national and online banks .
Highly Competitive Rates Available
As one of the top online banks , Ally Bank offers an impressive lineup of CDs that surpasses most other deposit products you can find on the market .
And the rates never change for the life of your deposit .
There 's no need to worry about fluctuating interest rates .
So , how do Ally ’s CD rates stack up ?
Ally offers three different CDs with a variety of terms , rates , and features :
High Yield CDs : Traditional CDs with terms between 3 months and 5 years
Traditional CDs with terms between 3 months and 5 years Raise Your Rate CDs : Special bump - up CDs with terms of 2 years or 4 - years
Special bump - up CDs with terms of 2 years or 4 - years No Penalty CD : A special CD with a term of 11 months and 3 different rate tiers based on the deposit amount
Interest rates vary from CD to CD , so keep in mind which product suits your needs best .
With the exception of the 12 - month CD and the 5 - year CD , Ally 's CDs have three rate tiers that increase as you deposit a larger amount of money .
On the Raise Your Rate CD , you have the chance to increase your interest rate once with the 2 - year term option , or twice with the 4 - year term -- if Ally ’s interest rate increases during that time .
It is a decent choice during times when interest rates are likely to be on the rise .
With the No-Penalty CD , note that the lowest rate tier may not even be able to beat Ally 's amazing online savings rate .
However , with higher rate tiers on the CD , you would be able to earn a high rate than the savings account .
Tip :
Find out exactly how much you 'll have at maturity with a CD calculator .
Early Withdrawal Penalties
Maximizing your savings in CD requires a great deal of discipline , especially when your interest compounds daily .
You may be tempted to withdraw a little bit here , a little bit there , but remember that a CD is n’t like other liquid savings accounts ; early withdrawals on a CD can trigger penalty fees that defeat the purpose of saving .
Early withdrawal penalties apply at all times for the High Yield and Raise Your Rate CDs .
Ally Bank CD Early Withdrawal Penalties
CD Term Early Withdrawal Penalty 24 months or less 60 days of interest 25 - 36 months 90 days of interest 37 - 48 months 120 days of interest 48 months or more 180 days of interest
The No Penalty CD allows for penalty - free withdrawals of your balance and any earned interest after the first 6 days of opening your account .
Minimum Deposit Requirements
CDs are designed for folks who are serious about building up a solid investment , so larger minimum deposits are often required of borrowers to put the higher interest rates that come with CDs to go to work and do their thing .
Of course , this can be problematic for people who do n’t have enough money to deposit .
Luckily , Ally Bank does not have a minimum deposit requirement for its CDs .
But , depositors should plan on making an initial investment of $ 5,000 to start saving .
You can earn a higher CD rate on Ally ’s High Yield and No Penalty CDs when you have $ 5,000 invested -- and an even higher rate with a $ 25,000 deposit .
IRA Version
CD yields can be used for anything you want -- like saving for retirement -- but the dividends you earn on two of Ally ’s CDs can be earmarked specifically for it .
The High Yield and Raise Your Rate CDs are also available in an IRA , or Individual Retirement Account , with the same terms and interest rates .
This can be a good alternative if you do n’t have a 401 ( k ) or another employer - sponsored retirement plan , or you ’d like to supplement the retirement investment you already have .
On both CDs , you can choose between three IRA options :
Traditional IRA
Roth IRA
SEP IRA
Each account offers tax advantages that mean less money paid to the IRS and more in your pocket .
Traditional IRAs are tax - deferred , so you do n’t pay taxes on your savings until you withdraw .
Roth IRAs allow for both tax - free growth and withdrawals .
And for small business owners , a SEP IRA gives employees a retirement planning option with the security and high yields of a CD in one .
Ally Bank recommends consulting with a tax professional before opening an IRA because there are contribution limits and other rules regarding IRA rollovers , transfers and conversions .
What Happens at Maturity ?
When the CD hits maturity , it ’s done earning interest , and you ’re free to withdraw your funds , with all the interest you ’ve earned and finance the goal you ’ve been saving up for .
You can also automatically renew your CD , which will take all your compounded earnings and start them over in a new CD of your choice with Ally ’s current APY Choosing this option means having a potentially higher deposit at your disposal , qualifying you for a better interest rate .
To get even more advanced , you can “ ladder ” several CDs , opening several accounts with different maturity dates .
Ally CDs Compared to Competitors
The first rule of choosing any type of bank account is to shop around .
You never know who might offer a better interest rate , or more attractive terms and conditions , or simply just for an easier user experience .
With that , take a look at how the CDs at some of these financial institutions stack up against Ally’s :
Synchrony Bank CDs
Synchrony Bank ’s big extended family of CDs gives depositors the choice between a short - term , 3 - month account up to 60 months , where you can make a deposit as low as $ 2,000 all the way up to jumbo deposits of $ 100,000 or more .
The longer the term , the higher the interest rate .
Like other CD products ( as well as Ally Bank ) , Synchrony ’s CDs are backed by FDIC insurance .
Goldman Sachs Bank CDs
GS Bank ’s CDs further broaden your choices of where to invest your money .
The bank ’s certificates are all about long terms and small minimum deposits , where you can put down as little as $ 500 starting at a 6 - month CD , all the way up to socking away money in a 6 - year CD with a high APY .
Goldman Sachs Bank USA customers have some added freedom and flexibility , too ; open a CD and choose how much your monthly interest is disbursed , either to a Goldman Sachs Bank USA savings account or another account of your choice .
Discover Bank CDs
If patience is your virtue , one of Discover Bank ’s CDs carries a 10 - year term to grow interest to exponential proportions .
Ideal for laddering with other CDs of shorter terms , you can open CDs that mature more quickly , gain access to those funds , all while having another CD earning dividends for a longer time period .
Accessibility is another perk to Discover ’s CDs .
Terms start as low as 36 months , and minimum deposits start as little as $ 2,500 .
Conclusion
Are these CDs a good choice and worth considering ?
Yes .
Any of the above banks and their CDs combine low - risk , secure savings with the stability of high interest rates that wo n’t vary or change with market conditions .
If interest rates drop to next to nothing , your CD will remain locked into its original rate for the life of the account .
Ally ekes out the others for the online and mobile guarantee it offers for its CD products , FDIC insurance , and customer service availability .
As for the products themselves ?
We like the themed approach the bank takes for each CD , so whether you want to bump up your rate , save without penalty fees , or just tap into some high yields , Ally goes beyond the standard account approach to give customers a product worth investing in .

Disputes among Maricopa County officials over the past 11 months have cost taxpayers $ 1.1 million in fees , according to an analysis released Monday by the Office of Management and Budget .
The fees include billings to date for six legal actions , cases in which Sheriff Joe Arpaio , County Attorney Andrew Thomas , County Treasurer Charles Hoskins and the Board of Supervisors have fought each other in court .
The money includes costs associated with a grand - jury proceeding focused on the $ 340 million court - tower project .
Like all government in the current economy , the county 's budget is tight .
On Monday , the supervisors adopted a $ 2.1 billion budget for fiscal 2010 , reflecting a $ 122 million reduction from 2009 .
Administrators expect that 200 employees will lose their jobs during the early part of the fiscal year .
According to County Manager David Smith , that $ 1.1 million in legal fees could fund 20 low - level county jobs .
Officials on all sides agree that the money spent fighting each other is a waste , but no one sees a way to stop it .
Rod McDougall is a longtime Phoenix attorney who has worked for Phoenix and the Attorney General 's Office .
He said the problem is the structure of county government , which gives too many people too much independence .
In his 33 years working in local and state government , McDougall recalls agencies suing each other only a few times .
" The whole situation is extraordinary , " he said .
" It seems to me it should be totally unnecessary to conduct your business in that manner . "
Expensive battles
Budget officials analyzed billing records from attorneys who represented all parties to arrive at the $ 1.1 million figure .
The money was paid to outside counsel , or attorneys who contract with the county to work highly specialized cases or on cases in which in - house attorneys have conflicts .
Billings still have n't come in for some work , officials said .
With some cases on appeal , legal fees could increase by hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Administrators and experts in local government say it is rare to have so many legal actions occurring at the same time in county government .
In the past , most conflicts between elected officials were resolved through staff meetings , or officials agreed to disagree .
A lawsuit or two a year between county officials was typical , Smith said , but " having six is crazy . "
Power politics
Most of the lawsuits revolve around money and power .
For example , two of the cases revolve around which department controls county computer systems .
Another challenges the Board of Supervisors ' power to establish a general litigation department that operates separately from the county attorney .
Another focuses on the board 's decision to sweep millions of dollars from criminal - justice funds used by Arpaio and Thomas .
Officials from the offices of the county attorney , sheriff and treasurer said they had no choice but to sue the board to defend themselves .
" Are all ( the elected offices ) in some massive conspiracy , or is it possible the Board of Supervisors has overstepped their authority and it's a power grab , " said Barnett Lotstein , special assistant to the county attorney .
" There is no other alternative to corrective action but to go to the courts and ask the courts to intervene .
And , if you go to court , you need a lawyer , and a lawyer costs money . "
Jack MacIntyre , a deputy chief for Arpaio , agreed there was no other recourse .
" You can't have a referendum , " MacIntyre said .
Hoskins , the county treasurer , said the lawsuits are wasteful , but he said the board is overstepping its authority with other elected offices .
" I think it 's a horrible waste of money , and we should be able to work these differences out , " he said .
" But they ( board members ) will not negotiate .
. . .
A lot of it comes from the ( board 's ) staff .
They are interfering with how other elected officials are running their offices .
They want to micromanage the offices . "
Lotstein and MacIntyre also said that although it may seem unusual that there are so many suits against the board , it 's not unprecedented .
They said that lawsuits by elected officials against the Board of Supervisors were filed in the 1970s and that other counties around Arizona have had similar disputes .
The supervisors and their staff believe they are trying to run the county efficiently and effectively and do not believe they are interfering with other elected officials ' duties .
" While the county attorney and the sheriff may think that 's what the board is doing , they 've yet to prove that in a court of law , " said Wade Swanson , director of the county 's civil - litigation department .
" No judge has agreed with them , and the board certainly does n't agree with them . "
More than money , the fighting likely is costing " legitimacy with the public in airing their dirty laundry in such a fashion , " said Roger Hartley , associate professor of public administration at the University of Arizona .
" It might be appealing to their own constituent bases , but it certainly does n't build a broader trust of government . "

With the touch of pen to paper and a simple wire transfer , Chrysler completed its alliance with Fiat on Wednesday morning , largely ending its quick trip through bankruptcy .
The reorganization was completed in 42 days .
The last obstacle to an exit  a temporary stay imposed by the Supreme Court  was lifted late Tuesday after the nine justices declined to hear a challenge of the deal by three Indiana state funds and several consumer groups .
The wire transfer , from the federal government , gives Chrysler $ 6.6 billion in exit financing .
After more than a month of sometimes dramatic court hearings , Chrysler sold the bulk of its assets to Fiat in almost anticlimactic fashion : in the offices of Cadwalader , Wickersham & Taft , the law firm that is advising the Treasury Department ’s auto task force .
The sale was completed about 9 a.m .
Hot or not ?
Men agree on the answer .
Women do n't .
There is much more consensus among men about whom they find attractive than there is among women , according to a new study by Wake Forest University psychologist Dustin Wood .
The study , co-authored by Claudia Brumbaugh of Queens College , appears in the June issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
" Men agree a lot more about who they find attractive and unattractive than women agree about who they find attractive and unattractive , " says Wood , assistant professor of psychology .
" This study shows we can quantify the extent to which men agree about which women are attractive and vice versa . "
More than 4,000 participants in the study rated photographs of men and women ( ages 18 - 25 ) for attractiveness on a 10 - point scale ranging from " not at all " to " very . "
In exchange for their participation , raters were told what characteristics they found attractive compared with the average person .
The raters ranged in age from 18 to more than 70 .
Before the participants judged the photographs for attractiveness , the members of the research team rated the images for how seductive , confident , thin , sensitive , stylish , curvaceous ( women ) , muscular ( men ) , traditional , masculine / feminine , classy , well - groomed , or upbeat the people looked .

Breaking out these factors helped the researchers figure out what common characteristics appealed most to women and men .
Men 's judgments of women 's attractiveness were based primarily around physical features and they rated highly those who looked thin and seductive .
Most of the men in the study also rated photographs of women who looked confident as more attractive .
As a group , the women rating men showed some preference for thin , muscular subjects , but disagreed on how attractive many men in the study were .
Some women gave high attractiveness ratings to the men other women said were not attractive at all .
" As far as we know , this is the first study to investigate whether there are differences in the level of consensus male and female raters have in their attractiveness judgments , " Wood says .
" These differences have implications for the different experiences and strategies that could be expected for men and women in the dating marketplace . "
For example , women may encounter less competition from other women for the men they find attractive , he says .
Men may need to invest more time and energy in attracting and then guarding their mates from other potential suitors , given that the mates they judge attractive are likely to be found attractive by many other men .
Wood says the study results have implications for eating disorders and how expectations regarding attractiveness affect behavior .
" The study helps explain why women experience stronger norms than men to obtain or maintain certain physical characteristics , " he says .
" Women who are trying to impress men are likely to be found much more attractive if they meet certain physical standards , and much less if they do n't .
Although men are rated as more attractive by women when they meet these physical appearance standards too , their overall judged attractiveness is n't as tightly linked to their physical features . "
The age of the participants also played a role in attractiveness ratings .
Older participants were more likely to find people attractive if they were smiling .
Micro Focus International plans to beef up its range of software quality assurance tools with two acquisitions it announced Wednesday .
It has agreed to buy Borland Software , a developer of application lifecycle management tools , for $ 75 million , and in a separate deal has also agreed to buy Compuware 's application testing and automated software quality business unit for $ 80 million in cash .
[ Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld 's Fatal Exception and Strategic Developer blogs . ]
Borland is a shadow of its former self : in May last year it sold Codegear , its software development tools division that published JBuilder , to Embarcadero Technologies for $ 30 million , and in January it lost its CEO Tod Nielsen to VMware , where he became chief operating officer .
Last year it reported a net loss of $ 216 million on revenue of $ 172 million from its remaining application lifecycle management activities .
Micro Focus , a developer of enterprise application modernization and management software based in the U.K. , hopes the purchases will help it to enlarge its share of the automated software quality assurance market , which it says is worth over $ 2 billion annually .
Buying Borland will allow Micro Focus to address a broader market , and bring it new customers , particularly in the U.S. , the company said .
It also expects to be able to cut costs significantly by eliminating duplication in the two companies ' back - office functions and IT systems .
As for the Compuware products Micro Focus is buying , it will sell those alongside its existing automated software quality product , Data Express .
From last April through this March , Compuware generated around $ 74 million in revenue and $ 5 million in pretax profit from its application testing and automated software quality business , Micro Focus said .
Borland has the approval of both companies ' boards of directors , but must still win over regulators and its own and Borland 's shareholders .
It expects to complete the Compuserve deal by the end of June , and the Borland acquisition late this quarter or early next .

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is sending an expert to Libya to look into a reported outbreak of bubonic plague not far from the Egyptian border .
Libyan officials say at least one person has died and several more have been infected in the town of Tubruq .
Cases of the disease , which was known as the Black Death in medieval Europe , are reported quite frequently in sub-Saharan Africa .
Bubonic plague can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early .
The WHO received a request from Libya to investigate the suspected cases in Tubruq on Tuesday , spokeswoman Aphaluck Bhatiasevi said .
An expert is on his way to Tubruq where he will help a government team study epidemiological data and check the reported cases .
If confirmed , it would be the first outbreak in that part of Libya for about 25 years , Ms Bhatiasevi said .
The Associated Press news agency quoted a Libyan official as saying that two people had been treated and sent home , and 10 others turned out not to have the disease .
Plague primarily affects wild rodents , and is spread between them by fleas .
Humans who contract the plague through flea bites normally develop a bubonic form - in other words , a form that enters via the skin .
Besides Africa , cases have also been reported in some Asian countries and in the US in recent years .
I 've overdone this metaphor , but I really do see the panoply of sources we have about Iran as an intelligence service to the masses .
We 've got reliable Humint -- on the ground sources .
We 've got open - source reports from broadcast and newspaper media .
We 've got analysis , in the form of great aggregation by smart observers .
We lack , um , signals intelligence , but Twitter is really a form of SIGINT , is n't it ?
There 's plenty of misinformation out there , like rumors that Ahmadinejad is going to stage an assassination attempt , so we need to be careful about how we judge the information .
If we 're a savvy analyst , we need to be careful about the weight we attach to photographs and video accounts .
They 're the most immediate and emotionally powerful , but they can distort our understanding of the situation , particularly of about the importance of specific developments .
To start with , here 's the raw data stream from Twitter , with the hashtag of the Iranian election .
Remember , this data is unfiltered .
There are some nuggets surrounded by garbage .
Follow the debates : " ( I hear that NPR is claiming that it is false news that Mousavi is in crowd now .
IT 'S NOT !
Tell them pp , we have pics ! ) " -- that 's a real tweet .
How would you evaluate it if you were on the Iran desk ?
Does Buddha Live Reincarnated in the Nepalese Jungle ?
Does the mighty Buddha live again in the form of a 17 - year - old boy that spent more than one year in a remote jungle in southeast Nepal ?
Thousands of pilgrims who flocked to the site for a glimpse of Ram Bahadur Bamjan ( aka Bonjan ) certainly think so .
Ram ’s first contact with the press was back in 2005 , when tens of thousands of followers came to see the “ Buddha Boy ” sit cross - legged among the roots of a tree .
His enlightened claim was that he had been without food or water for ten months .
Is he the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama , who was born in about 560BC and later became revered as the Buddha ?
It would appear that the answer depends upon whom you ask .
To some , he is a charlatan , but the long - haired white cloth - attired young man speaks only of peace and the end of discrimination , which is a hard act to follow .
There are several factors that raise a few doubts as to who this young man really is and whether or not he should exchange his gleaming white cloth for an orange prison ensemble .
During past appearances , thousands of pounds were collected from devotees , leading to allegations that he was really a conman .
One French journalist filmed Buddha Boy nibbling on fruit while supposedly midway through a fast , and another correspondent found him fast asleep while he was supposed to be meditating .
The young man appears to be in good health and plans to talk to small groups for the next week or so .
“ The whole jungle area where he has appeared has turned into a festival and around 10,000 people came to see him , ” said a police spokesperson .
Buddhist authorities are not convinced and probably never will be .

I 'm going to screw up , Andrea says to herself as she walks a straight line in front of a Dallas police officer .
Only hours into what was supposed to be a relaxing Memorial Day weekend , Andrea is on the side of the road near the bar she just left on Lower Greenville Avenue .
She thinks she 's sober , but she has to prove it to this cop , and she 's starting to doubt herself .
I 'm going to screw up .
It 's a cold Friday night just after 11 p.m. , and the 29 - year - old now engages in a balancing act .
She closes her eyes , holds out one leg and touches her nose .
The officer points a flashlight at her face as her eyes track a red penlight that he moves back and forth .
He asks her to count backward .
Finally done , she thinks she has passed the tests .
The officer thinks otherwise .
He handcuffs her and places her in the back of a squad car headed to the Dallas County jail .
Still in handcuffs , she 's brought to a room to take a breath test , which she refuses .
" I 'd always heard that if you 've had anything to drink , do not take it , " she said recently at a restaurant , as she nervously toyed with a ring .
" Do n't blow !
Do n't blow ! "
The immediate penalty for refusing the test is light : a 180 - day license suspension , which a decent lawyer can easily reduce .
But her refusal to take the breath test means the officer will be denied a valuable piece of evidence to prove she had been driving drunk if her case later goes to court .
This night in 2008 is different , though , and it 's not over yet .
Andrea sits on a bench in a long hall inside Lew Sterrett jail .
After about an hour , a cop hands her a fax .
" We have a warrant for your blood . "
" I 'm not signing this , " she says .
Are you freaking kidding me ?
" It does n't matter , " the officer says .
" Either way , your blood is getting drawn tonight . "
Andrea , who recounted her story with the condition that we not publish her full name , has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the first person arrested during the premiere weekend for an experimental Dallas Police Department program called " no refusal . "
Since last Memorial Day , the DPD has had four more no -refusal weekends , most recently this St. Patrick 's Day .
So far , 404 people have been arrested and , in some cases after being physically restrained , forced to give a blood sample .
Drivers stopped on suspicion of DWI can refuse to take roadside sobriety and breath tests , and about half of the nearly 4,000 people arrested annually in the city of Dallas for DWI refuse the breath test .
The number of " total refusals " of both kinds of tests have been skyrocketing in the last year and a half , say officers , judges and lawyers .
Drivers are getting smarter about the law , and DWI cases are getting tougher for police and prosecutors to win .
To counter that , police have arranged to have judges standing by on no-refusal weekends , ready to sign search warrants that allow officers to get blood from drivers whether they like it or not .
The weekend before this St. Patrick 's Day , 32 people were arrested for DWI , and about half refused to give up their blood voluntarily to a certified medical technician stationed at the jail .
Two resisted even after being served with search warrants and were cuffed and strapped into a chair so their blood could be drawn .
Dallas ' no-refusal program is part of a trend in DWI policing that is picking up momentum statewide — one that could quickly go beyond the experimental stage here if legislation crafted by the Dallas County District Attorney 's Office passes in the Legislature .
It cleared the Senate on March 30 .
Dalworthington Gardens , a small Tarrant County community , was the first arresting agency to go full - time with a blood - draw program in 2005 , and more than 30 agencies across the state have contacted the town since then to learn how to replicate the program .
Most recently , the Austin police chief announced he is ready to go full - time with the program , although he is being met with resistance from the American Civil Liberties Union and a grassroots group named Stop the Vampire Cops .
It 's not hard to understand why police and prosecutors are looking for a new weapon to help get drunken drivers off the road .
In 2007 , Texas led the nation in the number of people killed in alcohol - related accidents , according to the latest statistics available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
More than 100 people were killed in alcohol - related traffic accidents in Dallas County last year , or about 49 percent of traffic fatalities .
Alcohol floods the courts too .
Around the courthouse , when lawyers talk about misdemeanors , what they really mean is DWI .
That 's not surprising , considering that two - thirds of the 875 misdemeanor cases that went to court last year were DWIs — which include drivers intoxicated by alcohol , drugs or both .
Fully three - quarters of misdemeanor jury trials involve DWI , and defendants won 57 percent of cases heard by judges or juries .
Dallas would have already gone to the no-refusal program full - time , but under current law the process of securing the required search warrants is simply too time - consuming .
An arresting officer must fax a request for a search warrant to a city , district or county criminal court judge who volunteers to sit at home by a fax machine all night , ready to sign off on the warrants and fax them back .
The legislation awaiting action in Austin would simplify the process by allowing magistrates , already on staff 24 - 7 at the jail to set bonds , to issue search warrants to collect blood .
That simple change would greatly reduce the two to three hours it takes an officer to get a blood sample and shorten the turnaround time for getting cops back on the streets .
Increasing the use of blood as evidence would radically shift the balance of power between prosecutors and defense lawyers and will almost certainly lead to court challenges over whether routine blood tests trample on drivers ' right to privacy , as the Texas ACLU contends .
Whatever the courts later decide , right now it looks as if there will be blood , thanks to the support of police , prosecutors and the advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
Perhaps no one knows the stakes in this fight better than David Burrows , chairman of the statewide DWI committee for the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association and arguably Dallas ' DWI king .
----
The long hallway outside Burrows ' office on North Central Expressway is lined with framed pieces of paper , each a not - guilty verdict he has won , and he 's run out of room to hang them all .
Burrows is a tall figure with a trim mustache , sharp eyes and sun spots on his balding head .
On a column in the office hangs a framed award given to him by the Dallas Observer : " 2005 Best DWI Lawyer . "
As successful as Burrows has been over the decade in which he 's built a thriving practice devoted solely to DWI defense , he 's been careful to maintain a low profile when it comes to publicity .
Partly that 's because he wants to stay out of the line of fire of groups like MADD , he says .
Besides , he 's not a political figure , he says , and he does n't have any agenda other than to win .
" I just do n't want to come across as promoting people drinking and hurting people , " he says .
" I do want to promote that you can go to a restaurant and have a drink and be fine . "
Almost all of the 100 DWI cases that Burrows will bring to court in a year — most lawyers will set about 12 DWI cases for court annually — involve clients who have refused a breath test , though over the last year and a half he has received more cases in which drivers have refused to take either breath or roadside sobriety tests .
" You know the word 's getting out , " Burrows says .
" Somebody says , ' Well , I was convicted , and I did n't know that I did n't have to do anything . ' "
Refusing a breath test is n't exactly a get - out - of - jail - free card for tipsy drivers , but it certainly helps .
In Texas , prosecutors must prove that a driver was mentally or physically impaired because of drugs , alcohol or both , or had a blood - alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher .
Whether a jury returns a guilty verdict in a DWI case ultimately comes down to a combination of whatever tests a driver takes and what jurors see on the videos officers routinely shoot during traffic stops .
Appear sober as a judge on the video , and a good defense lawyer like Burrows can sometimes pick apart a negative test result .
If you do n't appear drunk , and there 's no breath evidence that says otherwise , well ...
" The person has to look normal , " Burrows says .
" If you have a client who does n't look normal , you 're just spinning your wheels . "
Even an ace lawyer like Burrows shies away from trying cases in which his client had a bad breath test .
Burrows is a numbers guy who keeps a running tally of his win-loss record on his computer .
He speaks in percentages and odds and bases his strategies on stats and scientific theories , and he does n't like to bring cases to trial in which he believes he has less than a 50 - 50 chance of winning .
When a client has taken a breath test that comes back with results above the legal limit , he figures he has only a 30 percent chance of victory in court .
" I 'm not really big on long shots , " he says .
Sometimes , though , if the client wants to go to court badly enough , he 'll do it .
That happened last year .
He had a client , fresh out of SMU , who scored 0.19 on his breath test — more than twice the legal limit — but his client 's father was determined to keep a conviction off his son's record .
And this February , he defended 30 - year - old Zach Warner , who scored 0.14 on his breath test but was resolved to try his luck in court .
Burrows won both cases .
That sort of success explains why other defense lawyers look to Burrows to teach them his methods .
In May , Burrows will host his third DWI strategy conference , and this year the focus will be blood cases .
He 's calling it the DWI Innocence Project , a play on the Texas Innocence Project , a nonprofit organization that works to free prison inmates wrongfully convicted of felonies .
Once lawyers learn about Burrows ' courtroom methods , they often retool their own approach to incorporate his style , says Lawrence Boyd , another high - winning Dallas DWI lawyer , who will serve as course chairman at Burrows ' conference .
" David Burrows revolutionized the way that a DWI case is handled , " Boyd says .
" We 're educating attorneys on how to try a DWI case from start to finish .
Every criminal lawyer is going to get calls on DWI .
Every person you know has a co-worker or a cousin or a brother - in - law who 's going to go get a DWI . "
Boyd considers DWI the bread and butter for defense attorneys , cases in which " you can do a great job and get a great result . "
In Burrows ' practice , a winning defense starts with picking the right jury and connecting with them .
" I'm from Dallas , " Burrows began at a February trial .
He leaned against the counsel desk and took his time , as if speaking to friendly strangers in his own living room .
" I 've been here all my life . "
After telling them about his studies at SMU and Baylor , he moved directly to the question that was on the minds of potential jurors .
" I know what you are saying in your heads .
I wonder what he 's accused of ? "
Then he adopted a somber tone .
" Well , my client is innocent . "
It 's the prosecution 's job to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
" Will you have an open mind and make the state prove to you that the breathalyzer works ? "
There was a round of enthusiastic nods .
Burrows ' style in the courtroom is folksy , but that 's part of a carefully crafted strategy .
" When he walks into a courtroom to try a case , there is a purpose behind every move he makes and every word he speaks .
It 's scalpel - like in its precision , " says Rick Hagen , president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association .
If his client appears sober on the video , then Burrows believes doubt has already been planted in the jury 's mind .
" The jury does n't need somebody to tell them what they 're seeing , " Burrows says .
Perhaps the officer made a mistake , or maybe the field tests the officer based the arrest on were faulty .
Or , if the client took the breath test and the score was high , perhaps the breath test machine itself , the Intoxilyzer 5000 , did n't work properly .
Defense lawyers used to focus on attacking the character and intelligence of the police officer making the arrest , but the stat - minded Burrows crunched his numbers and found that approach was n't working .
Jurors do n't want to see a cop accused of being a liar , so Burrows took a different tack .
He limits the number of questions he poses to officers on the witness stand to 15 , tops , and zeroes in on how the evidence was collected .
Rather than attack a cop , Burrows focuses on the possibility that the officer made a straightforward mistake .
" [ DWI is ] an opinion crime , " he says .
" The old - school lawyers would berate the officer and try to break down the officer and show the officer was incompetent , and I just decided , wait a minute , it 's not about the officer .
It 's about an opinion .
And an opinion does n't reach beyond a reasonable doubt . "
Whether someone looks drunk is subjective , but a breath test produces a concrete , persuasive number .
With a breath test score , Burrows says , " you 've stepped out of the opinion . "
So how does Burrows manage to win , by his own accounting , 30 percent of the cases he tries that have Intoxilyzer results ?
He uses science to attack the science behind the breath test .
For that , Burrows relies on his own experts .
----
The breath test , invented in the earlier part of the 20th century , measures the amount of alcohol in your breath and uses that measurement to approximate the level of alcohol in your blood .
And there 's the rub :
The results are an approximation and can vary depending on a number of factors — how much you drank , your size , when you had your last drink before the test and what you 've eaten , for example .
If a client has a high breath test score but on the video seems sober and speaks without slurring , Burrows will argue that something went wrong somewhere with the analysis of the breath sample .
To bolster his case , he often calls on Dr. Gary Wimbish , a forensic toxicologist .
Take , for example , the case of Burrows ' client Zach Warner , who blew a 0.14 on his breath test .
According to Wimbish , science says that anyone with that high a blood - alcohol level should appear visibly drunk , but in Warner 's case , he appeared relatively sober on his arrest video .
The difference between how he appeared and how the test said he should have looked was enough for Burrows to sow doubt in jurors ' minds and win an acquittal .
Burrows also will occasionally argue that the state cannot prove his client was intoxicated at the time of arrest , since the breath test was taken more than an hour later .
It takes a while for the human body to absorb alcohol into the bloodstream , so paradoxically , a driver could be below the legal limit for intoxication when arrested but become drunker as he or she waits to blow into the Intoxilyzer , Wimbish says .
" David is able to distill the essence of a case to the current knowledge known about alcohol relating to breath and blood , " says Wimbish , who spends many afternoons at the county courthouse testifying for a number of defense lawyers at a rate of $ 120 an hour .
" David deals with the facts .
He is a pretty good scientist . "
Burrows also uses science to attack the field sobriety tests — that series of balance and mental acuity exams that officers ask drivers like Andrea to perform at the roadside .
Officers will testify that the tests are accurate and backed up by studies conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Burrows has his own expert to counter a failed sobriety test — a former police officer and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission commander named Dexter Simpson .
According to NHTSA , a simple test like watching to see if a suspect 's eyes follow a moving light smoothly or if they jerk — called the horizontal gaze nystagmus test — is an accurate measure of drunkenness up to 95 percent of the time .
Not quite , Simpson testified in a recent Burrows case .
Both Wimbish and Simpson have delved into the NHTSA 's own data to find , they claim , that the test produces false positives 59 percent of the time .
Like Wimbish , Simpson has made a career out of testifying as an expert on behalf of defense lawyers in DWI cases .
He 's even written a book , The DWI Conspiracy , alleging a plot in the manipulation of the field sobriety tests that result in the faulty arrests of thousands of innocents — though Burrows does n't bring up the book at trial .
" We respect the court system , " Simpson says .
" We just beat it every chance that we get , because it 's defeatable .
I should n't be able to win these cases like this .
It should be difficult , but it 's not . "
At least for now .

It 's St. Patrick 's Day no-refusal weekend , and Senior Corporal Bobby Watkins , a member of the Dallas DWI squad , is on duty Saturday night .
Only 15 minutes after pulling out of central headquarters , he 's called to where a possible drunk driver was stopped heading the wrong way down a one - way street .
At the scene , an Expedition is parked on the sidewalk on Elm Street .
The woman behind the wheel is wearing a festive , bright green T - shirt .
" We 're doing blood tonight , " says Watkins , a cheerful cop with a whisper of a voice , as he parks his squad car .
He directs a spotlight into the windshield of the Expedition and walks over .
The sobbing woman has red hair stuck in clumps to her face .
Watkins asks how much she 's had to drink .
" Two drinks , " she says .
" Oh , two drinks ? " he repeats .
( On the way over here , Watkins told me that virtually every driver he faces says they had only two drinks . )
The woman 's left leg is in a splint , and she limps away from her car at Watkins ' request .
Between sobs , she says she is a single mother of three .
Watkins tells her to hold the grill of the squad car while he performs a series of field sobriety tests .
He 's looking for at least four clues that she 's drunk .
Counting backward from 48 to 33 , she skips 45 .
She recites the alphabet correctly .
Then he asks her to focus on a red penlight as he moves it broadly to one side and back .
Her light eyes follow it .
Her mascara has run and collected to form a smudged ring below her eyes .
He sees her eyes jerk during the eye test .
Next , he removes a portable breath machine .
He can't use the reading in court , but it helps to confirm his decision to arrest the woman .
She scores 0.184 .
She 's placed in handcuffs and starts squirming because her bladder is full .
She needs to go now , she complains , but there 's nothing but a vacant parking lot and multi-storied garage nearby .
As Watkins fills out more paperwork , urine collects in a pool below her sneakers .
In the Dallas Police Department , there are usually 10 officers on the DWI task force specializing in DWI cases .
The squad knows what it takes to win at trial .
" We 're building a case right from the start , " Watkins says as he drives to the jail , where the single mother will be booked and have her blood drawn .
" If you arrested this person , you got them off the street .
That 's a win - win for us and for the citizens of Dallas .
But once you get them in the jail , and they refuse to give samples , even though they had six clues , then they win the prize . "
Watkins says that everything he does in the field is geared toward a future trip to the witness stand .
First , he determines if there is enough reasonable suspicion to stop a car — say , driving the wrong way down Elm Street .
Next , he uses his senses .
" What do you see ?
What do you smell ?
What do you hear ?
You see bloodshot eyes .
Or you ask for their license , and they hand you a credit card .
Or they are fumbling with the license and dropping it on the floor . "
Then , " What do you smell ?
Alcohol . "
Finally , " What do you hear ?
' Officer , I had two beers . '
Well , maybe they did , but then they are giving you inconsistent statements . "
The woman in green says she had her first drink at 7 , but then says she had her first drink after leaving her house , which was at 4 p.m .
So Watkins asks her again , and she says 5 .
He adds up all this to decide whether to make an arrest .
Watkins says that on some nights , although he 'll stop five people , he 'll arrest only one or two .
Of course , if a driver pisses herself on the street , that 's pretty much a lock arrest - wise .
The woman arrested on Elm Street is dragging her feet across the police parking lot to the basement entrance of Lew Sterrett jail .
" This is so embarrassing , " she mumbles .
Once inside , she stays for a while inside the restroom , which is a glass room visible to those in the hall .
Watkins waits for her with his back to the room .
" If you were at a .09 , " he says , " you would say , ' I ca n't use that bathroom because people are going to see me ! ' "
A stream of people flowing into the jail offers a glimpse of how big the DWI problem is .
A handcuffed man followed by another officer comes through the mechanized door .
His shoulders are pulled back tight .
He also needs to use the restroom and is spinning in circles , holding it .
The door opens again .
Another young woman in handcuffs comes through , followed by another officer .
She shuffles her feet .
Blood is splattered across her jeans .
" What happened here ? "
Watkins asks .
" DWI accident , " the other officer replies .
" The regular patrol officers , they shy away from DWI arrests ... because of some good lawyers out there , yes , like David Burrows .
If you do n't know your material , they will nail you to the cross , " Watkins says .
But all his preparation can fall flat in the face of a determined assault from lawyers like Burrows and his experts .
That 's why blood would be such a game changer .
A breath test may be iffy , and even a hardcore drunk may pass a field sobriety test .
But a blood test that shows a high level of alcohol is tough to beat .
That 's why Mothers Against Drunk Driving is baying for blood .
MADD firmly believes that punishment works as a deterrent .
So , when 57 percent of the people who go to court for first - offense DWI are acquitted , that means a growing number of Dallas drivers have n't learned their lesson .
With blood in play , once the public gets word that it is nearly impossible to get out of a DWI arrest , people will think twice before drinking and driving , says Mary Kardell , executive director of the North Texas MADD chapter .
The average defendant drinks and drives 70 times before they 're caught , Kardell contends .
" If they are dumb enough to drink and drive and get themselves pulled over , then they get what they deserve . "
Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins created the blood legislation awaiting action in Austin , and it tops his nine - point legislative agenda .
Misdemeanor court Judge Lennox Bower was the first judge to sign a blood warrant during Dallas ' first no -refusal weekend in 2008 .
Bower had reservations about forcing people to give up blood , but he knew the practice was sweeping the state and figured he might as well get involved early and have some input .
For one , he insisted that blood draws take place at the jail and are n't performed by police .
Then he started to look at the numbers .
After that first no -refusal weekend , of the 18 people who refused to give a sample of their breath , blood work revealed that all but one were well above the legal limit for intoxication .
The average was 0.15 .
The one exception was Andrea , who hired Burrows to defend her .
Her results came back at 0.05 , and prosecutors dismissed her case .
Then Bower looked at his own caseload and noted that in a growing number of DWIs , prosecutors had no evidence because the defendant had refused to take any tests .
" When I saw that , and then saw what the juries are doing — which is acquitting total refusal cases — I realized that this is not only inevitable , but necessary , " Bower says .
After he heard that some drivers had to be physically restrained , he grew less comfortable with the practice .
" There are some parts of this I am still conflicted on , " Bower says .
" I do n't like to literally force them if they are refusing , but once I started seeing the numbers , it made it easier to accept . "
Right now lawyers are debating whether no-refusal programs are constitutional .
Texas law states that if a driver refuses to give a sample , " none shall be taken , " but mandatory blood - draws backed by search warrants have been upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals .
----
For those arrested during St. Patrick 's Day weekend , the consequences will be costly , win or lose .
Burrows bases his fees , anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 , on how long he thinks a trial will last .
A convicted driver pays the court $ 1,000 , the probation office $ 62 per month for two years and the state $ 1,089 for three years .
Plus , the conviction goes on your record .
Burrows knows all too well the price of a guilty verdict .
In 1996 , he was convicted of failure to file hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and ordered to serve a two - year sentence .
But he never lost his law license , just any semblance of his previous law practice .
Burrows came from a modest upbringing ; his father was a truck driver , and his older brothers were star athletes , so he turned to academics at a young age to feed his intensely competitive spirit .
After he served his sentence , he quickly dedicated himself again to winning in law .
" I 'm certainly 100 percent more appreciative , " the 55 - year - old Burrows says about how his conviction affects him today .
" Most lawyers my age ... are burned out , ready to retire .
I 'm truly ready to go another 20 to 30 years . "
He started trying DWI cases because those were the phone calls he was getting when he resumed practicing .
Specializing allowed him to stay on top of his game .
" Every trial I would lose , I 'd learn more .
As I would lose a case , I would say , ' OK , I gotta adjust next trial ' and see what was working and what was not . "
Now Burrows is beginning to get calls on DWI blood cases .
As of February , only 12 of the hundreds of cases from the start of the no-refusal program had come to court , resulting in a dozen guilty pleas .
While Burrows is disturbed that lawyers are shying away from bringing blood cases to court , he realizes that blood marks a new challenge to the strategies he 's spent a decade perfecting .
It 's time for a new game plan .
For one thing , cases where the blood alcohol level is determined to be at 0.10 or higher will stay out of the courtroom .
The blood evidence is simply too persuasive — unless Burrows and other defense lawyers can find a way to keep the evidence from ever being introduced at trial .
Fort Worth attorney Mark Daniel succeeded in suppressing the blood evidence against one of his clients , District Judge Elizabeth Berry .
The court ruled that there was n't enough evidence to justify her arrest .
Daniel will speak at Burrows ' DWI Innocence Project on " exposing flaws in the search warrant of a DWI blood test case . "
" If the blood test comes in to evidence , I do n't think anybody legitimately can say your chances will ever be better than 30 percent , with the exception if it's an 0.08 or 0.09 , then I would give them 50 - 50 , " Burrows says .
Burrows also will continue to use science to challenge the blood tests and has invited Wimbish to speak at his conference .
Wimbish says blood must be collected properly , which means according to forensic standards .
If the officer takes the vial of blood and leaves it in his pocket for a couple of days before sending it off to the lab , that evidence is no longer admissible .
Blood tests that are processed at a hospital rather than a forensic lab are also susceptible to challenge .
Burrows doubts the blood program will ever go full - time , particularly for large agencies like Dallas .
Blood tests , besides being time - consuming , could actually lower the amount of fines the county collects because officers will be less likely to make borderline arrests .
" Just because today the courts seem to be leaning toward blood testing , that does n't mean it 's going to stay that way , " Burrows says .
" We do n't have any definitive answer from the Texas courts whether that is a reasonable violation of a person 's rights .
Basically , it 's going to take some cases to figure this whole thing out . "
For Burrows to continue handling DWIs , he must believe there is still the possibility that his clients are innocent .
" In my own mind , I want to feel like they 're not intoxicated .
You ca n't sell a product you do n't believe in , " he says .
" If you do blood testing , I think the gray area is going to drop , " he says , then pauses .
" Well , the lawyers will help them through the plea bargain process .
But as far as trials , we 'll start trying other cases .

Iran is pressured because of its independent stance : Chomsky
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Kourosh Ziabari
Tehran Times , April 15 , 2009
Q : Professor Chomsky , you have stated several times that most of the countries of the world , including the members of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) , support Iran ’s efforts to develop its civilian nuclear energy program , but some voices in the United States are still making hawkish comments .
Why is that the case ?
A : Not only the Non-Aligned Movement , but also the large majority of Americans believe that Iran has the right to develop nuclear energy .
But almost no one in the U.S. is aware of this .
That includes those who are polled , and probably think they are the only ones who hold these beliefs .
Nothing is ever published about it .
What appears in the media , constantly , is that the “ international community ” demands that Iran stop uranium enrichment .
Almost nowhere is it brought out that the term “ international community ” is used conventionally to refer to Washington and whoever happens to go along with it , not just on this issue , but quite generally .
Q : The U.S. government is clearly practicing double standards in its foreign policy .
While supporting Israel ’s right to possess a nuclear arsenal , the U.S. is relentlessly pressuring Iran to halt its civilian nuclear program .
What are your views on this ?
And does the International Atomic Energy Agency have the authority to investigate Israel ’s nuclear weapons program ?
A : The basic point was explained very candidly by Henry Kissinger .
He was asked by the Washington Post why he now claims that Iran does not need nuclear energy so it must be working on building a bomb , while in the 1970s he insisted forcefully that Iran needs nuclear energy and the U.S. must provide the shah with the means to develop it .
His answer was pure Kissinger : “ They were an allied country ” so they needed nuclear energy .
Now they are not an ally , so they do not need nuclear energy .
As for Israel , it is an ally , more accurately a client state .
So they inherit from the master the right to do as they please .
The IAEA has the authority , but the U.S. would never permit them to exercise it .
The new U.S. administration has given no indication that it is any different .
Q : Four sovereign states possess nuclear weapons outside the framework of the NPT .
Three never joined the NPT and the fourth withdrew from the treaty .
Could Iran eliminate the endless pressure being imposed on it by withdrawing from the NPT ?
A : No , that would simply escalate the pressures .
Apart from North Korea , all of these countries receive extensive U.S. support .
The Reagan administration pretended it did not know that its ally Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons , so that the dictatorship could receive massive U.S. aid .
The U.S. has agreed to assist India in developing its nuclear facilities , and Israel is a special case .
Q : What are the obstacles blocking the establishment of direct talks between Iran and the U.S. ?
Does the Israeli lobby really have such a great influence over the U.S. corporatocracy ?
A : The Israeli lobby has some influence , but it is limited .
That was demonstrated in the case of Iran , once again , last summer , during the presidential campaign , the time when the influence of lobbies is at its peak .
The Israeli lobby wanted Congress to pass legislation that came close to calling for a blockade of Iran , an act of war .
The measure gained considerable support , but then suddenly disappeared , probably because the White House made it clear , quietly , that it was opposed .
As for the actual factors , we do not yet have adequate internal records , so it is necessary to speculate .
We do know that a large majority of Americans want to have normal relations with Iran , but public opinion rarely influences policy .
Major U.S. corporations , including the powerful energy corporations , would like to be able to exploit Iran ’s petroleum resources .
But the state insists otherwise .
I presume that the main reason is that Iran is just too independent and disobedient .
Great powers do not tolerate that in what they take to be their domains , and the world ’s major energy - producing regions have long been considered the domain of the Anglo - American alliance , now with Britain reduced to junior partner .
Q : Do you believe we will see a tactical or systematic revision in the approach of the U.S. mainstream media toward Iran during Barack Obama ’s term in office ?
Will these media outlets stop their anti-Iranian propaganda ?
A : The media generally adhere fairly closely to the general framework of state policy , though policies are sometimes criticized on tactical grounds .
A lot , therefore , depends on the stand that the Obama administration will take .
Q : And finally , do you believe that the U.S. president should apologize for the United States ’ crimes against Iran over the past century , as Iran has asked ?
A : I think that the powerful should always concede their crimes and apologize to the victims , in fact go much farther and provide reparations .
Unfortunately , the world is largely governed by the maxim of Thucydides : the strong do as they wish , and the weak suffer as they must .
Slowly , over time , the world is becoming more civilized , in general .
But there is a long way to go .
Yes , you should get a flu shot this year
As we — and the pandemic — move into the fall , getting a flu shot can help decrease your risk of other viral infections .
The house is usually a sure bet in California poker casinos .
But five Los Angeles County card rooms could lose millions if two recreational poker players win a lawsuit challenging a popular jackpot promotion .
Poker has long been allowed in California .
But the state has warned casinos that the jackpots -- in which players can win thousands of dollars for losing -- are illegal lotteries .
Card rooms typically collect $ 1 from every pot , amassing thousands of dollars a day , and use the money to reward players who lose despite holding exceptionally strong hands .
These tough - luck gamblers qualify for the casinos ’ “ bad - beat jackpots ” -- consolation prizes that often far exceed the amount of money scooped up by the winning players .
In a 2005 advisory , then - Atty .
Gen . Bill Lockyer cautioned casinos that the promotions violated state law unless players were allowed to win the jackpots without paying the fee .
It ’s the same legal principle that requires McDonald ’s to give away game pieces for its popular Monopoly game to consumers who ask for them , regardless of whether they buy anything .

Recreational poker players Dennis Chae and Jeff Kim contend in a lawsuit that the Bicycle Club , Commerce , Hustler , Hollywood Park and Hawaiian Gardens casinos would not allow them to compete for the jackpots unless they played at tables that collected the $ 1 - per - pot fees , even though their ads said no purchase was required .
Their lawsuit , filed May 1 in Los Angeles County Superior Court , seeks class - action status and alleges that tens of thousands of players could become plaintiffs .
It accuses the casinos of false advertising and unfair competition and seeks monetary damages and an injunction ending the jackpots .
Haig Kelegian , managing general partner of the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens , described the lawsuit as a stunt that had little chance of succeeding .
If players at his casino ask , and very few do , they can play at tables that do n’t collect the $ 1 fees , he said .
“ They ’re just doing this to try to figure out a way to sue somebody , ” Kelegian said .
“ We have always had no purchase necessary . ”

Andy Schneiderman , vice president and general counsel for the Commerce Casino , said in a statement that the casino ’s bad - beat promotion “ complies with all legal requirements . ”
Officials with the other casinos listed in the lawsuit did not respond to interview requests .
The poker players ’ lawyers estimate that the five casinos collect millions annually for the jackpots .
They charge “ administrative fees ” of 15 % to 25 % before funding the jackpot pools , collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit , the lawyers said .
“ The casinos obviously have tremendous incentive , ” said Tym S. MacLeod , one of the plaintiffs ’ lawyers .
“ This is not a case about collecting gambling losses back ; this is a case about putting a stop to the deceptive advertising . ”

Jackpot poker was first deemed an illegal lottery in a 1989 attorney general opinion that was upheld by an appeals court in Los Angeles .
The casinos have been offering the promotion as no-purchase - necessary since the 1995 appeals court decision , said I. Nelson Rose , a Whittier Law School professor and author of the book “ Gambling and the Law . ”
“ I think it ’s basically a screw - up by a couple of employees , ” Rose said .
“ I ca n’t see the suit really amounting to much . ”
Poker player David Kullmann said he hoped Chae and Kim succeed , because the $ 1 - per - pot collection cuts into his potential profit .
The jackpot fees are in addition to a “ rake ” of at least $ 3 a pot that casinos collect to cover operating expenses .
The Westchester man said he typically plays a $ 200 - buy - in game of no-limit Texas Hold ‘ Em at Hollywood Park Casino in Inglewood .
He said he had played thousands of hands without hitting a jackpot .

“ It ’s a tax .
I do n’t like it , ” Kullmann said .
“ If you play 30 hands an hour , that ’s $ 30 an hour that ’s being taken off the table that you ca n’t win . ”
Kelegian said the jackpots are extremely popular among players at his casino , commonly known as “ the Bike . ”
“ People do n’t complain .
They want it because we do all the work :
We accumulate all the money .
We take care of it , ” he said .
“ It ’s like found money .
. . .
You hit a certain hand , you win a jackpot . ”

The two things that I see common regarding perception of futuristic technology is that products are going to be compact and well integrated .
Take for example this futuristic dining table , its designed with all the modern convenience integrated within its belly .
Once you sit down , you need n’t get up to make a toast or fetch the coffee , get an apple from the fridge or even wash your dishes .
It ’s all integrated into the table .
The Form :
– A circular five - seater table with retractable chairs that fit flush with the frame of the table when not in use .
– A part of the table used to refrigerate food and is divided into 2 separate sections with a total volume capacity of 203 liters .
– At the touch of a button , the black glass top becomes transparent allowing a complete view of the fridge contents beneath it .
– The food is stored in bins where it is divided into groups ( dairy products , smoked meat , vegetables , fruits etc ) .
– This is where a rotating storage compartment is located with a volume capacity of 98 liters , designed to store small groceries .
– The second part of the refrigerator is integrated into the center of the table and chills your bottles .
– The shelves of the bottle fridge feature punched with holes minimizing the escape of cold air when the refrigerator is lifted .
This section has a volume capacity of 105 liters .
– Two buttons help you to use this second fridge :
One for Pulling up the fridge , the other for rotating the stand for easy selection .
– Small appliances are located inside a stainless steel inter-circular compartment that is manually rotatable and can store up to 8 different electrical appliances .
These appliances are easily replaceable .
– The appliances integrated include a mini- dishwasher , toaster , coffee machine , boiling kettle , cold water dispenser , a freezer , mini-microwave and cutlery holder .
– The top layer of the table is a touch display screen , allowing access to the internet .
It displays daily press ( newspaper , magazines ) , allows search for recipes and enables communications .
– The table top display can be changed to accommodate soothing views or even fun games .
The Systems Used :
– Touch OLED display screens that change from complete shade of black to fully transparent to expose content of the refrigerator .
– Nanotechnology surface ( for better cleaning ) .
– Pneumatic system ( pistons for hoisting electrical appliance ) , servomotors and electronics .
– The materials used are glass , plastic ( or synthetic stone ) and stainless steel .
– The table is securely anchored to the floor and connected to a source of electricity , water supply , the internet and the waste .

Twenty - year - old Lila Rose suffers from a condition that afflicts many new activists , a condition known as myopia .
Those who suffer from myopia experience an inability to see nuance in the world and seek comfort in absolutes .
While thought to be more pronounced among the young , myopia can infect people of all ages with varying results , and the results of Rose ’s particular strain of this cerebral infection have only just begun to make themselves known .
It ’s not clear how Rose became involved in the pro-life movement – it is a question she studiously avoids answering .
Perhaps it is no surprise that a girl who grew up with seven siblings in an Evangelical family in San Jose , California , would become passionate about putting a stop to abortion .
But religiosity is not a sure path to fanaticism , and as easy as it would be to demonize this young woman as a misguided anti-abortion extremist , or undermine her position by focusing on who is pulling her marionette strings , that view ignores Rose ’s power over her own actions .
But when we engage with her controversial methods and explore the ( largely one - sided ) response they have elicited we find Lila Rose is intent on appropriating some of the principles upon which the social justice movement is founded .
Rose , a history student at UCLA , is the founder of the somewhat pornographically named “ Live Action Films , ” the ultimate goal of which , says Rose :
is to use educational media to help create a world where the life of every human being , even the smallest or least developed , is protected .
We are student journalists and work to expose sexual abuse cover - up and racism at the nation ’s largest abortion provider , Planned Parenthood .
The group uses police - quality undercover equipment to record a loosely scripted conversation in which Rose and her cohorts bait Planned Parenthood employees into violating the organization ’s policies .
Videos of the in-person and phone conversations are then posted on YouTube and the Live Action Films website .
Welcome to twenty - first century stealth pro-life activism , folks .

Abortion .

Rose ’s methods do simply replicate those used by police officials ( and Dateline NBC ) to apprehend prostitutes , drug dealers , and child sex offenders .
Though those methods raise many worthwhile ethical questions , few would have batted an eye had she not captured a handful of questionable encounters with Planned Parenthood staff , the most damning of which shows a service provider at Planned Parenthood Greater Memphis Region telling Rose , who the provider believes to be a 14 - year - old girl , that Rose can protect her 31 - year - old boyfriend by lying about his age when she seeks an abortion .
The encounters are not as sensational as Rose would like you to believe .
The brief moments she chooses to focus on take place within a lengthy conversation – Rose ’s encounter with the Greater Memphis affiliate lasted 28 minutes–in which the context of particular statements is not always clear .
Although the Memphis video is available ‘ in its entirety ’ by Live Action Films , seemingly a move toward transparency , some of the dialogue curiously remains muted by Rose .
Because Rose is n’t the adolescent she claimed to be and Tennessee ’s law gives health professionals the benefit of discretion in deciding which cases to report–merely encouraging rather than requiring a mandated heath care provider to notify legal authorities if abuse is suspected–none of the employees actually committed a criminal act .
Even so , despite not being illegal , the employees ’ actions are ethically questionable , and still run afoul of Planned Parenthood ’s policy of reporting suspected statutory rape .
The extent of the “ problem ” of unreported statutory rape is enormously unclear ; Rose has not been forthcoming in stating the precise number of clinics she has visited so her sample size is unclear ( is this an anomalous situation in one out of 100 or 500 clinics visited ? ) nor has she disclosed how often clinic staff responded appropriately to her created dilemma .
Since it is clear that in any large health care system some missteps are unavoidable –to err is human , after all–and that a few employees out of the over 30,000 people who work with Planned Parenthood will exhibit less - than - stellar practices , it is misleading for Rose to cherry pick the worst offenders as “ proof ” that the cover up of sexual abuse is widespread within the organization without further context .
Since Rose has videotaped patients inside a health care facility and made that video publicly available , some have voiced criticism at the potential violation of a patient ’s right to privacy , others have decried Rose ’s script as entrapment , and others still have demanded that Rose compensate Planned Parenthood for wasting the organization ’s resources .
The latter two are the easiest to respond to : the services Rose availed herself of are typically offered at no cost , and so there is nothing for her to reimburse .
As far as entrapment is concerned , since Rose is a private citizen , not a law enforcement officer , this line of legal argument fails to apply .
The privacy rights issue is more difficult to discern .
Since laws vary by state , it is unclear the rights of the patients who appear in Live Action Films are being violated when their likenesses are not actually displayed publicly .
( Live Action Films has blurred the faces of the patients on the videos they have released . )
We also do n’t know which states ’ laws may apply , as the locations of the clinics are only divulged when Live Action Films chooses to release the selective footage .
If , legally speaking , neither Rose nor Planned Parenthood has done anything wrong , what is so special about yet another argument regarding abortion and morality ?
Morality is , after all , largely in the eye of the beholder .
I realized why I was so bothered by Rose ’s expertly tailored media persona while listening to an interview she did with radio host Laura Ingraham , and found myself nodding in agreement with Rose about elements of her argument .
Here ’s what Rose told Ingraham : “ [ The pro-choice movement ] should demand the best from their abortion providers … they need to demand the best behavior and the best law - abiding protection of women from these supposed people on their side . ”
Any health care provider requires regular self - assessment regarding both the protection of patients ’ rights and providers ’ responsibilities .
It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure staff are not only effectively trained at the time they are hired , but also that they continue to comply with the organization ’s policies and procedures throughout the duration of employment .
Rose ’s examples , however out of context they may be , hit home the point that providers and pro-choice advocates are already aware of and work to address : ensuring an impeccable quality of care is enormously important and needs to be a high priority for both health care providers and the pro-choice movement .
Rose ’s use of feminist and anti-racist language on Ingraham ’s show made me ponder why she seemed so keen to channel SisterSong ’s vision of reproductive justice , and why she appeared to be speaking to her opponents instead of to her comrades .
I had convinced myself this was a momentary lapse from Rose until a similar argument purporting to demonstrate her concern for women arose when she appeared in an interview with Glenn Beck ( “ Planned Parenthood institutionally covers up sexual abuse to procure secret abortions for little girls and then sends them back to the sexual abuser ” ) and once more on Hannity ’s America ( “ 79 % of [ Planned Parenthood ’s ] clinics are in minority neighborhoods , and an African American baby is almost as likely to be aborted because of this as it is to be born .
Abortion is truly impacting , devastating the African American community and Planned Parenthood is behind that . ” )
Obviously , this was not a temporary lapse .
Lila
Rose is using a tactic that has been utilized by anti-abortion activists to combat global reproductive health services for the past 30 years : to co-opt the rhetoric of the Left – in this case , specific reproductive justice concerns and commitments – in order to use it against them .
As Michelle Goldberg details in The Means of Reproduction , in the 1980s feminists fought for a paradigm shift in global reproductive rights by criticizing the cultural imperialism of population control advocates who believed in the necessity of decreasing population growth in “ undeveloped ” countries only to have this same criticism thrown back at them by the same conservative groups a decade later .
Rose has n’t found a new tactic , just new packaging .
The anti-abortion movement has always been good at using the media to popularize their message .
Rose has been featured on several Fox News segments , and she also publishes a newspaper , The Advocate , through her university .
Live Action
Films has been sending out press releases detailing their activities on a nearly biweekly basis since September 2008 , and the frequency has increased in recent months .
This could be the beginning of a rebranding of the pro-life movement .
So far the Left has been largely silent about Rose ’s activities - a mistaken underestimation of the power of media and the ability of the Right to shape the debate by putting the pro-choice community in a weaker , defensive position .
It is difficult to debunk a story that has surged unchecked throughout the blogosphere and appeared on credible media outlets ; but more than that , if established , it will be nearly impossible to unravel a pro-life discourse that removes the Left ’s claim on fighting racism and sexism within reproductive health .
Feminists and health advocates need to respond publicly to Rose ’s dubious assertions that Planned Parenthood is a nefarious organization that facilitates sexual abuse and racial genocide .
They need to point out that her paternalistic attitude toward women and minority groups only serves to perpetuate the institutionalized sexism and racism that permeates our society by denying them affordable health care services from an organization that offers a range of services , 97 percent of services are preventive services ( gynecological exams , contraception distribution , STI testing and treatment , cervical and breast cancer screenings , sexual health education , etc ) and where , according to Planned Parenthood Federation of America spokesperson Diane Quest , “ any removal of public funding would only serve to deny women , men , and young people critical preventive health care . ”
Advocates also need to talk about supportive ways to hold Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers accountable to their own policies : providing financial and in - kind support for staff professional development and monitoring of policy compliance , advocating for pro-choice legislation , reporting policy infractions to executive staff and other already - established regulatory bodies , conducting research to identify best practices , and building coalitions among pro-choice organizations and groups that work to support girls who are sexually exploited , to name a few .
They also need to point out that what Rose is doing may put clinic staff in danger , as some of the information made public in her videos could be used for perilous purposes ( for example , the days the doctors are in the clinic and the process by which discarded tissue is disposed of ) .
They need to talk about all of the women and people of color who are employed by Planned Parenthood who are at risk of losing their jobs if the organization loses funding .
Lila
Rose believes that her goal is righteous , and the pro-life community does too .
She received a $ 50,000 Life Prize in February from the Gerard Health Foundation to work toward her goal of “ continuing to do nonprofit educational work to reach the public with the message that all human beings are created equal , and should be protected by law and by individual choice . ”
It ’s time for the Left to start talking about these videos and these tactics .
We cannot allow feminism to act as a cover for misogynists with short - sighted , myopic objectives .
Some artists paint , some sculpt , and some simply have an incredible amount of range .
Such is the case of artist Dax Norman who animates , draws , paints , and even creates hilarious caricatures of celebrities on bowling pins .
Fom the Macho Man Randy Savage and Napolean Dynamite to The Beatles and the cast of The Big Lebowski , Norman ’s portfolio of bowling pin art covers an extremely broad spectrum of pop culture icons .
And now you can add Steve Jobs to the list , turtle neck and all .
Luckily , our fears of going through life without ever witnessing what Steve Jobs embodied on a bowling pin would look like have been alleviated .
Not only did Norman create an hilarious representation of Jobs on a bowling pin , he went one step further and photographed it outside the entrance of Apple HQ in Cupertino .

Erdos Museum is located in a city that is currently being built , almost overnight .
Driven by a booming economy , the Municipal Government of Erdos has determined to build a new city centre , dozens of kilometers away from the current city .
There was nothing but the Gobi Desert on this site in 2005 .
An urban masterplan was created , entitled ‘ Ever Rising Sun On The Grass Land ’ .
This plan drew a beautiful but empty image , one which fulfills the wishes of the government , but does n’t hold much for the people who will have to live there .
Erdos Museum will be created at the centre of this new city .
Our concept is a reflection and a reaction to the masterplan .
The design is a natural , irregular nucleus , to contrast with the planned city ; to provide interior scenery completely separate to that which is outside .
The museum is wrapped in reflective metal louvers .
The surface of the museum thus reflects and fragments the surroundings .
The interior will become a new public space , divided into several exhibition halls , connected by continuous white curvilinear walls .
The glazed roof will let light into this space , whilst the louvers will allow natural ventilation .
It has been just shy of two weeks since the first release candidate of Firefox 3.5 became available for download , and reports say that the latest version of Firefox should go official tomorrow .
Yet already , the Mozilla team is wasting no time in preparing for Firefox 3.6 — the next , next big version of the world 's second most popular web browser .
Scheduled for early - to - mid 2010 , Firefox 3.6 promises a number of major feature improvements over the current generation , so much so that it could actually see a bigger number jump ( in the same manner that Firefox 3.5 was originally called " 3.1 , " until its newness made it more than just an incremental release ) .
To avoid confusion , then , developers at Mozilla often refer to Firefox 3.6 as " Firefox.next " or refer to it by its codename , " Namoroka , " named for a national park in Madagascar .
So what 's on tap for users in Namoroka ?
Here 's a sneak peek , though keep in mind that this early in the development cycle , things are bound to change .
Top Priority Changes
The following are top priority changes and additions for the Firefox . next team .
These are generally not cosmetic enhancements , but things that will have a real , noticeable effect on how you use the browser and how it performs .
Better Peformance - For Firefox .next improving browser performance is one of the biggest goals .
That means " dramatic , human - perceivable speed increases , " such as getting startup time , and the time it takes to do common tasks like open a new tab , open a bookmarked page , or complete an address in the Awesomebar to under 50 ms .
One of the main areas of focus for Firefox 3.5 was improved JavaScript performance via the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine , which means faster , more responsive web apps .
For the next version , performance improvements will be felt in how the browser itself functions .
More Personalization and Customization Options -
One thing that has always made Firefox stand out , is how easily you can change the look , feel , and functionality through themes and add - ons .
In Firefox . next , one of the top priorities is a long talked about " light weight " framework for themes and add - ons that would allow you to load them up without restarting the browser .
That would make testing out new personalization and customizations a much easier and faster process .
New Navigation Options - Mozilla wants users of Firefox . next to be able to organize their tabs based on the task they are attempting to accomplish .
That means adding the ability to search for existing tabs , and the ability to navigate by tag , date , or source metadata , which could borrow from the unconventional navigation elements in Mozilla 's Ubiquity project .
Lower priority enhancements to Firefox navigation in this area include giving users the ability to create , save , restore groups of tabs , and adding some light file management features — such as copy , move , and delete — to the download manager .
Better Web App Support -
Web apps are a huge part of Mozilla 's vision for the future of computing , which is why Firefox .
next will add better support for them .
For the next version of Firefox , this means an improved interface for uploading files to websites , but more importantly it means the ability to save web pages as applications .
That likely points to an integration of the Prism project , which is a Firefox extension that lets users pop web applications out of the browser and run them directly on the desktop .
Helping web applications run and feel more like their desktop counterparts could be an important part of bringing web apps to a mainstream audience .
What Else is Being Considered ?
In addition to the main focus areas mentioned above , Mozilla is also considering a number of other features and changes for Namoroka .
Many of these might never find their way into the next version of Firefox , but a few of them very likely will .
Taskfox - Taskfox is a recently announced project at Mozilla to bring some of the experimental Ubiquity user interface and navigation paradigms to Firefox .
Some of those navigation features are higher priority and will more likely find their way into Firefox .
next , but if there 's time , we could actually see a lot more of Ubiquity in the next big version of Firefox .
Better Session Management - I already mentioned that the ability to create , save , and restore a group of tabs is a low priority addition for Firefox .
next , but this would be such a hugely useful feature that it deserves a second mention .
Firefox can currently save and restore session data when you shut down the entire program or suffer through a browser crash , but there 's not really a good way to just save a set of tabs and put them aside for later , which is something I often want to do when researching multiple posts .
The best option right now is just to bookmark tabs or save them elsewhere ( like in a text file or on Delicious ) — those are n't very good options .
Personally Customized Browser - Mozilla is tentatively planning for a Firefox that can adjust itself based on how you surf the web .
That means things like personalized form and search fill - in features , and a new " about : me " page that gives you statistics about your browsing history and behavior .
Identity Management -
There 's not much information about what this means , but Mozilla is again talking identity management as they did before Firefox 3.0 .
Back then it meant things like OpenID and CardSpace — we 'll have to see what it means this time around .
New Tab Page -
One of the coolest features of Google 's Chrome browser is their new tab page , which shows users their most frequently visited web sites when they open up a new tab .
Firefox might be planning to follow suit in version 3.6 with something perhaps similar to the proposed new tab page prototype they showed off in March .
What other features would you like to see in the next version of Firefox ?
Let us know in the comments .
Even if you ’ve managed to hold onto your crappy job during this whole “ economy ” thing the news keeps droning on and on about , that still does n’t guarantee that you have benefits .
Taking care of your health is an incredibly expensive luxury .
Want straight teeth ?
Want to be able to see ?
Want to know why it burns when you pee ?
Until Obama gets around to giving us all free health care , it ’ll cost ya !
This is America .
Save your money for booze , and follow my tips to living without health insurance :
Take the bus everywhere .
Even if you have car insurance and drive as carefully as possible , someone could ( and will ) hit you .
Then you ’ll be paying hospital bills .
You might as well fund an indie movie out of your own wallet , because that ’s how expensive staying in the hospital is .
So lessen your chances by taking the bus , although it does raise your chances of getting stabbed and having to go to the hospital anyway .
Wear glasses .
Sure , your first pair of eyeglasses will be expensive , but contacts get used up and you ’ll always need more of them .
If you ca n’t afford glasses , invest in a good friend who will walk you around .
Luckily for you , friendships are paid off in rides to the airport , as opposed to actual currency .
Change your religious values .
You ’ll save a ton on prescriptions if you become a Christian Scientist and refuse to believe that doctors know what they ’re doing .
Insisting that any illness can be cured by simple praying is the most affordable option you ’ll have !
Floss .
Even people with dental insurance do n’t go to the dentist .
But keep up your flossing , unless you want your teeth to fall out .
Stop having sex .
Who needs costly birth control if you ’re celibate ?
Plus , there ’s no chance of STD ’s , which means you ’ll never have to buy expensive creams to get rid of any itching down there .
Have more sex .
Google has 128 million results for " Health Benefits of Sex . "
As opposed to only 14.8 million for " Health Benefits of Suicide . "
Stuffed animals .
Do n’t spend all your money on a costly psychiatrist .
Tell all your problems to your teddy bear .
It ’s embarrassing , but not as embarrassing as admitting you ’re in therapy .
Free clinics .
if you simply must get professional help , there are free clinics , if you do n’t mind waiting all day in a waiting room filled with crack addicts and illegal aliens .
Although during my free clinic experience , I was misdiagnosed and given the wrong medication , only making me sicker .
You ’ll probably be healthier if you just bypass any sort of professional help altogether .
Think this is too much work ?
Do n’t worry – if you follow these simple steps , you may not live that long .
I rise in reluctant opposition to H Res 560 , which condemns the Iranian government for its recent actions during the unrest in that country .
While I never condone violence , much less the violence that governments are only too willing to mete out to their own citizens , I am always very cautious about “ condemning ” the actions of governments overseas .
As an elected member of the United States House of Representatives , I have always questioned our constitutional authority to sit in judgment of the actions of foreign governments of which we are not representatives .
I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little .
And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran .
Of course I do not support attempts by foreign governments to suppress the democratic aspirations of their people , but when is the last time we condemned Saudi Arabia or Egypt or the many other countries where unlike in Iran there is no opportunity to exercise any substantial vote on political leadership ?
It seems our criticism is selective and applied when there are political points to be made .
I have admired President Obama ’s cautious approach to the situation in Iran and I would have preferred that we in the House had acted similarly .
I adhere to the foreign policy of our Founders , who advised that we not interfere in the internal affairs of countries overseas .
I believe that is the best policy for the United States , for our national security and for our prosperity .
I urge my colleagues to reject this and all similar meddling resolutions .
It 's a pretty sad day in the U.S. House of Representatives with the only sane figure is Ron Paul ( R - TX ) .
Yesterday the House put aside serious governance to take up a puffed up , non-binding resolution , H.RES.560 , offered by Howard Berman , the Los Angeles neo -Con Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee ( and one of the de facto representatives of Israel 's far right Likud Party in Congress ) .
Although one sensible progressive stalwart , Dave Loebsack ( D - IA ) , and one usually knuckleheaded Blue Dog , Brad Ellsworth ( D - IN ) , had the self - respect to vote " present , " the superfluous resolution garnered 235 Democrats and 170 Republicans , only Ron Paul voting " nay .
" Does Ron Paul oppose democracy and freedom ?
Quite the contrary .
Read his statement about the resolution and his vote :
This morning the honey was dripping out of Eric Cantor 's smirking mouth as he ran to every TV camera in sight to condemn the detestable Supreme Leader and , more to the point , chastise President Obama 's stance , which is n't really any different from what the House passed , only without the demagoguery and incitement .
Every Iranian reformer
I 've heard speaking on the radio has asked the U.S. government to not insert itself because it would only make matters more difficult for them .
Does this matter to Mike Pence , the bloodthirsty Republicans and dim- witted Democrats ?
Of course not .
John McCain got his first woody since originally being introduced to Sarah Palin at the thought of the streets of Tehran running with blood .
Lieberman and Graham were no doubt breaking out a bottle of champagne in gleeful anticipation .
The primitive religionist thugs and the military dictators in Iran are cracking skulls and claiming that the protesters are agents of America and the EU .
The Iranians , on their own , with our prayers , are completely delegitimizing Supreme Leader Khamenei and the fascist dictatorship there .

In the wake of the death of Irish immigrant Darren O’Donnell , Irish immigration centers in New York are calling for all the undocumented not to hesitate to seek medical help if they are injured .
O’Donnell , 32 , an Athlone , County Westmeath native and an undocumented construction worker in N.Y. , suffered fatal injuries after being attacked in a Staten Island park , the Irish Echo reported last week .
He did not , however , seek out medical attention and did not report the incident to the police , which ultimately resulted in his untimely death .
In response to the tragedy , the Aisling Irish Community Center in Yonkers , N.Y. is reiterating advice they ’ve previously given to undocumented immigrants “ not to be afraid to come forward when a crime has been committed against them . ”
“ The police are here to serve and protect us , ” Orla Kelleher , executive director of the Aisling Center , told IrishCentral .
“ Just as if you have a medical concern , the hospitals and doctors have a duty of care to look after somebody regardless of their immigration status . ”
The Emerald Isle Immigration Center of Queens , N.Y. similarly said in a published report that they are working to get the message out to every undocumented Irish immigrant in New York City that they “ should not be afraid of seeking help from the police or emergency medical services , ” said Siobhan Dennehy , executive director of the Center .
Kelleher says the Aisling Center has only ever had positive experiences with both the police and hospitals , both of which have a “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy in cases regarding undocumented immigrants .
“ This proves that people should not be afraid to come forward , ” she said .
“ The police have done everything within their power to serve and protect us without any fear of a person ’s status coming against them .
They have always abided by their ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ policy . ”
O’Donnell was eventually treated for his injuries in the Richmond University Hospital in Staten Island , and was transferred to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan , where he died from his injuries on May 16 .
When asked why an undocumented immigrant might not immediately seek medical attention for injuries or report an incident to the police , Kelleher said : “ I think some people prefer to ignore it in the hope that the problem will go away , rather than dealing with an issue , which can become as serious as fatal , in this case . ”
Kelleher ’s hypothesis corresponds to the Athlone community ’s description of O'Donnell .
One Athlone Woman told the Echo that the Irish immigrant was quiet , and “ not the kind of person to make a big deal of things . ”
O’Donnell ’s remains were sent to Westmeath , where he was interred after a funeral in St. Mary ’s Church in Athlone .
More details of the Irish immigrant ’s death will soon be released by the Medical Examiner for the City of New York .
Meanwhile , the Richmond County District Attorney ’s office , which covers Staten Island , has stated its intentions to further investigate O’Donnell ’s death .
( Atlanta , GA , June 26 , 2009 ) —
The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today denied the Georgia General Assembly 's motion to dismiss Lambda Legal 's federal lawsuit on behalf of Vandy Beth Glenn , a transgender woman who was fired from her job as Legislative Editor after she told them she planned to transition from male to female .
Richard W. Story , United States District Judge , writes : " Defendants do not claim that Glenn 's transition would have rendered her unable to do her job nor do they present any government purpose whatsoever for their termination of Plaintiff 's employment …
Anticipated reactions of others are not a sufficient basis for discrimination . "
" We are thrilled that Vandy Beth has been granted her day in court and that the Georgia General Assembly can be challenged for violating her constitutional rights , " said Cole Thaler , National Transgender Rights Attorney based in Lambda Legal 's Southern Regional Office in Atlanta .
" Senior officials of the Georgia state legislature discriminated when they fired our client simply because her boss did n't like who she is . "
Glenn worked for two years in the General Assembly 's Office of Legislative Counsel as an editor and proofreader of bill language .
She loved her job , but living as male was increasingly painful and distressing for Glenn , who has a longstanding female gender identity .
Glenn 's health care providers diagnosed her with Gender Identity Disorder ( GID ) and agreed that gender transition was necessary for her health and well - being .
In 2007 , Glenn informed her immediate supervisor , Beth Yinger , that she planned to proceed with her transition from male to female , and showed Yinger photographs of herself in feminine attire .
Yinger passed the information on to her boss , the General Assembly 's Legislative Counsel , Sewell Brumby .
After confirming that Glenn intended to transition , Brumby fired her on the spot .
Lambda Legal 's lawsuit , first filed in July 2008 , asserted that Glenn 's termination violated the Constitution 's Equal Protection guarantee because it treated her differently due to her nonconformity with sex stereotypes and her medical condition .
On October 16 , 2008 , the Georgia General Assembly filed a motion to dismiss the case claiming that her Equal Protection claims were incorrectly applied .
Lambda Legal argued that Glenn 's Equal Protection claims are based on unequal treatment due to her membership in two identifiable groups — people with GID and people who do not conform to sex stereotypes — and , in today 's ruling , the court agreed .
Today 's decision relied in part on Lambda Legal 's landmark case Romer v. Evans which made clear that prejudice does not justify governmental discrimination .
" I look forward to continuing my case and working to end this type of discrimination .
No one should lose their job for no good reason the way I did , " said Lambda Legal client Vandy Beth Glenn .
Cole Thaler , Transgender Rights Attorney and Greg Nevins , Supervising Senior Staff Attorney in Lambda Legal 's Southern Regional Office in Atlanta are handling the case .
The case is Glenn v. Brumby et. al .

Paul Krugman responds to readers ’ comments on his Oct. 30 column , “ Bursting Bubble Blues . ”
Brian Collins , Concord , Calif . :
What exactly can the Fed do to crack down on irresponsible mortgage lenders ?
Can it ban these interest - only mortgages ?
Paul Krugman : The Fed has a lot of power to issue lending regulations .
In fact , it ’s starting to do that now — closing the barn door long after the horse is gone .
John Jones , Waynesville , N.C. :
If anyone is to blame for the current situation , it is Mr. Greenspan , who pooh - poohed warnings about an emerging bubble and did nothing to crack down on irresponsible lending .
I am not a supporter of Greenspan , but I remember him expressing concern over the inflation in housing prices — and as I recall , he began the steady rise in the overnight rates charged by the Federal Reserve in part in an attempt to dampen the speculation in housing sales and expressed some concern that these actions failed to increase mortgage rates and admitted that he really did not understand why .
Is this correct ?
Paul Krugman : No , not really .
Greenspan waited until the housing bubble was almost at its peak before admitting that there was some “ froth ” in the market .
His 2004 remark , which I quoted , was part of a longer disquisition in which he actually denied in principle the possibility of a housing bubble .
Neeraj Mehra , Amritsar , India : Mr. Greenspan has done a disservice to the nation by creating the housing boom .
As a layman - observer , that ’s the lingering thought I ’ve had .
Your article reaffirms it .
The question I have is this :
Did he do the right thing — acting morally by engineering a housing boom , more as a bridge loan , until something else showed up at the horizon to shore up the economy — because he did n’t have a choice , or did he undertake a path of mere political expediency ?
And , that ’s a question that ’s nagging me for a while .
Would appreciate it if you could shed some light .
Paul Krugman :
As Paul McCulley of PIMCO remarked when the tech boom crashed , Greenspan needed to create a housing bubble to replace the technology bubble .
So within limits he may have done the right thing .
But by late 2004 he should have seen the danger signs and warned against what was happening ; such a warning could have taken the place of rising interest rates .
He did n’t , and he left a terrible mess for Ben Bernanke .
James Abeel , Ajijic , Jalisco , Mexico :
Is there a budding real estate tax problem arising from this housing slump ?
I come from the most overpriced county in the U.S. , Essex County , Mass. , where the real estate taxes , of course , have ballooned with the housing prices .
In Massachusetts , the Republican governors have been cutting state - supported programs , putting a high amount of stress on the cities and towns to raise real estate taxes forcing many to move away — not an uncommon problem in the Bay State .
If middle - class homeowners can not sell or buy homes , as the axe cuts both ways , what are the chances of these same people of paying high real estate taxes ?
Paul Krugman :
Yes , indeed : real estate taxes are based on past values , and could become very nasty in a falling market .
Bill Brawley , Etna , N.H. :
Three questions :
What comparisons can be made between the current housing bust and the savings and loan debacle of the late 80 ’ / early 90’s ?
It ’s remarkable how regional markets have boomed and busted in near - perfect synchronicity .
It ’s also notable how suddenly the chill set in , everywhere .
Can this be attributed to the Internet ’s ability to speed delivery of information , and , if so , would that worsen the situation ?
Finally , how worried should we be about the integrity of the banking system with integrity carrying the full load of its connotations ?
Underground comics took root in America in the 1960s and ripened with the counterculture ; artists like R. Crumb , Kim Deitch and Art Spiegelman discarded the old funny - page formats and themes  beat it , “ Blondie ”  like so many desiccated cornhusks .
In Japan , however , there had already been a comics revolution , and the man at its rowdy vanguard was Yoshihiro Tatsumi .
Mr. Tatsumi , born in 1935 , came of age alongside Japan ’s postwar obsession with manga , serialized black - and - white comics whose characters have a distinctive iconography : big , dewy eyes ; tiny mouths ; piles of spiky hair .
Most manga takes place in a bright alternate universe where it seems as if any problem might be resolved with a cute - off : batting eyelashes at 10 paces .
Mr. Tatsumi began drawing manga as a child , but he quickly rebelled against the form ’s aesthetic limitations .
Manga was aimed largely at children , and its emotional and intellectual palette was circumscribed .
Along with a cohort of young writers and illustrators , Mr. Tatsumi introduced in the late 1950s a bolder form of manga he called “ gekiga ”  darker , more realistic , often violent .
The name stuck .
And he became one of Japan ’s most important visual artists .
Image A memoir looks back at the roots of gekiga , Japanese comic book arts dark side .
Credit ... Yoshihiro Tatsumi / Courtesy of Drawn & Quarterly
Mr. Tatsumi ’s work , long unavailable in English , has begun to be translated and issued by the Canadian publishing house Drawn & Quarterly in an annual series of books edited by the cartoonist Adrian Tomine .
Now comes the big kahuna : Mr. Tatsumi ’s outsize autobiography , “ A Drifting Life . ”
Just a quick and simple little how to for you here , some video instructions and some quick tips .
First , the video :
The garment only needs to stay in the plastic bag for about 5 - 10 minutes after you ’ve sprayed it ( if necessary ) , not an hour like they say in the video above .
Use distilled water , doing so will prevent minerals in tap water from penetrating the fabric and making it stiff .
You can use some spray starch for extra crispness , but you should know that a heavily starched shirt can wrinkle a lot more when worn and also end up being uncomfortable as well .
Keep the iron moving , obviously never rest the iron face - down on the clothing .
When youâ€ ™re done ironing , you should empty the water from the iron while it ’s hot .
When youâ€ ™re done ironing , you should empty the water from the iron while it ’s hot .
This reduces the moisture that ’s left in the water compartment of the iron .
Also , allow the iron to cool off before you put it away ( you do n’t want to start a fire if the iron is stored near anything flammable ) .
Additional Resources
Here ’s a REALLY good quality article where someone put together the step - by - step instructions along with pictures for most steps , highly recommended .
I was at Glastonbury when Jacko died .
That 's not a factual statement , but a T - shirt slogan .
The day after his death , souvenir tops with " I was at Glasto 09 when Jacko died " printed on them were already on sale around the site .
In fact , when Jacko died , I was at home playing Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars on a Nintendo DSi .
I am 38 years old .
Many festival - goers apparently discovered the news when DJs around the site began playing Michael Jackson records simultaneously .
Music combined with word of mouth .
That 's a nice way to find out .
I learned it via a harsh electric beep , bringing my attention to a text message that simply proclaimed " Jackson 's dead " in stark pixelated lettering .
Clearly it 's the sort of information you have to mindlessly share with the rest of the herd the moment you hear about it .
But first I needed confirmation .
I occasionally text people to say there 's been a massive nuclear explosion in Canada , or David Cameron 's gone mad and launched his own breakfast cereal shaped like little swastikas or whatever , in the hope they 'll pass it on without checking .
I did n't want to fall for my own jape .
I switched on the TV .
Jackson was still alive on BBC News 24 , where they seemed to be reporting he was in hospital following a heart attack .
That was n't good enough , so I flicked over to Sky News , which tends to blab stuff out while the Beeb drags its feet tediously checking the facts .
He was bound to be dead on Sky .
But he was n't ; he was possibly in a coma .
In desperation , I turned to Fox .
They would already be attempting to communicate with him via the spirit realm , surely .
But they were n't .
If anything , they were being more cautious than the Beeb .
Boo .
Back to Sky , which was now reporting that a website was announcing his death .
That 'd do for now .
I beamed a few texts out : " Michael Jackson apparently dead " .
" Piss off " came the reply .
It was my own fault .
I 'd texted a few weeks earlier to say Huw Edwards had just vomited live on the news .
Confirmation of his death gradually spread across the news networks , but the main terrestrial channels were still obliviously broadcasting their scheduled programmes .
ITV won the newsflash race , diving straight in after Trial and Retribution .
Alastair Stewart abruptly shouted " MICHAEL JACKSON HAS DIED " down the lens like a man standing on the shoreline trying to get the attention of someone on the deck of a passing ferry during gale - force winds .
Fair enough .
Whenever I hear the phrase , " And now a special news report " , I automatically start scanning the room for blunt objects to club myself to death with in case they 're about to announce nuclear war .
Since this was n't the apocalypse , but an unexpected celebrity death – sad , but not worth killing yourself with a paperweight over – Stewart was right to blurt it out as fast as he could .
After watching the news long enough to assess that , yes , he was dead , and the circumstances all seemed rather tragic , long enough for them to play a bit of Billie Jean and Beat It and Smooth Criminal and Blame it on the Boogie and so on , reminding me that he was a bona fide musical genius , I went to bed .
The next day he was still dead , but somehow deader than the day before .
He was all over the radio and papers .
The TV had clips of Thriller on heavy rotation , which seemed a tad inappropriate , what with him playing a decomposing corpse in it .
If Bruce Willis died falling from a skyscraper , I doubt they 'd illustrate his life story by repeatedly showing that bit from Die Hard where he ties a firehose round his waist and jumps off the building .
Across all the networks , a million talking heads shared their thoughts and feelings on his death .
They had rung everyone in the universe and invited them on the show .
On This Morning , a Coronation Street actor revealed he had once had tickets for a Michael Jackson concert but could n't go because of the traffic .
It was a sad day indeed .
At 3 pm , his death was still " BREAKING NEWS " according to Sky , which has to be some kind of record .
Even 9/11 did n't " break " that long .
Next day , the news was apparently still sinking in around the globe .
The BBC went live to Emily Maitlis as she stood on Hollywood Boulevard ( at 1 am local time ) waiting for two young Latinos to perform a breakdance tribute to the King of Pop .
Something went wrong with the iPod hooked up to their speakers so she had to stand there for a full two minutes , awkwardly filling in while they fiddled with the settings .
Sky had flown Kay Burley out to LA too , to hear the fans ' pain and pull concerned faces .
This continued into the following day .
It 's probably still going on now .
But the news is not the place to " celebrate " Jackson 's music .
The Glastonbury stage , the pub , the club , the office stereo , the arts documentary : that 's the place .
The news should report his death , then piss off out of the way , leaving people to moonwalk and raise a toast in peace .
If I was God , here 's what I 'd do now .
I 'd force all the rolling networks to cover nothing but the death of Michael Jackson , 24 hours a day , for the next seven years .
Glue up the studio doors and keep everyone inside , endlessly " reporting " it , until they start going mad and developing their own language – not just verbal , but visual .
And I 'd encourage viewers to place bets on which anchor would be the first to physically end it all live on air .
And while that was happening , I 'd create some other stations that covered other stuff .
Current affairs type stuff .
I think I 'd call them " news channels " .
They might catch on .
This week Charlie was saddened to read of the death of former NME writer Steven " Swells " Wells : " I disagreed with 85 % of what he wrote , but I always wished I could hurl sentences together like him – he tossed words around like a demented cartoon chef .
He seemed hilarious and furious , music journalism 's very own Sadowitz .
Never met or spoke to him ; now I wish I had .
RIP . "
A classic example of a female character that Shakespeare has given license to “ act outside her role ” as a woman ( at least , until she is “ appropriately ” reined in at the end of the play ) is the lady Olivia of Twelfth Night .
When she falls in love with Viola disguised as the young page Cesario , she works hard to try to woo him , taking on the role of the hunter where she would normally be the hunted .
This gives her incredible appeal as a strong and empowered woman , as does the fact that she has no real reason to reject the advances of the Duke Orsino– in fact she even admits that he ’s quite handsome , saying that he is “ of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth ; ” ( 1.5.261 ) as well as “ in dimension and the shape of nature / A gracious person ” ( 1.5.263-264 ) but like Hermia of A Midsummer Night ’s Dream when faced with the love of Demetrius , Olivia refuses to back down and submit to the man she does n’t want .
She is strong , and she rules over her household with an unquestioned hand , with servants at her beck and call and even her live - in uncle ( an older , male relative , who by all accounts should be in charge ) firmly under her thumb .
Even while the strong , shipwreck surviving Viola , or the wise and dangerous lady Portia of Merchant of Venice are forced to go into disguise in order to protect themselves as they wade in among the dangers of the male world , Olivia steps forth undisguised and unchallenged , as firm against the tide of the misogynistic elements of society as the Elizabethan era ’s own “ Virgin Queen ” was .
Like Shakespeare ’s Olivia , Elizabeth too stood as a pinnacle of female power , refusing all suitors as she sat at the helm of her nation ( not just her household ) with control over many older males , including members of the clergy and the military , unwilling to yield her power to any would - be king .
In the end however , despite all of Olivia ’s power and feminine flame , despite all her similarities to the “ Virgin Queen ” who never fell to the wiles of suitors or ambitious men , the Lady of Illyria is easily undone , and her end is perhaps fitting for the eyes of an audience of Shakespeare ’s era , reducing her to a mewling kitten - like shadow of her former self , one who cries out “ What shall you ask of me that I ’ll deny ” ( 3.4 219 ) in the hopes of winning the love she now desperately seeks to see returned ( instead of valiantly denying or hunting it . )
It takes only the easy agreement of Viola ’s brother Sebastian ( who Olivia does n’t really know at all when it comes right down to it ) to reign her in and put her under the knuckles of male domination ( where members of the audience at that time in history would probably argue she truly should be ) as the wife of a penniless “ gentleman ” who is most certainly beneath her .
Whether this is a veiled critique , stab , or worse– hope for the future inserted by Shakespeare in regards to the “ Virgin Queen ” and her refusal to marry , we can only guess , though I still think it bears mentioning as something to consider when we read Twelfth Night and witness first hand the way the mighty Olivia is brought low by a young man who , like so much refuse and dead seaweed , was found and brought into the city by an enemy of the ruling elite after he washed up on the shore of Illyria .
Another woman who bears mentioning as an empowered transcender of roles that is raised and torn down by the poetic machinations of our playwright is Shylock ’s daughter Jessica , who shines brilliantly , if briefly , in the comedy entitled The Merchant of Venice .
While Jessica is , like Olivia of Twelfth Night , very assertive when it comes to love , she takes her feminine power a step further and defies her father ’s wishes outright , going so far as to forsake and rob him blind in the same moment that she turns her back on her entire faith .
In this sense , she appears far stronger than Olivia , or more probably , simply more reckless , as she immediately gives over the power she has seized ( and the male clothing she temporarily dons ) when she submits to marrying the Christian gentleman Lorenzo and taking his faith as her own .
Her rise and fall as a woman of strength and power is brilliant , but short - lived , and though the repercussions of her actions extend beyond the scope of the play and can only be guessed at , Shakespeare seems to indicate with lines like the candid warning of Lancelet Gobbo : “ I fear you are damned both by / father and mother ” ( 3.5.14 - 15 ) and the sad mood she acquires by the end of the play , that she will not be spared the dose of “ comeuppance ” an audience of Shakespeare ’s time might feel she surely deserves .
So it looks like the PlayStation Store received a face lift over night , just in time for Sony ’s big E3 press conference .
The store should be updating later today with Final Fantasy VII and multiple videos from the conference .
The store ’s icons are now more squared and the overall color of the store is a much darker blue .
The sound that the store makes whenever you make a selection has changed , as well as the username and icon have been moved to the bottom right .
The only feature that seems to be missing is the much requested search function .
As more and more content is release onto the PlayStation Store the search function is needed more than ever .
I have included a picture below ; you may compare it to the header image at the top of the article .
As always , stay here on PlayStation LifeStyle for all the latest news on your favorite console .

Dead has not yet received the support and content which Valve has repeatedly stated will be delivered .
- The release of Left 4 Dead 2 will make Left 4 Dead an obsolete purchase and inferior piece of software after only one year since release .

Issue Clash : Late Abortions
Two outspoken abortion activists in an interactive debate you do n't want to miss .
Shocking images and violent calls to action from anti-abortion websites .
Two outspoken abortion activists in an interactive debate you do n't want to miss .
The Weekly Q
Canada 's top court has shut down a bid from a B.C. man trying to challenge the so - called " bubble zone " law that protects the area surrounding abortion clinics .
Donald David Spratt says the zone violates his freedom of expression and was hoping to convince the Supreme Court of Canada the law restricting protests in front of abortion clinics is unconstitutional .
But the court dismissed his claim without giving a reason .
The decision upholds the Access to Abortion Services Act , which makes it illegal to interfere with a doctor or patient within 50 metres of an abortion clinic .
Spratt was convicted in 1998 after standing in front of a Vancouver clinic with a large wooden cross that read " You shall not murder . "
He spoke to workers as they came out of the clinic about the value of the love of God and the necessity of redemption from sin .
Precedent
Last September , the B.C. Court of Appeal shut down shut a decade long battle by Spratt and Gordon Watson , another anti-abortion activist , by upholding the bubble zone law .
The unanimous decision agreed the right to oppose abortion is constitutionally protected , but said limits on that expression are justified in order to protect vulnerable women accessing health care services .
Jill Doctoroff , director of the non-profit Elizabeth Bagshaw Women 's Clinic , said the decision is consistent with Canadian law .
" This is a legal and medical procedure in an accredited medical facility , " Doctoroff said .
" We 're pleased women are able to access service without harassment and staff and nurses and physicians can go to their workplace without being harassed for what they do . "
With files from The Canadian Press
RALEIGH , N.C. , June 28 ( UPI ) -- " Antiques Roadshow " appraisers valued a jade set as high as $ 1.07 million , the highest appraisal since the show started traversing the United States .
The collection -- jade pieces from China 's Chien Lung reign from 1736 - 1795 -- belong to an unidentified woman who arrived early at the Saturday taping in Raleigh , N.C. , of the popular PBS show , The News & Observer in Raleigh reported Sunday .

The woman told the appraiser the pieces belonged to her father , a military liaison to China in the 1930s and ' 40s , show officials said .
Asian art appraiser James Callahan , who examined the four pieces , said the dealer steered her father to quality items .
The popular PBS series travels cross-country , helping folks assess the value of collectibles and heirlooms .
" The dealer selected very fine pieces , " he said .
" I 've never seen anything like it . "
Callahan says the value of the pieces depends on the market for them in China and that the Chinese government often wants to get such pieces back .
" Roadshow " workers said the woman 's initial reaction was silence , followed by , " Damn ! "
Erfworld
I do n't know how many of you out there follow this comic , Erfworld , but I 've been following it since it started in 2006 and they 've just now finished the first part .
It 's about a D&D gamer guy who gets zapped into a weird fantasy world to be the perfect warlord for one side in a big battle .
It 's a full - page story comic , which has made it difficult to read at times when you only get one page every week or two , but I recently went back and read it from the beginning and it's really a pretty good comic .
And now that the first book is done , it 's the perfect time to read the whole thing yourself .
I needed to switch over to Apple computer , phone and ipad because of software changes in my buisness .
I was able to purchase a Macbook Air , Iphone 5se , and Ipad Air .

58 percent of GOP not sure / doubt Obama born in US
Shocker poll from Kos/ Research2000 today .
A whopping 58 percent of Republicans either think Barack Obama was n't born in the US ( 28 percent ) or are n't sure ( 30 percent ) .
A mere 42 percent think he was .
That means a majority of Republicans polled either do n't know about -- or do n't believe the seemingly incontrovertible evidence Obama 's camp has presented over and over and over that he was born in Hawaii in ' 61 .
It also explains why Republicans , including Roy Blunt , are playing footsie with the Birther fringe .
Surprise , surprise : Birther sentiment was strongest in the South and among the 60 - plus crowd - presumably because seniors can't log on to the Internet and rely on rumor , word of mouth and right - wing talk radio .
When do we start a serious dialog about the Birther movement being a proxy for racism that is unacceptable to articulate in more direct terms ?

In making Sonia Sotomayor his first nominee for the Supreme Court yesterday , President Obama appears to have found the ideal match for his view that personal experience and cultural identity are the better part of judicial wisdom .
This is n't a jurisprudence that the Founders would recognize , but it is the creative view that has dominated the law schools since the 1970s and from which both the President and Judge Sotomayor emerged .
In the President 's now - famous word , judging should be shaped by " empathy " as much or more than ...
It is sad , but inevitable , that the TIOBE index of programming language “ popularity ” ( sic ) would be gamed .
Once you start measuring something , and advertising the results , people with an interest in particular outcomes naturally start to look for ways to influence those results .
( It ’s the Observer Effect writ large . )
The fact that TIOBE ’s methodology , which I ’ve discussed previously here and here , is simplistic makes it particularly open to gaming .
Anyone , or any community , with access to many web pages can simply add the magic phrase “ foo programming ” , where foo is their language of choice , to get counted .
And it seems that ’s exactly what the Delphi community did at the end of 20081 .
They made a concerted effort and it seems to have paid off .
( I ’d be very interested in hearing about similar behaviour in other language communities . )
Is that behaviour gaming ?
The author of the post who exhorted is readers to “ Update your Delphi related blog or site to say Delphi programming on every page in visible text ( update the template ) .
Stand up and be counted .
You can make a difference ! ” does n’t seem to think so , as he also said “ I am not suggesting we game the system , just that we help TCPI get an accurate count . ”
An accurate count of what , exactly ?
That ’s always been the fundamental question with TIOBE .
It should be obvious that most web pages that talk about “ delphi programming ” would n’t actually contain the phrase “ delphi programming ” .
The same applies to every other language .
That ’s the paradox at the heart of the TIOBE Index .
And yet , somehow , TIOBE seem to think that counting pages containing the phrase “ delphi programming ” lets them claim that :
The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world - wide , courses and third party vendors .
Eh ?
How can they possibly defend that claim ?
Certainly their documented definition does n’t support it , or even mention it .
I presume they ’re thinking that CV’s , job postings , and adverts are most likely to contain the magic phrase .
It should be obvious , again , that the number of CV’s , job postings , and adverts referring to a given programming language would naturally only be a small fraction of the total web pages referring to the language .
( And only distantly related to the “ popularity ” of a language . )
Yet that “ small fraction ” is what TIOBE measure and make bold claims about .
The fact that TIOBE is making a comparison based on a small fraction makes it even more troubling that TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen appears to support language communities changing their pages to include the magic “ foo programming ” phrase .
In an email quoted on delphi.org he says :
For your information , I think your action has already some effect .
Tonight ’s run shows that Delphi is # 8 at this moment .
There is a realistic chance that Delphi will become “ TIOBE ’s Language of the Year 2008 ″
He ’s endorsing the artificial insertion of the magic phrase .
Clearly this distorts the TIOBE index in favour of language communities that infect as many pages as possible with the magic phrase .
That sure seems like an invitation to game the system !
It ’s likely to lead to other language communities doing the same , and so to further devaluation of the TIOBE Index .
( For alternatives to TIOBE you could look at sites like http://www.langpop.com/, James Robson ’s Language Usage Indicators , or my popular comparison of job trends blog post with ‘ live ’ graphs . )
I have , on a couple of occasions , used the phrase “ perl programming ” in blog posts for my own amusement , and linked it to my original TIOBE or not TIOBE – “ Lies , damned lies , and statistics ” post .
I have n’t suggested that others do the same .
TIOBE ’s endorsement of artificial insertion changes that .
Now it seems like we ’re going to get a dumb “ race to the bottom ” to see which language community controls the most web pages .
If , as a result , the TIOBE Index is affected significantly , then I simply hope they ’ll drop their pretentious claims and state clearly exactly what they ’re counting , how they ’re doing it , and what it means : not much .

Server Hardening with ConfigServer Security & Firewall ( CSF )
CSF was designed for Linux servers by Way to the Web Limited and is very powerful SPI ( Stateful Packet Inspection ) iptables firewall script with a Login / Intrusion Detection and Security capabilities like blocking traffic from well known spammers network using the DShield Block List and the Spamhaus DROP List .
Below is a small cut of it's features :
Excessive connection blocking
Excessive user processes reporting
SYN Flood protection
Port Scan tracking and blocking
To help with the ease and flexibility of the suite , CSF has a front - end which could be easily integrated with control panels like cPanel , DirectAdmin and Webmin .
This makes configuring and managing the firewall very simple task .
This post describes how to harden your server with CSF : installation , configuration and control panel integration .
The installation process is simple : just download the latest version of CSF from download page , untar it and launch the installation script :
cd /root / work wget http://www.configserver.com/free/csf.tgz tar - xzf csf.tgz sh csf/install.sh rm - Rf /root / work / csf *
When installation is completed , test whether you have the required iptables modules :
perl /etc/csf/csftest.pl
If everything works , you should get output like this :
Testing ip_tables/iptable_filter ... OK Testing ipt_LOG ...OK Testing ipt_multiport/xt_multiport ... OK Testing ipt_REJECT ...OK Testing ipt_state/xt_state ...OK Testing ipt_limit/xt_limit...OK
Testing ipt_recent ... OK Testing ipt_owner ... OK Testing iptable_nat/ipt_REDIRECT...OK RESULT : csf should function on this server
Next , backup the original config file / etc / csf / csf.conf , open it and make the following changes :
AUTO_UPDATES = " 1 " LF_DSHIELD = " 86400 " LF_SPAMHAUS = " 86400 " LF_BOGON = " 86400 "
The basic configuration could be done by modifying in config directives ETH_DEVICE , TCP_IN , TCP_OUT , UDP_IN and UDP_OUT .
Note :
In case of bad config , CSF will flush iptables after 5 minutes , because testing mode is enabled by default .
Start CSF and check open TCP and UDP ports with nmap :
/etc/init.d/csf start nmap - sSU -F ip.address
If check shows that everything is OK , testing mode could be disabled .
Edit config file / etc / csf / csf.conf and set :
TESTING = " 0 "
Now the firewall is fully configured and tested .
Restart it :
/etc/init.d/csf restart
The Webmin integration is quite straightforward :
Login to Webmin Navigate to Webmin > Webmin Configuration >
Webmin Modules to add a module from local file Check From local file .
Module is located at /etc/csf/csfwebmin.tgz
To perform server security test , navigate to System > ConfigServer Security & Firewall > Check Server Security

As a moderator on the JavaRanch , I often come across people asking “ What would happen if I executed the following code ” .
Many times the author of such posts can answer the question by copying and pasting his / her code into a Java main ( ) method and running it .
Some might chalk these posts up to being lazy , but , clearly , taking the time to write a post on a message board – often signing up as a member for the first time – takes some amount of effort as well .
With that , I ’m going to be go with the assumption developers avoid experimenting with code because they are scared or unsure of their own knowledge .
Besides which , if it is a matter of laziness , there ’s not much advice I can give except to say “ Do n’t be lazy ” .
Why is experimenting with code can be scary
In my experience as a teacher , development lead , and moderator I often come across developers who are unsure of their own knowledge .
Often times they do n’t fully understand what it is the code is doing and are afraid to experiment for fear it will either demonstrate their own personal weakness or harm the existing code .
To them , I believe that experimenting is most crucial , if only because some of the doubts and questions that linger in their head can often be answered in an surprisingly short amount of time .
If you are staring at a piece of code , puzzled by what you do not understand , take my advice : Step back and play 20 questions , ask yourself “ What are questions I have about this code that can be answered with a simple yes / no ? ” then set up test code to answer each question .
Once you have your answer , your doubt about the application should vanish , replaced by first - hand knowledge of what is going on .
Keep in mind that sometimes these experiments lead to even more questions , but that ’s good ; it ’s part of the learning process .
In those cases , perform even more experiments on the code .
What is an experiment ?
What constitutes an experiment ?
Oftentimes , it involves just writing a short line or two of code , then writing a logging statement , or , more commonly , if you do n’t have a logger , a System.out. println ( ) statement that displays the value of some variable or object .
For example , if you do n’t know why a method is behaving a certain way , add a dozen output statements throughout the code so you can follow two things : 1 ) the path the code is taking and 2 ) the value of the data throughout the code .
Many times , you may be staring at a section of code , wondering why it ’s not working , only to find out that section of code is never reached at run-time .
Experimenting can be about changing values and recording the inputs , but sometimes its just about outputting where / what you think a process is doing .
Some people will recommend a debugger for experimentation but I ’m not one of them .
Aside from often being unwieldy and confusing to use , especially for beginners , sometimes running code through a debugger can affect what it outputs .
For example , in a server environment , remote debuggers can be especially difficult to use .
Services may have transaction timeouts of 30 seconds , and pausing the code in the debugger can cause an exception to be thrown before the method is complete .
If you like using debuggers , more power to you , but as someone who has used both output statements via logging tools and debuggers , I greatly prefer the logging tools .
Primarily , this is because the output statements give you more of a trial and error structure to work with : either a test succeeded , or it failed , and the output is all there in front of you .
Stand - alone Safe Experiments
The easiest and safest experiments are those you create that are completely separate from any other code .
In terms of Java and Eclipse , this is akin to creating a new Workspace and a new Java Project to run the test code in .
Every developer should have a temporary , throw - away workspace like this to perform low - level Java tests with .
Simply create a file which in some way asks the question you want answered , and execute the program to evaluate the results .
Safe Experiments within Existing Code
Let ’s say the code is highly framework dependent , such as often is the cases with J2EE and database - driven applications .
For example , creating a temporary workspace to house your test case may be too cumbersome to implement .
In such a case , you can run the experiment inside your existing code provided you are careful and follow some general guidelines :
If you are working with code that is backed by a repository , such as Subversion , CVS , ClearCase , etc , make sure your experimentation code does not get checked in or you may end up with applications such as this , this , or even the impossible ( the last one ) .
The DailyWTF has literally thousands of such cases .
It is perfectly fine to experiment , just be careful to cleanup when you are done !

If you are working with code that is * not * backed by a repository , then install a developer repository !
I cannot tell you enough the power and value of using a coding repository for all development work .
In lieu of that , though , you should just make a copy of the project and / or workspace and experiment with the copy , keeping the original intact .

I cannot tell you enough the power and value of using a coding repository for all development work .

If you are working with code that connects to a database , make sure it ’s not one other developers use .
Making changes to a shared database as part of a test could affect other developers , so , if possible , you should have your own local copy of the database .
This does not mean you should have a production database , but merely a copy of a QA or Development database
Final Thoughts
In my experience , one of the things that separates a great developer from the rest of the pack is that the great developer fully understands the code they are writing .
When a bug appears ( even great developers can cause bugs ) , this person often has a good idea where to look for the problem right away , and save valuable support time .
Ultimately , if you ever find yourself mystified by your own code base , run some experiments and learn why things work the way they work .
You ’ll be a better developer for it !
CONSTRUCTION work on the Olympic park has helped only 115 people from the five Olympic boroughs to get off the dole .
The site employs 820 people from the local area , or about 20 per cent , from a total of more than 4,100 workers .
Of these , about 14 per cent , or 115 , had declared themselves unemployed .
The figures were released by Olympic Delivery Authority ( ODA ) .
An ODA spokesman said : “ We are delivering vital business , jobs and training opportunities in a tough time for companies and workers in east London .
" Jobs are advertised in local job brokerages first and around a fifth of the workforce live around the Olympic Park while half live in London .
" One in ten of the current Olympic park workforce was previously unemployed , this is above our agreed seven per cent target and a dedicated digger school and construction training centre have been set up to help even more local people get work on site . "
The five host boroughs - Greenwich , Hackney , Newham , Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest - are home to some of the poorest neighbourhoods in the country .
Speaking in the House of Commons , Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said work on the site was ahead of schedule .
She said : " All the major venues on the Olympic park are either on schedule or ahead of schedule .
" The International Olympic Committee 's co-ordination committee , during its visit in April , described progress to date as ‘ nothing short of astounding ' . "
Ms Jowell added that more than 34 per cent of the Olympic Delivery Authority 's ( ODA ) programme is now complete .
" Construction has now commenced on all five major venues , and construction of the Olympic stadium is now one year in and remains ahead of schedule , " she said .
White members of the public are being unlawfully detained by the police in order to give " racial balance " to stop - and - search statistics , a report by the Government 's watchdog on terror laws has found .
Lord Carlile , the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , said he knew of cases where suspects were stopped by officers even though there was no evidence or suspicion against them .
He warned that police were wasting money by carrying out " self - evidently unmerited searches " which were an invasion of civil liberties and " almost certainly unlawful " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lord Carlile , a QC and Liberal Democrat peer , condemned the wrongful use of Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , in his annual report on anti-terror laws .
He said police were carrying out the searches on people they had no basis for suspecting so they could avoid accusations of prejudice .
As the terror threat against Britain is largely from Islamist extremists , the figures show disproportionately more Muslims and therefore more Asians being searched than whites .
But the peer said police should stop trying to balance the figures , and it may be that an " ethnic imbalance " is a " proportional consequence " of policing .
Civil liberty lawyers and black and Asian groups reacted angrily .
Raj Joshi , vice - chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers , accused the police of playing into the hands of far - right organisations like the BNP .
" The latest statistics show exactly what black and Asian communities have been saying for years : that they are being unfairly treated from stop and search through to sentence and punishment in the criminal justice system , " he said .
" It is not enough to use anti-terror laws to target Asian communities when we have been told that the police rely on so - called intelligence - led policing . "
Lord Carlile wrote in his report published yesterday : " I have evidence of cases where the person stopped is so obviously far from any known terrorism profile that , realistically , there is not the slightest possibility of him / her being a terrorist , and no other feature to justify the stop .
In one situation the basis of the stops was numerical only , which is almost certainly unlawful and in no way an intelligent use of the procedure . "

He added : " I believe it is totally wrong for any person to be stopped in order to produce a racial balance in the Section 44 statistics .
There is ample anecdotal evidence this is happening .
I can well understand the concerns of the police that they should be free from allegations of prejudice , but it is not a good use of precious resources if they waste them on self - evidently unmerited searches .
It is also an invasion of the civil liberties of the person who has been stopped , simply to ' balance ' the statistics . "
Figures released earlier this year revealed a huge increase in searches using Section 44 powers .
Officers in England and Wales used the powers to search 124,687 people in 2007 - 08 , up from 41,924 in 2006 - 07 .
Only 1 per cent of searches led to an arrest .
Nearly 90 per cent of the searches were carried out by the Metropolitan Police , which recorded a 266 per cent increase in its use of the power .
Officers in London use Section 44 to carry out stop and search between 8,000 and 10,000 times a month .
Lord Carlile questioned why Section 44 powers are thought to be needed in some areas but not in others facing similar levels of risk .
He criticised the Metropolitan Police for not limiting Section 44 use to parts of London , and said the number of searches being carried out by the force was " alarming " .
A Home Office spokesman defended the use of the powers .
" Stop and search under the Terrorism Act 2000 is an important tool in the ongoing fight against terrorism , " he said .
" As part of a structured anti-terrorist strategy , the powers help to deter terrorist activity by creating a hostile environment for would - be terrorists to operate .
Countering the terrorist threat and ensuring good community relations are interdependent and we are continuing to work with the police to ensure that the use of stop - and - search powers strikes the right balance . "
Case study : ' I was pulled over four times '
Martin King , editor of The Independent 's website :
The only surprise about Lord Carlile 's report is that the findings come as a surprise to him .
I was pulled over by police officers four times as I drove to the previous offices of The Independent in Marsh Wall , east London – close to the sensitive security area surrounding Canary Wharf .
Each time I was given a copy of a form explaining why I had been stopped and my car searched .
It conveyed my rights in some detail .
The stops became so routine that I kept the old paperwork in my car : I could just hand the police officers the form from the previous occasion , so they could copy my details on to the new sheet .
There would be about a dozen police and community support officers ( PCSOs ) at any one time , working together .
They would pull in large groups of people , or three or four cars at a time , and their activities peaked when there were high - level security alerts in the area .
One PCSO was sufficiently abashed to agree that the police had to ensure there was a reasonable mix of ethnicities among those searched .
When I put this notion to him he just smiled back at me in tacit acknowledgement of the pressure he was under .
Then he gave me a new piece of paperwork and we went through the procedure once more .

Chrysler ’s bankruptcy is throwing a wrench into California ’s lemon law , which is intended to make it easier for consumers to get refunds for defective vehicles .
As the automaker ’s bankruptcy grinds away , settlement checks from Chrysler to unhappy car buyers are bouncing and complaints are stymied in and out of court .
Consumer advocates say the situation could erode public confidence in buying new cars at precisely the time the automakers need customers in their showrooms .
And Chrysler says it has yet to do anything to resolve the issue .
“ Lemon law claims are in limbo and there ’s a lot of uncertainty and confusion , ” said Rosemary Shahan , president of the Sacramento advocacy group Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety .
“ They ’re saying we need people to have confidence and get out there and buy cars .
We could n’t agree more , but you ca n’t ignore the problems people are experiencing . ”

State lemon laws , such as the one passed by California in the early 1980s , make it easier for consumers to get refunds for defective vehicles that are still covered by a manufacturer ’s warranty .
Under the California law , new or used vehicles that have a defect that ca n’t be repaired after four attempts -- or two , in the case of life - threatening defects -- or that have been out of service for 30 days during the warranty period may be designated “ lemons . ”
That triggers an obligation for the manufacturer to either pay the owner a cash settlement or buy back the vehicle .
Lemon law complaints are often settled through negotiation between the buyer and the automaker .
If that fails , the buyer can sue .
Since Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection April 30 , financial claims incurred before the filing can be paid only if approved by the bankruptcy judge .
Chrysler has not asked for permission to make payments on lemon law complaints -- and that is causing headaches for some of its customers .

Alex Simanovsky , an Atlanta attorney whose firm handles lemon law cases in California and other states , said he had “ a stack of six or seven checks in my drawer right now from Chrysler that have bounced . ”
The amounts range from $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 for clients who were accepting cash payments to as much as $ 40,000 in cases where Chrysler agreed to repurchase the vehicle .
“ There has been no determination if these accounts are going to be unfrozen [ by the Bankruptcy Court ] and the checks will be good , ” Simanovsky said .
“ My feeling is they will not be . ”
San Diego attorney Ellen Turnage represents a client who reached a settlement with Chrysler over a 2006 Dodge Magnum with a bad suspension .
The car has been returned to Chrysler , but the automaker ’s check bounced .
“ Now he ’s got no car and no money , so he ca n’t go buy a new one , ” Turnage said of her client .
“ He ’s stuck .
We ’re hanging on to a glimmer of hope that at some point this will all be resolved . ”

Attorneys who handle lemon law cases typically work on a contingency fee basis , so they are n’t getting paid either .
Chrysler said it was aware of the lemon law logjam but would n’t say how many of its customers were affected .
The company said it had no plans at this point to ask the bankruptcy judge to approve payments to settle lemon law complaints .
“ This is a complex process and there are a lot of issues being discussed , ” said Chrysler spokesman Mike Palese .
“ This could be one of those issues that comes up in the course of the bankruptcy , but I ca n’t say that we have any plans to present it at this time . ”

Chrysler advises customers with pending lemon law complaints to file a proof of claim form with the Bankruptcy Court and join the ranks of the automaker ’s unsecured creditors .
“ In that case , you ’ll be lucky to get pennies on the dollar , ” Simanovsky said .
Representatives of consumer groups met with the Obama administration ’s auto task force this week to discuss lemon law problems and other issues stemming from the Chrysler bankruptcy and the restructuring of General Motors Corp. , which also could wind up in Bankruptcy Court .
“ They were open to listening to us , but I do think that the consumer is not a focus of the auto task force at this point , ” said Linda Sherry of Consumer Action , a San Francisco - based consumer advocacy group .
“ The task force was put in place to do other things . ”

WABC 7 had this crazy story over the weekend : A cat fell 26 stories from a lower Manhattan building — and survived !
And the cat 's name is ... Lucky !
Apparently Lucky 's owner had left a window in her apartment open 6 inches wide — which is more than enough for any enterprising cat to wander through .
Lucky decided to walk out onto the ledge , but he slipped .
What 's also amazing is that a window washing crew across the street took pictures !
See them here — WABC 7 describes them , " First of Lucky perched dangerously on the ledge , and then a stomach - turning shot of Lucky midair .
Finally , they captured Lucky , after landing , on his feet on a neighbor 's balcony 26 stories below . "
Lucky was hospitalized briefly and seems to be fine and as cute as ever , judging by the video .
If you have any pets , do not leave unscreened windows open more than a inch .
Here 's the ASPCA on high rise syndrome .

There should be absolutely no doubt Glenn Beck is a government disinfo operative tasked with taking down the 9/11 truth and patriot movements .
In fact , Fox News — as a primary fount of Operation Mockingbird — is tasked with attacking not only the 9/11 truth movement but the pro-liberty and Constitution movements as well .
“ Our country is now vulnerable , ” the operative Beck declares .
“ Those people who would like to destroy us — our enemies like Al Qaeda .
They ’d like to destroy us , and they will work with anyone .
There are also people like white supremacists or 9/11 truthers that would also like to destroy the country .
They ’ll work with anybody they can . ”
In other words , the 9/11 truth movement , according to Beck , will work with al - Qaeda .
If you read between the lines , Beck is calling for the government to dish out the same kind of violent response to the truth movement the CIA - created al - Qaeda received in Afghanistan or at Camp Gitmo .
Beck is calling for murder and torture of people who disagree with the government .
[ efoods ]
Fox News did a smash up job subverting the tea parties and reducing the movement to a carnival sideshow while CNN and especially MSNBC went into overtime to portray the “ tea baggers ” as irrelevant and absurd .
On October 22 , 2007 , Beck — then a host on Prime Time News — viciously attacked the 9/11 truth movement , describing the whole movement as “ insane ” and branding 9/11 activists as “ dangerous anarchists . ”
“ These truthers are exactly the kind of people who want to rock this nation ’s foundation , tear us apart and plant the seeds of dissatisfaction in all of us ” said Beck .
He later said the 9/11 truth movement is “ the kind of group a Timothy McVeigh would come from , ” insinuating the movement is intent on violence .
In November of 2007 , Beck the operative teamed up with the scurrilous ex-Marxist and neocon David Horowitz to denounce Ron Paul ’s supporters as terrorists .
“ Beck opened up his show segment by inferring that the U.S. military should be used to silence domestic dissent against the war , claiming that those he would later identify as Ron Paul supporters , libertarians and the anti-war left and link with terrorists , were a ‘ physical threat , ' ” wrote Paul Joseph Watson for Prison Planet .
“ When you enlist in the U.S. military , you have take an oath that says you ’re gonna support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies – foreign and domestic – we talk a lot on this program about the foreign threats – maybe we should spend some time tonight on the domestic one ….
the physical threat may be developing domestically as well , ” said Beck .
Last week the corporate media reported that U.S. counterterrorism officials “ authenticated ” a video by a supposed al - Qaeda recruiter who claimed he has the ability to smuggle a biological weapon into the United States via tunnels under the Mexico border .
In the video , Abdullah al - Nafisi also suggests that al - Qaeda might want to collaborate with “ members of native U.S. white supremacist militias who hate the federal government , ” according to the Washington Post .
The video was posted on the web by MEMRI , a documented Mossad front and Israeli propaganda outfit run by intelligence operatives and neocons .

Update 4:45 pm : The American Clean Energy and Security Act passed the House today by a vote of 219 - 212 , the first time that a bill capping carbon dioxide emissions has passed a chamber of Congress .
It now heads to Senate , where many are expecting another tough battle for the legislation .
Climate change legislation faces a major political test as the American Clean Energy and Security Act heads to a vote on the floor of the House Friday .
The floor debate began today with Democrats and Republicans trading hyperbole about the economic impact of the bill .
Democrats , including President Barack Obama , have been calling it a green jobs bill .
Republicans have been calling it " economic suicide . "
In fact , it was sometimes difficult to tell that the debate was actually about a bill to " put a price " on the carbon dioxide emissions that scientists believe cause global warming .
Here 's the basic idea : by making burning coal , natural gas and other fossil fuels more expensive , the legislation will make renewable energy sources like wind and solar power more attractive .
The bill 's details have caused consternation among some environmentalists , but if the chatter from Silicon Valley is any indication , the legislation 's broad stroke actions will stimulate low - carbon energy technological innovation , which would be good news for green tech startups .
" We endorse putting a cap on carbon emissions , " wrote John Doerr , a partner at Kleiner , Perkins , Caufield & Byers , a venture capital firm with dozens of green tech investments , in a memo to the president .
" It alone can not solve all our problems , and it must include other provisions to make it economically viable and to help smooth the transition , but it is the most important step in a coherent strategy for curtailing emissions . "
The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that the net cost of the legislation in 2020 per American household will be about $ 175 , although that could fluctuate as the details shift as the legislation makes its way out of the House — it is expected to pass today — and onto the Senate .
The Environmental Protection Agency analysisfound that the bill , because of its energy efficiency provisions , could save Americans money on their utility bills .
Advocates of the bill — and climate legislation , in general — say that taxing carbon more accurately reflects the all - in cost of burning fossil fuels , which includes resulting climate change .
In recent months , left - leaning thinkers have taken to calling this " closing the carbon pollution loophole . "
While the bill is historic , the government has long used regulations , subsidies , and direct R&D funding to change the country 's energy mix .
Nuclear power generation received tens of billions of dollars in Federal R&D money and tens of billions more in subsidies and loan guarantees .
Oil and coal exploration and mining have been and continue to be supported by government surveys of mineral resources .
Indirect subsidies abound , too .
A recent RAND study estimated that the 12 - 15 percent of the military budget could be saved if we relied less on oil from the Persian Gulf .
Commonly referred to as the Waxman - Markey bill , after the original Democratic sponsors Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachussets , the legislation has been the subject of aggressive attacks by both right - and left - wing groups .
Right - wing groups like the Heritage Foundation say the bill will cripple the American economy .
They point out that the bill will effectively raise the price of carbon , and because the vast majority of our electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels , the cost of electricity is likely to rise , at least in the near - term .
Left - leaning environmental groups say the bill does n't go nearly far enough to combat climate change , particularly in the next decade .
They also are n't happy that the utilities will receive their carbon permits for free .
Many were pushing for 100 percent auctions , with the money refunded to taxpayers or used to support alternative energy R&D .
While both sides seem to have very specific projections about the costs of the bill 10 years in the future , all numbers should be viewed skeptically .
It 's very difficult to predict what the price of fossil fuels will be three years out , let alone 10 .
For example , if global oil and natural gas prices spike — and this bill has generated substantial investments in alternatives — then it will seem like a great idea , regardless of the legislation 's impact on the country 's carbon dioxide emissions .
That level of uncertainty could be carried across the rest of the bill .
One major argument in favor of passing the climate bill is that it will make international climate negotiations in Copenhagen later this year easier .
If the U.S. is leading on the issue , China and India could institute greenhouse gas curbs of their own .
The legislation uses a cap - and - trade mechanism in which the level of carbon dioxide emissions is capped and permits for that amount of CO2 are distributed to fossil fuel burners .
Most of the permits in the current version of the document will be given to utilities and other fossil fuel users .
The remainder will be auctioned .
Many on the left had wanted to see all of the tradeable permits auctioned .

The Federal Trade Commission has launched a probe into whether there 's any antitrust funny business going on between Google and Apple .
The two companies share two board members , which the FTC suspects may be reducing competition between them .
Both Apple and Google have been made aware of the investigation already , though neither has commented publicly on it .
Google and Apple may have started out in very different industries , but the two companies have slowly become both partners and competitors .
Google continues to partner with Apple in creating and maintaining Google Maps for the iPhone , for example , but the advent of Android has pitted the two companies against each other in the mobile space .
That 's in addition to the availability of Safari and Chrome as competing Web browsers , too .
This has apparently come to the attention of the FTC , according to unnamed sources speaking to the New York Times .
The two board members in question are Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson , and thanks to the Clayton Antitrust Act , an individual cannot sit on the board of two competing companies if it might reduce competition between them .
Whether the two members ' presence on both boards has indeed reduced competition is difficult to say , although the investigation comes just a couple of months after rumors broke that Google allegedly agreed not to use multitouch on the Android - capable G1 at Apple 's request .
The investigation is reportedly in the early stages , so it may not turn out to be the drama bomb that some are expecting .
However , if the FTC feels as if the " interlocking directorates " are causing a problem , Schmidt and Levinson could be forced to resign from one board or another ( presumably , Schmidt would resign from Apple's ) .
Agency calls for urgent international action to help civilians as military operations spread
Atrocities are being committed against villagers in remote areas of Eastern Congo , where fighting between the Congolese army and the FDLR rebel group continues , said international agency Oxfam today .
On a recent field visit to Lubero territory in North Kivu , where Oxfam has increased its emergency operations due to the renewed fighting , villagers reported that several thousand houses have been deliberately burned since military operations began in January .
In the past week alone , at least 250 more homes were set ablaze .
Marcel Stoessel , Head of Oxfam in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , who just came back from the conflict zone , said : " There is nowhere that is safe in the area I visited .
Villagers are being forced to flee , some for the fifth or sixth time , losing family members on the way .
Women are being raped and abused .
People have been looted of the few possessions they owned , and have had their houses burned to the ground - all of this is happening as we speak , but the world is looking away .
" The stories I heard are heartbreaking .
A woman told me how she witnessed a brutal gang rape of a neighbour by three armed men .
She thinks the victim must have died afterwards .
She ran away with her children , but her husband ran in another direction .
She does not know where he is . "
At least 250,000 people have been forced to leave their homes since January .
Oxfam is alarmed about the lack of protection of civilians in their home villages , but also about their safety in the towns they fled to , where armed men are also carrying out serious abuses .
There are not enough UN peacekeepers patrolling the areas affected by the new violence , leaving civilians feeling scared and vulnerable .
While there are around 17,500 MONUC peacekeepers in the country , the force has very little visible presence in the areas to which people have fled .
" Communities tell us that they would like to see more peacekeepers patrolling the areas on foot , so that they feel safer " , said Stoessel .
Oxfam called on MONUC to ensure that its resources are deployed in areas where they can best protect people at risk .
Oxfam this month significantly scaled up its life - saving emergency response by providing clean water , sanitation , and carrying out crucial hygiene promotion activities .
Up to 150,000 additional people will benefit from this assistance .
With the military operations against the FDLR now expanding to South Kivu , Oxfam is also concerned for civilians there , with initial reports of thousands of people already fleeing in anticipation of increased violence and attacks .
Oxfam has opened a new rapid response office in Bukavu , South Kivu , to be prepared for possible humanitarian fallout .
" What we have seen in North Kivu sets a terrible precedent for what may happen in South Kivu " , said Stoessel .
" Oxfam calls on all parties to the conflict , including the Government , to respect the life , dignity and property of civilians . "

2. On January 20 , the Rwandan and Congolese army , and the CNDP militia , began a joint offensive to disarm the FDLR rebel group by force .
The Rwandan army left eastern DR Congo at the end of February this year .
As a result the FDLR has since launched violent attacks on civilian villages .
3 Late last year over 250,000 people were displaced in fighting between the Congolese government and CNDP rebel group .
4 . Other areas of Eastern Congo , such as in Haut Uélé and Ituri in the far north east of Congo , are also plagued by violence .
Fighting between government forces and the LRA rebel group in the Haut Uélé has displaced over 190,000 people since December , according to UN figures .
The LRA has killed at least 700 people and kidnapped over 300 people , many of them children .
In Ituri , early reports indicate that fighting between the FPJC and FRPI rebels and the government army last week has displaced tens of thousands of people .

REAL reporting is easy .
Making the news up is much harder .
So the weekly editorial meeting at the Onion , a spoof newspaper based in New York , is intense .
One writer clutches a human skull .
Another wields a threatening stick .
Yet another walks in late , looking scruffy and eating a chocolate cereal bar .
Alert readers would recognise him as the cover model for a feature in 2006 on “ Heterosexual Men 's Fashion ” .
Someone hands round a list of 124 bogus headlines , all written in the sombre style of the New York Times .
After two hours of raucous banter , the list is winnowed to a dozen .
At a second meeting , the chosen headlines are fleshed out and writers are assigned to turn them into stories .
Recent gems include “ Detroit Mayor Throws First Brick in Glass - Breaking Ceremony for New Slum ” and “ Hero Woman Changes in Front of Open Window ” .
Alas , Lexington is not at liberty to disclose next week 's fake news .
But the headlines that were scrapped are not bad .
An opinion piece by Barack Obama , for example , is entitled “ Should You Ever Feel Despair , Simply Remember How Eloquent I Am ” .
The real Mr Obama baffles other comedians .
David Letterman , a talk - show host , describes him as “ cogent , eloquent , and in complete command of the issues ” and sighs : “ What the hell am I supposed to do with that ? ”
The new president is “ not fat , not cheating on his wife , not stupid , not angry and not a phoney ” , complains Bill Maher , another small - screen joker .
Chris Rock , a stand - up comic , likens Mr Obama to Brad Pitt .
“ There 's no Brad Pitt jokes , ” he told CNN .
“ You know , what are you going to say ?
‘ Ooh , you used to have sex with Jennifer Aniston .
Now you have sex with Angelina Jolie .
You 're such a loser ' . ”
At the White House correspondents ' dinner this month , Mr Obama was the guest of honour .
The traditional task of roasting him fell to Wanda Sykes , a comedienne .
Visibly star - struck , she ignored the crowd and addressed herself to the president , who was sitting nearby .
She teased him for looking handsome with his shirt off , and saved her venom for his critics .
Of Rush Limbaugh , a conservative talk - radio star , she said : “ I hope his kidneys fail . ”
On hearing her routine , Christopher Hitchens , a polemicist , remarked that “ when comedians flatter the president , they become court jesters , and the country becomes a banana republic . ”
Mr Obama himself can be pretty amusing .
His speechwriters are skilful and he delivers punchlines with a certain deadpan panache .
Discussing his plans for his second 100 days in office , for example , he promised to “ design , build and open a library dedicated to my first 100 days ” , and to “ strongly consider losing my cool ” .
One can't help noticing that when Mr Obama mocks himself , he mocks himself for being super - human .
Conservative satirists would love to toss some kryptonite at him , but he is a slippery target .
His race makes some cautious , for a start .
And anti-Obama jokes on the internet are pathetic .
Most sound bitter rather than witty .
For example : “ Why did Barack Obama cross the road ?
Answer :
To help the other side . ”
Conservative cartoonists are struggling to pierce Mr Obama 's armour .
Sometimes the best they can do is to suggest that , in time , he will not look so impressive .
For example , Scott Stantis , a cartoonist for the Birmingham News of Alabama , drew a picture of a big ugly monster labelled “ The blame ” inching towards the desk in the Oval Office .
“ Is that thing getting closer ? ” asks Mr Obama .
Liberal satirists feel they ought to goad the powerful , but it no longer comes naturally now that George Bush has buzzed back to Texas .
Sometimes they mock Mr Obama for not quite living up to their colossal expectations .
Jon Stewart , a satirical television pundit , ribs the new president for failing to distinguish himself from Mr Bush as quickly and completely as Mr Stewart would like him to .
For example , Mr Obama has not yet stopped the armed forces from discharging soldiers — including Arabic - speakers — for being gay .
So it was OK to waterboard a terrorist over 80 times , fumed Mr Stewart , but not OK that the soldier who could actually understand him should have a boyfriend .
Black Man gets Worst Job
The writers of the Onion are unencumbered by any obvious party loyalty .
To fit in , you have to hate everything around you , muses Joe Randazzo , the editor .
Hence the headline that greeted Mr Obama 's election victory : “ Black Man Given Nation 's Worst Job ” .
The Onion News Network , an online video venture , did a segment entitled “ Obama Win Causes Obsessive Supporters to Realise How Empty Their Lives Are ” .
The camera showed pitiful young campaign volunteers lying comatose on a couch or wandering aimlessly through a park .
“ Who will take care of these people ? ” asked the anchor .
“ We really do n't know .
Many have already driven away their friends and family with months of endless praise for Obama 's latest speech and constant reminders to vote , ” said the breathless correspondent on the scene .
“ That does sound annoying , ” said the anchor .
The Onion lampooned previous presidents , of course .
No prizes for guessing who inspired the headline “ New President Feels Nation 's Pain , Breasts ” , or who regaled dinner guests with an impromptu oration on Virgil 's minor works .
What sets the Onion apart , however , is that Mr Obama has not blunted its barbs at all .
On the contrary , the way more serious journalists fawn over the new president offers an irresistible target .
“ Media Having Trouble Finding Right Angle on Obama 's Double Homicide ” , the Onion reported last month .
“ ‘ I know there 's a story in there somewhere ' , ” said the editor of Newsweek , after Mr Obama brutally murdered a suburban couple .
The Onion is better at spotting good yarns , which is why , despite the recession , it is prospering .
The main threats it faces are that its staff might grow up — or that the earnest papers it parodies may go out of business .
Automatic teller machines ( ATMs ) — 500 of them — dispensing pieces of gold will be available around Germany , Switzerland and Austria by the end of this year .
That at least is the plan of German precious metals online trading company TG - Gold - Super -Markt.de .
The ATMs , to be located at airports , railway stations and shopping malls , are intended to accustom ordinary people to the idea of investing in a physical asset such as gold , the thinking goes .
Thomas Geissler , the company ’s chief executive , said the gold ATMs might even improve relations between the sexes .
“ I have yet to meet a woman who does not like a gift of gold .
It ’s better than flowers .
Flowers are more expensive .
They wilt and you ( as a man ) do n’t get as many points at home as if you bring gold , ” he said .
A prototype ATM on display for a one - day marketing test at the main railway station in Frankfurt , Germany ’s financial capital , did indeed reward your correspondent with a 1 - gramme ( 0.0353 ounce ) piece of gold .
It cost the equivalent of $ 42.25 — a 30 percent premium over the spot market price .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
As street protests and voter skepticism rose over Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's election victory , the incumbent leader hailed the vote , saying it was a " great ordeal " but one that pointed " the way to the future . "
Moussavi supporters run past a burning bus in Tehran on Saturday .

" The people of Iran inspired hope for all nations and created a source of pride in the nation and disappointed all the ill wishers , " Ahmadinejad said in a nationwide TV address Saturday night .
" This election was held at a juncture of history . "
The government said on Saturday that Ahmadinejad won Friday 's presidential election with 62.63 percent of the vote and Mir Hossein Moussavi received 33.75 percent of the vote .
But while he extolled the result and the huge turnout , Moussavi and supporters in the Tehran streets are crying foul as street clashes have erupted in the aftermath of the polls .
Reaction emerged across the world , as countries such as the United States and Canada voiced concern over claims of voter irregularities .
The ongoing street protests have been viewed as remarkable in a country where anti-government sentiment is not looked upon kindly by those in power .
In the aftermath of the vote , street protesters and riot police engaged in running battles , with stones thrown , garbage cans set on fire and people shouting " death to the dictatorship . "
Watch angry protesters take to streets »
People leaned out of windows and balconies to watch the throngs of protesters march , many of whom were Moussavi supporters and conducted largely noisy but peaceful demonstrations .
Later in the evening , an agitated and angry crowd emerged in Tehran 's Moseni Square , with people breaking into shops , starting fires and tearing down signs .
Two sides of people faced off against each other in the square , throwing rocks and bottles and shouting angrily .
Observers believe the two sides could be supporters of Ahmadinejad on the one , and Moussavi on the other .
Before the vote count ended , Moussavi issued a sharply worded letter urging the counting to stop because of " blatant violations " and lashed out at what he indicated was an unfair process .
Moussavi said the results from " untrustworthy monitors " reflects " the weakening of the pillars that constitute the sacred system " of Iran and " the rule of authoritarianism and tyranny . "
Independent vote monitors were banned from polling places .
" The results announced for the 10th presidential elections are astonishing .
People who stood in long lines and knew well who they voted for were utterly surprised by the magicians working at the television and radio broadcasting , " Moussavi said in his statement .
Iran , he said , " belongs to the people and not cheaters . "
But Ahmadinejad said " it was clear what a majority people wanted . "
" The elections in Iran are really important .
Election means consensus of all people 's resolve and their crystallization of their demands and their wants , and it's a leap toward high peaks of aspiration and progress .
Elections in Iran are totally popular - based move that belongs to the people with a look at the future , aimed at constructing the future . "
He indicated progress through consensus , saying economic and infrastructure reforms can be accomplished in Iran through a collective process .
" All of us can join forces , " he said .
Analysts expected Moussavi , widely regarded as a reformist , to do well .
After a presidential debate between Moussavi and Ahmadinejad riveted the nation , Moussavi 's campaign caught fire in recent days , triggering massive street rallies in Tehran .
What officials have called an unprecedented voter turnout at the polls Friday had been expected to boost Moussavi 's chances of winning the presidency .
But Ahmadinejad -- despite being blamed for Iran 's economic turmoil over the past four years -- maintains staunch support in rural areas .
Watch as Ahmadinejad is declared the winner »
The voter turnout surpassed 80 percent , at least two officials said on Saturday .
Iran 's Interior Minister Seyed Sadeq Mahsouli said 85 percent of the country 's 46 million eligible voters had gone to the polls Friday .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei lauded the " epic " event .
" The 12 June election was an artistic expression of the nation , which created a new advancement in the history of elections in the country , " Khamenei said .
" The over 80 percent participation of the people and the 24 million votes cast for the president - elect is a real celebration which with the power of almighty God can guarantee the development , progress , national security , and the joy and excitement of the nation . "
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the level of participation of Iranians who reside abroad increased 300 percent in the election , Iranian media said .
Moussavi was the main challenger among three candidates who had been vying to replace Ahmadinejad .
The others were hard - liner Mohsen Rezaie , the former head of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards and former parliament speaker and reformist Mehdi Karrubi , who called the declared results of the elections are a " joke " and " astonishing . "
Technology has been a key tactic in politically mobilizing young people in Iran , but text messaging has not been working in Iran over recent days .
However , Iranian protesters still arrived en masse at meeting places around Tehran on Saturday .
Watch CNN review the unprecedented online presence of candidates »
Khamenei indicated that Iranians should take a deep breath in the aftermath of the vote .
" The Saturday after the election should always be a day of affection and patience , " he said .
" Both the supporters of the elected candidate and the supporters of other respectable candidates should refrain from making any provocative and doubtful behavior .
The respectable president - elect is the president of all the people of Iran and everybody , including yesterday 's rivals , should protect and help him . "
CNN 's Eve Bower , Christiane Amanpour , Samson Desta , and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report .

In a mock debate focused on the rich Internet application development realm , AJAX was pitted against Sun Microsystems ' JavaFX Friday , with proponents for both technologies pointing up their entrant 's high points and the low points of their rival .
A session at the JavaOne conference in San Francisco had the co-founders of the Ajaxian Web site for AJAX technologies squaring off , with Ben Galbraith playing the part of the JavaFX advocate and Dion Almaer serving as AJAX 's proponent .
Both serve as co-directors of developer tools at Mozilla .
While Galbraith and Almaer are obviously geared toward AJAX , Galbraith said he also has experience consulting on Java .
" JavaFX is built on top of an incredibly mature runtime that gives you amazing performance , " as well great features , and [ Oracle CEO ] Larry Ellison , Galbraith said , giving a humorous nod to Oracle 's plans to buy Java founder Sun Microsystems .
[ For more info on rich Internet application platforms , check out " Not your father 's Web : The year in RIAs " |
Also check out other news from JavaOne . ]
Almaer focused on AJAX being synonymous with the Web .
" It 's all Web stuff that 's going on , " he said .
The two went back and forth , measuring factors such as graphics performance , language capabilities , and tools .
" Today 's JavaScript runtimes are just pitiful , " Galbraith said , and the Web is slow , he added .
Java also has a more sophisticated API , he argued .
But Almaer countered , " We have a very simple API .
I consider that a feature . "
Almaer also advocated the performance of the Google Chrome browser , prompting Galbraith to ask how many people actually use Chrome .
In the graphics space , JavaFX and Java outpace AJAX " by a huge margin , " Galibraith said .
Almaer promoted the Canvas graphical technology for browsers .
Google 's new O3D technology also boosts 3D rendering on browsers , said Almaer .
Video , Galbraith said , is " an area [ where ]
I 'm pleased to say JavaFX is also leading the way . "
But citing YouTube as a successful Web video venture , Almaer said rich video already is possible now on the Web through mediums such as Flash .
In addition , HTML 5 also supports video and is backed by Mozilla , he said .
Almaer asked why JavaFX needed its own language , ( JavaFX Script ) , rather than using something already available , such as Groovy .
" You have to invent yet another language , " Almaer said .
JavaScript far outpaces JavaFX when it comes to available components , he said .
" In our world of JavaScript , you 've of course got millions of components , " said Almaer .
Galbraith pointed out there have been issues with CSS , which is used with JavaScript .
He did this by showing a coffee cup , with a box showing the words " CSS is awesome , " with the word , awesome , over - running the lines of the box .
Galbraith said Java has an advantage in tools .
" Come on , you 've got nothing for tools that can even come close to the Java platform , " he said .
But Almaer countered that there are many single - purpose tools on the Web for AJAX .
He also promoted Mozilla 's Jetpack technology for extending browsers and building Web pages .
While Java offers a single , consistent platform , the Web offers a " nightmare of compatibility problems , " with multiple browsers pervasive , said Galbraith .
Almaer cited Internet Explorer 7 as having the most share , followed by Mozilla Firefox and some Webkit - based browsers .
Web technologists do not want a dominant player and can leverage open source software while JavaFX users must wait for the JavaFX team if they want a feature , he said .
Almaer also argued while that Java for the Mac is a variation , but Galbraith said Java on the Mac is consistent with Java 1.5 on Windows .

What is the essence of the problem with our financial system – what brought us into deep crisis , what scared us most in September / October of last year , and what was the toughest problem in the early days of the Obama administration ?
The issue was definitely not that banks and nonbanks could fail in general .
We ’re good at handling some kinds of financial failure .
The problem was : a relatively small number of troubled banks were so large that their failure could imperil both our financial system and the world economy .
And – at least in the view of Treasury – these banks were so large that they could n’t be taken over in a normal FDIC - type receivership .
( The notion that the government lacked legal authority to act is smokescreen ; please tell me which statute authorized the removal of Rick Waggoner from GM . )
But instead of defining this core problem , explaining its origins , emphasizing the dangers , and addressing it directly , what do we get in yesterday ’s 101 pages of regulatory reform proposals ?
A passive voice throughout the explanation of what happened ( e.g. , this preamble ) .
No one did anything wrong and banks , in particular , are absolved from all responsibility for what has transpired .
A Financial Services Oversight Council , which sounds like a recipe for interagency feuding , with the Treasury as the referee and – most important – provider of the staff .
The bureaucratic principle is : if you hold the pen , you have the power .
Some of the largest banks ( “ Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies ” , or Tier 1 FHCs ) will now be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board – although under the confusing jurisdiction also of the Financial Services Oversight Council in many regards ( e.g. , in the key setting of material prudential standards ) and subsidiaries can have other regulators .
Tier 1 FHC should have higher prudential standards ( capital , liquidity and risk management ) , but “ given the important role of Tier 1 FHCs in the financial system and the economy , setting their prudential standards too high could constrain long - term financial and economic development . ”
Sounds like a banker drafted that sentence .
None of the important details / numbers are specified , although the Fed should use “ severe stress scenarios ” to assess capital adequacy .
Is that the same kind of actually - quite - mild stress scenario they used earlier this year ?
In terms of risk management , “ Tier 1 FHCs must be able to identify aggregate exposures quickly on a firm - wide basis . ”
There is no notion here that risk management at these big banks has failed completely and repeatedly over the past two years .
How exactly will FHCs be able to identify such risks and how will the Fed ( or anyone else ) assess such identification ?
In case you were n’t sufficiently confused by the overlapping regulatory authorities in this plan , we ’ll also get a National Bank Supervisor ( NBS ) within Treasury .
Regulatory arbitrage is not gone , just relabeled ( slightly ) .
There is no greater transparency or public accountability in the regulatory process .
We still will not know exactly what regulators decided and on what basis .
Such secrecy , at this stage in our financial history , clearly prevents proper governance of our supervisory system .
There appears to be no mention that corporate governance within these large banks failed totally .
How on earth can you expect these banks to operate in a responsible manner unless and until you address the reckless manner in which they ( a ) compensate themselves , ( b ) destroy shareholder value , ( c ) treat boards of directors as toothless wonders ?
The profound silence on this point from the administration – including some of our finest economic , financial , and legal thinkers – is breathtaking .
There ’s of course more in these proposals , which I review elsewhere and Secretary Geithner ’s appearances on Capitol Hill today may be informative – although only if his definition of the underlying “ too big to fail ” issue uses much stronger language than yesterday ’s written proposals .
But based on what we see so far , there is little reason to be encouraged .
The reform process appears to be have been captured at an early stage – by design the lobbyists were let into the executive branch ’s working , so we do n’t even get to have a transparent debate or to hear specious arguments about why we really need big banks .
Writing in the New York Times today , Joe Nocera sums up , “ If Mr. Obama hopes to create a regulatory environment that stands for another six decades , he is going to have to do what Roosevelt did once upon a time .
He is going to have make some bankers mad . ”
Good point – but Nocera is thinking about the wrong Roosevelt ( FDR ) .
In order to get to the point where you can reform like FDR , you first have to break the political power of the big banks , and that requires substantially reducing their economic power – the moment calls more for Teddy Roosevelt - type trustbusting , and it appears that is exactly what we will not get .

GMAT Score Format
The GMAT is held by the Pearson VUE based in US under the supervision of GMAC ( Graduate Management Admission Council ) to secure admission in business and management schools .
About 900 business schools across the globe accept the GMAT test scores .
The GMAT exam yields four scores : Verbal , Quantitative , Total , and Analytical Writing Assessment , which are reflected in your score report .
Each score is reported on a fixed scale and will appear on the official GMAT score reports that you and your designated score recipients ( graduate management programs ) receive .
Your score report includes all GMAT scores from tests taken in the last five ( 5 ) years .
The contact and demographic information that was required for you to register for the test will also appear on your score report .
GMAT Score Format
An official GMAT score report consists of four parts : Verbal Scaled Score ( on a scale from 0 to 60 ) ; Quantitative Scaled Score ( on a scale from 0 to 60 ) , Total Scaled Score ( on a scale from 200 to 800 ) , Analytical Writing Assessment ( AWA ) Score ( on a scale from 0 to 6 ) .
The total score is a scaled combination of the verbal and quantitative scaled scores , and thus reflects a student ’s overall performance on the multiple choice sections of the test .
The AWA score is independent of and has no impact on the total scaled score .
Applicants can access GMAT scores electronically or receive paper reports - they ’re sent to the test taker and score - report recipients selected by the test taker within three weeks of the test date .
The score report will show all of the test taker ’s GMAT scores for the past five years .
Test takers may print an Unofficial Score Report after they finish the exam , but this does not include the AWA score and will not be accepted in lieu of an Official Score Report .
The Verbal and Quantitative scores range from 0 to 60 .
Scores below 9 and above 44 for the Verbal section or below 7 and above 50 for the Quantitative section are rare .
Total GMAT scores range from 200 to 800 .
Two - thirds of test takers score between 400 and 600 .
The AWA score is an average of the two independent ratings for each section : Analysis of an Issue and the Analysis of an Argument .
These average scores can range from 0 to 6 in half point intervals .
Writing scores are computed separately from the scores for the multiple - choice sections of the test and have no effect on the Verbal , Quantitative , or Total scores .
The GMAT score reports include the following background information : Country of citizenship , Gender , Date of birth , Telephone number , Undergraduate institution , grade point average ( GPA ) , major , and date of graduation , intended graduate study , highest level of education attained .
Next Generation GMAT Score Format
The GMAT stands for Graduate Management Admission Test and is required to secure admission to management programs in Canada , US and other parts of the world .
It is a multiple choice based test conducted in English .
Today ’s businesses and organizations demand managers who can make sound decisions , discern patterns , and combine verbal and quantitative reasoning to solve problems .
The Integrated Reasoning section will measure these skills .
On June 5 , 2012 , the GMAT ® exam will introduce Integrated Reasoning , a new section designed to measure your ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources – skills that you already use , and skills that you need to succeed in our data - rich world .
GMAT Exam Format
The GMAT exam will remain 3 hours , 30 minutes ( four hours with breaks ) .
The Analytical Writing Assessment will be streamlined from two 30 - minute essays to one Analysis of an Argument essay .
Immediately after the essay question , the Integrated Reasoning section will start .
Test takers will have optional breaks before and after the Quantitative sections :
The GMAT Verbal , Quantitative , AWA , and Total scores will not change .
The Analytical Writing Assessment will consist of one 30 - minute essay ( Analysis of an Argument ) rather than two .
The Integrated Reasoning section will have 12 questions .
Test takers will receive a separate score for the Integrated Reasoning section .
Like the AWA score , the Integrated Reasoning score will not count toward the Total Score .
For more than 50 years , the GMAT exam has kept pace with these changes to help schools find the right students , and help students find the right schools .
The skills being tested by the Integrated Reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for todayâs incoming students .
The Integrated Reasoning score will provide a new data point for schools to find the right candidates for their programs , and for you to stand out .
Britain was once famous for its unarmed and relatively restrained police force , but the death of a man at last week 's G20 protests in London has brought into focus serious concerns with a new aggressive form of policing .
Former police chief Andy Hayman today warned that " If left unchecked , we have a more violent crowd in uniform than the one demonstrating . "
Here I give my account of the protests and the police tactics used .
This article was written several days prior to the release of the video showing Ian Tomlinson , the man who died at the protests , being beaten and pushed by a baton - wielding policeman shortly before his death .
Does Britain now have an aggressive system of policing that undermines the country 's democratic traditions by systematically intimidating and closing down any protest it does not consider ‘ safe ' ?
The way that the G20 protests were managed suggests that we do .
In particular the policy of " kettling " is a deliberate form of indiscriminate , collective punishment of demonstrators committed to peaceful protest , which seems designed to frighten people from expressing their disapproval of a system that is now , even by its own admission , dysfunctional .
The development is part of a wider pattern of state authoritarianism not to speak of out - of - control policing .
I was present in the City of London throughout Wednesday 's events .
Here I give my account of the protests , and an overview of the reports about them , with some ideas on how we can re-claim our liberty from those who would undermine it through fear and bullying .
Since Wednesday April 1st there have been several first - hand accounts by protestors of the heavy handidness and , in many cases , brutality of the police 's approach to the protests at the Bank of England and Climate Camp .
These have helped counter some of the all too predictable smears coming from sections of the mainstream media .
There is now a strong case which says that not only did the police action raise serious civil liberties concerns ; it was counter - productive , provoking violence and endangering the safety of peaceful protestors .
The day started well enough .
At 11 am my friend Andreas and I gathered at Moorgate station in the warm sunshine with around two hundred other protestors .
Together we followed the " Red horse " ( representing war ) down to the Bank of England where we were joined by my friends Clare and Tony who were part of groups following the other three " horsemen of the apocalypse " - the Green horse against climate chaos , the Silver horse against financial crimes and the Black horse against land enclosures .
People were angry , as you 'd expect , but the atmosphere outside the Bank of England was generally peaceful and good spirited .
There were cheers as the four horses were paraded on the steps of the bank and we heard impromptu speeches denouncing bankers and politicians from the recently suspended anarchist Professor Chris Knight and a woman in a rabbit costume .
As others have testified , the atmosphere really started to turn sour around one o'clock when the police strategy became clear .
Under this strategy , known as " kettling " , protestors are kept penned into an area by walls of armed policemen standing shoulder to shoulder .
No one is allowed to enter or leave the area for an undesignated time period and protestors are left without food , water and ( worst of all ) toilet access .
One officer informed Andreas , who was trying to leave the demonstration at 1 pm to get to work , that the earliest he could expect to get out was 7 pm .
The officer said that as they were expecting a " breach of the peace " they would shut down the whole area and would only let people leave once they had recorded everyone 's details ( which will doubtless be stored on the police 's illegal intelligence database along with thousands of other innocent activists ) .
There was no reasoning with the police , such as saying " Excuse me , I 'd like to leave to go about my business before there is a breach of the peace " .
It was obvious to everyone there that this strategy has been decided by senior commanders and was going to be imposed no matter what happened ( the experience of trying to reason with over - zealous riot police is well - described in an article by Peter Hitchens who was caught up in a " human sweeping machine " screaming " It 's not debateable ! " at him having stumbled into protests outside the Israeli embassy in January on his way home from work ) .
As Sunny Hundal put it , the Police " predicted trouble and then created the conditions for it . "
All protestors were now being treated like criminals with the predictable result that many became frustrated and sympathetic to the actions of the minority who had come to cause trouble , offering cover for their activities through the sheer numbers pushing against police lines .
It was only after the kettling began that the police barrier by RBS was broken and the branch had its windows smashed and computers stolen by a few masked anarchists .
The attack seemed at the time more like a stage - managed photo op than a spontaneous outburst of violence , something also observed by those who watched it on television , it was pure spectacle ( it was noticeable that RBS 's windows were n't boarded up like the others , despite being right next to the Bank of England ) .
I could n't help feeling that elements from all three groups present had willed the RBS moment to happen and were relieved when the branch 's glass exterior was finally breached - the protestors angry at the banks , the media who got the images for the storyline they wanted , and the police who had been talking up the threat of violence for weeks and now had a justification for their enormous expenditures and intimidating behaviour .
Not long after the raid on RBS , a police line on Threadneedle street on the other side of the enclosure was successfully challenged by a surge of protestors .
Andreas managed to escape before the police re-grouped to seal off the new shape of the protest with their own new enclosure , whilst Tony , Clare and I headed with the main group along to HSBC .
Over the next few hours a game of cat and mouse ensued with police and protestors moving from street to street .
The police would divide up the crowds of protestors into ever smaller holding pens and when they were inevitably challenged by people frustrated by trying to get out they would push them with their shields and beat them with their truncheons .
Every now and then without warning they would advance aggressively on the protestors who would scatter and then re-group to challenge the police lines anew .
I later heard the group outside HSBC described in the media as the " hard - core " element .
I saw plenty of fellow protestors with bloody skulls and I even saw one young girl being carried away unconscious from the front line , yet I saw very few protestors strike back .
There were a minority throwing cans and other objects but most were remarkably restrained given the provocation .
Neither did I witness much violence directed against property .
To great cheers , the anarchist flag was raised up the flag pole of an office block opposite HSBC but I saw no attempts to vandalise the building or the bank .
Around 4:30 pm we managed to escape through a hole in a bush next to police lines before they had the chance to seal it off .
We found our way to the nearest pub near Cannon Street station for a much - needed toilet break .
After stopping for some food and drink we headed to down to check out Climate Camp outside the Carbon Exchange on Bishopsgate .
Here the atmosphere was peaceful and relaxed with a festival - like vibe .
Tents were set up in the road and cheerful protestors , mostly , like me , still under 25 , were sat around holding workshops on climate change , meditating and listening to music .
The camp was surrounded by police but they seemed much less tense than those by the Bank of England and they let us into the camp without any hassle .
We decided to spend the evening in the camp and headed to the shops in Spitafields in search of supplies .
When we came back 45 minutes later the whole camp was under siege , the entrances blocked by riot vans and rows of police .
Not only had they sealed off the perimeters of the camp , refusing to let anyone in or out , they were creating holding pens within the camp itself , dividing it up into ever - smaller sections .
I could see no other purpose to the siege other than to provoke and intimidate peaceful protestors .
If the police wanted to clear the area it would have made sense for them not to let people in , but why would they refuse to let people out unless their aim was to stir up a reaction ?
From outside the camp looking in we could see young people , hands in the air to show they were non-violent , being pushed around and in some cases beaten by police .
According to reports from inside the camp the officers carrying out the beatings were covering their ID badges so they could n't be identified .
As well as violence and intimidation , the protestors in the enclosures , including women , had to suffer the indignity of urinating in public .
I challenged an officer as to why they were doing this when the camp had been entirely peaceful .
All he could say was that an " offence " had taken place , refusing to say what .
After hanging out in the friendly squat on Earl Street , dubbed the " convergence centre " , we returned to Bishopsgate around 10.30 pm to see if the siege of the camp was still going on ( I was later sorry to learn that the squat was raided the next day at noon by dozens of police officers in full riot gear and allegedly carrying tasers .
All the occupants were apparently cuffed , searched and made to sit outside on the pavement for some time ) .
As we made our way back to the camp several of our group were searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act .
By this point the media had left and the police were clearing the streets , charging at protesters with shields and batons .
One of our group , who had n't been walking away fast enough for the police 's liking , was screamed at and repeatedly beaten with a truncheon .
Most of the violence I saw was being committed by a small minority with the majority showing considerable restraint under intense provocation from the police .
One amusing incident illustrates this .
A young German anarchist tried to get the crowd of thirty fleeing protestors pumped up .
He grabbed a litter bin declaring that that there needed to be a stand , and used his lighter to set fire to the contents which he then dramatically tipped ontothe road making a small firey barricade .
He was immediately reproached by his fellow protestors .
" You 're ruining it for everyone " said a young couple , who immediately proceeded to stamp out the flames out with their feet .
" Come on guys ! " he shouted , " What are you doing ?
Let 's burn this city down ! "
As his desperate provocation was extinguished by his fellow protestors he left in disgust , presumably to Strasbourg .
When the news broke that a 47 year old man , Ian Tomlinson , had died tragically in a police kettle , the media were quick to swallow the line fed to them by the Met that police medics had been pelted with bottles when trying to help ( the Evening Standard made the inflammatory claim that they were " pelted with bricks " before having to withdraw it from their website ) .
This conflicts with eye witness statements which say that the collapsed man was being given first aid by a protestor who was pushed away and told to get out by police who refused to speak to the ambulance the protestors had on the phone .
All of the witnesses deny the allegation that missiles were thrown at the medics .
The Observer has now reported that he was directly assaulted by the police .
We need an independent public inquiry into the death of Ian Tomlinson to establish the circumstances of his death .
Serious questions also need to be asked about the practice of kettling itself .
In my experience it is a form of collective punishment for participating in a lawful protest .
Astonishingly , the practice itself was recently declared to be lawful by the Law Lords after it was challenged under the Human Rights Act , by a protestor and an innocent bystander who were caught in a police cordon for seven hours in bad weather and with no access to toilet facilities at the anti-capitalist protests on May 1st 2001 .
Lord
Hope ruled that the police 's use of containment in these circumstances , which amounts to a deprivation of liberty , is justified by the " interests of public safety .
The case is now being taken to the European Court of Human Rights who it is hoped will overturn this dubious judgement and rule in favour of fundamental rights .
Writing on the Guardian 's liberty central ( which has provided excellent coverage of the protets ) , John O'Connor , a former commander at Scotland Yard , attempted to mount a defence of kettling .
O'Connor did n't engage with the human rights objections at all , instead claiming that " massive overkill results in less injury and damage to property " .
Counter - terrorism powers and the use of kettling have no doubt made life " much easier " for police chiefs , as O'Connor , says , but then again so would banning protest all together .
The police have developed a brutal method to contain peaceful protestors , discouraging ordinary people from exercising their democratic rights .
If we value democracy then we 're going to have to challenge the culture of fear - mongering perpetuated by politicians and the police with the help of a compliant media .
As George Monbiot said reacting to Wednesday 's events on his blog , the police know that " By planting the idea in the public mind that the streets could erupt into catastrophic violence at any time , were it not for the thick blue line thrown around even the mildest protest , they establish the need for a heavy police presence " , justifying their massive budget and the accretion of ever - more powers which erode our civil liberties .
Police and government have connived in the demonization of protest .
As well as the organisational self - interest of the police there are other dynamics at play .
A recent Joint Committee on Human Rights report into the 2008 Kingsnorth protests raised serious concerns about the police 's use of terror and anti-social behaviour legislation , and in particular kettling , to bully and harass peaceful protestors .
What was Jacqui Smith 's reaction to this report and to the police tactics on Wednesday ?
Not a peep .
As long as the public can be led to see any protests against government policies and those of the G20 as necessarily violent and disruptive , alternatives to the prevailing social and economic system are de-legitimised and the narrow spectrum of party politics in this country is validated .
What can those of us do , who are concerned by the threat posed to our civil liberties by police fear - mongering and the repressive measures that go with it ?
I think we should join forces in a playful and self - confident way , encouraging guerrilla action , like that of the Smile at the Spies Group who have produced posters satirising the recent advertising campaign by ACPO and the Met which raises the spectre of terrorism and encourages us all to snoop on each other .
A good place to start might be to organise a large public protest against aggressive policing to assert our democratic self - confidence and show that we 're not afraid .
The police say that we face a " summer of rage " .
Who 's up for a " summer of freedom " ?
Inside an alien ’s head …

The discussion of the need to prevent climate change continues apace .
Honestly , I am not fed up about the issue but I ’m fed up reading what the deniers have to say about it through the social media .
So , I visited some blogs containing other topics to somehow get off from the usual blogs that I follow .
After browsing a couple of blogs , I came to stumble upon a quote that ’s quite striking .
It says , “ You can not f*ck the future , sir — the future f*cks you . ”
It came from a theology blog but then upon reading the quote , the issue on climate change began crawling inside my mind .
Though I ’m not sure of what the quote ’s context is , I came to concoct my own understanding of it .
Hell yes , nobody can mess up with our future here in this planet but I guess the future itself will eventually give its final say whether we ’re going to have a f*cked up one or not .
In my humble opinion , what we need to do now is to welcome the choice of a solution that might actually motivate some action for once , even on alien ’s method , rather than standing vainly in its stead .
That being said , I guess the recent direct communication we did at the ADB climate meeting got quite a good number of press and it ’s a good indication that clothing in all that ’s strange will always be a very effective and rational way to deliver a message that is a matter of urgency .
Being an “ alien ” for a day was fun while delivering the message that human survival depends on real solutions to halt climate change , and at the same time reminded me that there are more reasons to act now than ever before .

The latest theory about the Air France 447 disaster is that bad speed readings caused the Airbus 's computer control systems to go haywire -- and that , while rebooting the computers and flying on backup instruments , the pilots flew the plane so fast that it broke up in mid-air .
This theory has been given credence by another Airbus 's systems going nuts in a similar situation last week , this time over the Pacific :
WSJ : A Northwest Airlines A330 flying from Hong Kong to Tokyo ... ran into a situation which investigators believe may be a similar to what took place on the flight deck of the Air France jet .
The Northwest crew reported entering a storm in daylight and running into turbulence ; in less than a minute their primary and standby airspeed indicators showed the plane had slowed dramatically .
Other systems that automatically maintain speed and altitude also disengaged .
" The master warning and master caution " indications flashed on the instrument panel , according to one crew member 's written description , " and the sound of chirps and clicks ( followed ) letting us know these things were happening . "
Things did n't return to normal for three minutes as the captain flew the aircraft out of the rain , according to information gathered by U.S. safety officials .
The scene inside Air France Flight 447 may have been more ominous from the beginning .
The crew was flying at night and the storm they tried to traverse may have been more violent .
After the initial speed warnings , the Air France pilots are believed to have quickly lost the autopilot and automated throttle - controls , which are designed to instantly disengage when speed readings are suspect .
Soon after , according to people familiar with the investigation , cockpit instruments showed a series of warnings about various other equipment failures and the crew apparently shut down or tried to reboot their primary and secondary computer systems .
It 's not clear what happened next .
But the pilots , perhaps distracted by wildly fluctuating airspeed indications , along with the cacophony of other cockpit warnings , could have allowed the jetliner to gain excessive speed that possibly tore off sections of the plane .
The aircraft could have accelerated and run into danger because faulty instruments convinced the Air France crew the twin - engine jet was traveling so slowly that it was close to stalling .
That may have prompted them to rev up the engines or point the nose down to go faster .
These incidents , along with others , will likely increase concerns about the " fly - by - wire " planes built by Airbus and , soon , Boeing .
Hydraulic systems can break , too , of course -- and have .
But to a generation of folks reared on computers that crash constantly for no apparent reason ( and resist most attempts to diagnose the problem ) , the concept of a " software glitch " blowing up their airplane has the potential to be particularly terrifying .
Over the past week , extremely weird things have been falling from the sky in Asia .
Mega - hail destroyed almost 10,000 homes in China , while dead animals have been raining from the clouds in Japan ( pictured : tadpoles on a car ) .

Although blogs like Pink Tentacle have been reporting the tadpole rains of Japan for over a week now , the news is finally hitting mainstream outlets .
Apparently small fish as well as tadpoles are falling on various districts in Japan .
Usually they 're dead by the time they hit the ground .
One man claimed he found 13 tiny carp had rained onto his car .
Nobody has come forward with a good theory about how they have gotten into rain clouds , nor has anyone been able to explain what might have changed recently to make this happen .

According to the UK Guardian :
One popular theory is that the creatures were sucked up by waterspouts but meteorologists say no strong winds have been reported in the areas where tadpoles were found .
One expert said gusts too weak to be picked up by observatories might have sucked up small quantities of water , along with a few unfortunate tadpoles .
Ornithologists said it was too early too rule out their feathered friends .
Kimimasa Tokikuni , head of the Ishikawa branch of the Japanese Society for the Preservation of Birds , told the Yomiuri Shimbun that bigger birds , such as herons and black - tailed gulls , might have dropped the tadpoles after being disturbed in mid-flight .
But the startled bird theory fails to answer a simple question : why have n't the " flying " tadpoles been noticed before ?

Less unusual but no less alarming have been this spate of mega - hail storms in China recently .
Giant hail stones , combined with winds up to 62 miles per hour , crushed thousands of houses and injured hundreds of people over the last week .
Xenophilia reports :
Recovery efforts have begun in eastern China following a severe hail storm on Sunday that killed at least 14 people and destroyed thousands of homes .
Hail stones and winds of more than 100 km /h ( 62 mph ) lashed the province for nearly 90 minutes , uprooting trees and scattering debris across roads .
The Civil Affairs bureau in Anhui province says more than 10,000 people had to be taken to emergency shelters .

I suppose you could call this climate change , since in fact it does represent a change in the climate .
Especially the tadpoles .
But I have to admit it seems like something a lot weirder than that .

Taipei , May 9 ( CNA )
Taiwan reaffirmed Saturday its sovereignty over several island groups in the South China Sea in the wake of recent bids by Malaysia and Vietnam to extend the outer limits of their continental shelves to include the disputed region .
In a statement , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) said the Republic of China has " unquestionable " sovereignty over the Spratly Islands , the Paracel Islands , the Maccelesfield Bank and the Pratas Islands and their surrounding waters , from the perspective of history , geography and international law .
" The ROC is entitled to all due rights in these four island groups and their waters , seabed and subsoil .
The ROC government does not recognize any claims over or occupation of the islands by any country for any reason , " the MOFA said .
The ministry urged Malaysia and Vietnam to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute through negotiations and dialogue with concerned governments , in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , as well as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea signed between the People 's Republic of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2002 .
The region , which is rich in oil deposits and marine biodiversity , is claimed either entirely or in part by Taiwan , China , Vietnam , Malaysia and the Philippines .
On Wednesday , Malaysia and Vietnam jointly submitted an application to the United Nations to have their continental margins extended beyond 200 nautical miles to cover some of the region in dispute , followed by a separate application submitted by Vietnam the following day .
The moves came one week before the May 13 deadline set by the United Nations for countries to submit claims for the legal extension of their continental shelves .
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea allows countries to seek to extend their right to exploit natural resources from 200 nautical miles to 350 nautical miles off their coasts if they can provide scientific proof of the natural extension of their terrestrial land into the sea .
Also asserting its sovereignty over the region , the PRC's Foreign Ministry on Friday described the claims by Malaysia and Vietnam as " illegal " and " invalid " and urged the United Nations not to review their submissions .
Beijing was referring to the rules of procedure of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf , which states that " in cases where a land or maritime dispute exists , the commission shall not consider and qualify a submission made by any of the states concerned in the dispute . "

Up or Down ?
A while ago , I had an idea for what I thought would be a nice little calculation .
Recently I tried it , and it worked , and here 's the result : a mathematical solution to the problem of whether the toilet seat should be left up or down .
The basic idea is to look at some different scenarios and figure out the expected effort involved in each .
By effort , here , I do n't mean just physical effort , but rather anything that makes an action more undesirable … negative utility , if you 're used to thinking that way .
The expected effort will derive from two different units of effort .
The first , which I 'll call e , is the effort of raising or lowering the seat .
It represents a small amount of physical effort , but mostly an expenditure of time , plus the ickiness of having to touch the seat .
The second , which I 'll call d just to make the letters adjacent , is the effort of bothering to check the state of the seat before sitting down .
I think it 's negligible , but it does n't complicate the math to include it , and we can always set it to zero in the end .
Now , on to the scenarios .
Female Household
If a woman is living by herself ( or several women are living together ) , there 's nothing to calculate .
The seat stays down , and the expected effort is zero .
Male Household
If a man is living by himself ( or several men are living together ) , the situation is a bit more complicated .
Let p be the probability that , in a single instance , the seat ought to be up , and q = 1 - p be the probability that it ought to be down ; and assume that the man uses the lazy algorithm of leaving the seat in whatever state it was last in ; then the elements of the calculation can be organized as follows .
s\c male male p q up p 0 e down q e 0
The letters “ s ” and “ c ” in the corner are meant to suggest that the rows represent ( initial ) states , while the columns represent cases .
The row and column headers show the probabilities for the different states and cases , while the main body of the table shows the effort required for each combination .
The two cases have probabilities p and q by definition ; the two states have the same probabilities due to the lazy algorithm .
Now we can just add up the expected efforts for all the combinations .
If , for example , the seat is up ( probability p ) , but ought to be down ( probability q ) , then it needs to be lowered ( effort e ) , and the expected effort for the combination is pqe .
Similarly , the expected effort for any other combination is the product of the actual effort with the corresponding row and column probabilities .
Here , the only other combination with nonzero effort has the same expected effort pqe , so the total is 2 pqe , or rather d + 2 pqe , since I did n't include the effort d in the table .
By the way , although here it may look like the columns represent final states , that 's just an artifact caused by the lazy algorithm .
In later calculations it will be clear that the columns are cases , not states .
Shared Household , Male Algorithm
If men and women are living together , things get much more interesting .
As a first step , let 's see what happens if everyone uses the lazy algorithm .
Let f be the probability that , in a single instance , the user is female , and m = 1 - f be the probability that ve's male .
( If there are n people in the household , n f female and n m male , then f = n f /n and m = n m /n , all else being equal .
All else may not be equal , but that is something I choose not to discuss here . )
The elements of the calculation look like this .
s\c male male female p q 1 up mp 0 e e down f+mq e 0 0 Just as an example of where the values come from , the seat will be down initially ( probability f+mq ) if the last user was female ( probability f ) or the last user was male ( probability m ) and he wanted the seat down ( probability q ) .
Adding up the various combinations , and including d , we obtain the following values for the expected effort .
female d + mpe male d + pe(f+2mq )
In particular , the expected effort is not the same for women as for men .
Under certain conditions ( when f/ m < p - q ) , the expected effort is larger for women ; otherwise , smaller .
However , I do n't think that 's the right comparison to make .
Suppose , as often happens , a man and a woman have been living separately , and then decide to move in together .
What you want to compare , in that case , is not the expected effort , but rather the change in expected effort due to the new circumstances .
From the calculations above , we know the old values of the effort , female 0 male d + 2 pqe then all we need to do is subtract , and we have the changes .
female d + mpe male fpe ( 1 - 2q )
Now the expected effort is always larger for the woman .
In fact , even if we allow different numbers of men and women , and ignore the effort d , the expected effort is still larger for women under most conditions ( in fact , when m / f > p- q , which by coincidence looks a lot like the previous rule ) .
That 's all pretty abstract , so let 's put in some numbers .
First , as a rough guess , let 's suppose that p and q are about 3/4 and 1 / 4 .
In that case , the absolute effort is larger for women if f / m < 1/2 , i.e. , if there are few women , while the change in effort is larger for women if f/m < 2 , i.e. , if there are n't a lot of women .
Next , let 's suppose that the household consists of one woman and one man , so that f and m are both about 1 / 2 .
To keep things simple , let 's also set e = 1 and d = 0 .
Now we can make a nice little table of the various expected efforts .
separate together change female 0 3/8 +3/8 male 3/8 9/16 +3/16
Thus , moving in together creates more work for everyone , but creates relatively more for the woman , which , I imagine , is part of the reason that women complain about men not putting the seat down , and not vice versa .
In other words , there 's some justification for the complaint .
Shared Household , Female Algorithm
Since the lazy algorithm is , arguably , unfair to the women , let 's look at the other extreme , and see what happens if everyone always leaves the seat down .
( For women , that 's the same thing as the lazy algorithm , so for “ everyone ” you can also read “ the men ” . )
Here are the elements of the calculation .
( The “ up ” row has probability zero , so it could be left out . ) s\c male male female p q 1 up 0 e e e down 1 2e 0 0 So , the expected effort looks like this , female 0 male 2pe and the change in expected effort looks like this .
female 0 male -d + 2p2e
Already we can see how this is going to turn out , but let 's put in the numbers , just for completeness .
separate together change female 0 0 0 male 3/8 3/2 +9/8
Clearly this is a far more unjust division of labor !
Shared Household , Probabilistic Algorithm
Although the calculations above have n't been done before ( as far as I know ) , I have to admit that the qualitative results were entirely predictable .
Now , however , we come to something genuinely new , which I claim as my own modest contribution to the problem of toilet seats .
The two algorithms we 've looked at have been unfair in different directions , so , clearly , what is needed is something in between .
So , let 's see what happens if the men , when the seat ought to be up , put it down afterward some fraction x of the time .
Defining y = 1 - x , the elements of the calculation look like this .
s\c male male female p q 1 up mpy xe e e down 1 - mpy ( 1+x ) e 0 0 For consistency , I should perhaps have written 1 - mpy as f+mq+mpx , but it does n't matter , the two are equal .
Also , by the way , you can check that the elements are correct by looking at them in the limits x = 0 and x = 1 , where they reduce to the elements for the last two scenarios .
Adding up all the combinations , we find the following expected efforts .
( Here the second line can be written in many ways ; the one below is convenient because it groups all the terms that contain y. ) female d + mpey male d + 2 pe - pey [ 1 + m ( 1 - 2q ) ]
Then , subtracting , we find the changes .
female d + mpey male 2p2e - pey [ 1 + m ( 1 - 2q ) ]
Now , according to my arguments above , we can make the algorithm fair by requiring the changes in effort for men and women to be equal .
But , that 's easy enough — we just set the two equal and solve for y. y = ( 2 p - d/pe ) / ( 1+2 mp ) Putting in the standard numbers , we find y = 6/7 , so that x = 1/ 7 .
Then , as a check on the calculation , we can put the numbers into the same kind of table as before .
separate together change female 0 9/28 +9/28 male 3/8 39/56 +9/28
Yup , it all adds up .
Now let 's step back a second and see what we 've got .
If the correct measure of fairness is the equality of effort beyond what 's required in a purely male or female household , then we know the value of x that makes the algorithm fair .
It 's pretty clear that that 's the correct measure when a man and a woman move in together , but not very clear at all in any other case .
If , furthermore , the numbers I 've been using are correct , then the value of x for a household of one man and one woman is 1/7 , so that the man should put the seat down exactly 1/7 of the time .
Now , here 's a funny thing .
Before I worked through these calculations for the first time , I imagined that x would be some generic real number , so that you 'd need a random number generator next to the toilet in order to apply the algorithm properly .
Instead , with the very first set of numbers I chose to use , I got the value 1/7 , which , I think you have to admit , immediately suggests a particular way that the algorithm should be applied : the man should put the seat down one day a week .
To me it even seems obvious that the day should be Sunday .
Notes Unfortunately , that 's not the right way to interpret the result .
If , for example , both the man and the woman are away during the day , working , then only evenings and weekends are spent at home , and the fraction of time that Sunday occupies is more than 1/ 7 .
( And , we should probably only count waking hours . )
Or , if just one person is away during the day , the situation becomes difficult to analyze .
Technically , we could just adjust the values of f and m , but that would n't take into account the fact that there are now known intervals with only one user , so that the value of putting the seat down depends on the time of day .
In both cases , all I can say is that maybe the Sunday rule would be a good starting point for figuring out some workable compromise .
Although the equation above always gives a value for y , the value is n't always a valid solution to the problem .
Under certain conditions ( approximately m/f < p- q , as explained above ) , even the lazy algorithm is more work for men than for women , and in such cases the value of y will turn out to be greater than 1 .
On the other hand , if d is really large , there 's no middle ground between always putting the seat down and even the tiniest probability of leaving it up , and in those cases the value of y will be less than 0 .
If you believe , with Mr. Spock , the utilitarian sentiment that “ the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few ” ( for related quotes in Bartlett 's , look under “ the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers ” ) , then instead of making the expected male and female efforts equal , you might want to minimize the total expected effort … that is , minimize the quantity f times the expected female effort plus m times the expected male effort .
( Note that the weights really are f and m , not n f /n and n m / n. )
As it turns out , the total effort is linear in x , with positive slope , so that the best solution is always the lazy algorithm … and the same is true if you minimize the total change in effort instead of the total effort !
( That last is obvious , because the base efforts do n't depend on x . )
So , although putting the seat down does have the beneficial effect of redistributing effort , in the end it always creates more effort than it saves .
There 's another unit of utility that I have n't talked about so far , namely , the large negative utility of trying to sit when the seat 's not down .
The reason I have n't talked about it is that it does n't figure in anywhere .
In fact , it 's exactly because it 's large that it does n't figure in — if there 's any chance that the seat is n't down , it 's obviously better to make the small effort of checking the state before sitting .
By the way , it 's important to distinguish the small effort of checking the state from the larger and more annoying effort of learning to always check the state .
The latter is a one - time cost , so it should n't be included in the calculations above , but it should perhaps be accounted for in some other way .
For example , when a man and a woman move in together , it 's the woman who has to learn to check the state , so probably the man ought to do something nice for her , to compensate .
Finally , I ought to point out that if you 're a guest rather than a resident , different rules may apply .
My own feeling is that you should always leave things in the state you found them in , even if that means you have to put back down one of those seat covers that have the carpet on top .
Even after Congress drafted legislation last year that gave the National Security Agency broad powers to eavesdrop , the agency exceeded that authority and intercepted private e-mail messages and phone calls of Americans in recent months , according to The New York Times .
In 2008 , after much controversy involving allegations of illegal spying on Americans , lawmakers passed the FISA Amendments Act .
The act gave the NSA broad powers to siphon mammoth amounts of phone and internet traffic passing through domestic telecom networks without obtaining a court order , as long as the targets of the spying were believed to be outside the United States .
But according to the Times , the agency engaged in " overcollection " of " significant amounts " of domestic traffic .
The alleged violation , described by sources as systemic , occurred because the agency had trouble distinguishing between domestic and overseas traffic , whether collected from U.S. telecom networks or the NSA 's own spy satellites .
The revelations stem from reviews that the Justice Department is conducting into NSA activities .
According to the Times , classified government briefings have been held in recent weeks to address the controversy and bring the NSA back into compliance .
The Justice Department said that the " overcollection " problems had been resolved .
Congressional intelligence committees say they 're investigating the allegations .
Equally significant are allegations that prior to Congress broadening its powers , the NSA also considered eavesdropping on a member of Congress without court approval .
The unnamed congressman was traveling overseas at the time as part of a delegation to the Middle East in 2005 or 2006 .
The agency wanted to tap his conversations because he had contact with an extremist who was under surveillance for suspected terrorist ties .
The Times reports that the plan was scrapped after complaints from intelligence officials who thought spying on a congressman was taking things too far .
This information comes from separate inquiries the Justice Department was conducting into the agency 's activities prior to President Barack Obama taking office .
According to the Times , a senior FBI agent has offered evidence to the inspector general 's office indicating that the NSA engaged in " significant misconduct " in the surveillance program by targeting Americans for eavesdropping without having sufficient evidence that they were tied to terrorist groups or activity .
UPDATE : Director of National Intelligence , Admiral Dennis Blair , responded to the eavesdropping allegations in a statement , which included the following :
Under these authorities the officers of the National Security Agency collect large amounts of international telecommunications , and under strict rules review and analyze some of them .
These intercepts have played a vital role in many successes we have had in thwarting terrorist attacks since 9/11 .
On occasion NSA has made mistakes and intercepted the wrong communications .
The numbers of these mistakes are very small in terms of our overall collection efforts , but each one is investigated , the Congress and the courts are notified , corrective measures are taken , and improvements are put in place to prevent reoccurrences .
Let me clear , I do not and will not support any surveillance activities that circumvent established processes for their lawful authorization and execution .
Additionally , we go to great lengths to ensure that the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. persons are protected .

Pope Benedict has given his blessing to taking adverts on Vatican Radio
Vatican Radio - the voice of the Roman Catholic church - is going commercial in July to meet rising costs .
It is one of the world 's oldest broadcasters , first going on the air as long ago as 1931 .
But the station now costs about $ 30 m ( 21.4 m euros , £ 18.8 m ) a year to run and the Vatican has been looking for ways of raising new funding .
An advertising agency is to vet the radio ads to make sure they are in keeping with moral standards .
Vatican Radio's first transmitter was designed by the Italian who carried out the world 's first long distance voice transmission - Guglielmo Marconi .
Global broadcasts
The station , known as the Voice of the Pope , broadcasts worldwide by short , medium and long wave , by FM in Rome , and also on the internet .
On 6 July it will transmit its first commercial advert .
The Vatican has chosen the Italian electricity multinational ENEL as its first commercial radio sponsor .
But Vatican Radio hopes to attract other advertisers from around the world to help meet increasing costs .
An agency will filter all radio ads to make sure they are in keeping with the high moral standards of the Catholic Church , according to the official Vatican spokesman .
Pope Benedict XVI has personally approved Vatican Radio's new experimental commercial venture .
Overcoming a Rough Week
We all have bad days , but have you ever had one of those weeks when it seems everything is going wrong ?
Monday , your alarm did n’t ring and you were late for work .
Tuesday , your car broke down .
Wednesday you lost your credit card .
Thursday was your annual review and your employer informed you that , due to the economy , the company is not issuing raises this year .
By the time Friday arrives and you can see the light at the end of the tunnel , you get a ticket for speeding .
How do we handle a series of setbacks and bad news ?
I recently had one of those weeks where it seemed that anything that could go wrong – did go wrong .
The natural reaction most people have when the walls begin crumbling is to crumble right along with them .
I have developed a habit of not letting outside circumstances consume me .
I have learned in the past that the events in your life do not determine the course of your life .
Rather , it is your reaction to those events that will determine the quality of your life , and your life direction .
In other words , it ’s not what happens to you , it ’s how you react to what happens to you .
Most of us can experience certain negative events and dismiss them .
But when negative events seem to happen simultaneously – as they often do – they feel suffocating and impossible to overcome .
This is when thoughts of giving in to that feeling of helplessness seem to evade the mind .
With the state of the economy and many people losing their jobs and homes , many of us feel powerless .
But the truth is that there are many things we can do to help us cope with , and even change a bad situation .
My Story : “ Did I Break a Mirror ? ”
I rolled out of bed Monday morning expecting my first week back at work to be a continuation of my everyday life .
I had enjoyed my vacation week , but now , it was back to work .
I spent the vacation reconnecting with friends , relaxing , and celebrating my 30th Birthday .
I was refreshed and ready for a productive and fulfilling week .
I had a feeling that my week was going to be challenging when I opened my email on Monday and read that one of my employees will be out for a week ; meaning that time sensitive assignments would not be completed until she got back .
Also , because technical issues prevented me from updating my blog , my web traffic took a nose dive .
Things began to get worse from there .
At the monthly staff meeting , we were asked to be patient during our merger with another company .
We were also told to be prepared for some changes .
We knew that “ be patient ” meant they did n’t know what was going on , and “ changes ” meant people were going to lose their jobs .
On top of that , a potential business partner suddenly stopped returning my emails .
More bad news followed .
A good friend and one of the nicest people I know , was moving out of the country .
To add insult to injury , someone dented the passenger side door on my car , my Blackberry started malfunctioning , and NBC cancelled My Name is Earl .
All of this happened in one week !
“ Did I break a mirror or offend a leprechaun last week ? ” , I thought .
After a brief pity party , I came to my senses and decided not to let those events determine my quality of life .
I developed a plan to bounce back and regain control over my life .
Why We Must Bounce Back
There ’s power in the overcoming of obstacles .
Knowing that you have the ability to recover and survive the trials and tribulations of life , is a redemptive feeling .
We must realize that we do not have to be victims of things that are happening around us .
We are more likely to take more risk and act with courage tomorrow , if we are able to conquer the conditions of today .
Letting our circumstances consume us can lead to a false view of our life experience .
Some who are unable to recover from the trying times of their lives begin to develop negative beliefs .
I ’ve heard people say “ God just has it in for me ” or “ I ’m just unlucky “ .
This mindset renders us helpless and unable to act in a way that changes our circumstances .
Being unable to cope with life ’s obstacles can also affect our health .
Depression and alcoholism can many times be rooted in a person ’s inability to deal with the outside world .
Since the outside world seems to deal multiple crushing blows , one after another , they look for an escape or close themselves off from the outside world .
Our relationships suffer also if we are unable to bounce back .
We tend to isolate ourselves from the people around us .
Some people carry anger and resentment inside and it reflects in their everyday dealings with people .
I ’m sure you ’ve run it to a person who seems to be mad at the world all of the time .
For these reasons and many more , it is important that we begin to face and conquer life ’s tough conditions .
Bouncing Back
1 . Find your foundation
The life we live should stand on a solid foundation .
The mistake that many people make is to value their life based upon their possessions or social status .
You are more than what you own , you are more than your worldly titles .
For some people , it is their spiritual faith , or creative passion , or a strong relationship with family and friends that serves as the foundation for their life .
Finding your foundation means rediscovering the things that are truly important to you ; the things that make your life worth living .
You may have a passion for music or art .
Use your current hardship to rediscover what drives you .
Use those expressions of yourself to remind you that life can be enjoyable .
2. The Ant Philosophy
In some of his speeches , author Jim Rohn often talks about the ant philosophy .
Ants are remarkably persistent .
If an ant is on its way somewhere , and you place your thumb in its path , the ant instinctively tries to find another way .
The ant will try to go over , around , and sometimes through any obstacle .
Giving up is never an option .
Have you ever seen an ant come across an obstacle , stop and quit as to say , “ Why are things always getting in my way ” ?
Instead , the ant believes that there is a way to continue on the path and it works until it finds it .
When things get tough in our lives , we have to adopt the ant philosophy .
Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves , and letting the obstacle win , we must attempt to find another way to get on the right path .
We must be persistent until we reach our destination .
3. Verbalize It
Humans were not designed to be isolated .
We need each other in so many ways .
One of the major mistakes that I made when everything seemed to be going wrong was I began to isolate myself and suppressed my problems .
I thought that if I threw myself into my work , eventually I would feel better .
That may help to improve some circumstances , but I still felt a bit weighed down by everything that has happening .
During the week , a friend called me and asked , “ How ’s everything ? ”
“ Everything is stupid ! ” I responded , unable to fully articulate my frustration .
He laughed knowing that I had been having a tough week .
After talking for a few minutes , I realized how good it felt to verbalize how frustrated I was with how my week was going .
I ’m not one to dump my problems on other people , but I learned that sometimes it is better to express it in words than hold on to it .
4. Wake Up Call
“ Every adversity , every failure , every heartache
carries with it the seed on an equal or greater benefit ”
~ Napoleon Hill
Sometimes , it is the painful or frustrating circumstances that trigger us to learn and make positive changes in our lives .
With one of my employees suddenly being out , I found major flaws in the way I managed my team .
Even the way I distributed assignments left room for disastrous results in the event that one person was unable to work .
During this week , I recognized and fixed several problems with my management system , which I would not have done otherwise .
During this week , I was reminded that that my day job may be in danger , this triggered me to review how I could recover from potential economic setbacks .
It had been about 7 months since I reviewed my recovery plan .
I realized that many things had changed with my monthly income and expenses , and it was time to revise the plan .
5. Dwell on the Good
For some strange reason , our minds tend to dwell on the negative things .
That is one reason the news media usually broadcasts bad news ; they know that negative happenings draw more ratings and attention .
Last year , at a gathering , I met two women who worked for the local news station as reporters .
When we were being introduced , I confessed that I did n’t recognize them because I do n’t watch the news .
To my surprise , one of them responded , “ Good , it ’s all bad news “ .
Even though it seemed as though my life was filled with the negative , there were many good things that happened .
For example , I attended a banquet where I got to see some old friends who I miss .
Also , someone gave me a certificate for a free massage at a local spa .
But instead of being thankful for the good things , I made the mistake of choosing to see and dwelling on the bad .
We should take the time to be thankful and dwell on the good things that come into our lives , however small or intangible they may seem .
I sat down and created a list of all the things I appreciated from the week , all the happenings that I enjoyed and all the non-tangible gifts I ’d received .
The list helped me put things in perspective .
It also reminded me that the good times will return ; in fact , they ’re already here , if we choose to look for them .
Learn from the Seasons
Yes , the good times will return .
Most failures and obstacles are temporary but feel as though they are going to last forever .
We must be subscribers to the fact that , just like seasons , bad times come and go .
Good things will eventually happen again and good things may come from your bad experience , if you choose to see them .
A possible benefit to your hardship may be the potential opportunity to help someone else through their trials .
It is hard to see the possible good when you are in the thick of it , but all storms must come to an end .
Spring is often called the season of opportunity and it conveniently comes after winter which is known for being harsh and desolate .
The tough times will pass and in their place will be growth , and potential for great things to happen .
So , how was your week ?

In another big victory for the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) a federal jury has fined Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum $ 675,000 for illegally downloading and distributing 30 copyrighted songs .
In finding Tenenbaum guilty of willful copyright infringement , the Boston court 's jury fined the 25 year - old doctoral student a sum of $ 22,500 for each illegally downloaded song , far less than the maximum statutory fine of $ 150,000 per song that the jury could have hit him with .
The damages awarded today were about a third less than the massive $ 1.92 million fine that was assessed against Minnesota native Jammie Thomas - Rasset in a similar music piracy case that was decided in June .
As with Tenenbaum , Thomas - Rasset too was found liable for illegally downloading 24 copyright songs .
But in her case , the jury awarded the music companies which had sued her , $ 80,000 per infringed song .
The verdict in the Tenenbaum case came after a brief trial that began Monday and ended yesterday when Tenenbaum admitted under direct questioning that he had illegally downloaded and distributed all of the songs at the center of the case .
Tenenbaum was sued for copyright infringement by the RIAA in 2007 .
His case shot to prominence last fall when Harvard law school professor Charles Nesson said he would represent him in his fight with the RIAA .
The RIAA claimed to have found more than 800 illegally downloaded songs in a shared folder on his computer , but the case focused on a representative sample of just 30 of those songs .
Even before Tenenbaum 's admission , some following the case had predicted that he had little chance of prevailing based on a pre-trail ruling by Judge Nancy Gertner .
In that ruling , Gertner essentially forbid Tenenbaum from asserting a " fair use " defense in arguing his case .
That doctrine allows for the use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holders in some specific circumstances including transformative use or for nonprofit academic purposes .
In her ruling on Monday , Gertner said that Tenenbaum had not provided any " hard proof " to show how his alleged illegal music distribution constituted fair use .
She had noted that Tenenbaums interpretation of fair - use laws was so broad " it would swallow the copyright protections that Congress has created . "
Ray Beckerman , a N.Y - based attorney who has represented several clients in RIAA lawsuits , called todays verdict " ridiculous , " but " not surprising in view of the way the trial was incorrectly handled . "
Beckerman has been critical of the way the case has been handled from the beginning .
None of the key issues relevant to the case were touched upon or explored during the case by the defendants team , the RIAA lawyers or Judge Gertner , he said .
" Together they did an abysmal , pathetic job of crystallizing the issues properly and of disposing of the issues properly , " Beckerman said .
" I 'm sure the judge will reduce the verdict , but I have no idea to what she will reduce it .
She has historically given many favorable rulings to the RIAA , more than any other judge in the country . "
When San Jose State University student Kyle Brady published the source code of his completed homework assignments after finishing a computer science class , his professor vigorously objected .
The professor insisted that publication of the source code constituted a violation of the school 's academic integrity policy because it would enable future students to cheat .
Brady stood his ground as the confrontation escalated to the school 's judicial affairs office , which sided with the student and affirmed that professors at the university cannot prohibit students from posting source code .
This conflict reflects some of the broader friction that exists between open source ideological values and an academic system in which collaboration and the ability to repurpose existing work makes it difficult to measure individual achievement .
Free culture science fiction novelist Cory Doctorow shared his thoughts about the issue on Thursday in a blog post on BoingBoing .
Doctorow suggests that assignments are ultimately more valuable to the students when the work that they produce can have broader purpose than merely fulfilling academic requirements .
He also rightly points out that peer review of source code and studying existing implementations are both common practices in the real world of professional software development .
These are both compelling points and they illustrate how traditional academic sensibilities can be detrimental to the intellectual development of students .
I concur fully with Doctorow 's assessment of Brady 's struggle and I have one further point to add myself .
I think that sharing source code is an experience that has inherent educational value .
As a programmer , I have learned more about programming from seeing how other people modify and reuse parts of my own code than I ever learned in a classroom .
The number of computer science students has declined sharply over the past decade , hitting rock bottom in 2007 .
Enrollment started to bounce back last year , but the United States still suffers from a lack of students who are pursuing technical degrees .
This is degrading US technological competitiveness in the global community .
Part of the problem is that the detached and unproductive nature of modern computer science education makes the entire experience joyless and less valuable .
Doctorow seems to have similar thoughts about this :
" I 've always thought it was miserable that we take the supposed best and brightest in society , charge them up to $ 60,000 a year in fees , then put them to work for four years on producing busywork that no one — not them , not their profs , not other scholars — actually wants to read , " Doctorow wrote .
" Kyle 's prof 's idea of how computer programmers work is exactly what 's meant by the pejorative sense of ' academic '— unrealistic , hidebound , and out - of - touch with reality . "
Rather than forcing students to complete tedious busy - work in isolation , there are more practical and enriching approaches that could be taken to improve computer science education .
Some schools actually encourage students to participate in open source software projects and make it part of the curriculum .
One example of computer science education done right is Seneca College , which collaborates with the Mozilla Foundation .
Seneca students participate in a wide range of open source projects and are working on some very exciting and innovative things .
The culture of this kind of computer science program is far more conducive to a meaningful learning experience .
Unlike Brady 's professor at SJSU who was upset by the fact that a student dared to share his source , some of Seneca 's enlightened computer science teachers practically expect their students to build dialog around their work .
Seneca professor David Humphrey strongly encourages his students to blog and points out the importance of making it a regular habit .
Humphrey also has has some relevant thoughts about Brady 's predicament .
" This is proof that there are still serious barriers to mixing education proper with the web .
At the same time that we 're hearing stories like this one , there are an increasing number of stories about the opposite , and people who see the value of letting go of closed approaches to knowledge in favour of collaboration , " Humphrey wrote .
" More students need to follow Kyle 's lead and take their learning seriously . "
Indeed .
It 's also clear that more professors need to follow Humphrey 's lead and explore ways that collaboration can be used to build a more fruitful learning experience .

CAMP VICTORY , Iraq -- Stephen Colbert left no doubt about his solidarity with American troops when he taped the first of four Comedy Central shows he 'll produce in Iraq this week .
Stephen Colbert high - fives a serviceman after submitting to a military - style haircut in Iraq on Sunday .
Colbert , wearing a business suit made of the same camouflaged material used for soldiers ' desert uniforms , submitted to a regulation military haircut as hundreds of U.S. troops cheered wildly Sunday .
The comedian , who satirizes conservative TV pundits on his " Colbert Report , " began his " Operation Iraqi Stephen : Going Commando " USO tour Sunday in the Baghdad headquarters of the U.S. - led military coalition in Iraq .
" It must be nice in Iraq , because some of you keep coming back again and again , " Colbert said , joking about the multiple tours many troops have had in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
Some troops had accumulated enough frequent flyer miles to earn them a free ticket to Afghanistan , he joked .
Colbert told his guest , Gen. Ray Odierno , he felt " a little intimidated " by him , not because he was he top U.S. commander in Iraq , but because it felt like he was " interviewing Shrek . "
Odierno is an imposing bald figure at 6 - feet , 5 - inches tall .
Odierno said the military is " not yet ready to declare victory " in Iraq and that there was a little more work to be done for long - term stability .
" I , Stephen Colbert , by the power invested in me by basic cable , officially declare we won the Iraq war , " Colbert said , as his audience broke out into applause .
The interview was interrupted when President Obama appeared on large television screens .
The commander - in - chief told his general it was time to " cut that man 's hair . "
With white electric hair clippers in his hand , Odierno stood up and began shaving Colbert 's trademark thick dark hair .
The troops stood and cheered as a female member of Colbert 's staff finished the job .
After the haircut , Colbert ran through the audience , high - fiving the troops as he showed off his new military look .
One Army major said that " shaving of the hair is an amazing show of support " that was " very touching . "
Former Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain also made a pre-taped appearance on the show , jokingly reminding the troops to " take time to clean your muskets . "
Lt. Col. Debra Shoemaker , a native of Colbert 's hometown of Charleston , South Carolina , said the show was a " nice break " from the monotony of service in Iraq .
USO Senior Vice President John Hanson said the shows are an important diversion for the troops .
Colbert 's USO tour is unusual because it 's the first time a show taped in a combat zone has been edited and aired so quickly .
The Sunday show will be televised on the Comedy Central network Monday night .

All the Collateral that 's Fit to Print
I was really ready for a laugh when I read the Bloomberg article , “ Derivatives Industry Gets Second Look From Congress . ”
To start off the festivities , it opens with a photo of the odious Christopher Dodd , the self - important arrogant loudmouth from Connecticut who milks the job for special “ favors ” and personal aggrandizement , actually chairs the House banking committee and , as a long - time member of Congress , is directly responsible for the economic catastrophe befalling us and the world , a sorry fact that I hope is a complete and utter embarrassment to the voters of Connecticut .
But the article was not about Christopher Dodd or how something is obviously wrong with this guy , and naturally it did not mention the fact that if I thought , for even a minute , that I could get away with it , I would go to Washington , D.C. , walk into this guy ’s office , grab him by the lapels of his coat and slap , slap , slap the hell out of his smarmy face until whatever in the hell is wrong with him has been knocked out of his stupid Leftist , economically - illiterate head .
Instead , we read that now that his incompetence is evident , “ Congress will take a second shot at the derivatives industry after its decision nine years ago to forgo regulations led to a $ 592 trillion market that brought some financial firms to their knees . ”
Then , to show you that Mr. Dodd , the bank or the Federal Reserve do n’t have an exclusive on economic illiteracy , the article quoted Mark Halverson , “ a staff director for Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin ” , as saying that “ One of the key underlying problems in the whole lead - up to the meltdown was too much leverage , too little capital or too little collateral . ”
Hmmm !
Well , while he is exactly right that there was too much leverage , where the buyers of these toxic assets were putting up a few cents in chump change and borrowing the rest , he apparently does n’t know what leverage is , even though I just explained it , which shows how much people pay attention to me around here .
Morons .
The fact is that Mr. Halverson is being merely redundant when he says there was too little capital , as distinct from leverage , but I got a Real Hot Mogambo News Flash ( RHMNF ) for this Halverson fella about “ too little collateral ” , as there was lots of collateral , dude !
All the collateral you want !
More than you could ever want !
You want more collateral ?
Hell , give me a couple of minutes and I can whip a lot of IOUs and vague promises into a package and give you all the freaking collateral you want !
I ’ll give it a fancy title , too , like “ Collateralized Debt And Vague Promises Obligation . ”
Too little collateral , you say ?
Hahaha !
Then , just when I thought it could not get funnier , I got to a funnier part where , as part of the overhaul of the entire economic and financial system of America , the Obama administration has a proposal that would “ require standardized over - the - counter derivatives contracts to be guaranteed by a clearinghouse . ”
Hahahaha !
And if the clearinghouse decided it could not , or would not , pay ?
Hahaha !
Hell , we got that system now !
Hahaha !
The scary part was that the Obama administration is revealed as clueless , too , and Bloomberg remarked that the White House “ said in its regulatory proposal that while derivatives did n’t cause the financial meltdown , they ‘ became a major source of contagion through the financial sector during the crisis , ’ instead of dispersing risk as intended . ”
Hahaha !
Wrong !
I was just getting ready to fire off a lot of scathing emails about such a ridiculous stupidity , when I realized that here was the perfect solution to my problems at work !
No , not my main problem of calling employees and customers “ morons ” for not buying gold , silver and oil when their own stupid government is ruining the dollar right in front of their eyes by allowing the Federal Reserve to create such excesses of new money and credit so that the government can borrow the money and spend it , now that people are not borrowing and spending money with their customary élan because they are broke and unemployed .
Nor was it a solution to any of my many , many other personal problems which are , I might add , all the result of other people acting like they have a lot of brain damage .
Was n’t it Sartre who said , “ Hell is other people ” ?
Instead , this could be the solution to the problem of how I am probably going to get fired because I have alienated the customers and made enemies of the employees , which was not part of my Fabulous Mogambo Plan ( FMP ) , which was to take the customer ’s orders , demand a big deposit , and then just say , “ Screw ‘ em ! ” whereupon Sales would always be bringing in new customers , whereupon I would take a little of that new deposit money and settle out - of - court with the irate customers for pennies on the dollar .
A real moneymaker of a plan !
So , obviously , the financial problems of the company are not my fault .
The sales department fell down on the job , ruining everything .
As I watch her face turn red with anger , I remember that I am just hoping to stall for time , as it will not be long before gold , silver and oil shoot upwards in price and I , who have these things , will have enough money to buy the damned company and fire them all , including my boss and her “ Get out of my office or I ’m calling Security ! ” crap !
Actually , I am thinking , “ Whee !
This investing stuff is easy ! ”

Time Travel Beats Quantum Mechanics

Hollywood time machine .
The 1960s TV show The Time Tunnel was science fiction , but in some cases time travel does n’t violate the laws of physics .
In fact , it might be used to break a super - secure quantum code , according to a new theory , which illustrates one of the conflicts between quantum mechanics and general relativity . ×
The ability to travel back in time , though entirely hypothetical , is n’t explicitly forbidden by our current understanding of space and time , embodied in the general theory of relativity .
Time travel tends to play havoc with other laws of physics , however , and in the 29 May Physical Review Letters researchers report another example .
They show that data encryption systems relying on quantum principles can be broken by allowing the data stream to interact with a quantum state that travels back in time .
This scenario does n’t present an immediate threat to information security , the authors assert .
Rather , it ’s an example of the kind of contradiction that any unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity will have to resolve .
A closed timelike curve ( CTC ) is a looping path that connects back on itself by going forward then backward in time .
A CTC might rely on a spacetime wormhole , for example , that connects a place and time in the future with another location at some earlier time .
Regardless of whether such paths exist , they raise awkward questions , notably the “ grandfather paradox ” in which a person goes back in time and kills an immediate ancestor .
In 1991 , David Deutsch of Oxford University in England worked out how to avoid such paradoxes in the case of a quantum particle that travels around a CTC and interacts somewhere along the way with another particle .
He proved that it ’s always possible to find a quantum state that gives the CTC particle a ” Groundhog Day existence , ” in which it cycles around the loop forever , always interacting with the other particle in exactly the same way at the same point in spacetime [ 1 ] .
Todd Brun of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and his colleagues have now found a way to use states defined by the Deutsch formulation to decode quantum - encrypted messages .
Such a message could be sent as a series of particles , each in quantum state “ zero , ” quantum state “ one , ” or a combination state called a superposition .
The intended recipient measures each particle but needs additional information after - the - fact from the sender to distinguish the superpositions from the non-superpositions .
But a spy who could distinguish “ on the fly ” between , say , a zero and a superposition state could intercept the message and also send particles to the recipient that mimic the originals , thereby avoiding detection .
For the spy to accomplish this , the researchers imagine a particle entering a CTC so that it travels around and back in time , allowing it to interact with its future self , so to speak , before going on its way again .
They describe an interaction that , in the simplest example , leaves a particle in the zero state unchanged but transforms a superposition of zero and one into a pure one state .
A standard measurement by the spy that distinguishes one from zero can then reveal with complete certainty whether the initial state was zero or a superposition .
Ordinarily such a transformation would n’t be possible without advanced knowledge of the incoming state .
The trick , Brun explains , is that the particle interacts with the transformed version of itself that comes back from the future .
Brun says the scheme does n’t violate any laws of physics , but he admits that the logic is hard to grasp .
Compared with regular chronological reasoning , he says , “ it ’s definitely cheating . ”
The researchers go on to show how more complex interactions with a CTC can serve to decipher particles embodying superpositions of any number of states .
According to Deutsch , the work provides support for current theories of quantum information , showing that they can handle even very exotic situations .
On the other hand , Brun acknowledges , if you believe quantum mechanics is infallible , you might question Deutsch ’s 1991 paper , or even the existence of CTCs altogether .
Whatever the answer , the difficulties that CTCs cause for quantum mechanics are problems that only a full theory of quantum gravity can resolve , Brun and his colleagues conclude .

Sir Allen , 58 , denies any wrongdoing Texan billionaire Sir Allen Stanford has surrendered to the US authorities after a warrant was issued for his arrest on criminal charges .
The 58 - year - old already faces civil charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) over an alleged fraud worth $ 8 bn ( £ 6 bn ) .
Sir Allen turned himself in to the FBI in Virginia and is expected to appear in a Richmond federal court on Friday .
It was not immediately clear what criminal charges Sir Allen faces .
Dick DeGuerin , Sir Allen 's lawyer , told The Associated Press he had surrendered " to some FBI agents who were hiding out in black SUVs outside the residence where he was staying in Virginia " .
" He walked out and asked if they had a warrant , " Mr DeGuerin said .
If it was a Ponzi scheme , why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place ?
Sir Allen Stanford
Profile : Sir Allen Stanford
He said Stanford told the agents to arrest him if they had a warrant , but if they did not have a warrant , he would go back to Houston to turn himself in .
In February , the SEC , the US financial watchdog , described the alleged fraud at Stanford Financial group as a " fraud of shocking magnitude " .
The cricket impresario is accused by the SEC of luring investors with promises of improbable and unsubstantiated high returns on certificates of deposit and other investments - what is known as a Ponzi scheme .
The billionaire financer has refused to talk to US regulators investigating his alleged fraud , and court documents show that Sir Allen pleaded the Fifth Amendment - the right to withhold potentially self - incriminating evidence .
In an interview with ABC earlier this year he insisted no money was lost by customers dealing with his financial services companies .
" If it was a Ponzi scheme , why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place ? " he said at the time .

It ’s not clear what Mr. Moussavi thinks about democracy , but it ’s a good bet that he ’s willing to entrust the people with more power than was Mr. Khatami , who despite some differences could neither really break with his ruling clerical brethren , nor free himself from the age - old Islamic belief that the faithful need clerical supervision .
And even if Mr. Moussavi is n’t the ideal reformer  he was prime minister in the 1980s  he is surrounded by the best and brightest of Iran .
The regime has lost almost all the country ’s intellectual capital .
Even among the clergy , the best minds  the ones faithful Iranians talk about , like Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri  have distanced themselves from Ayatollah Khamenei .
I ca n’t think of a serious book written by an Iranian since the fall of Mr. Khatami expounding the Islamic Republic as a model for Muslims .
The reverse parallels here with the rest of the Islamic Middle East are striking .
Where secular dictatorships rule , the best and the brightest are often attracted to the Islamist cause .
The moral repugnance of these regimes trumps the appeal of their Westernization .
Muslim fundamentalists often espouse democracy either because it is the only peaceful means of dethroning their rulers or because they really do believe that most Muslims are “ good ” Muslims .
Democracy would make their societies more virtuous , they feel , more likely to preach and practice the traditional injunction to command good and forbid evil .
Until now , the Islamic Republic has had a propaganda heyday among devout Arabs , depicting itself as a virtuous state with a workable level of democracy  just enough to give the regime legitimacy and stability .
Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran ’s Parliament and the wicked genius behind the crushing of the reform movement during Mr. Khatami ’s presidency , loves to emphasize Iran ’s democracy when he travels abroad , always highlighting America ’s preference for secular dictatorships .
Now the clerical regime can no longer make this argument .
As Iranians have come to know theocracy intimately , secularism has become increasingly attractive .
Iran now produces brilliant clerics who argue in favor of the separation of church and state as a means of saving the faith from corrupting power .
Indeed , Iranians are on the threshold of turning the Koran ’s ethical injunction into a democratic commandment : nothing good can be commanded without a vote of the people .
The democracy - supporting clerics of Iraq are trying to do the same thing , but the Iranians , much further advanced in their thinking about church and state , will surely be much bolder .
Whether he intended it or not , Mr. Moussavi  and indirectly Ayatollah Khamenei because of his crude determination to keep the former prime minister from power  has probably begun the final countdown on the Islamic Republic .
We can only guess about the effect of an Iranian crack - up on the rest of the Middle East .
Although the region ’s Sunni rulers were spooked by the aggressiveness of Mr. Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Khamenei ( not to mention the idea of a Shiite state with nuclear weapons ) , the birth of real democracy in Iran , always the most dynamic state in the region , cannot but cause acute anxiety .
Sunni Arab fundamentalists , whose day has not yet arrived , will be fascinating to watch .
They will surely see the awesome power of democracy ; they will probably conclude , however reluctantly , that God can not be the sole legislator of the laws and ethics that good Muslims want to live by .
And American policy ?
For starters , many of America ’s supposed allies may welcome a Khamenei crackdown .
This may complicate matters for President Obama .
But he should take note : inside Iran , the nuclear issue is n’t what the people are fighting about .
They are fighting for freedom .
Even if Ayatollah Khamenei proves triumphant in this round , the president should get on the right side of history .
He has nothing to lose : the supreme leader is never going to give ground on the nuclear issue .
And as the clerical regime gets nastier at home , it will become nastier abroad .
Mir Hussein Moussavi is Mr. Obama ’s only hope .
Saab filed for reorganisation in Sweden in February General Motors has reached a tentative agreement to sell Saab to the Swedish sports car manufacturer Koenigsegg .
GM said that as part of the deal there would be $ 600 m ( £ 367 m ) of funding from the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , guaranteed by the Swedish government .
It is the latest part of GM 's reorganisation , which is also set to see the Opel and Vauxhall brands going to Canada 's Magna .
Saab filed for reorganisation under Swedish law on 20 February .
Koenigsegg produces 18 cars a year and employs 45 people , and there has been some doubt as to whether it has the expertise to run Saab , which sold 93,000 cars in 2008 .
Saab employs about 3,400 people in Sweden and about 12,000 other jobs in the country are dependent on Saab and its suppliers .
But GM Europe 's president Carl - Peter Forster said : " Koenigsegg Group 's unique combination of innovation , entrepreneurial spirit and financial strength ... made it the right choice for Saab as well as for General Motors " .
GM revamp
The statement from GM did not say how much is being paid for the unit , but the sale is expected to be completed by the end of September .
Koenigsegg specialises in the luxury end of the car market GM said it would continue to provide technology to Saab " during a defined time period " .
GM currently has bankruptcy protection in the US and is slimming down its range of brands as it tries to regain profitability .
The Swedish government has been keen to avoid bailing out its carmakers as long as they are owned by US parent companies .
Joran Hagglund , state secretary for Sweden 's industry ministry , said the financing had not yet been finalised .
" We do not yet know if Koenigsegg Group will need loan guarantees or not , " he said .
GM bought half of Saab in 1989 and the rest of it in 2000 .
Koenigsegg was founded 16 years ago by Christian Koenigsegg , and its principal backer is the Norwegian industrial designer Baard Eker .
Its cars sell for about £ 900,000 each .

The growing prevalence of autism worldwide has parents and clinicians searching for effective treatment options .
Though not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of autism , a common class of antidepressants is often prescribed to treat the symptoms of autism in children .
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) are among the most widely used drugs for autism treatment , even though the effectiveness to date has been questionable .
A new study published in the June issue of Archives of General Psychiatry reports that , not only are SSRIs ineffective , they may actually cause unintended side effects .
The study , funded by the National Institutes of Health , evaluated 149 children aged 5 to 17 years who had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders , Asperger disorder , or pervasive developmental disorder .
The patients also had at least moderate severity ratings according to the Clinical Global Impressions , Severity of Illness Scale , as well as at least moderate compulsive behaviors according to the Children ’s Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale .
The children were randomized to receive either citalopram ( Celexa ) or placebo by mouth daily for 12 weeks .
During the trial period , physicians rated the children ’s symptoms on a scale of 1 to 7 , with 7 corresponding to more severe or worsening behaviors .
At the conclusion of the trial , nearly one - third ( 32.9 % ) of the patients receiving citalopram showed improvement in symptoms , but this was not significantly different from the 34.2 % of patients who showed symptom improvement with placebo .
Further , patients receiving citalopram were more likely to experience side effects , including nightmares , increased energy level , impulsiveness , decreased concentration , hyperactivity , diarrhea , insomnia , and dry skin than patients receiving placebo .
Also , citalopram , as with all SSRIs , carries a warning regarding increased suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents , though no suicidal ideations were experienced in this study population .
Overall , the authors of the current study conclude that citalpram cannot be endorsed as treatment for autism symptoms , since the risks outweigh the benefits .
Abnormal serotonin function is thought to contribute to some of the common symptoms of autism , namely repetitive behaviors such as spinning , twirling , and head - banging .
Therefore , SSRIs were a natural choice for treatment of these behaviors .
Today , the worldwide market for autism drug treatment is $ 2 billion and SSRIs account for 60 % of that total .
However , trials and data concerning the effectiveness of SSRIs in autism are mixed , at best .
Some patients do experience symptom improvement , but there are several known risks of SSRI treatment that are particularly concerning in the autism population : suicide risk and increased agitation and aggression , primarily .
Also , many of the clinical trials evaluated small populations , and many have used weak study designs , making the conclusions somewhat unreliable .
Treating autism — a condition with an unknown cause and wide - ranging symptoms — remains challenging .
Symptom improvement during SSRI treatment may be due to the “ placebo effect , ” or the random fluctuation of autism symptoms over time .
The actual outcomes are uncertain , but many clinicians are beginning to question the benefit of SSRIs versus the risks of treatment .
At the very least , the door is still open to investigating the cause and possible treatment options for the ever - prevalent autism and related disorders .

In the name of God
People of Iran
These last days , we have witnessed the lively efforts of you brothers and sisters , old and young alike , from any social category , for the 10th presidential elections .
Our youth , hoping to see their rightful will fulfilled , came on the scene and waited patiently .
This was the greatest occasion for the government ’s officials to bond with their people .
But unfortunately , they used it in the worst way possible .
Declaring results that no one in their right mind can believe , and despite all the evidence of crafted results , and to counter people protestations , in front of the eyes of the same nation who carried the weight of a revolution and 8 years of war , in front of the eyes of local and foreign reporters , attacked the children of the people with astonishing violence .
And now they are attempting a purge , arresting intellectuals , political opponents and Scientifics .
Now , based on my religious duties , I will remind you :
A billionaire developer and former member of the Egyptian parliament was convicted and sentenced to death Thursday for arranging the murder of his ex-girlfriend , a Lebanese pop singer whose body was found in her high - rise apartment in the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai .
The verdict against Hisham Talaat Mustafa , once a member of the ruling National Democratic Party , is the latest twist in a stunning drama that has offered a peek into the closely guarded realm of Egypt ’s politicians and businessmen .
Mustafa , one of the country ’s richest men , was found guilty of paying $ 2 million to a former policeman last year to kill Suzanne Tamim , a diva whose professional slide had led her into the relationship .
Mustafa , who appeared in court in prison - issue white shirt and pants , was granted an immediate review of the sentence by Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa .
A religious investigation is common in Egypt for death penalty cases .

Few had expected that a tycoon who built luxury hotels and has ties to President Hosni Mubarak ’s family would be facing the gallows .
“ I am definitely sad because today ’s decision shows that the court is moving in a particular direction , ” said Mustafa ’s lawyer , Farid Deeb .
He said his client , who sat in a defendant ’s cage during the brief hearing , was also entitled to an appeal before Egypt ’s highest court .
The verdict may be a sign to businessmen “ that nobody is above the law , ” said Hassan Nafae , a political commentator .
“ It may deter some arrogant businessmen who thought there were no political or legal constraints on their ambitions as well as their sexual desires . ”

When the judge in a cramped Cairo courtroom read Mustafa ’s fate , the defendant showed almost no emotion , but the crowd surged toward the cage and chaos ensued .
Security guards hurried Mustafa into the hall as his family and friends screamed and wept .
A woman described by Egyptian satellite television as Mustafa ’s daughter fainted ; other reports said it was his wife .
The case has fascinated news media across the Middle East .
Egypt ’s prosecutor general , Abdel - Maguid Mahmoud , had newspapers confiscated from kiosks and ordered a ban on reporting on the case as the police investigation pointed toward Mustafa , who was a member of the ruling party ’s Policy Secretariat , headed by Mubarak ’s son Gamal .
But the party ’s ability to protect one of its own collided with the insistence of authorities in Dubai , part of the United Arab Emirates , that Mustafa be charged with murder .
Mustafa hired hotel security guard and former policeman Mohsen Sukkari to kill Tamim , 31 , after she broke off their relationship when she became involved with an Iraqi kickboxing champion .
Mustafa , a married man , had dated Tamim for three years ; the couple met in hotels and apartments in London , Dubai and Cairo .
Police say Sukkari , who was also sentenced to death , entered Tamim ’s flat in Dubai on July 28 by posing as a representative of the building ’s owners .
He slit her throat and fled , leaving his bloody clothes behind and his picture on a surveillance camera .
He was soon arrested and implicated Mustafa , whose conversations with Sukkari about the killing were caught on state security eavesdropping tapes .

Mustafa was head of Talaat Mustafa Group , which built hotels and businesses throughout the Middle East , including at the Egyptian resort Sharm el Sheik .
Tamim rose to prominence after winning a TV talent show in Lebanon in 1996 , but legal battles with her estranged second husband , a music producer , hurt her career .
Nafae , the political commentator , said he thought Mustafa ’s lawyers would have found “ loopholes . . . but this would have caused too much public uproar because the crime is horrendous and reflects a great exploitation of political leverage and shows that the defendant thought he was above the law . ”

It is a fascinating and challenging time to work in the music business .
The record industry is swept up in a sea of change and we have embraced it .
It ’s a new day for the business and a new day for fans — 25 years ago , it was just radio and records , but today ’s music marketplace is dramatically different , with hundreds of different fully licensed digital music services and models .
Yet even with this emerging legal landscape , the rights of artists , songwriters , and record labels deserve protection .
Unfortunately , there are those who seem to overlook that fact , including a Harvard law school professor , his class , and their client Joel Tenenbaum , a defendant in one of our illegal music downloading cases .
We welcome a healthy debate about our decision to defend the rights of record labels and artists online .
The passion that fans and commentators exude toward music is a sign of its enduring power and connection .
That ’s a great thing , but emotion should not obscure the facts .
Steven Marks
Let ’s be clear : the best anti-piracy strategy is a vibrant legitimate marketplace rich with content and innovative business models .
We get that .
And that is today ’s music industry .
Fans can stream music at Internet radio sites like Slacker , tap into subscription services like Rhapsody or Napster , explore the great music options at social networking sites like MySpace or imeem , stream and sample songs for a dime at Lala.com , download ringtones , ringbacks and now full length songs to their mobile phones , or purchase mp3 songs at sites like Amazon.com and iTunes .
No doubt there is even great innovation and experimentation to come .
Four years ago , the industry earned virtually no revenues from digital music services .
In 2008 , digital music became a $ 3 billion business and comprised more than 30 percent of the industry ’s revenues .
To enable that legal marketplace to reach its full potential , we still need to educate fans about the law and illegal sites that do not compensate artists for their work .
Our anti-piracy efforts have helped to stem illicit music downloading , educate fans about the legal and illegal ways to get music online , and helped provide a foundation for the legal marketplace to grow .
We are realistic .
We fully recognize that online theft will always be an unfortunate challenge to our industry .
Our job is to provide the right incentives to bring it under sufficient control so that this emerging legal market can reach its potential .
A circus , a crusade , a revolution
We are pleased to transition what we believe will be a more effective strategy : working with Internet Service Providers to forward notices of copyright theft directly to subscribers to point out that their illegal activity has been detected .
That does n’t mean a free pass to those who egregiously downloaded unauthorized music in the past or who refuse repeated offers to discuss a reasonable settlement .
Some defendants — including Mr. Tenenbaum , in the case pending against him — have essentially admitted to the illegal activity .
Someone breaks the law , thumbs his nose at the person harmed , ignores settlement offers and then gets to walk away ?
What kind of message does that send and how is that fair ?
Waging a protracted legal battle instead of taking responsibility for one ’s illegal actions is disrespectful of creators ' rights , of our judicial process , and of the law .
And that ’s exactly what the Tenenbaum case is : a crusade waged by a Harvard professor to gut the copyright laws that protect creators and his attempt to transform a courtroom into a " three - ring circus . "
Professor Nesson seeks a revolution , not a resolution or a real defense of his client .
For a music community severely harmed by illegal music downloading , including thousands of working class folks out of jobs , this is no ivory tower exercise .
Even against a backdrop of an entire community suffering — hundreds of artists dropped from rosters , billions of dollars and thousands of jobs lost during the last ten years — we have strived to implement our legal campaign in a fair and reasonable manner .
Professor Nesson likes to throw out astronomical damages awards but his theories are detached from reality .
We ’ve never once sought maximum damages in our court cases against individual downloaders .
We let courts and juries decide the appropriate dollar amount for any case that reaches that far stage .
And this program has never been about the dollars — we lose money on it and any recoveries are a small fraction of the enormous toll wrought upon the music community .
Ultimately , this case , despite the legal theatrics , is just like any other : a means to an end .
And that end is a vibrant , thriving legal marketplace that offers fans a rich , diverse array of models to enjoy music and properly rewards musicians and record companies for their work .
Xeloda Cancer Drug Eliminates Fingerprints
Recently a 62 - year - old man was found without fingerprints due to his use of Xeloda , a cancer medication .
The drug seems to have caused a lot of peeling to his fingers , leaving the man without fingerprints .
This came to attention when the man , known as Mr. S , tried to travel to the U.S.
Apparently , very few patients experience this side effect , but it is known to happen .
Implications -
In today 's society , many individuals take a particular interest in mysterious discoveries or unlikely scientific breakthroughs .
Such events or occasions satisfy the craving amongst many consumers for the unknown and impossible .
Companies and businesses that are able to provide consumers with products and services that mimic similar feelings and reactions will fare well in today 's science and answer - seeking society of consumers .
Iran ’s most powerful political and spiritual leader warned voters Monday against supporting pro-Western candidates in next month ’s presidential election , comments widely seen as supporting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s approach to foreign policy over those of his challengers .
“ Those who submit to the enemies and bring shame on the nation should not come to power by the people ’s vote , ” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a speech in the western town of Bijar .
“ Those who , through paying lip service to the Western countries and arrogant governments want to secure a position for themselves . . . should not come to power , ” he said .
“ These are not valuable for the Iranian nation . ”
As the official guardian of the Islamic Republic and its political values , Khamenei plays a key role in defining the range of debate in Iran ’s political establishment .

His comments coincided with an uptick in harsh criticism of Ahmadinejad ’s foreign policy by candidates seeking to unseat him in the June 12 elections .
Over the weekend , former parliamentary speaker and now moderate presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi blasted Ahmadinejad for questioning the Holocaust , arguing that the president ’s controversial rhetoric rallied countries to the cause of Israel and alienated potential allies .
Other candidates have begun to outline foreign policy programs starkly different from Ahmadinejad ’s approaches .
Mohsen Rezai , a former commander of the Revolutionary Guard and a conservative challenger , argued this weekend for a more conciliatory relationship with the United States .
“ My government will engage in a constructive and effective interaction with the U.S. administration should I win the presidential elections , ” Rezai said in an interview with an Iranian news agency during a campaign stop in the southern city of Bandar Abbas .
“ In foreign policy , I believe in convergence between countries . ”

Former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi , the president ’s other leading challenger , said Monday that Ahmadinejad ’s government was cultivating relations with ideologically kindred countries in Latin America instead of forging ties with the nearby nations of the Caucasus , Central Asia and the Middle East .
“ We have neglected civilizations in which Iran has played a role and moved toward Latin America , ” he said in remarks reported by Iran ’s Press TV .
“ We have forgotten cities we lost in wars between Iran and Russia and cling to countries such as Venezuela and Uruguay . ”
Competition in the presidential election has turned out to be exceptionally heated , with the powerful conservative and two heavyweight reformists squaring off fiercely against Ahmadinejad .
Fars , a news agency close to Ahmadinejad , reported on a recent poll that showed 54.5 % of respondents supported the incumbent .
But another poll , published by the Iranian Students News Agency , found that 32 % of those surveyed would vote for a conservative and 21.5 % for a moderate , with the rest undecided .

Under Iran ’s political system , if a leading candidate receives less than 50 % of the vote , a runoff election is held between the top two vote - getters .

Well this should go over well .
As the Utah state representative explained in a Web posting that was quickly removed – unfortunately for him , Google lives on – soon to be US Ambassador to China , Republican governor of Utah Jon Huntsman , himself a Mormon , is under ecclesiastical mandate to proselytize to the Chinese when he goes to there to be Obama ’s ambassador .
He has no choice .
Let Huntsman deny it .
Let Obama deny it .
It does n’t matter .
Our next Ambassador to China will be using his post to try to convert the Chinese to Mormonism , and more generally , to let the Mormons into China where they can then run around the country and spread their ideology .
I suspect the Chinese , not know for their tolerance of dissident groups trying to indoctrinate their people , are going to flip .
Here is what the Utah state rep. wrote :
This is a big deal for the Governor , Utah , the United States , and …the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) .
Although the LDS church ’s missionary program has an ecclesiastical presence throughout many parts of the world , the countries with the largest population bases ( China and India ) are not currently open to the church ’s missionary efforts .
Huntsman served his LDS mission as a 19 year old young man in the Taiwan Taipei Mission in the early 1980’s .
He has since been back to the Far East on a number of occasions .
Huntsman not only takes to China his political acumen but also a lifetime of membership in the LDS church .
This should bode well for the LDS church ’s mission to spread the gospel throughout the world , since all members of the LDS faith are under divine mandate to …” Go ye therefore , and teach all nations … ” ( Matt 28:19 ) Huntsman ’s ambassadorship not only puts him in an excellent position to address US - China relations , it puts him in an even better position to teach the gospel …in Mandarin .
And let me explain one more time .
We are not dealing with a religion that believes in “ live and let live . ”
We are not dealing with people who tell the truth when they say “ do n’t worry , we wo n’t really impose our views on you . ”
The Mormons have spent the past two decades secretly baptizing dead Jewish Holocaust victims and forcibly converting them to Mormonism against the wishes of their immediate families , even though they promised publicly that they ’d no longer do it .
This is a group of people who think nothing of dropping tens of millions of dollars to impose their views on people who live far away from them in distant lands .
It does n’t matter what Huntsman now tells us .
The Mormons have a tenet in their faith called “ lying for the lord . ”
It means they outright lie when asked about their church , in order to protect and promote their church .
And as we ’ve seen with their treatment of the Holocaust victims , and their absurd excuse for why they secretly baptized President Obama ’s mother only last year , in matters concerning their faith , they have shown that you cannot trust them at their word .
Their promises come second to their faith .
If Jon Hunstman is required by God to secretly help the Mormons infiltrate China – and he is – then that is what Jon Huntsman will do as our next Ambassador to China .
You can bet on it .
Pity the poor Chinese .
They have no idea what ’s about to happen to them .
Welcome to our world .

As the 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip struggle to rebuild their society with mud in the face of a crippling official blockade by the Israeli government , hundreds of Israeli protesters arrived at the border today to block what little humanitarian aid the government deigns to allow in , forcing the military to close the crossings entirely for much of the day .
Protesters block humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza
The protesters are demanding the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , who has been held by the Hamas government for three years .
Despite progress in the negotiation for his release , the demonstrators have demanded that no aid be allowed into the tiny strip as an effort to win international sympathy for his plight .
“ There is no other way but collective punishment , ” one of the demonstrators declared , but in the face of 1.5 million civilians living in the bombed out remains of their society in the wake of January ’s Israeli invasion being deprived of humanitarian aid , it seems unfathomable that the international focus will be on a soldier being held to trade for some of the thousands of Gazans held in Israeli detention .
Of the 73 trucks expected to cart humanitarian aid into the strip , only seven were allowed in .
In the face of growing opposition to letting food and fuel into the enclave , several Israeli companies have reportedly announced that they will no longer transport goods into Gaza until Shalit is released .

WE HAVE all heard of experts who fail basic tests of sensory discrimination in their own field : wine snobs who ca n’t tell red from white wine ( albeit in blackened cups ) , or art critics who see deep meaning in random lines drawn by a computer .

CONGO and the International Monetary Fund are arguing about a bail - out .
What 's new , you might ask .
Dog bites man .
But the sticking point is , unexpectedly , not the country 's economic policy , but how exactly to repay a $ 9 billion credit that Congo secured last year from China .
China 's deal with Congo , and the disputes arising from it , are examples of a growing trend .
Authoritarian governments are using their money to buy influence abroad .
Sometimes the money comes as a commercial loan ; sometimes , as a grant ; frequently , as both .
These flows are changing the business of aid , undermining attempts by Western countries to improve their programmes and encouraging recipients to play donors off against each other .
The use of aid to win friends and influence people is not new .
America and the Soviet Union both used aid as a weapon in the cold war .
Now a 21st - century equivalent is emerging .
A study this week by a group of American institutions , Freedom House , Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia , looks at the use by China , Iran , Russia and Venezuela of what it calls “ authoritarian aid ” .
The study , “ Undermining Democracy ” , is the first attempt to estimate the global scale of such operations .
China 's assistance programme is the most active .
In 2007 its leaders said they would offer African countries $ 20 billion in new financing ( they did not say on what terms or over what period ) .
Hu Jintao , the president , repeated a promise to boost aid and cancel debts during a trip to Africa this February .
The World Bank says China already gives Africa $ 2 billion a year ( more than the bank itself does ) .
China does not publish aid figures and a study in 2007 for the Centre for Global Development , a think tank in Washington , DC , put the figure lower , at $ 1.5 billion - $ 2 billion a year ( with a third to a half for Africa ) .
But all estimates agree that aid has been rising relentlessly ( see chart ) and that China , once a recipient , is now in the middle rank of donors , on a par with Australia or Spain , though with more commercial lending .
Over the past ten years , Venezuela 's aid has been comparable to China 's , though it is now falling behind .
Gustavo Coronel , a critic of President Hugo Chávez , says Mr Chávez has made $ 43 billion worth of foreign “ commitments ” since 1999 .
Roughly $ 17 billion could be described as aid , including cheap oil to Cuba and cash transfers to Bolivia .
The report estimates that Venezuela 's cheap - oil programme alone is worth $ 1.7 billion a year , though its most flamboyant feature — cheap heating oil for poor Americans — was recently scrapped .
Russian and Iranian aid is more impenetrable than China 's but flashes of information light up the murk .
Iran offered $ 1 billion to Lebanon 's Shias to help them rebuild their ruined houses after the 2006 Israeli war .
This year , Russia offered Kyrgyzstan $ 2 billion , a gesture made , by amazing coincidence , just after Kyrgyzstan had thrown out American forces .
Russia has long used energy prices and debt forgiveness to cajole or punish neighbours .
If you include another generous undemocratic donor , Saudi Arabia — whose aid , $ 2 billion in 2007 , fluctuates as much as the oil price ( see chart ) — then total “ authoritarian aid ” comes to $ 10 billion a year and possibly more .
That is a substantial , though not a game - changing sum .
It is almost 10 % of total aid from rich countries , and about what Britain or Japan gives .
But its significance lies not just in its total value .
Autocracies offer an alternative to western aid in several ways .
In the past decade rich countries have tried to improve a dismal record of development spending by linking aid closely to the priorities of recipients ( rather than financing a big project which the country does not need ) and by demanding good governance .
China and the rest do not .
Much of their aid is overtly political .
Iran 's offer of free electricity to Shia parts of Iraq is one example , Venezuela 's bankrolling of Cuba another .
Most is steered towards a few friendly regimes , or ( in China 's case ) places with natural resources .
China has pledged $ 600 m to Cambodia , more than ten times as much as America .
It has given Myanmar $ 400 m in the past five years ; American aid to the country is worth about $ 12 m a year .
Naturally , help from harsh regimes is rarely encumbered with pesky demands for good governance .
This makes it welcome to corrupt officials and even to those merely sick of being lectured by Westerners .
Alas , it can encourage bad governance .
China , the report says , is training 1,000 Central Asian policemen and judicial officials “ most of whom could be classified as working in anti-democratic enterprises ” .
The report concludes that authoritarian regimes are using aid to boost their soft power .
If so , the spread of authoritarian aid is a challenge to more than just Western ideas of the right sort of giving .
TradeKing vs Scottrade – Online Stock Trading Comparison
Many people asked for more of these online stock trading comparisons so here ’s one on TradeKing and Scottrade .
Personally , I feel all these stock brokers are becoming more and more alike so it ’s becoming harder and harder to compete without price .
Here are some of the difference I found with the two brokers .
Trading Commissions Comparison
Equity Trades
– $ 4.95 a trade , broker assisted trade is also $ 4.95 .
Scottrade – $ 7 a trade , $ 17 for touch tone phone system and $ 27 for broker assisted trades .
Options Trades
TradeKing – $ 4.95 + $ 0.65 per contract
Scottrade – $ 7 + $ 1.25 per contract
Clearly , TradeKing is lower priced for trading .
Mutual Funds
TradeKing vs Scottrade – $ 14.95 vs $ 17
Margin Fees Schedule
Scottrade and TradeKing margin interest respectively
$ 0 – $ 9,999 – 7.75 % vs 6.50 %
$ 10,000 – $ 24,999 – 6.50 % vs 7.50 %
$ 25,000 – $ 49,999 – 6.50 % vs 7.25 %
$ 50,000 – $ 99,999 – 5.50 % vs 6.75 %
The list goes on but across the board , TradeKing is much cheaper to trade with .
So Is TradeKing Just Better in Every Way ?
On the surface , is cheaper and offers pretty much the same product as Scottrade .
However , the latter offers what it calls the Scottrader and the Scottrade Elite programs .
These programs are for high volume traders who are used to the proprietary trading platforms of the old days before the web .
As far as I can tell , the great part about using those platforms are :
that you can save the environment you are on so all the screens are at the same place every time you log in .
information is pushed to you .
In other words , the prices , news are updated automatically since of you needing to push the refresh button on your browser .
For those that will only trade with those platforms , then by all means but for the rest of us , the online versions are good enough .
In that regard , I would go with TradeKing .
Update : A reader alerted me that TradeKing is offering to reimbursed you for up to $ 150 in termination fees for anyone that switches over to them .
Update # 2 : Another reader is quick to point out that Scottrade also offers something similar as well , only that it ’s up to $ 100 .

Our economy has been through the wringer lately , and most people are looking for ways to cut back on their budgets .
Making sure that you have a little extra money saved in the bank is more important than ever .
Saving Money Is n’t Always Easy
For many of us our budgets already seem pretty tight , and it ’s hard to imagine where we ’ll be able to find more areas to cut .
If you look , however , you too can find ways to cut back .
Here are a few practical ways that you save some extra money this year .
50 Easy Ways To Save Money Every Month
10 Practical Ways To Save Money
Cut The Cable TV
Cutting your cable TV can save you a lot of money , and not just once , but every month .
The average cable bill can run anywhere from $ 40 - $ 120 every month .
Add that up over a year and you ’ve saved from $ 480 - $ 1440 !
Instead of watching cable , watch your favorite shows from most networks on a service like Hulu Philo or Sling , and then add in free streaming services to fill in the gaps .
Set up a cord cutting package like we have at our house , where you watch free broadcast TV using an antenna and DVR , use a cable TV alternative and free streaming services , while also using a media server to watch your own media like Plex .
Using a software like Media Mall ’s Playon software , you can stream most of your favorite streaming services that you ’re paying for and record them to watch later .
The cost ?
A one time fee of $ 40 for Playon .
Take A Personal Day To Find Better Insurance Rates
One thing that I ’ll do every couple years is take a personal day from work so that I can take an entire day just to focus on our insurance coverages , shop around and find better rates .
For example , last time I did this I was able to find better coverage on our auto and homeowner ’s insurance , for about $ 1100 less per year !
Cancel Subscription Services And Use Cheaper Alternatives
One thing we ’ve done in the past at our house is cancel our netflix subscription , and move to a cheaper alternative , renting movies at a Redbox .
For Netflix we were paying close to $ 15 / month , and only getting 2 - 3 movies a month .
In comparison for the same amount of movies rented at the Redbox less than a mile from our house , it cost us just over $ 3 .
If you can find a Redbox free rental code ( which are readily available ) , it can be even cheaper !
Use this tactic for other subscription services like newspapers or magazines .
Instead of paying subscription fees , just buy it on the newstand for the rare occasion that you want to read it .
Buy Things Used
Instead of buying that new car for 20 grand , buy a 2 - 3 year old car with low mileage of the same make and model for about half price .
I did this when buying my car recently , and we saved probably about 12 - 14 thousand dollars !
The tip works for other things as well .
Try it when buying clothing , books , electronics or other high ticket purchases .
Pack Your Lunches And Limit Eating Out
I used to think this tip was silly until we tried it at our house .
After doing our budget we realized just how much we were actually spending on lunches and dining out together .
Let ’s just say it was a lot more than we thought it was .
Even cut this spending in half and you ’ve probably saved a couple hundred / month .
Save Money At The Movies
If you ’re a movie buff like my wife and I , you can find a lot of ways to save money when you go to the movies .
Go to a matinee , see the movie at a second run theater , buy packages of tickets at a reduced rate , bring your own snacks , seek out free family movie days in the summer or join movie watcher loyalty clubs .
Wow , that was a mouthful .
Check out the link for more !
Maintain
Things
Keep up on the regular scheduled maintenance for your car ( oil changes , tire inflation , check fluid levels ) , as well as regular maintenance on your home .
Keeping up on the maintenance may not feel like you ’re saving money ( in fact you may be spending some ) , but it can mean that you ’ll save hundreds or thousands of dollars down the line because your things will last longer .
Give Yourself A Waiting Period
Are you prone to going out and buying things on a whim ?
Give yourself a waiting period within which you ca n’t make a purchase .
The more susceptible you are to spontaneous purchases , the longer your waiting period should be .
I like to wait at least 24 hours before making a decision to buy something , longer if the price tag is higher .
Saving up and paying cash is an even better idea , often you ’ll find by the time you ’ve saved up for the item , you do n’t really want it anymore .
Do n’t Shop When You ’re Hungry , And Make A List
One mistake that I make all the time is that I tend to go grocery shopping when I ’m ravenously hungry .
When I do that I often end up buying a bunch of groceries that we do n’t need , and that sometimes spoil before we can even eat them .
Go shopping after eating a meal , and only shop with a list .
Do n’t buy anything that is n’t on your list .
For more ways to save on your groceries , check out this post .
Save By Asking For A Discount
Often you can get a discount on the services you use , and the things you buy just by asking .
For example , call up your internet company and ask for a discount on your monthly bill .
Often they ’ll give you a reduced promotional rate for a limited time , or a reduced rate to not jump ship to another provider .
Another one we ’ve used is to ask for a discount on medical bills .
Often if you call up the hospital billing department you can save 10 - 20 % off of your bill just by asking , and paying cash .
We did this last year for some of my wife ’s medical bills .
If you ’re not sure you want to ask for a discount yourself , there are a ton of bill negotiation services that can get your rates lowered , for a percentage of the savings .
There Are Always More Ways To Save .

Take a jet engine hooked up to some big magnets , add some steam pipes , and what do you have ?
The comeback of some old - school technologies that could help solve our modern energy problem .
The idea is simple — generate both electricity and heat in the same place , but the potential benefits are big .
Unlike a traditional electric power plant , which can convert about 40 percent of its fuel into electricity but wastes the rest as heat , these combination plants capture that heat and use it to warm or cool buildings .
The efficiency of combined heat and power plants can reach into the 80 percent range .
If you hook up that plant to a network of steam pipes and electrical wires , you 've got the tools to power an entire campus or community .
Combined heat and power , or CHP , could get a a push from possible climate legislation .
And this week , the Department of Energy bet $ 156 million of stimulus funding on these steam - age ideas .
It fits with industrial , commercial and municipal interest in reducing fuel costs and environmental footprints .
" We do a lot of work with large commercial and industrial concerns , both public and private , and CHP is really starting to gain momentum , " said Brian Casey , CEO of SourceOne , the consulting division of environmental services giant , Veolia .
" Ultimately as a country , if we get our act together here about how we regulate carbon , CHP will be a tool in that battle . "
The United States could benefit by learning from its past .
In fact , the very first central power plant , Edison 's Pearl Street Station , produced both heat and power , but in the era of cheap , abundant energy , that idea was almost abandoned .
Today , most of the time , we make electricity and generate heat in different places .
We get our electricity for lighting and power from a central station located far away and transmitted to us through the grid .
Heating or cooling , on the other hand , is often accomplished with on - site boilers or electric radiators .
Both systems work less efficiently when they stand alone .
Together , waste heat generated during the process of making electricity can be scavenged and piped around to provide climate control .
In the early 20th century as our current energy system was being built , Americans " ignored the efficiencies of cogenerating electricity and steam heat at central plants in favor of less efficient oil and coal furnaces in each building , " wrote energy historian David Nye .
Heat and power got farther and farther apart .
Now , though , the century - old trend that accompanied the rise of electricity is being reversed .
Many industrial and commercial entities are choosing to build their own combined heat and power generating facilities .
In 1998 , there were only 46 gigawatts of CHP facilities in the United States .
By the end of 2008 , 85 gigawatts of CHP capacity had been built .
A DOE report released late last year found that CHP was already responsible for reducing American emissions by 248 million metric tons of CO2 , which is equivalent to taking 45 million cars off the road .
That 's a lot more than wind , solar or any of the other renewables .
They have such a big impact because they effectively double the amount of work that we get from burning the same amount of fossil fuel .
With the extra impetus to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to combat global warming , these electric plants that also use their excess heat could experience a lot more growth over the next 30 years .
To do so , though , they have substantial challenges to overcome .
For one , many of the regional benefits of CHP are not recognized by existing environmental and utility regulations .
Utilities resist CHP systems because they complicate their transmission infrastructure and they say that 's costly .
And people have grown used to having their power generated in some far off place and often object to the installation of a power plant nearby .
Despite these hurdles , CHP proponents push on .
Casey 's team worked with Biogen Idec , a biotech firm in Cambridge , Massachussets , to install a plant at the company 's new building .
After protracted negotiations with the local utility , they are now on good terms , but it was no easy task .
The plant itself is a mini-technological marvel that will pay for itself with energy savings in just four years .
It 's essentially a jet engine ( see photo above ) hooked up to magnets located in the basement of an office building .
" It 's subterranean , 30 feet underground .
There 's a beautiful mezzanine and atrium above it and the research scientists in offices , " Casey said .
" In the footprint of about 20,000 square feet is a combustion turbine ....
It turns a generator to make electricity and then we grab all the waste heat we can with a heat recovery steam generator . "
The electricity lights the building and the steam is used directly for heat or converted by absorption chillers for refrigeration .
It does n't produce all its own electricity , tapping into the local grid when extra power is needed .
But that 's not the only legacy network to which it 's connected .
" This specific project is blessed that it stayed connected not just to the electric network but stayed connected to the district steam network , " Casey said .
Though they are rarely noticed now , most of the big cities in America have some kind of subterranean steam system in place , a relic of the time when steam infrastructure was still being built .
And heating whole chunks of cities together , in what are known as district energy systems , has environmental benefits of its own .
" By combining the thermal needs of hundreds of buildings , district energy systems deliver economies of scale for employing equipment and technologies that are far more efficient and versatile than for individual buildings providing their own cooling and heating equipment , " argued Veolia CEO Oliver Barbaroux in a Forbes editorial .
( Veolia operates more district energy systems in the United States than does any other company . )
The systems are basically a series of huge underground steam pipes connected to boilers at a central station .
They can be a perfect complement for CHP systems when custom - built for an university like M.I.T. or the University of Florida or when a local steam system is available to tap into .
San Francisco is a great candidate for a CHP facility .
A set of boilers is already located near Mint Plaza , a newly remodeled and trendy area of town .
Around the corner from the nation 's fanciest coffee shop ( Blue Bottle 's flagship store ) , two smokestacks rise 100 feet into the sky .
They 're part of a steam power system that stretches back 100 years .
On the map , you can see the steam distribution system as it existed in 1917 .
It 's nearly the same today , except for a small , new line that runs to the enormous Westfield mall on Fifth and Market .
" There 's still some of the original piping , " said Wayne Wong , marketing manager for the plant , which is operated by Minneapolis - based NRG Thermal , a division of one of the nation 's largest utilities .
The inside of the plant is probably 100 degrees and louder than an AC / DC show .
The boilers are clanging away , supplying energy to 170 buildings with 37 million square feet of space in the city 's downtown core .
The photo below shows one of the main pipes that connects the plant to the underground system .
Right now , the plant only generates heat , but Wong said they 'd like to put in a CHP plant that could produce 50 megawatts of electricity and continue to supply steam to their existing customers .
It turns out , though , that hooking up the CHP system with the district energy system wo n't be easy .
" You know how it is , folks do n't want power plants in their backyards , " Wong said .
" Even if the money was OK , just to get permitting would take years and years and years to overcome the opposition to it . "
Perhaps , with the new emphasis on carbon emissions and local systems , more environmentally minded Americans will be willing to allow innovative fossil fuel power plants into their communities .
Even though they burn fossil fuels , CHP and steam plants hooked up to district energy systems are more efficient than other solutions .
They might use brown fuels , but they should make greens happy .

It ’s official .
Bill Veghte , Microsoft ’s senior VP for Windows business , told an audience of the Microsoft faithful at TechEd that Windows users should not switch to Vista .
Veghte said , “ If you ’re just starting your testing of Vista , with the [ Windows 7 ]
Release Candidate and the quality of that offering , I would switch over and do your testing on the [ Windows 7 ]
Release Candidate , and use that going forward . ”
In short , Microsoft is finally telling you what I ’ve been telling you all along : Vista is junk .
Microsoft has actually been doing this for over a year now .
First , in April 2008 , Ballmer described Vista as a “ work - in - progress . ”
Then , he said users should skip Vista in favor of Windows 7 in October ( http://blogs.computerworld.com/ballmer_says_skip_vista).
How many times must Microsoft tell its knee - jerk fan club that Vista was a mistake before they get it .
Now , Microsoft wants you to switch to Windows 7 .
Except , what a surprise , after the Vista fiasco , cash - strapped companies are n’t eager to try Windows 7 either .
Instead , they ’re sticking with XP .
Could it be that one reason why desktop Linux is finally grabbing some market share is that , discouraged by Microsoft ’s ‘ upgrade ’ paths and prices , users are finally willing to give alternatives a try ?
One can only hope .
In 1831 , Pyotr Smirnov was born to illiterate Russian serfs in a village so remote that walking at night required clanking metal sticks together to scare off the wolves lurking at forest 's edge .
But he had ambition and intelligence .
As a teenage apprentice to an innkeeper - uncle in a nearby town , he observed the mechanics of pricing and supply .
In his 30s he set up shop himself as a small - time liquor peddler .
By 1886 , he was selling two - thirds of Moscow 's vodka .
Soon he was purveyor to the czar , presiding over a company whose product saturated the vast Russian empire .

REUTERS / Jason Reed
( Reuters ) - Two U.S. Democratic lawmakers want Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to relax recently tightened standards for mortgages on new condominiums , saying they could threaten the viability of some developments and slow the housing - market recovery , the Wall Street Journal said .
In March , Fannie Mae FNM.
NFNM .P said it would no longer guarantee mortgages on condos in buildings where fewer than 70 percent of the units have been sold , up from 51 percent , the paper said .
Freddie Mac FRE .PFRE.N is due to implement similar policies next month , the paper said .
In a letter to the CEO ’s of both companies , Representatives Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , and Anthony Weiner warned that a 70 percent sales threshold “ may be too onerous ” and could lead condo buyers to shun new developments , according to the paper .
The legislators asked the companies to “ make appropriate adjustments ” to their underwriting standards for condos , the paper added .
In an interview with the paper , Weiner said the rules have “ had a real chill on the ability to get these condos sold , ” at a time when prices of condos have fallen enough to attract potential buyers .
In addition to the 70 percent sales threshold , Fannie Mae will also not purchase mortgages in buildings where 15 percent of owners are delinquent on condo association dues or where one owner has more than 10 percent of units , as the firm sees these as signals that a building could run into financial trouble , the paper added .
Both Fannie and Freddie are preparing a response to the lawmakers , according to the paper .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
The Nehru - Gandhi dynasty has been a force in Indian politics since independence
By Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News , Delhi
As India 's new cabinet was sworn in , the biggest applause was reserved for one of its youngest members , Agatha Sangma , who is all of 28 .
She was among several young faces who were brought into government by the Congress party to inject a sense of freshness and energy after its resounding poll victory .
But every single one of them belongs to political families .
Political nepotism appears to be a trend that is n't abating but seemingly spreading beyond the influential Nehru - Gandhi dynasty to a handful of clans across India .
So the formation of the new cabinet was held up because the chief of the southern Dravida Munnetra Khazagam ( DMK ) party wanted posts for his children and members of his extended family .
Even the smaller parties are often family fiefdoms with parents handing over the reins to their children .
' Subverting democracy '
It 's not a guarantee that just because you have a political background things will be easy for you
Agatha Sangma Jiten Jain who runs Youth For Equality , a political advocacy group , says increasingly politics is being seen as a lucrative business .
" Sons , daughters , relatives are becoming MPs .
This is disturbing .
You are moving towards a monarchy where one constituency is ruled by one family and 500 families will rule India . "
Youth for Equality put up a candidate in the election but she was routed by her better - funded opponent from a well - known political family .
" There are three to four political families that have five to six ministers in the cabinet .
Except for one or two , none of them have worked in the social domain , none of them have any political experience .
They have just come with the name of their fathers and grandfathers and got elected , " he says .
It 's not the voters who are at fault .
Vir Sanghvi , editor of the Hindustan Times newspaper says the parties are simply subverting democracy and freezing out the people .
" Often the voters are given two or three choices and all of those choices are dynasts .
The internal democracy that we should be seeing in parties is almost entirely missing .
" So while there may be democracy when it comes to elections there is no democracy within parties .
It 's almost always the dynasts who get nominated , " he says .
Because of a shortage of avenues you need your parental help otherwise you 'll be at the bottom of the social rung
Sociologoist Dipankar Gupta
The young political beneficiaries of this trend argue that they have earned the right to be here .
Agatha Sangma , who is the daughter of a former Speaker of parliament , accepts that a political background , especially at a young age , is a huge advantage but it 's not enough to succeed .
" It 's not a guarantee that just because you have a political background things will be easy for you .
It gives you an initial advantage but after that you have to be able to perform and only that will determine your political future , " she says .
Family business
So at a time when India is emerging as a major international player , the world 's largest democracy and an economic giant whose companies are at the forefront of global buy - outs - what can explain this apparently regressive step ?
Priyanka Gandhi ( left ) is often urged to join her brother Rahul in politics " It 's an extremely profitable business , people who become ministers tend to make a lot of money , " says Vir Sangvi .
" There 's also a sense , particularly in the smaller parties , that if you allow proper succession you lose control of the party .
It 's much more tempting to run it like a family business . "
Then there 's the tradition in India of children , usually male but increasingly female , going into the family profession .
Sociologist Dipankar Gupta says that unlike their Western counterparts , middle - class Indians feel that they cannot afford to leave the family profession , be it medicine , law , or increasingly , politics .
" The gap between the rich and the poor is so large that nobody wants to risk sliding to the bottom of the social scale .
And because of a shortage of avenues you need your parental help otherwise you 'll be at the bottom of the social rung . "
So why do the parties select people from political families ?
Mr Gupta says it has to do with a vast system of patronage between the politicians and the parties where they both end up favouring each other often at the cost of ordinary people .
But for many , this is extremely worrying for Indian democracy .
" If this continues , you will have the emergence of a political caste - a sort of Brahminical caste .
Indian democracy will cease to be participatory , it will cease to be a way of empowering people .
To get elected to parliament you will have to be born into political families , " says Mr Sanghvi .
" The whole point of democracy in India is that poor people should be able to enter politics and change their lives .
" If there 's just going to be a class of new Brahmins who get elected because the peasants vote them into power , the consequences for India will be devastating . "

I love , love , love Harry Potter series and I am not ashamed to admit it .
There ’s something about this universe that J.K. Rowling created .
Yes , it ’s very dark at times , but it ’s still kind and bright at the same time .
The magic just pulls me in and each time I read those books ( so far I read them all twice ) , I do n’t want to let them go , I do n’t want the adventures to stop .
I really love reading , and I spent my childhood and youth reading a lot of wonderful books , but somehow , although I liked them and reread some of them a few times , I never had an urge to reread a book right after finishing it .
But after I turned the last page in the last Harry Potter ’s book I could only do so much to stop myself from picking up the first book again .
Surprisingly , food is actually a prominent subject in those books .
Starting with the first time Harry met Hagrid and they had sizzling , plump , juicy and slightly burnt sausages .
Oh , my , just typing those words makes my mouth water .
And what about the famous feasts at Hogwarts ?
“ He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table : roast beef , roast chicken , pork chops and lamb chops , sausages , bacon and steak , boiled potatoes , roast potatoes , chips , Yorkshire pudding , peas , carrots , gravy , ketchup and , for some strange reason , mint humbugs . ”
And although I try not to eat that much meat now and I recently tried being a vegan for a few weeks , it makes my stomach growl .
It ’s a carnivore heaven .
And then there are desserts .
“ When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before .
A moment later the puddings appeared .
Blocks of ice cream in every flavour you could think of , apple pies , treacle tarts , chocolate eclair and jam doughnuts , trifle , strawberries , jelly , rice pudding … ”
I am not too familiar with British cuisine , so the first time I read about Treacle Tart I did n’t think too much about it .
But it is Harry ’s favourite dessert , so I read about it again and again and at some point I looked this word up in a dictionary .
I was disappointed – apparently English - Russian dictionary translated the word as molasses and what ’s so tasty about that ?
I mean it ’s a great ingredient for a ginger bread , but for a tart ?
And only a few months later I accidentally saw a recipe for a Treacle Tart in one of my books and it turned out that despite the name , it ’s actually made out of Golden Syrup .
It took me a long time , but I finally made it and …
I can see why it ’s Harry ’s favourite !
recipe adapted from Caramel by Trish Deseine
for 3 small 11×5 cm forms
For the pastry
Chilled butter , cut into cubes – 1/6 cups ( 37 ml )
All - purpose flour – 1/2 cup+1/8 cup ( 150 ml )
Soft brown sugar – 1 tablespoon ( 15 ml )
Chilled water – 1 tablespoon ( 15 ml )
Chilled vodka – 1 tablespoon ( 15 ml )
For the filling
Golden Syrup ( or Maple Syrup or Corn Syrup ) – 1/3 cup ( 75 ml )
Butter – 3/4 tablespoon ( 10 ml )
Whipping cream – 1/6 cup ( 37 ml )
Egg , lightly beaten – 1
– To make the pastry , mix the butter , flour , and sugar together in a food processor , or in a mixing bowl , using your fingertips to combine , until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs .
– Make a hollow in the center and pour in water and vodka ( if not enough , add a little bit more vodka ) to make a dough .
– Shape into a ball , cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes .
– Roll out the pastry and use it to line the forms .
Chill in the refrigerator for another 40 - 60 minutes .
– Preheat the over to 350F ( 180C ) and put a baking sheet in the over to heat up .
– Gently heat the Golden Syrup in a small saucepan .
– Add the butter and stir until the mixture is smooth .
– Remove the saucepan from the heat and gently stir in the cream and the beaten egg .
Be careful not to scramble the egg , if , however , egg white cooks a little , then pour the mixture through a fine thieve to get rid off the egg white lumps .
– Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake for 30 - 35 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the filling has set .
– Allow the tart to cool for a few minutes before serving with whipped cream .
Just to show the size of the tart forms .
I had three of those from the recipe .

Watch the trailer for It Felt Like a Kiss guardian.co.uk
Adam Curtis has gone a bit mad .
The insultingly gifted documentary maker behind The Century Of The Self and The Power Of Nightmares seemed rather quiet of late .
In fact , since his 2007 BBC2 series The Trap , his only visible pieces of work were two short ( and superb ) mini-documentaries he created for my BBC4 series Screenwipe and Newswipe .
People kept asking me what he was up to .
I assumed he was chipping away at some new documentary which would be announced when he was ready .
He 's ready now .
He 's made a new documentary called It Felt Like A Kiss .
Except it is n't just a documentary .
It 's also a piece of interactive theatre , with music composed by Damon Albarn and performed by the Kronos Quartet .
And it does n't take place in a cinema or concert hall , but across five floors of a deserted office block in Manchester .
About now a sizable percentage of you will be thinking " that sounds wanky " , and starting to back away .
Do n't .
Because it 's also ... well , it 's also a funhouse .
To be honest , no one really knows what it is .
After a struggle , Curtis himself says it 's " a psycho- political theme experience in which you become a central character .
It 's going to be frightening .
A walk of enchantment and menace . "
On the official website , viewers are advised that it 's " not suitable for those of a nervous disposition " .
" Please wear suitable footwear , " it adds , ominously .
Curtis is collaborating with the theatre company Punchdrunk , which specialises in staging innovative , site - specific performances that defy description .
They tend to leave their audiences , or rather visitors , or rather participants , babbling excitedly for days afterwards .
The marriage between Punchdrunk 's theatrical dreamworld and Curtis 's virtuoso film - making skills might tip some completely over the edge .
I have n't seen any of the live - action elements yet , but what I 've seen of the film is astonishing .
If you 're familiar with his previous work , you 'll know he specialises in creating mesmerising collages , simultaneously impish and forbidding ; utterly accessible yet often giddyingly deep .
Yes , they 're political documentaries , but simply calling them " political documentaries " is a bit like simply calling Spike Milligan a biped .
They 're complex ideological arguments and emotional tone poems in one .
They 're frightening , fun and entirely unique .
But where his preceding works have occasionally been a touch eccentric , this one takes the piss .
It is completely and utterly demented - in a positive way .
I 'm not saying it does n't make sense ; if anything , it forges its own new brand of coherence whether you like it or not .
This is a documentary running on alien software .
I 'm at a loss to describe it .
For starters , the trademark Curtis voiceover has gone completely , replaced instead by occasional , simple captions .
Music is at the forefront .
Ominous soundscapes and bubblegum pop weave their way around the images : archive news , Hollywood movies .
It 's hypnotic .
And the editing .
One particular segment , set to River Deep , Mountain High , feels like being repeatedly stung on the mind by a hallucinogenic jellyfish while inhaling huge clouds of history through a pipe .
The marriage of Phil Spector 's wall of sound and Curtis 's wall of images is so perfect , so strange and striking , it jangled around my head for hours afterward .
And I only saw it in a tiny window on an Apple Mac , in a corner of Curtis 's tape - strewn " lair " at BBC Television Centre .
God knows what it 'll be like on a big screen as part of a live - action , funhouse - style experience .
It 'll probably kill people .
So what 's it about ?
In a roundabout way , it 's about you .
But it 's also about the golden age of pop , when the US rose to supreme power .
It encompasses everything from Rock Hudson , Lou Reed , Saddam Hussein , a chimp and Lee Harvey Oswald .
It 's a heady brew .
" I think it 's a fascinating period , " says Curtis .
" I wanted to do a film about what it actually felt like to live through that time ...
Where you could see the roots of the uncertainties we feel today , the things they did out on the dark fringes of the world that they did n't really notice at the time , which would then come back to haunt us . "
It 's a common theme in Curtis 's work : he 's not interested in conspiracy theories , but rather with the unforeseen consequences of ideas throughout history , and their impact on a deeply personal level .
" The way power works in the world is : they tell you stories that make sense of the world .
That 's what America did after the second world war .
It told you wonderful dreamlike stories about the world ...
And at that same time , you were encouraged to rise up and ' become an individual ' , which also made the whole idea of America attractive to the rest of the world .
But then this very individualism began to corrode it .
The uncertainties began in people 's minds .
Uncertainty about ' what is the point of being an individual ? ' "
" The politics of our time are deeply embedded in this idea of individualism , " he continues , " which is far wider than Westminster , consumerism or anything like that .
It 's how you feel .
People think , ' Oh , if it 's within me it must be true . '
But it 's not the be-all and end - all .
It 's not an absolute .
It 's a way of feeling and thinking which is a product of a particular time and power .
The notion that you only achieve your true self if your desires , your dreams , are satisfied ...
It 's a political idea .
That 's the central dynamic of our life . "
Because you 're worth it ?
He nods .
" Because you 're worth it . "
He gestures out of the window , towards the Westfield Centre , Europe 's biggest and most eerily calming shopping mall .
" That 's what Westfield is about .
What you desire is the most important thing .
But a great paradox of our time is that what you desire may not be coming from within you .
" The iPhone is a good example , " he adds .
" People really feel they want one - to express themselves .
But they all want one , at the same time .
Where does that come from ?
From within or without ?
Because we live in an age where the individual is paramount and everything is seen from the perspective of ' you ' , we 've lost sight of the bigger forces at work .
Which has limited us .
Not only in our understanding of the world ; it 's made us very powerless .
I think that 's what I 'm really trying to get at in this . "
Does that sound right to you ?
Chances are it does .
So go along .
I 'm sworn to secrecy over much of what 's going to happen inside that five - storey Manchester building , but it 's fair to say that the documentary gradually starts to fragment and ... well , you 'll have an experience , put it that way .
You 'll like that , you individual .
You crave experience .
Curtis hopes this one will give you pause for thought .
" What I 'm hoping they 'll do is pull back like in a helicopter and look at themselves and think about how they 're a product of history , and of power , and politics , as much as a product of their own little inner desires .
We 're all part of a big historical age .
That 's just what we are .
And , sometimes , we forget . "
In summary , from what I can gather , It Felt Like A Kiss is both the craziest yet crookedly rational project I 've ever heard about .
Hearing Curtis talk about that huge subject , that huge building , that brink - of - madness , reality - blurring feel , there are a few unmistakeable parallels with Synecdoche , New York , Charlie Kaufman 's recent film , in which Philip Seymour Hoffman takes control of an infinitely huge Manhattan warehouse and attempts to stage a boundary - shattering show that will sum up the entirety of human experience .
He over - reaches and winds up creating a work of ever - expanding fractal madness .
Curtis , I think , has gone a bit mad , too - but to precisely the right degree .
The world of tomorrow
TV industry !
Here 's a little bombshell for you .
From now on , all of Curtis 's work will be produced first and foremost for the internet .
It will be hosted at bbc.co.uk / adamcurtis ( coming soon ) .
Go there to find a trailer for It Felt Like A Kiss .
An hour - long cut of the whole thing will be placed on the site on the last day of the Manchester International Festival ( MIF ) .
It will also host his next two projects : " A long thing about our complicated relationship to the Congo over the last 100 years and how our idea of nature as a sacred yet terrifying realm has risen up during that same time . "
That will be followed by a piece about " the political and cultural ideas that underlie the internet - and the idea that we are all linked in an interconnected web - out of which can come a new form of democracy . "

YOU ARE NOW ON THE CUTTING EDGE
New World Order planners can possibly " take over the world by projecting holographic images into the sky while beaming thoughts directly into our heads , telling us to accept the new ' god ' of their design . "
[ HAARP : The Ultimate Weapon Of The Conspiracy , by Jerry E. Smith , p. 15 ; New Age adherent ]
When I read this , my blood ran cold , since I was immediately reminded of Jesus ' prophetic words in Matthew 24:24 , that the deception at the End of the Age would be so very , very good that it would involve " ... great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect . "
When most people read this passage , their focus is on the extreme deception foretold , not on the fact that our Lord is warning us that this deception will take the form of " great signs and wonders " .
Not only has New Age author , Jerry Smith , warned us in the quote , above , that HAARP technology has given New World Order planners the technological capability to carry out such a global grand scheme , but another New Age leader , Peter Lemesurier , has similarly warned us .
" Belief sometimes needs a physical crutch .
Various commentators have suggested that , even during the Exodus itself , the semi-legendary Cloud of the Presence may , like the equally - legendary pillar of fire and smoke which accompanied the long march , have been some kind of technological phenomenon .
Certainly , therefore , the use of such special effects should not be ruled out on this occasion [ appearance of Antichrist ] . "
[ Lemesurier , The Armageddon Script , p. 236 ]
Note the use of the words , " special effects " in the quote above ; you can read " great [ lying ] signs and wonders " .
The Illuminati are putting us on notice that they are going to target the entire world with their " special effects " .
Christians should understand that we are the ones with the largest bullseye painted on our backs .
We are the # 1 enemy of the Illuminati and are targeted for special destruction , and elimination .
I find it highly significant that , as political , religious , and economic signs increasingly point toward the End of the Age prophecies of the globalist Kingdom of Antichrist , Hollywood has gained ever increasing capabilities to produce movies that are so very , very realistic .
New
Age writings are plain in their belief that the " signs and wonders " attending the appearance of their Christ will be very technological in nature , much like a huge Hollywood script .
Speaking of scripts , listen to the last words of Peter Lemesurier , as he finishes his concluding section as to how the Christ [ Antichrist ] will be able to deceive the peoples of the world into worshipping him as God :
" Their script is now written , subject only to last - minute editing and stage - directions .
The stage itself , albeit as yet in darkness , is almost ready .
Down in the pit , the subterranean orchestra is already tuning up .
The last - minute , walk - on parts are even now being filled .
Most of the main actors ... have already taken up their roles .
Soon it will be time for them to come on stage , ready for the curtain to rise .
The time for action will have come . "
[ Lemesurier , The Armageddon Script , p. 252 ]
New
Age writings have always claimed that their Christ will be acting on a world - wide stage , according to a prewritten script , just as Lemesurier writes , above .
This deliberate and careful scripting has been carried out by the most brilliant men imaginable , writing with demonic supernatural assistance .
No major event by a major actor or actress [ Political and Key Business Leader ] is spontaneous ; all such major events are carefully scripted .
For example , when President Clinton speaks , he is following a carefully planned script .
Some New age authors have even been so explicit as to make their plans public .
Christian author , Constance Cumbey quotes New Age author , David Spangler as he made it quite clear how these " lying signs and wonders " accompanying the appearance of the New Age Christ are technologically feasible .
Cumbey writes :
" I have learned that the [ New Age ] Movement has devoted a great deal of research and attention to the use of holographic images .
These are three - dimensional images created in space by use of laser beams .
David Spangler said in a meeting in Southfield , Michigan , February 1 , 1982 , that laser beam projectors had been installed for use on top of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , Episcopal , in New York City .
" I talked to lighting experts to see what laser beam projectors are capable of and I was told they can be beamed onto telecommunications satellites .
The New Agers have several of these at their disposal .
When the lasers bounce from the satellite back to earth , the light rays can be bent in such a manner as to appear that flames are coming from the sky .
These satellites can also be used to project a three - dimensional holographic image viewable by up to one - third of the earth 's population .
There is even technology to make the image speak in the language of the areas to which it is beamed . "
[ Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow , pg. 24 , published in 1983 ]
Cumbey reminisced how she thought of a particular Scripture upon learning of this technology .
She remembered this Scripture :
" And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men , And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ...
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed . "
[ Revelation 13:13 - 15 , Emphasis added ]
WHO IS THE AUTHORITY GRANTING THIS POWER [ KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY ] ?
These words , " had power " intrigue me greatly , especially since they are used in direct conjunction with the " lying signs and wonders " by which Antichrist will deceive the vast majority of all the peoples in the world .
If the forces of Antichrist are going to have the " power " [ ability , knowledge ] to carry out these visual deceptions , by whose authority did they receive this power ?
From whom did this special " power " come ?
We get the answer in several verses of Revelation .
" And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword . "
[ Rev 6:4 ]
We know from Rev 6:1 that this particular power came directly from Jesus Christ as he opened the First Seal .
" And when he had opened the fourth seal ...
And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him .
And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth . "
[ Rev 6:7 -8 ]
Once again , we see that the power given the forces of Antichrist flows directly from Jesus Christ .
" And there was given unto him [ Antichrist ] a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months . "
[ Rev 13:5 ]
Here , we see that Satan gave the power to Antichrist to speak highly blasphemous statements against Jesus Christ and to enable him to rule for the last 42 months of the Tribulation Period .
But , Satan received the power from Jesus Christ .
" And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations . "
[ Rev 13:7 ]
Jesus Christ gives the forces of Antichrist the " power " to overcome
His saints in the most unbelievable persecution in all history .
" And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire . "
[ Rev 16:8 ]
Here we see Jesus Christ empowering this angel with Divine ability to scorch men with fire , the fire of the Sun .
In each of these five instances , the word ' power ' in the original Greek meant " ability " , " competency " , " mastery over " , and " superhuman " .
The word is Strong 's G1849 , ' exousia ' , and is power granted by a superhuman outside force .
In other words , Jesus Christ is prophesied to allowSatan to give the forces of Antichrist special " ability , competency , and mastery over " the knowledge as to how to carry out these specific acts of Divine Judgment .
We have long maintained this is the only reason our scientists now have the ability , the knowledge , to control weather and the storms thereof .
We have also regularly stated in the course of this ministry that Satan could not carry out all of God 's prophecies concerning the End of the Age with the technology existing in 1900 ; he needed modern technology .
In our opinion , God has allowed Satan to communicate to his members of Satanic secret societies immense knowledge that has led to our 20th Century explosion of scientific know - how .
Throughout history , many of the greatest minds have gravitated to the secret societies because they longed to increase their knowledge , and to possess knowledge not given to the common masses of society .
Consider the men who were members of secret societies that have had such great influence on our daily lives :
1. Pythagoras -- originator of much of our knowledge of Geometry .
He left his Greek home to move to Egypt to join the secret society devoted to the study mathematics and geometry .
Today , Pythagoras is thought of so highly by occultists of all stripes that we might rightly call this admiration ' worship ' .
Pythagoras was an adept in the Egyptian and Babylonian Satanic Mysteries , from which he learned the three occult sciences of music , mathematics [ including Geometry ] , and astronomy [ New Age author , Elizabeth van Buren , The Secrets of the Illuminati , p. 33 , also Nesta Webster , Secret Societies and Subversive Movements , 1924 , p. 6 ]
2. Benjamin Franklin , inventor extraordinare -- Member of the Rosicrucian secret society , and hobnobbed with Freemasons .
3. Thomas Edison , inventor of the light bulb -- Member of the House of Theosophy
4. Henry Ford , inventor of the mass production method of assembling vehicles -- Member of the House of Theosophy
5. Inventor of the Xerox copy machine -- Member of the House of Theosophy
6. Marcel Vogel , one of the first inventors of the computer , has been giving speeches to New Age audiences for almost two decades now , claiming he received the initial knowledge as to how to use the characteristics of Magnetism to build a computer from a Guiding Spirit during a meditation dream !
[ Constance Cumbey , Editorial : Underemphasis Of Love Is As Bad Or Worse As An Overemphasis Of Love " , New Age Monitor newsletter , June / July , 1989 , p. 1 ]
7. Apple , Inc. , priced their first computer at $ 666 to demonstrate the occult basis of computer technology .
8. Master D.K. , speaking through his channeler , Alice A. Bailey , claims that the atomic secrets were revealed to human scientist by the Masters of the Logos [ Externalisation of the Hierarchy , Lucis Publishing , New York , 1957 , p. 190 - 1 , 548 ] .
Today , this explosion of information has reached critical mass , doubling every 10 months , with many of the discoveries leading to Antichrist activities , such as genetic engineering of the human body , creating " new " human beings , and dealing in human body parts deliberately grown for transplant .
This information brings us back to the subject of " power being given " to create the " lying signs and wonders " of the Antichrist .
Most people have no difficulty understanding that these " lying signs and wonders " will undoubtedly be used to produce the staged appearance of Antichrist .
TIME FOR A FAKE RAPTURE ?
However , these same " lying signs and wonders " could possibly be used against the Christian Church at the most dynamic time in the history of the Times of the Gentiles , i.e. , before and during the appearance of Antichrist .
What might be the purpose of the Illuminati to stage just such a fake rapture ?
[ This is presupposing the technology does , indeed , exist , as the Illuminati claims ] .
1 . To thoroughly throw panic , confusion , and despair into the ranks of their most mortal enemy , Fundamental Born - Again Christians .
Many genuinely saved Christians will be tremendously puzzled when the Rapture for which they have been expectantly and patiently awaiting has occurred , and they were NOT taken .
One of my friends reported he once had a dream that Jesus returned for His Church , and he was not taken ; he was thoroughly awakened from his sleep over this nightmare , and was badly shaking !
At least for a short time , Christians will be thoroughly shaken by the fact that they were still firmly planted on earth , after a rapture occurred which they thought was genuine .
Their faith will be tested like never before .
2 . To sow extreme discord into the ranks of genuine Born Again believers .
When genuinely saved Christians discover that their pastor is still on earth also , many will become very angry .
After all , they had followed his teaching , his leading , and his counsel , with the apparent net result being that Jesus Christ rejected both their pastor and them !
On the Sunday morning following the Rapture , a lot of genuinely saved pastors will face a very hostile following .
I believe the initial response will be one of a tremendous fissure opening up among the true brethren .
3 . To validate the ministries and Apostate teachings , of Liberal ministers and their churches .
If this fake Rapture includes the " disappearance " of many Liberal pastors and teachers who have rejected the Deity of Jesus Christ , His uniqueness , and many other cardinal doctrines , then the vast majority of people not religious might think that their teachings were correct , after all .
This lie will then encourage the rest of the population of the Western world to embrace their Ecumenical doctrine .
Since the end result aimed for by these Apostate religious leaders is the establishment of a global religion that embraces ALL religions , this faked Rapture would encourage the unsaved to go in this direction at precisely the time when Antichrist will be making his staged appearance .
Of course , these Apostate religious leaders would not have really disappeared but will have just gone into hiding until no one cares anymore about the faked rapture .
As you consider this possibility , remember that the vast majority of the unsaved do not critically think anymore ; they will be mightily led by the nose by the Liberal Media , and will likely believe any lie , no matter how transparent to the thinking individual .
4 . To try to cause as many Christians as possible to lose their faith ; this is likely to occur because many Christians have been led to accept false teaching concerning some Bible prophecies , or because they are weak on understanding key doctrine .
The Illuminati is also weak on Biblical doctrine , and so do not realize that no one genuinely saved can ever lose their salvation .
Their goal would be to cause as many as possible to lose what faith they had , even to the point of many committing suicide .
Truly , a fake rapture would shake people 's faith like no other event in world history .
It would require every genuinely Born Again believer to take a firm stand upon the Bible doctrine that states unequivocally that all those " who trust in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved " .
[ Acts 16:31 ; John 3:16 - 18 in Jesus ' own Words ; Romans 10:9 ]
Satan loves to attack Christian 's faith ; it is his favorite tactic , and the one most commonly used against true Christians .
One of the most troubling trends in Protestant Christianity in the past four decades has been the belief that doctrine really does not matter , that what really matters is experience , specifically the experience of speaking in tongues .
The entire Pentecostal Movement is terribly weak in doctrine , and is emphasizing an experience of speaking in tongues , which Satan can counterfeit – and does counterfeit -- in Buddhism , Hinduism , and Black Magick Witchcraft .
In the immediate aftermath of a fake rapture , every Christian 's faith will be tested and shaken to the highest degree ; at this moment , only the firm anchor of doctrine will save a person 's faith .
Is this possible event what Jesus had in mind when He said :
" Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like :
He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great . "
[ Luke 6:47 - 49 ; Emphasis added ]
I have heard numerous sermons on this passage , emphasizing that part of the application is to the trials and tribulations of a person 's life , but that a part of the application is to the trials and tribulations of the End of the Age .
This latter view is that the Divine Judgments during the 7 - year Tribulation Period will constitute the greatest storm possible on a person , and that only those whose foundation is truly Jesus Christ will " endure to the end " .
Certainly , genuinely Born Again believers are going to be shaken by the thought that they had missed the Rapture of the Church , that Jesus Christ did not consider them " worthy to escape the trials coming upon the whole world to try the whole world " [ Luke 21:36 ] .
These Christians will have to return to the basic facts of their salvation , undergirded by the promises of salvation in the Word of God .
Such people will survive such an experience , but those whose faith is not genuine , and who do not know their Biblical doctrine , may lose their faith at this point .
They will be like the man in the last sentence of this passage , above , whose Christian faith is " without a foundation " , resulting in their eternal ruin .
I find it highly instructive to realize that , when Job was under the false attack from his " friends " , he fell back to his fail - safe defensive position of his faith .
Time and time again , Job fell back to his faith , from which he refused to be shaken [ Job 1:20 - 21 ; 9:20 - 22 ; 10:7-8 ; 13:15 ; 19:25 ]
Likewise , if a fake rapture occurs , truly Born - Again believers will be forced to retreat back into their impenetrable bunker of faith , just as did Job ; but those people who do not possess faith will be shaken so severely in their mind and heart they will lose whatever faith in Jesus Christ they did posses .
Certainly , a fake Rapture would cause the greatest spiritual weeding out of all time , separating the genuine Christian from the genuinely counterfeit .
The biggest question concerning this possible severe shaking of a Christian 's belief by a fake rapture is whether God would allow such a severe shaking .
Is there ever any indication that God deliberately allows Satan to REALLY shake a person 's faith , to test that faith , and to prove it genuine ?
Of course , there is just such an example and his name is Job .
[ Job 1:6-12 , 21 ; 2:1-7 ; 3:1 ; 10:1-8 ; 13:15 ; 17:1 ; 23:10 ; after Job 's faith remained unshaken , in spite of the erroneous " counsel " of his " friends " , God restores all to Job , plus much more -- 42:12 - 17 ;
God allowed Satan to bring these three worthless friends to counsel Job , causing even more grief with their false counsel . ]
In James 1:2 - 12 , we see that we are promised that God will allow our faith to be shaken ; verse 12 tells us that when these trials and temptations are finished , and we have stayed the course , we shall be given the Crown of Life , which God has promised .
If God allows Satan to severely shake the faith of tens of millions of Christians with a fake rapture just before the appearance of Antichrist , He will be acting in full accord with His Nature , His promises , and His Scripture .
5 . To give the Illuminati the excuse to seize some of their Christian enemy , causing many Christians to think a " partial rapture " had occurred .
The Illuminati has many Christian leaders on their Hit List , and would love to have an opportunity to seize and possibly martyr them , so their testimony as to the truth of what is occurring during the appearance of Antichrist would be silenced .
Just prior to the fake rapture , agents could secretly seize many such Christian leaders , causing the illusion they had been raptured , thus spawning a false perception that a " partial rapture " had occurred .
This tactic would further sow confusion , panic , and discord among the brethren , while eliminating the most effective witness against the appearance of Antichrist .
As you consider the Illuminati , consider whom they are ; they are the most prominent , and powerful , Black Magick Satanists in world history .
They are supported , possessed , and guided by the most evil spirits of all time .
Therefore , please allow the Apostle Paul to inform us as to the true nature of the Illuminati .
" Put on God 's whole armor ... that you may be able successfully to stand up against all the strateges and the deceits of the devil .
For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [ contending only with physical opponents ] but against the despotism , against the powers , against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness , against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly [ supernatural ] sphere .
Therefore put on God 's complete armor , that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day ... and having done all the crisis demands , to stand firmly in the your place .
Stand therefore ... "
[ Ephesians 6:11 - 14a , Amplified Bible Commentary ; Emphasis added ]
We Christians are up against a most formidable spiritual array of wickedness , straight out of the Pit of Hell .
Furthermore , notice that Paul lists only one offensive weapon at our disposal , the sword .
which is the Word of God .
If we are forced by this fake rapture to retreat back to our bastion of faith , our only offensive weapon will be to quote " Thus saith the Lord " to ourselves and to Satan .
But , if a person is woefully weak on Bible Scripture and therefore , doctrine , they might not have the offensive weapon with which to preserve their faith .
Doctrine can only be learned from studying Scripture ; doctrine IS THE anchor of the soul .
Read it ; learn it ; apply it !
TIME FOR THE NEXT BLOW
But , then , such a fake rapture would set up genuine believers with another huge Illuminist blow !
As we reported in NEWS1332 [ " Confirmation of Major Discrepancies In Standard Prophecy Teachings " ]
American Christians have been set up to believe that the Church will be Raptured before the appearance of Antichrist , so that we will never see this demonically - possessed leader .
During a Bible Prophecy conference held at Tremont Temple in downtown Boston , in October , 1999 , I had the opportunity to speak with a leading Evangelical prophetic speaker about several matters in which I had special interest .
During a break on Saturday , the second day of the conference , I was able to approach this speaker .
We encourage you to read this report in detail , for we do not have the time to cover it here ; but , he admitted that the standard prophecy teaching that the Church will be Raptured before Antichrist will appear -- based upon 2 Thessalonians 2 -- is based solely on his [ and other 's ] private interpretation .
When I protested strongly to him that 2 Thessalonians 2 does not actually say that believers will never see Antichrist , he calmly agreed , but then said , " That is my interpretation " , in contradiction of 2 Peter 1:20 .
This is also the interpretation of standard prophecy teaching today , and has resulted in millions of Christians falsely believing they will never see Antichrist because they will be taken in the Rapture beforehand .
Therefore , such Christians will possibly suffer two double whammies -- first , they will be shaken to discover they have not been taken in a false Rapture which they believe to have been real ; secondly , they will be immediately treated to the spectacle of Antichrist arising on the world scene , in full view of TV cameras , displaying unprecedented occult power , lying signs and wonders , and deceiving multitudes , an event they have been conditioned to believe will never happen .
Such Christians will be overwhelmed with doubt , because they thoroughly believed the standard prophecy line that was never based upon Scripture in the first place , but only on the " private interpretation " of a phalanx of Bible prophecy teachers .
THE CURSE OF THE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION
Quite commonly , we see the terrible impact that misguided expectations can have on a person 's life .
Newlyweds commonly face this problem , as husband and wife come to grips with a reality that does not match their previous expectations .
Wall Street is particularly susceptible to the blows of unrealistic expectations ; on numerous occasions , we have seen stock go down dramatically for a company that had just announced record profits .
Why does this occur ?
It occurs because investors had unrealistic expectations ; they had expected even more profits than were announced .
Christians thus indoctrinated to the Rapture occurring before Antichrist arises will thus have been delivered a double whammy blow .
Most of these Christians also do not know when the 7 - year Tribulation Period actually begins .
Most erroneously believe it begins when Antichrist arises , even though Daniel 9:27 makes it quite clear that the 7 - year period begins the moment Antichrist " confirms the Covenant " with the " many " -- Israel 's leaders .
Thus , a period of time will occur from the moment Antichrist arises to the moment he convinces the Jewish Orthodox leadership he is their Messiah , thus prompting Jewish religious leaders to announce to their followers that this man is their Messiah .
Antichrist can confirm the Covenant only after being officially accepted by Jewish religious leadership .
Thus , when the appearance of Antichrist occurs shortly after the fake rapture , the same Christians who have been misled about the timing of the true Rapture will also be further confused by the fact that they are now actually witnessing the appearance of Antichrist .
Rather than concluding that their teaching on this matter was in error , I am afraid many will assume that the whole of Bible doctrine is wrong , and will abandon their faith , thus causing their spiritual house to fall -- and " great will be the fall " of it .
I believe it quite possible that such a fake rapture might occur .
It would cause the truly Born Again Believer to thoroughly examine his / her belief , their faith , and to hold on to their faith until the True Rapture occurs -- which is quite possibly after the fake rapture , and after staged appearance of Antichrist , but before he " confirms the Covenant " with Jewish leaders .
Would you be spiritually ready for a fake rapture ?
Would your faith be mature enough ?
Is your soul anchored to the Rock of Jesus Christ ?
Can you can say with the Apostle Paul , " I know in Whom I have Believed ? "
Would your understanding of Bible prophecy be mature enough to realize you have been misled ?
Or would you throw your faith and the entire Bible , into the trash heap , and abandon Jesus Christ ?
I do not know enough about the specific technology to know exactly how such a fake rapture would be carried out ; however , I do know that such an event is technologically possible .
I believe it would take only a couple of elements to deceive the unsaved world and the undiscerning Christian .
1 . If all the major networks suddenly simultaneously broke through to announce that tens of thousands of people are suddenly missing .
2 . If these networks showed a film prepared beforehand , where people will be shown to be here on earth one second and mysteriously gone the next .
3 . If " experts " were suddenly interviewed saying that this may be the foretold Rapture of the Church
4. Maybe , just maybe , 3 - dimensional holographic images might project people on sparsely occupied streets , seemingly walking down the street , and then having them disappear right in front of real people 's eyes .
This would produce the eye - witness accounts so needed to give this event the weighty credibility .
I know the technical problem exists of having the 3 - dimensional holographic images superimposing themselves upon real people , a problem that would blow the cover of the operation ; however , I have learned not to underestimate the technological capabilities of Hollywood .
Certainly , the news accounts simply would not air the testimony of someone who claimed he or she saw the holographic images on top of real people .
The vast majority of mankind would believe it ; too many Christians would also be convinced they had missed the real Rapture of the Church .
Additionally , I know that the Illuminati is fully aware that each Christian badly wants to be raptured out of this world before Antichrist arises and before the terrible prophesied events begin to occur ; therefore , the Illuminati would be mightily tempted to use such anxious feelings against their mortal enemy , the Fundamental Christian .
The motive is certainly present , and the capability [ opportunity ] is present now , too .
Thus , in police investigative thinking , two out of three basic considerations of whether a suspect could have committed a crime are present .
In my opinion , this makes a fake rapture possible .
I am not predicting one , but it is possible .
CONTINUED FAKE RAPTURE 2
Whooho .
Forget tuned - up cars !
The present is driving bicycles with MonkeyLectric wheels .
Just like my colleague at Doktorsblog , I want to drive with this bike through the night of Cologne , my slogan would be :
I want to drive my bicycle .
Try to do this on paper .
Maybe something less silly , maybe not .
What would you nightdrive , and where ?
Just spread the word .

Author and talk - show host Glenn Beck has signed a wide - ranging contract with CBS Corp .'s Simon & Schuster publishing arm that gives him profit participation in each new book , a perk the publisher has traditionally reserved solely for its most important writers , such as Stephen King .
The deal reduces the publisher 's risk by paring Mr. Beck 's advances at a time when the book business is rocky .
The move also locks in an author whose media presence has helped make him a best - selling writer .
According to Simon & Schuster , Mr. Beck 's first book , the 2003 nonfiction work " The Real America , " sold 50,000 hardcovers ; 2007 's nonfiction " An Inconvenient Book " sold 500,000 hardcovers ; and his novel " The Christmas Sweater , " published in 2008 , sold 775,000 hardcovers .
Authors typically receive a royalty of 15 % of the publisher 's suggested retail price on hardcover titles and a 7 % to 10 % royalty on paperbacks , money paid out after publishers have recouped their advance .
Mr. Beck will accept smaller advances in exchange for a share in the profits .
The deal will also provide him with more creative control over how his books are designed and marketed .
" I 'd rather take a lower advance and have a partnership , " Mr. Beck , 45 years old , said .
" I 'll bet on myself and a smart person on the other side of the table every time . "
Mr. Beck said he took satisfaction in having a deal similar to that of Mr. King , noting that Mr. King described him in a magazine column as " Satan 's mentally challenged younger brother . "

California 's unemployment rate soared to 11.5 percent in May , the highest since the eve of World War II , as employers cut 68,900 jobs , according to a bleak report issued Friday by the state Employment Development Department .
The state 's peak unemployment rate was 11.7 percent in January 1941 .
Nearly 2.14 million Californians are now hunting for jobs , which are growing scarcer .
" It 's a jungle out there , " said Shannon Fee , a 43 - year - old Alameda woman who has spent a year looking for work in adult education or corporate training with only a few nibbles and no offers .
" The California economy is deeply ill , and we 're a long way from getting back to health , " said Scott Anderson , senior economist with Wells Fargo .
Anderson thinks the state jobless rate will edge up to 12 percent even if the recession eases this year .
The state rate is up from April , when 11.1 percent of Californians were unemployed .
The U.S. unemployment rate is 9.4 percent .
State figures show that this recession has prompted the steepest layoffs in 40 years .
During that period , the worst recessions occurred in the early 1990s and early 1980s .
In the '90s downturn , when the aerospace slump clobbered California , 4.1 percent of jobs were lost before payrolls started growing again .
During the 1980s recession , employers cut payrolls 3.3 percent .
This time around , since payroll employment peaked in July 2007 , about 5.7 percent of regular jobs have been cut , and it is still not clear when the state 's labor market will hit bottom and grow again .
Eventual recovery
But Stephen Levy , with the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto , said that as bad as things looks now , the state 's job market will eventually recover .
" It 's not a bottomless pit , " Levy said .
What has hit California hard in this recession , Levy said , has been the twin collapses of the housing market and global trade .
The housing bust has led to steep job cuts in construction , finance , insurance and real estate .
The trade slowdown has hit sectors like warehousing and transportation .
" But those jobs are not gone permanently .
They are coming back , " he said , once the recession ends and demand for houses and products returns .
Levy contrasted California 's situation with that of Michigan , which has the nation 's highest unemployment rate , 14.1 percent , and depends on an auto industry that may never recover .
" The May job numbers were terrible , but there 's hope for the future , " Levy said .
Zooming in on the Bay Area , the job picture worsened slightly in May but still remains somewhat better than for the state as a whole .
The San Francisco metropolitan area , which includes Marin and San Mateo counties , continues to have the best job market in the region in these bad times , with a May unemployment rate of 8.6 percent .
San Jose outlook bleak
Metropolitan San Jose , made up of Santa Clara and San Benito counties , has the region 's longest odds for job hunters , with an unemployment rate of 11.2 percent .
In the Oakland metropolitan area , composed of Alameda and Contra Costa counties , 10.4 percent of job seekers could n't find jobs in May , including Fee .
As a former Army wife often posted overseas and unable to work , Fee said , her resume reveals gaps between jobs which employers do n't like to see .
That makes it harder to get the interviews , where she would have a better chance to show her worth .
" I just have to keep at it , " she said .
" But it 's incredibly tough . "
So that " certain premium " for the UMD - less PSPgo ?
We may gripe about the $ 230 price tag here , but our friends across the pond might actually have it worse .
Right now , while UK gamers are shelling out on average £ 100 ( about $ 165 US ) for a new PSP , the " guide price " for Go is currently set at around £ 230 ( $ 370 US ) .
Egregious ?
We think so , and it looks like British consumers might agree , as two independent retailers have reported zero pre-orders so far .
Ouch .
Of course , it 's not indicative of the entire region , especially given there 's no data here from the big chains , but as a " canary in a cage " indicator , it still does n't sound good -- but hey , there 's still plenty of time before its October 1 launch , and anything can happen .

THE FACTS
It is well known that too much soda can increase the risk of diabetes and obesity .
But when it comes to kidney problems , is there a difference between colas and other kinds of soda ?
Colas contain high levels of phosphoric acid , which has been linked to kidney stones and other renal problems .

ETIHAD AIRWAYS FLIGHT 141 – His name is on the no-fly list , but yesterday he was flying high above rippled clouds blanketing the world below on his way home to see his family for the first time in six years .
Abousfian Abdelrazik was five hours into a flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto when he looked up from behind his glasses in the front row of the darkened cabin and smiled .
" Yes , " he had managed to fall asleep for a little while .
" Yes , " he had something to eat from the halal menu , which offered lamb kofta with tomato - flavoured rice and cucumber salad with feta cheese .
He nodded and introduced himself but he would save all his other words for when he stepped onto Canadian soil .
" This is a personal and momentous occasion for him , " his lawyer Yavar Hameed said by way of explaining the silence of his client , whom the federal government repatriated under fire yesterday after he had to sleep on a cot in the weight room of the Canadian embassy in Khartoum for more than a year .
Abdelrazik had roused Hameed from his slumber in the seat beside him with whispers of how he did not want to talk – about anything at all – until he landed at Pearson International Airport yesterday afternoon .
" That is his wish , " said the Ottawa lawyer as Abdelrazik dropped his gaze .
Seven hours later cameras and cheering supporters carrying bright orange posters surrounded the 47 - year - old Sudan - born man from Montreal as he walked into the public area of the airport as other travellers wondered what all the fuss was about .
" I am very glad to come back home , " said Abdelrazik , whose grey beard betrays how long it has been since someone took the oft - published photograph of him in a yellow shirt holding a small child on his lap .
" I just flew from Sudan to Canada .
I am very tired .
I want to say to my supporters from coast to coast , in every town , in every city , in every village , thank you very much for your supporting me and for your effort , " he said from the middle of the throng .
" Now I am here .
Thank you very much and I am glad to be a citizen of this famous nation . "
Then he hopped into a vehicle that would carry him to Montreal to be reunited with his children .
It had been a long journey that began years before the June 4 ruling by a Federal Court judge ordering Ottawa to return Abdelrazik from Sudan because as a Canadian citizen he had a Charter right to enter the country – a right which government lawyers had argued only applied if someone showed up at the border asking to be let in .
" The spirit of law and human rights in this country has triumphed , " Hameed told supporters in Toronto as he stood next to a beaming but bewildered - looking Abdelrazik yesterday .
" It has triumphed over reactionary politics and the egregious practice ... of selective citizenship . "
Abdelrazik arrived in Canada in 1990 as a refugee claimant and became a Canadian citizen five years later .
He was living in Montreal when he travelled back to Sudan to visit his ailing mother in 2003 .
He alleges Sudanese authorities tortured him during two periods of detainment .
The Sudanese government released him , and both the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service have said they have no current or substantive information to link him to criminal activity .
He is on a United Nations terrorism blacklist that restricts travel and the finances of alleged associates of Al Qaeda .
Last week the UN Security Council committee that manages the list published the reasons for adding his name , although none of the allegations are new .
The UN alleges he trained at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan , where he allegedly told someone he met Osama bin Laden , twice tried and failed to join Muslims fighting the Russians in Chechnya , and was an acquaintance of Ahmed Ressam , who was convicted in the U.S. for plotting an attack at the Los Angeles airport .
Abdelrazik also knew Adil Charkaoui , a Morocco - born permanent resident of Canada who was arrested in May 2003 under a security certificate .
His passport expired while he was in Sudan and Ottawa said repeatedly it would grant him an emergency travel document if he obtained a flight itinerary .
But a few hours before he was to board an April 3 flight paid for by his supporters , the government cited the no-fly list as its reason for refusing him one .
On his trip that got him home yesterday he moved swiftly through airports accompanied by two RCMP officers and a diplomatic official from the Canadian Embassy in Khartoum to board two flights arranged and paid for by the federal government .

He spent Friday night in an air - conditioned room at Abu Dhabi International airport after arriving from Khartoum .
As soon as he arrived at the gate for his second flight yesterday morning , local security officials whisked him away from the prying eyes of other passengers .
Two Canada Border Services
Agency guards greeted him soon after he stepped off the plane in Toronto and marched him through the airport – as he grinned broadly – to a special immigration counter that verified the travel document he had been denied so long .
Then he waited for his duffel bag at the luggage carousel like everyone else before meeting the rest of his legal team – one lawyer , Audrey Brousseau , had tears in her eyes – in a semi- private corridor away from the crowd waiting to welcome him home .

Leccy Tech Each and every all - electric dreamcar - speedster Tesla Roadster built before April 22 , 2009 needs to have its innards examined .
In the finest bit of spinmeistering that The Reg has seen in many a moon , Telsa Motors issued a recall notice Thursday entitled " Tesla To Do House Calls . "
The house calls in question are visits by Tesla techs to the 345 owners of the aforementioned Roadsters to check whether their " rear , inner hub flange bolts " are properly torqued .
That 'd be bolts in the cars , not the owners .
According to Tesla , the problem was discovered after a " root - cause analysis " showed that the " uncharacteristic handling " reported by one owner was caused by improper torquing of those pesky bolts by Lotus , the Roadster 's contract manufacturer .
Thus alerted , Lotus is also checking some of its Elise and Exige models .
As with most such recalls , the service will be performed at no cost to the owner .
Unlike most such recalls , the service will begin with " house call " to he owner 's home or office , where a Tesla tech will determine whether the Roadster needs to be taken into the shop for repairs that " will include a complimentary , full - vehicle inspection and software upgrade . "
To say that Tesla has driven a rocky road would be an understatement .
In the company 's short life it has endured production delays , reorgs , layoffs , lawsuits , and funding follies .
But it has its friends , as well - notably California 's unlikely governator Arnold Schwarzenegger and , most recently , Damlier AG , which just this month acquired 10 per cent of the company for a " double - digit million Euro sum . "
We 're fans of Tesla here at The Reg , as well , looking forward to its Sport and saving 4,990,000 of our pennies for a Model S. ®

Not getting enough notice is the fact that in manylocal health care markets there are very few insurance companies offering care plans .
In many places there are one or two companies that provide most of the insurance .
Particularly true if you set aside the uninsured people and the people the plans reject who can only get coverage from the high cost state coverage pool .
If you look at US Representatives and Senators who oppose the Public Option , in many cases they are receiving political funds from insurance companies with near monopolies in their coverage locations .
TPM
Muckraker could / should compile a table of representatives , the health care insurance companies donating to them and the percentage of their markets they control .
That would tell a big story about what is really happening .
No " last core parallel slowdown " on OS X
I 'm a huge fan of the recent paper http://ghcmutterings.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/new-paper-runtime-support-for-multicore-haskell/
which put me over the top to get started writing parallel code in Haskell .
Parallel code is now integral to my and my Ph.D. students ' research .
For example , we recently checked an assertion for the roughly 69 billion atomic lattices on six atoms , in a day rather than a week , using perhaps 6 lines of parallel code in otherwise sequential code .
When you 're anxiously waiting for the answer , a day is a lot better than a week .
( The enumeration itself is down to two hours on 7 cores , which astounds me .
I see no reason to ever use another language . )
In that paper , they routinely benchmark N - 1 cores on an N core Linux box , because of a noticeable falloff using the last core , which can do more harm than good .
I had confirmed this on my four core Linux box , but was puzzled that my two core MacBook showed no such falloff .
Hey , two cores is n't representative of many cores , cache issues yada yada , so I waited .
I just got an EFi - X " boot processor " ( efi-x.com ) working on a nearly identical quad core box that I built , and I tested the same computations with OS X .
For my test case , there 's a mild cost to moving to parallel at all , but ...
Compared to 2 cores , using 3 , 4 cores on a four core Linux box gives speedups of 1.37x , 1.38 x Compared to 2 cores , using 3 , 4 cores on an equivalent four core box running OS X gives speedups of 1.45 x , 1.9 x
Here 1.5x , 2.0 x is ideal , so I 'm thrilled .
If we can't shame Linux into fixing this , I 'm never looking back .
How true is this for other parallel languages ?
Haskell alone is perhaps too fringe to cause a Linux scandal over this , even if it should ...
The EFi-X boot processor itself is rather expensive ( $ 240 now ) , and there 's sticking to a specific hardware compatibility list , and I needed to update my motherboard BIOS and the EFi - X firmware , but no other fiddling for me .
These boxes are just compute servers for me , I would have been ok returning to Linux , but not if it means giving up a core .
People worry about compatibility , " I sensed a softness in the surround sound in game X... " , but for me the above numbers put all this in perspective .
Another way to put this , especially for those who do n't have a strong preference for building their own machines , and can't wait for Linux to get its act together :
If you 're serious about parallel Haskell , buy a Mac Pro .
Tensions on the Korean peninsula have risen since the North 's tests Chinese fishing boats are reported to be leaving the tense inter-Korean border in the Yellow Sea after North Korea 's threat of military action .
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency quoted defence sources as saying the South 's military authorities are trying to find out if Chinese ships were told to go .
The North conducted a nuclear test and fired several missiles this week .
On Friday Seoul confirmed the launch of another short - range missile off North Korea 's east coast .
The BBC's Chris Hogg says some reports claim the latest missile - the sixth - travelled further than the other five .
In another development on Friday , North Korea warned of " self - defence " measures if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions over the nuclear test .
" If the UN Security Council provokes us , our additional self - defence measures will be inevitable , " the foreign ministry said in a statement carried by official media .
The communist nation has also threatened military action against the South after Seoul 's decision to join a US - led Proliferation Security Initiative ( PSI ) under which North Korean ships could be stopped and searched .
See comparison of North and South 's military power Pyongyang says this decision is tantamount to an act of war and that it is no longer bound by the Armistice which in 1953 brought an end to the Korean War .
Fishing boats " Chinese fishing boats operating near the Northern Limit Line ( NLL ) began withdrawing yesterday , " Yonhap quoted a defence source as saying .
TROUBLESOME SEA BORDER Known as Northern Limit Line Position in Yellow Sea declared by UN in 1953
Not recognised by North Deadly naval skirmishes along the line in 1999 and 2002 Regularly breached by North 's fishermen
Factfile : Underground testing
The Korean war N Korea 's missile programme More than 280 Chinese vessels were fishing near the NLL for crab earlier this week but the number has fallen to about 140 , according to the source .
The NLL , which North Korea refuses to recognise , marks the maritime border off the west coast of the peninsula .
It was the scene of bloody naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 .
Yonhap also quoted an official at Seoul 's presidential office saying the withdrawal did not appear to be a sign of an imminent provocation .
" All Chinese ships would have evacuated the area if that was the case , " the official said , adding the crab - catching season was almost over .
" Now that there 's talk of ... an all - out war , we fishermen are worried .
Nowadays when we go out , we do know we are facing dangers , " Reuters quoted a South Korean fisherman , Kim Jae-sik , in waters claimed by the North but occupied by the South .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , who is in Guam , told reporters he was not aware of any unusual troop movements in North Korea .
Guam calm Speaking at the Andersen US Air Force base , Mr Gates said he saw no need to increase troop levels in South Korea from the current total of 28,000 .
" I am not aware of any military moves in the North , that are out of the ordinary at least , " he said .
South Korea and the United States earlier raised the military alert level in the region which calls for increased surveillance but not increased military manoeuvres .
ESCALATING TENSIONS 27 May - North Korea says it is abandoning the truce that ended the Korean war and reportedly test - fires another missile 26 May - The North test - fires short - range missiles as South Korea announces it will join a US - led initiative to control trafficking in weapons of mass destruction 26 May - President Barack Obama pledges military support for America 's East Asian allies , as the UN condemns the nuclear test 25 May - North Korea stages its second nuclear test , triggering international condemnation 29 April - Pyongyang threatens to carry out a nuclear test unless the UN apologises for criticising its recent rocket launch 14 April - Pyongyang says it is ending talks on its nuclear activities and will restore its disabled nuclear reactor after UN criticism of its rocket launch 5 April - The North goes ahead with a controversial rocket launch , seen by major governments as a cover for a long - range missile test
Q&A : North Korea nuclear test
What is N Korea 's game plan ?
Analysts say the tension generated in the North could be largely geared to the domestic audience , to justify military spending and control of the population against an alleged threat from the West .
" We have no intention of taking military action against North Korea unless they do something that requires it , " Mr Gates said , in comments described by AFP news agency as an attempt to play down the sense of crisis .
" Just based on what the Chinese government has said publicly , they 're clearly pretty unhappy about the nuclear testing in particular and they were n't very happy about the missile test either , " he added .
Mr Gates is on his way to a two - day security dialogue in Singapore .
In New York , the US and Japan circulated a draft United Nations Security Council resolution to key council members that condemned Pyongyang 's second nuclear test on Monday and called for strict enforcement of UN sanctions imposed on North Korea after its first atomic test in October 2006 .
When North Korea agreed in February 2007 to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions , there was real hope of reaching a settlement .
But the negotiations stalled as it accused its negotiating partners - the US , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations .

NEW YORK – It slices !
It dices !
It pierces and pokes !
Pulls stubborn flesh from bone with a wrist flick !
And if that does n't get your prisoner talking , perhaps the ornate chair with its spiked seat , back and armrests will do the trick .
Both the throne and tiny flesh ripper are part of a bounty of iron torture implements dating to the 16th century that will soon go on sale , but on one condition :
The buyer must have morals as well as money – more than $ 3 million ( U.S. ) .
At a time when the CIA interrogations of terrorist suspects is questioned , the anonymous seller wants the 252 - item collection to fall into responsible hands , and serve as an indictment of torture .
A portion of the proceeds will go to Amnesty International and other human rights groups , said Arlan Ettinger of Guernsey 's auction house in New York .
The seller , a New England woman , was inspired by the debate over waterboarding and other CIA tactics to contact the auction house about a sale .
Ettinger 's auctions have run the gamut from Soviet art and Elvis Presley 's estate to Benny Goodman 's clarinet and Titanic trinkets .
But how to hawk devices of blood and gore with names like the Tongue Tearer and the Roman Terrible Pincers without crossing the line into sinister profiteering ?
" I did n't know how to respond , " he said .
He and the seller agreed on the need for care in choosing a buyer and directing some proceeds to anti-torture groups .
" It was one of those things that made me pause and say , ` Wow , ' " said Amnesty 's Timothy Higdon , before he and others decided the publicity would " help tell the story of why torture is wrong . "
Ettinger said , " It made perfect sense that you turn something terrible into something good . "
His desk was covered with items like the Small Iron Spider , a flesh - tearing device .
" This sweet little thing could grasp any part of one 's body and do pain , " he said , squeezing the handle to make the eight claw - like legs with needle - sharp tips open and close .
There were spiked collars , an axe and a perforated spoon " through which boiling water , oil or molten lead was poured onto various portions of the body , " says a catalogue .
Leg weights were put beside the torture chair as shoes are put with a dress : to show how well they match .
The weights added pounds to the person in the torture chair , driving the spikes deeper into the skin .
A heavy stone tablet designed for a torture chamber door had the inscribed admonishment : " Dark deeds make dark endings . "
Elsewhere were an iron implement meant to be " affixed to the ears before they were cut off " and " a powerful iron foot - breaker " – as described in an 1890s catalogue .
It says the items originated in the region of the Holy Roman Empire that became Germany and that " every one of the barbarous implements ( has ) been in actual use . "
The collection was kept at the Imperial Castle of Nuremberg in Bavaria until the late 1800s , when Britain 's Earl of Shrewsbury bought it and sent it on tour .
More recently , a Norwegian living in the U.S. whose family had been persecuted by the Nazis bought the items .
He died in the 1970s and an heir is behind the sale .
No auction date has been set because Ettinger hopes to find a single buyer .
Keeping the items together , perhaps on display in a museum , would be the best way to educate people about human rights abuses , he said .
If one buyer is n't found , Ettinger will auction the items piece by piece , and try to sniff out motives before handing over antique items still capable of killing and maiming .

" If we thought that someone had truly evil intentions , we would n't take the money , " Ettinger said .
Los Angeles Times
A federal judge has ruled that John Yoo , a former Bush administration lawyer who wrote crucial memorandums justifying harsh interrogation techniques , will have to answer in court to accusations that his work led to a prisoner ’s being tortured and deprived of his constitutional rights .
The government had asked Judge Jeffrey S. White of Federal District Court in San Francisco to dismiss the case filed by Jose Padilla , an American citizen who spent more than three years in a military brig as an enemy combatant .
Judge
White denied most elements of Mr. Yoo ’s motion and quoted a passage from the Federalist Papers that in times of war , nations , to be more safe , “ at length become willing to run the risk of being less free . ”
Microsoft has warned users that yet another critical vulnerability has been found in its popular Office spreadsheet program Excel .
The flaw could allow remote hackers to open and run malicious code on an unsuspecting user 's computer through an infected spreadsheet file .
The attack effects users of Microsoft Office Excel 2007 but also those using any of the older binary .XLS files .
A user opening a file , probably through an email , will be asked to open a malicious spreadsheet .
They 'll then begin downloading at least two files onto their system , one valid , the other the malicious binary .
Once the new and infected file is opened , unsuspecting users will unfortunately execute a hidden Trojan horse downloader that could be used by hackers to log user keystrokes and any sensitive personal data , including financial information .
( Source : arstechnica.com )
Attack could evade detection
Because the attack rather sneakily uses a valid document to mask its true intentions , many users -- even critical or cynical ones -- could be duped .
In addition , security companies examining the attack have found that whoever designed it was wise enough to include weak encryption on the binary , meaning it has the potential to evade detection software .
Thankfully , attacks have not yet been widespread , most occurring in cases where the hacker had a specific target in mind .
However , vice president of Symantec ' Security Response Vincent Weafer does n't believe that means anyone can let their guard down , particularly those most likely to be attacked : government or corporate officials .
The attack 's design " shows that attackers are again looking at these common applications as a means of getting onto the system , " Weafer insisted .
" Typically if [ the threat ] is crafted , it tends to be very selective . "
( Source : crn.com )
Microsoft still working on a patch
Even though the majority of Excel users are unlikely to be attacked , security experts are insisting everyone remain vigilant .
While Microsoft is still working on a specific patch at this time , users can strengthen the security of their shared applications with the latest updates while keeping firewalls up and antivirus programs up to date .
" The message here is , make sure you 're paying attention to your patch updates for all of your applications on your desktop , " Weafer said .
Games That Defined The Dreamcast
The Sega Dreamcast obviously was not a strong commerical success .
However , that was not because of a lack of quality games .
Sega excelled at having games that were unique , addictive , and just plain fun .
( Watch G4 ’s Coverage of Dreamcast history )
The Dreamcast also had some strong support from a number of big publishers such as Capcom , Namco , and SNK with rounded out a game library that is still very popular among hardcore gamers .
This feature will not cover absolutely every one of the best Dreamcast games , but instead focuses most on the games that gave the Dreamcast its identity — most of which were exclusives to the console .
This list should serve as an excellent starting point for anybody looking to build a quality Dreamcast collection that will hold up to modern games .
Soul Calibur
Even though it was not a Sega - developed title , Soul Calibur is one of the games that forever will be remembered with the Dreamcast .
Soul Calibur is absolutely gorgeous , but when you consider the game was a launch title for the Dreamcast , its image quality is all the more impressive .
( And wait to you see it with a VGA adapter )
Each of the game ’s warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon–sword , ax , stave , nunchaku , you name it–and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon .
At first , the huge number of possible moves and combinations available for use can be a bit daunting , but it keeps you wanting to learn more .
There are also a number of different play modes to keep you involved for quite a while .
The gameplay and depth of this landmark 3D fighter still holds up to this day , as both Soul Calibur 2 and 3 still do n’t seem to live up to the original .

Shenmue
Shenmue was one of the most beautiful and revolutionary titles for the Dreamcast .
It combined elements from Adventure , RPG , Simulator , and Fighting games into an epic journey that brought a fictional community to life and compelled you to find the killer of Ryo ’s father .
It ’s no wonder that Yu Suzuki ’s pet project would be an amazing game after years of development and a hefty $ 20 million budget .
Shenmue brings games one step closer to reality — there ’s a time scale , all non-playing characters actually have their own lives to lead , and enemy encounters are presented realistically .
You can interact with nearly every object and learn and master several different martial arts .
The atmosphere in the city of Shenmue is simply amazing — each building , sidewalk , table , chair , crate , and every other environmental nuance has been rendered and calculated with an insane amount of detail and elements such as the color and intensity of the lighting is carefully reproduced for each environment .
I must give a fair warning , however , Shenmue is not for everyone .
It ’s not especially appealing for people like me who have a relatively short attention span .
Shenmue requires patience ( the first disc or two spends most of its time setting up the story as opposed to letting Ryo bash some skulls . ) and a good amount of puzzle - solving in order to get into the game .
Individual gamers will either love or hate Shenmue — and will love it or hate it for the same reasons .

Jet Grind Radio
If there was one word to describe Sega ’s best work in the second half of the 90’s , it was “ unique ” .
Sega employed a number of development houses that did their best to create creative games that broke the barriers of traditional game genres .
Jet Grind Radio is a perfect example of a Dreamcast games game that provided a unique and unforgettable graphical , audible , and gameplay experience .
In JGR , you gradually accumulate gang members to mark your territory with graffiti .
Of course , the cops do n’t like this and will do everything in their power to stop you , even if it means calling in the military to take you out for good .
While Jet Grind Radio does start off slow and is a bit awkward at first , soon you ’ll be grinding and painting like a pro , all the while dodging gun fire , gas bombs , and tanks .
The combination of slick cell - shading graphics , energetic music , adrenaline - pumping action , and a very unique premise made Jet Grind Radio a title that no serious gamer should go without .
While Jet Grind Radio lacked in sales numbers , it lives on as a cult classic ( and one of my all - time favorites ) .

Space Channel 5
While some other rhythm games like PaRappa The Rapper attracted more attention , Space Channel 5 topped the charts with Dreamcast owners .
Both the graphics and the music had a phenomenal retro-futurist ( reminds me of a hip Jetson ’s atmosphere ) feel to them and kept Space Channel 5 from becoming just “ another ” simon - says - type game .
Space Channel 5 has a handful of simple game elements that make it unique and the game does a good job of starting out easy and gradually getting more difficult .
While SC5 is n’t especially deep or long , the music will keep you coming back From start to finish , Space Channel 5 rocks the house .
Even when the moves become so complicated you get angry and want to hurl your controller across the room , the quality of the music helps bring you back .
A little techno here , a little rock there — the music has a great style that ’ll have you tapping your feet .

Crazy Taxi
This arcade port was one of the main reasons I initially jumped on the Dreamcast .
While it has been cloned a few times since its release , Crazy Taxi was a thrill that could not be found anywhere else .
The music from The Offspring got a little tiresome after a while , but actually got you in the Crazy mood .
Crazy Taxi gives you control of a cabby racing around two San Francisco - esque cities , picking up customers and dropping them at their required destinations by any means necessary .
It ’s a race against the clock , resulting in no -holds - barred racing around the two cities , flying off hills and screeching around bends .
Although some may argue that the game lacks some depth , they forget that this is a pure arcade game that compels you to beat your best scores .
The Dreamcast version also featured the “ Crazy Box ” , a set of minigames that features challenges such as stopping by hitting a pole , bowling using the cab as a ball , and popping giant balloons in a field .
Although once completed it ’s not great for long sessions , it has that addictive “ one more go ” quality of nearly all Sega ’s arcade titles .
Crazy Taxi is definitely worth checking out if you do n’t take your racers too seriously , or just want some hardcore arcade - style fun .

Virtua Tennis & Tennis 2K2
I do n’t intend to downplay the significance of the 2 K series ( NFL 2K2 , NBA 2K2 , etc ) in the Dreamcast ’s library , but if there is one Dreamcast sports title that last the test of time , Virtua Tennis would prevail .
Having the essential quality of being easy to play and difficulty to master , Virtua Tennis was one of the sleeper hit of short - lived Sega Dreamcast .
It is often overlooked as a killer party game — I have had many parties with both guys and girls of all gaming levels having a blast on a 4 - player doubles tournament .
While other enjoyable tennis titles have come long since ( Top Spin and Mario Power Tennis ) , Virtua Tennis still holds up as being possibly the best tennis game ever .
The “ sequel ” , Tennis 2K2 is pretty much the same as Virtua Tennis except that the graphics are a bit more polished and it adds to the player lineup with a female roster ( including the Williams sisters ) .

Skies of Arcadia
Something about Air Pirates gives the RPG genre a breath of fresh air .
With an upbeat quest and some innovative and fun ideas , Skies of Arcadia lets you venture off to distant islands to uncover a number of secrets .
Unlike other RPGs which wait until the mid-point to give you an airship , Skies of Arcadia does it right from the bat by bequeathing Vyse and crew with a ship of their own to sail the turn - based combat infested skies .
The world is comprised of floating islands , and you use your air ship to travel among them while playing Robin Hood with other pirates .
The story may be similar to traditional motifs such as those in Lunar : The Silver Star , but it still feels new in this age of anti-heroes and mopey , whiny main characters .
The ship warfare provides for a great alternative to standard RPG character combat , and the characters are a joy to watch with their many facial expressions and animation .

Power Stone & Power Stone 2
Throughout the late 1990 ’s Capcom tried over and over again to successfully transition their fighter expertise to the 3D realm .
While some of them ( Rival Schools , for example ) were somewhat entertaining , most of them were on the dreadful side — and nothing that rivaled their quality 2D titles .
When the Dreamcast came along , Capcom finally got things right .
With PowerStone , they broke away from the traditional fighting setup and brought an entirely new cast of characters to a fully 3D environment .
With Power Stone , players could not only use traditional attacks on their opponents , but also use items in the play field ( furniture , poles , etc ) to do extra damage .
There is also a nice stratigic element found within the game ’s Power Stone gimmick .
If a certain player gets 3 Power Stones they are temporarily overtaken by a unique super - human power .
So players will not only want to beat the crap out of their opponents , but also try to keep them from getting Power Stones .
Power Stone 2 ’s designers greatly expanded upon the battle arenas of the original Power Stone and added support for up to 4 players .
It ’s almost too much chaos to handle .

Sonic Adventure & Sonic Adventure 2
The original Sonic Adventure is one of the only games that has wowed me graphically .
In the days when the N64 was the best there was , Sonic Adventure on the pre-release demo Dreamcasts looked like something gamers only dreamed about .
While the original Sonic Adventure was eventually bested by later Dreamcast releases , Sonic Adventure 2 increased the eye candy ( and focused more on action gameplay ) .
The original Sonic Adventure added some RPG - ish exploration / dialogue elements to break up the action levels ( which I did n’t much care for ) , but Sonic Adventure 2 was full - blown action levels and added the option of playing as the “ Dark ” side .
Being able to play as Dr. Robitnik and the new Shadow character were quite enjoyable .
While I did n’t think that the Sonic Adventure games quite captured the feel of the old - school 2D Sonic games , they are still very enjoyable and are a must - try for fans of 3D platformers .

Samba De Amigo
If you enjoy rhythm games , monkeys , and need something different from Dance Dance Revolution , you really need to take a look at Samba De Amigo .
Samba is another one of the ultimate party games and deserves another chance .
It involves waving / shaking maracas in certain directions to match the upbeat music .
In theory , the game sounds simple , maybe even boring , but Samba de Amigo is nothing but .
As long as you do n’t fear making a complete fool out of yourself , there are few game experiences as enjoyable as Samba de Amigo .
Many people find it much easier for beginners to play as opposed to DDR , but it still is a challenge in higher levels and it can be a riot to watch your friends shake their maracas like there ’s no tomorrow .
Originally hampered by the high price of Sega ’s first party maracas , Samba did n’t sell very well .
Now , cheaper third - party maraccas can be found online , but I find the game to be highly enjoyable even with traditional controllers .

Virtua Fighter 3TB
Even though it was probably the least celebrated title in a fighting series with a cult following , Virtua Fighter 3TB is a deep and polished 3D fighter .
Virtua Fighter 3 was original planned to be released on the Sega Saturn ( along with an upgrade cart ) , however with Sega quickly moving onto the Dreamcast , the game was made more arcade - accurate and added the Team Battle ( TB ) mode .
Virtua Fighter 3tb is n’t as eye - catching as Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive 2 , gameplay and strategy is where VF3tb excels .
The control in VF3tb takes awhile to get used to unless you are familiar with the previous Virtua Fighter games .
Instead of the total 3D movement of Soul Calibur , Virtua Fighter is on a 2D axis , but includes a sidestep button to give 3D movement .
This system works fairly well once you get used to it , but it is more restrictive than true 3D joystick movement .
There is no instant gratification of mastering Virtua Fighter 3tb .
If you want to get good , you ’re going to have to log in the hours to get good .
Button mashing will never take you all the way in a good fighting game , but in VF3tb it will take you almost nowhere .
Time and patience are required to get the most out of the game .

Ecco the Dolphin : Defender of the Future
Ecco the Dolphin for the Dreamcast is one of those rare instances of a company taking a 2 - D game ( the Genesis and Sega CD originals ) and making it work in 3D .
Defender of the Future is an amazing looking game — the rich textures and animation really bring the sea life to life .
The game is also among the most challenging around again , but you ’ll enjoy it thanks to tight control , a brilliant atmosphere , and well done story .
The environments in this game are so beautiful , I think of Ecco as an “ ocean simulator ” more than I think of it as a game .
The geometry and texturing of Ecco ’s aquatic world are near perfection , creating a stunning and believable environment — from the lush scenery to an exotic assortment of underwater creatures .
There are 34 levels in total and there ’s no denying that Ecco is a massive game which will take a long time complete .
Since the game involves a lot of exploring and puzzle solving , I did n’t find it as engaging as some people .
It is beautiful , but I personally get frustrated by the Ecco games .

Chu Chu Rocket !
ChuChu Rocket ! was actually the first popular console to make it into the online world and was a featured title in my Games That Nobody Played – But You Should .
It ’s a unique puzzle game that should not be overlooked for either its single - player or multi-player features .
The concept of the game is simple : point mice into your rocket , keep cats away from your rocket .
Put four players on the same board and the trash - talking quickly escalates .
The blazing competition and deep strategy easily make up for Chu Chu Rocket ’s simple ( but pleasant ) graphics .
The only downside is that the brain - numbing multiplayer mode can be hard to describe to newbie friends .
The single player mode is also a great deal of fun that will keep your brain in tip - top shape .
Much like more modern games like Super Monkey Ball , it makes you think creatively to reach your goal .
A true classic .

Phantasy Star Online
Sega was one of the main pioneers in online console gaming .
While they had modest online offering with both the Genesis and Saturn , the Dreamcast was the first of their consoles to have online capabilities built into the stock machine .
The Dreamcast came standard with a 56 k modem and also had a ( expensive ) LAN / Broadband adapter availible as an upgrade .
Phantasy Star Online paved the way for Sega ’s groundbreaking online network and for later networks like XBox Live .
Phantasy Star Online ’s gameplay is in the same vein of Blizzard ’s hugely popular Diablo – fight hordes of monsters , get all sorts of great items and equipment , and raise your characters stats .
Combat in the game is fast paced and less tactical than most traditional console RPGs , and the story , when present , never gets in the way of the action and treasure hunting .
Phantasy Star Online not only brought some addictive online gameplay to the Dreamcast , but it also was not a letdown to the diehard fans of the classic series .

Street Fighter 3 : Third Strike and other Fighters
Sure the Dreamcast had a number of great 3D fighters such as Soul Calibur , VF3tb , and Dead or Alive 2 , but its real strength was in the 2D fighter arena .
Teamed with the “ official ” Agetec arcade stick , the Dreamcast is a 2D fighters dream console .
( Combine it with a Saturn and you may pass out from excitement ) Capcom and SNK both supported the Dreamcast to the fullest extent .
Personally , I enjoyed Street Fighter 3 : Third Strike the most as it had an amazing balance of strategy , unique characters , and blissful 2D animation .
There are many other fantastic fighters on the Dreamcast that cover the entire spectrum of brawling types , so I recommend that you take a look at my overview of the Dreamcast ’s fighter library .
Ikaruga and other Shmups
While the Dreamcast might not be able to match the sheer quantity of the Sega Saturn ’s shooters , it makes up for it in quality .
The first batch of shooters came at the beginning of the Dreamcast ’s life and included such hits as Mars Matrix and GigaWing .
However , the bulk of the shmups actually showed up as Japan - only imports after the Dreamcast was already taken off US store shelves .
Hyped as the sequel to the Saturn favorite Radiant Silvergun , Ikaruga did not disappoint with its mind - bending gameplay .
Many other great shooters followed , such as Psyvariar II and Under Defeat .
Again , if you have both a Dreamcast and a Saturn , you will never run out of shmups to keep you busy .
Check out my full coverage of the Dreamcast shooter libary to learn more .
Dreamcast Imports
Much like the Saturn before it , there are a great deal of excellent games from the Dreamcast that never made it to the US .
In additional the shooter and fighter library , the highlights include Rez , Shenmue II , and Headhunter .

DENVER —
An appeals court ruled Monday a Ten Commandments monument on the Haskell County Courthouse lawn in Stigler violates the Constitution because its primary effect is to endorse religion .
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3 - 0 against the 8 - foot - tall monument in a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma and a Haskell County resident who said it offended him .
The ACLU said the decision means " the county cannot continue to display it on the courthouse lawn .
That said , nothing prevents any individual , group , or congregation from publicly displaying the same monument on their own property — and we would defend their right to do so . ”
An attorney for the commissioners said the judges erred " for many reasons ” in Monday ’s decision , and he cited Supreme Court decisions in similar cases to support his conclusion .
Attorney Kevin
Theriot said he is recommending to the commissioners that they ask all 12 judges of the court to reconsider the decision of the three - judge panel .
Monument endorses religion , judges say
The monument was erected in 2004 .
The Haskell County commissioners ’ authorization of the monument " had the impermissible principal or primary effect of endorsing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause ” of the Constitution , the judges wrote in a 52 - page decision .
The establishment clause of the First Amendment says , " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . ”
The judges said the Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to mean a government action must not have a primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion .
The judges wrote that , " in the unique factual setting of a small community like Haskell County , ” the Christian origins of the monument ’s erection " tended to strongly reflect a government endorsement of religion . ”
Monday ’s decision overturned a 2006 ruling by a Muskogee federal judge who concluded the commissioners did not overstep the constitutional line " demarcating government neutrality toward religion . ”
Circuit Judge Jerome Holmes of Oklahoma City , a conservative appointed by former President George W. Bush , wrote the decision for the Denver - based appeals court .
Retail sales rose in May for the first time in three months , an increase driven by shoppers returning to automobile showrooms seeking bargains .
Retail sales rose 0.5 % , as forecast , after a 0.2 % drop in April , the Commerce Department said .
Sales excluding autos also increased 0.5 % , led by gasoline as prices jumped last month .
A separate report showed that claims for jobless benefits fell last week .
“ It ’s indicative of a bottoming - out process , but we do n’t have much forward momentum to speak of , ” said Jonathan Basile , an economist at Credit Suisse Holdings Inc. in New York .
“ The consumer is not ready to spend in earnest yet because of the weak job and income environment . ”
U.S. household wealth fell in the first quarter by $ 1.3 trillion , extending the biggest slump on record , as home and stock prices dropped , according to the Federal Reserve in another report .
The decline was the sixth straight .

The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment insurance fell for the third time in four weeks , to 601,000 , lower than economists had forecast .
The number of jobless continuing to collect benefit payments still rose to a record for the 19th straight week to 6.82 million .
Inventories at U.S. businesses fell in April for an eighth straight month , the longest stretch since 2002 , as companies cut back .
Sales fell 0.3 % , the Commerce Department said .
The 1.1 % decline in stockpiles followed a revised 1.3 % drop in March .
Economists had forecast that retail sales would rise after a 0.4 % drop in April .
Estimates ranged from a drop of 0.3 % to an increase of 1.4 % .
Excluding autos , sales were projected to rise 0.2 % after a 0.5 % drop a month earlier , according to the survey .

Car dealers were among the retailers that performed the best .
Auto sales rose 0.5 % after falling 0.4 % in April .
Building - material , clothing , grocery stores and pharmacies were among the other retailers that showed gains in demand .
On the Neurophilosophy blog , a fascinating look at confabulatory hypermnesia , a rare disorder in which people with various kinds of amnesia ( including amnesia resulting from alcoholism and Vitamin B1 deficiencies ) invent a continuous stream of detailed , fictitious events to fill in the gaps in their memory .
The write up comes from a paper published in the journal Cortex :
Most strikingly , LM confabulated plausible answers to questions about both his personal life and public events , which would normally elicit from most people an answer of " I do n't know " .
When the researchers asked him " Who won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980 ? " he replied " Fernandel " ; when asked what he had for dinner on Tuesday two weeks ago , he answered " Steak with french fries " ; and when asked " Do you remember what you did on March 13th , 1985 ? " he replied " We spent the day at the Senart Forest . "
LM thus has a " pure " amnesic syndrome , in that his impairment is not associated with other cognitive deficits which might interfere with memory function .
He scored normally on short - term memory tests , and the evaluation revealed mild , diffuse neurodegeneration , rather than damage in a specific part of the brain .
False memories are not uncommon in patients with Korsakoff 's syndrome – indeed the condition is also referred to as amnesic - confabulatory syndrome .
However , the confabulations of such patients are sometimes extraordinary , bizarre and verging on being delusional .
LM 's confabulations , on the other hand , were always plausible , and therefore quite unlike those reported in other Korsakoff 's patients .
As President Obama prepared last month to release secret memos on the CIA ’s use of severe interrogation methods , the White House fielded a flurry of last - minute appeals .
One came from former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden , who expressed disbelief that the administration was prepared to expose methods it might later decide it needed .
“ Are you telling me that under all conditions of threat , you will never interfere with the sleep cycle of a detainee ? ”
Hayden asked a top White House official , according to sources familiar with the exchange .
From the beginning , sleep deprivation had been one of the most important elements in the CIA ’s interrogation program , used to help break dozens of suspected terrorists , far more than the most violent approaches .
And it is among the methods the agency fought hardest to keep .
Advertisement
The technique is now prohibited by President Obama ’s ban in January on harsh interrogation methods , although a task force is reviewing its use along with other interrogation methods the agency might employ in the future .
Because of its effectiveness -- as well as the perception that it was less objectionable than waterboarding , head - slamming or forced nudity -- sleep deprivation may be seen as a tempting technique to restore .
But the Justice Department memos released last month by Obama , as well as information provided by officials familiar with the program , indicate that the method , which involves forcing chained prisoners to stand , sometimes for days on end , was more controversial within the U.S. intelligence community than was widely known .
A CIA inspector general ’s report issued in 2004 was more critical of the agency ’s use of sleep deprivation than it was of any other method besides waterboarding , according to officials familiar with the document , because of how the technique was applied .
Advertisement
The prisoners had their feet shackled to the floor and their hands cuffed close to their chins , according to the Justice Department memos .
Detainees were clad only in diapers and not allowed to feed themselves .
A prisoner who started to drift off to sleep would tilt over and be caught by his chains .
The memos said that more than 25 of the CIA ’s prisoners were subjected to sleep deprivation .
At one point , the agency was allowed to keep prisoners awake for as long as 11 days ; the limit was later reduced to just over a week .
According to the memos , medical personnel were to make sure prisoners were n’t injured .
But a 2007 Red Cross report on the CIA program said that detainees ’ wrists and ankles bore scars from their shackles .
Advertisement
When detainees could no longer stand , they could be laid on the prison floor with their limbs “ anchored to a far point on the floor in such a manner that the arms cannot be bent or used for balance or comfort , ” a May 10 , 2005 , memo said .
“ The position is sufficiently uncomfortable to detainees to deprive them of unbroken sleep , while allowing their lower limbs to recover from the effects of standing , ” it said .
In the Red Cross report , prisoners said they were also subjected to loud music and repetitive noise .
“ I was kept sitting on a chair , shackled by hands and feet for two to three weeks , ” said suspected Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah , the first prisoner captured by the CIA , according to the Red Cross report .
“ If I started to fall asleep , a guard would come and spray water in my face . ”
Advertisement
In the Justice Department memos , sleep deprivation was described as part of a “ baseline ” phase of interrogation , categorized as less severe than other “ corrective ” or “ coercive ” methods .
Within the CIA , sleep deprivation was seen as a method with the unique advantage of eroding prisoners ’ will to resist without causing lasting harm .
“ Waterboarding was obviously the most controversial , ” said a former senior U.S. government official who was briefed extensively on CIA interrogation operations .
But “ sleep deprivation is probably the most effective thing they had going . ”
Facing congressional efforts in 2005 and 2006 to block the use of certain techniques , CIA lawyers and Bush administration officials lobbied to keep a core set of methods , including sleep deprivation .
Advertisement
In 2007 , after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling compelled the White House to bring the CIA program into compliance with the Geneva Convention , President Bush signed an executive order that outlined detainees ’ rights to the “ basic necessities of life . ”
The order listed “ adequate food and water , shelter from the elements , necessary clothing ” and protection from extreme heat and cold .
But it made no mention of sleep as a basic necessity .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said sleep deprivation multiplied the coercive power of other techniques that included face - slapping and confinement in small boxes .
“ It was viewed as a tool that enabled all the others , ” said a former CIA official directly involved in the program .
The former official , like others , described internal thinking on condition of anonymity .
The Justice Department memos also cited research that suggested sleep deprivation was not harmful .
Advertisement
“ Experience with sleep deprivation shows that ‘ surprisingly , little seemed to go wrong with the subjects physically , ’ ” said the May 10 , 2005 , Justice Department memo -- one of many instances in which government lawyers cited scientific papers in asserting that the program was safe .
But some authors of those studies have since said that the conclusions of their research were grossly misapplied .
James Horne , director of the Sleep Research Center at Loughborough University in Britain , said he was never consulted by U.S. officials and did n’t know how his work was being used until the memos were released .
“ My response was shocked concern , ” Horne said in an e-mail interview .
Just because the pain of sleep deprivation “ ca n’t be measured in terms of physical injury or appearance . . . does not mean that the mental anguish is not as bad . ”
Advertisement
Horne said that it was dangerous for the CIA to extrapolate from independent research in which subjects had gone for as long as a week without sleep , voluntarily , and were free to eat , rest , watch television or leave the research facility at any time .
By contrast , CIA prisoners were subjected to major additional stresses that risk physical and mental collapse .
“ To claim that 180 hours is safe in these respects is nonsense , ” Horne wrote in a separate online posting .
Even if sleep deprivation succeeded in getting prisoners to talk , he said , “ I would doubt whether the state of mind would be able to produce credible information , unaffected by delusion , fantasy or suggestibility . ”

Gordon Brown announced today that young people will be expected to do 50 hours community work in the government 's new scheme to create a citizenship conscious Britain .
In a podcast on the Downing Street website , the prime minister said : " I believe that every young person can make a difference and by involving young people to become forces for good in our communities we will together build a better and more responsible Britain . "
The scheme which is due to start in September will introduce 20 000 new roles for 16 - 19 school leavers who will undertake full - time community service alongside training .
The new measure requires every young person to contribute at least 50 hours of community service by the time they are 19 and a compulsory community service was not entirely ruled out .
The government will provide support for schools and councils to help increase voluntary work and provide service opportunities in the scheme which will cost £ 146 million over two years .
Series of pilots will be set up to research ways to increase the participation of young people in community service in a given area .
The community work would include helping in an old people 's home , campaigning on local issues , fundraising for global causes and helping deliver environmental projects .
Compulsory citizenship classes , which play an important part in the new 14 - 16 education curriculum will also encourage pupils to take an active part in their community .
" If we have learned anything in the past few years , it is that the pursuit of narrow self interest does not self the public good , in fact it positively hurts it , " Mr Brown said .
" We need to encourage a new era where young people learn the power of serving something greater than themselves . "
Writing in the News of the World on Monday last week , Mr Brown said he wanted to create a Britain where community service would be a normal part of teenagers ' life .
The scheme will be run by the Department for Children , Schools and Families and will target school leavers enrolled on the Entry to Employment ( e2e ) programs , which encourage teens to take up apprenticeships , jobs or further learning .
Authenticating Paperwork
It ’s a sad , horrific story .
Homeowner returns to find his house demolished .
The demolition company was hired legitimately but there was a mistake and it demolished the wrong house .
The demolition company relied on GPS co-ordinates , but requiring street addresses is n’t a solution .
A typo in the address is just as likely , and it would have demolished the house just as quickly .
The problem is less how the demolishers knew which house to knock down , and more how they confirmed that knowledge .
They trusted the paperwork , and the paperwork was wrong .
Informality works when everybody knows everybody else .
When merchants and customers know each other , government officials and citizens know each other , and people know their neighbours , people know what ’s going on .
In that sort of milieu , if something goes wrong , people notice .
In our modern anonymous world , paperwork is how things get done .
Traditionally , signatures , forms , and watermarks all made paperwork official .
Forgeries were possible but difficult .
Today , there ’s still paperwork , but for the most part it only exists until the information makes its way into a computer database .
Meanwhile , modern technology — computers , fax machines and desktop publishing software — has made it easy to forge paperwork .
Every case of identity theft has , at its core , a paperwork failure .
Fake work orders , purchase orders , and other documents are used to steal computers , equipment , and stock .
Occasionally , fake faxes result in people being sprung from prison .
Fake boarding passes can get you through airport security .
This month hackers officially changed the name of a Swedish man .
A reporter even changed the ownership of the Empire State Building .
Sure , it was a stunt , but this is a growing form of crime .
Someone pretends to be you — preferably when you ’re away on holiday — and sells your home to someone else , forging your name on the paperwork .
You return to find someone else living in your house , someone who thinks he legitimately bought it .
In some senses , this is n’t new .
Paperwork mistakes and fraud have happened ever since there was paperwork .
And the problem has n’t been fixed yet for several reasons .
One , our sloppy systems generally work fine , and it ’s how we get things done with minimum hassle .
Most people ’s houses do n’t get demolished and most people ’s names do n’t get maliciously changed .
As common as identity theft is , it does n’t happen to most of us .
These stories are news because they are so rare .
And in many cases , it ’s cheaper to pay for the occasional blunder than ensure it never happens .
Two , sometimes the incentives are n’t in place for paperwork to be properly authenticated .
The people who demolished that family home were just trying to get a job done .
The same is true for government officials processing title and name changes .
Banks get paid when money is transferred from one account to another , not when they find a paperwork problem .
We ’re all irritated by forms stamped 17 times , and other mysterious bureaucratic processes , but these are actually designed to detect problems .
And three , there ’s a psychological mismatch : it is easy to fake paperwork , yet for the most part we act as if it has magical properties of authenticity .
What ’s changed is scale .
Fraud can be perpetrated against hundreds of thousands , automatically .
Mistakes can affect that many people , too .
What we need are laws that penalise people or companies — criminally or civilly — who make paperwork errors .
This raises the cost of mistakes , making authenticating paperwork more attractive , which changes the incentives of those on the receiving end of the paperwork .
And that will cause the market to devise technologies to verify the provenance , accuracy , and integrity of information : telephone verification , addresses and GPS co-ordinates , cryptographic authentication , systems that double - and triple - check , and so on .
We ca n’t reduce society ’s reliance on paperwork , and we ca n’t eliminate errors based on it .
But we can put economic incentives in place for people and companies to authenticate paperwork more .

At least 12 people may have died in violent clashes with Iran 's security forces following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election , ­according to reports from the country .
The reported fatalities have come amid a brutal crackdown on students , apparently aimed at quelling a wave of campus rebellions that authorities fear could spill over to the wider population .
A Farsi website , Balatarin , carried an unconfirmed report that seven people had been killed in the southern city of Shiraz following confrontations with riot police at the local university .
Five busloads of plainclothes officers had been sent to confront the demonstrators during Sunday 's protests , but were said to have been unable to prevent them from being joined by members of the public and marching to one of the city 's main squares .
It is unclear whether all those said to have died were students .
The Guardian understands that five students may also have died in clashes at Tehran University early on Sunday .
The students – named as Fatemeh Barati , Kasra Sharafi , Mobina Ehterami , Kambiz Shoaee and Mohsen Imani – are believed to have been buried today in Behesht - e - Zahra , a famous cemetery in Tehran , reportedly without their families being informed .
Autnews , a student website , claimed that plain clothes officers used firearms against students after forcing their way onto the campus .
Students were said to have sought refuge in toilets after police raided halls of residence , where rooms were ransacked and beds set on fire .
Tonight Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran 's parliament , appointed a committee of MPs to investigate the reports .
The reported fatalities appeared to be backed up by one witness , who said a force of around 300 plainclothes and riot police joined basij forces ( militia volunteers ) to attack the students .
" We had nowhere to hide but the toilets and bathrooms , and they shouted : ' You traitors to the Islamic republic , you bastards , leave the building or we 'll shoot you all . '
Many students were severely wounded – we could hear injured students groaning and shouting for help , " the witness said .
" At 3 am they announced on loudspeakers : ' If you evacuate the building we wo n't harm you .
Otherwise , you 'll all be injured or killed . '
All the students then came out of the building in lines , with their hands on their heads .
The police hit them with batons and some started to shout that they had conquered the dorms .
Eventually they let us go back to our rooms but at least 10 had been shot , some appeared to have been killed and hundreds were injured . "
Another witness , Majidreza Sobhani , 21 , a mechanical engineering student , said police smashed locks to force their way into students ' rooms .
" I can't describe what they did to me and friends .
Just go to our dorms and see what our rooms look like , " he said .
Violent incidents were reported at Isfahan University , where 60 students were taken into custody following clashes that left halls of residence badly damaged .
Some students were said to have been injured after being thrown from upstairs windows .
Protests also took place at Hamedan University and Babol University in Mazandaran province on the Caspian Sea , where demonstrations are said to have spread to four towns after police attacked students .
Riot police surrounded the campus of Tabriz University , which has historically been a hotbed of radical protest .
Anger was apparent too at Amir Kabir University in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad was forced to flee the campus after angry protests more than two years ago .
Some 150 lecturers and around 500 students staged a sit-in at the campus mosque , mirroring an action by academics at another Tehran institution , Sharif University , on Sunday .
Senior Justice Department lawyers in 2005 sought to limit tough interrogation tactics against terror suspects , but were overruled .
James Comey , then the No. 2 official at the Justice Department , tried to convince Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the tactics were wrong and would eventually damage the reputation of the department .
The New York Times reported Comey sent an e-mail at the time describing his efforts to curtail the use and combination of the tactics that critics call torture .
" I told him the people who were applying pressure now would not be there when the ( expletive ) hit the fan , " Comey wrote in an e-mail obtained by the Times .
" It would be Alberto Gonzales in the bull ’s - eye .
I told him it was my job to protect the department and the AG .
and that I could not agree to this because it was wrong . "
A person familiar with Comey ’s concerns , speaking on condition of anonymity , told The Associated Press that Comey sought to put limits on the use of the interrogation tactics because he argued they were wrong on moral and ethical grounds , and they did n’t work .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a matter still under investigation .
The Justice Department has been conducting a long - running investigation into the conduct of the lawyers who wrote legal memos authorizing the CIA to use a variety of harsh measures , including sleep deprivation , slamming suspects into walls and waterboarding — a form of simulated drowning — as means to make those terror suspects talk .
The memos were the subject of internal debates within the Bush administration and were later made public by the Obama administration .
Following the memos ’ release , some critics of the past administration have called for those who authorized the methods to be prosecuted as criminals .
The Times reported on its Web site Saturday that even among those Justice Department lawyers who objected to some of the methods , there were few claims that specific methods violated the law banning torture .
In releasing the memos , President Barack Obama said no CIA officials would be prosecuted for following the legal advice they were given .

Trusting Banks as Far as You Can Throw Them
I was kind of dozing , idly dreaming of playing golf , where if I was n’t putting the ball right into the cup from 25 feet away , then I was chipping it in from 25 yards out , wowing the crowd with deft wedge action , whereupon my caddy , a beautiful girl in a bikini and stiletto heels , would say , “ Oooh !
Nice one !
You are so good that it gets me hot !
I am panting for you , my Hot Mogambo Golfing Stud ( HMGS ) ! ”
Suddenly , I was jolted rudely awake by alarms ringing in the Mogambo Bunker Of Paranoid Delusions ( MBOPD ) at the news of a drop of $ 40 billion of Total Fed Credit last week .
Wow !
This is the “ money ” that magically appears , literally “ out of thin air , as a new credit on the books of the banks , which they can then loan out some Huge Freaking Multiple ( HFM ) of that little bit of new credit , thus creating lots and lots of new money .
And this huge $ 40 billion downward swing of Total Fed Credit in one week is a Big Freaking Bunch ( BFB ) , where the total effect on the banks is the reciprocal of the fractional reserve ratio , which is at least 10 times as much according to the classical textbook examples , but more likely a thousand times as much , seeing as how the Federal Reserve itself says that total bank assets are now a whopping $ 12.030 trillion and total bank liabilities are $ 10.780 trillion , against which the banks are only “ required ” to have $ 57.622 billion as reserves !
Hahaha !
So what does that make the fractional reserve ratio ?
187 - to - one ?
Hahaha !
We ’re freaking doomed by out - of - control fractional - reserve banking !
And in that regard , the M1 and M2 money supplies are still growing , with M1 up 17 % over last year and now hitting $ 1,596.2 billion ( $ 1.696 trillion ) and M2 up 8 % from this time last year , now hitting $ 8,327.9 billion ( $ 8.327 trillion ) .
Perhaps this is the reason the internationalforecaster.com quotes Nassim Nicholas Taleb , economist and author of the terrific book The Black Swan , as saying , “ Bank nationalizations are ‘ absolutely necessary ’ to stop them damaging the financial system further with more losses . ”
His sentiments are obviously echoed by New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini , who actually says the majority of U.S. banks are “ insolvent ” .
And as if anyone had to be told that bankers and politicians cannot be trusted , Mr. Taleb goes on , “ You can not trust the banks in taking risks , ” and because we stupidly did , we now “ have a very strange situation in which it ’s the worst of capitalism and socialism , a situation in which profits were privatized and losses were socialized .
We taxpayers have the worst . ”
And one of the reasons that you ca n’t trust the banks is revealed by Bloomberg.com when it ’s reported that one of the Federal Reserve morons , Dallas district - bank President Richard Fisher , said , “ The Federal Reserve is n’t capable of offsetting the ‘ flood ’ of U.S. Treasury borrowing with its bond - purchase program , which is helping to revive credit markets . ”
Hahaha !
I got a Hot Mogambo News Flash ( HMNF ) for this dork : yes they can !
There is nothing to stop them !
Hahaha !
Who ’s going to stop the Federal Reserve from creating all the money that the federal government wants to borrow , and then the Fed using the money to buy all the new government debt ?
Hahaha !
You gonna stop them ?
Hahaha !
Of course , he may be saying this because he and his Fed moron buddies have screwed everything up and he does n’t want to talk about that , or how Mises.org reported that “ The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) list of problem banks grew to 305 in the first quarter , the highest number since 1994 , ” to which they then ominously added that “ but of course the names of those banks are not released so that depositors can be forewarned . ”
This is probably why msnbc.com had the headline “ Most Banks Still Getting Weaker , Analysis Shows , ” with an explanatory subhead of “ First - quarter reports show bad loans increasing at 60 % of banks , ” which seems somewhat understated since later we read that “ Overall , bad loans rose another 22 percent in the quarter . ”
Even worse , it is even more lopsided than that , as , “ While the 10 largest banks reported $ 10.2 billion in earnings for the quarter , the remaining 8,245 banks together lost $ 2.6 billion , according to the analysis , ” which comes down to “ One in five banks lost money in the quarter , and several lost big , weighing down the rest . ”
The disintegration of the banking system , the fall of the dollar and the ruination of everything connected with them seems the perfect place to remind you that if you are not buying gold , silver and oil to profit from this governmental incompetence and stupidity , then there is something Very , Very Wrong ( VVW ) with you , which means you probably stopped paying attention already , which leaves the rest of us who ARE buying gold , silver and oil , meaning that there is nothing more to say about buying gold , silver and oil !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !

They – through the efforts of people like Pete Forde and the Ruby local heroes at Unspace – know how to maximize grassroots organization and harness them into industry - leading events like last year ’s RubyFringe and the upcoming FutureRuby conference .
It should therefore not be a surprise that when Pete and company got the idea to help out their fellow Ruby developers during the econopocalypse with a job fair – employment .
nil ? — they ’d take the standard techie job fair formula , turn it upside down and make it their very own .
They chose the Gladstone Hotel in Toronto ’s hip West Queen West neighbourhood , which is better known as a venue for karaoke , rock bands and burlesque ( in fact , I ’ve performed in all three kinds of shows there ) than for computer and IT - related employment fairs .
This was not your typical job fair .
It did n’t have any of the fancy display stands that you normally see on the exhibition floor at tech conferences .
Instead , both job - seekers and small companies were told to build poster board displays , a la high school science fairs .
Another rule : no computers allowed !
Even iPhone apps were considered “ cheating ” .
The closest you were allowed to get was using whiteboards or pen and paper for “ live coding ” .
This was n’t about staring at computer screens , but people talking to other people – people who were passionate about the Ruby programming language and its associated frameworks , libraries and communities .
An excerpt from the sign - up page for employment.nil ?:
Let ’s face it : it ’s better to be a Ruby developer than a car manufacturer in 2009 , but things have definitely slowed down — for everyone .
And yet , there are solid reasons why this is an excellent time to start new projects , launch companies , and create new markets .
By definition , Ruby has been adopted by creative individuals that grew frustrated with risk averse bureaucracies .
We believe that there are huge number of opportunities to be found during this economic downturn , both for freelance developers and aspiring entrepreneurs alike .
As with most tragic historical near - misses , there are just a huge number of connections that are n’t made even in our own collective back yard .
More from the job fair ’s site :
That said , we also believe that Ruby people are determined self - starters that are n’t afraid to self - promote .
Anything worth doing in life requires hard work and sacrifice .
Sadly , while many developers are patient and willing to think orthogonally , we rarely get an opportunity to practice the other more social skills which make us desirable as team members , project managers , and co-founders .
Unless we overcome our shyness and learn to speak eloquently about our experience and skill sets , we have nobody to blame for our work prospects but ourselves .
Our solution is to gather students , developers , development companies , and of course project leaders and company founders for a good old - fashioned career fair .
As you can see from the photos , there were different kinds of booths set up .
There were those for companies looking to hire some Ruby developers …
and those deidicated to showcasing some interesting application of Ruby , such as lojacking iPhones :
… or HacklabTO ’s own Jed Smith showing how we harness Ruby to drive our laser ( yes , we ’ve got a laser etcher / cutter ! ) :
And some booths were set up by Ruby programmers showcasing their own work and who were looking for a job :
The event was n’t just noticed by the Ruby community , who filled the room throughout the 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. course of the event .
Late in the afternoon , Ontario ’s Minister of Small Business and Consumer Services , Harinder S. Takhar , paid a visit to the job fair .
Pete , ever the gracious event curator , took Mr. Takhar to several booths , introducing him to their owners , who were only too happy to show the Minister their Ruby - related work .
Here ’s Andrew Burke of Shindig , showing him the projects he ’s taking on in his independent software consultancy :
Here ’s Kieran Huggins showing Mr. Takhar his work in MyTTC.ca :
I ’m sure that grassroots high - tech events with a strong “ indie ” aesthetic are outside the Minister ’s everyday experience , but he seemed pretty impressed with the event : a dedicated group of nerds building software and careers using only laptops , stuff you can download for free and their brain cells .
Here ’s
Pete explaining the local Ruby developer scene and the concept of open source software to Mr. Takhar :
And here ’s Mr. Takhar presenting Pete with an award of recognition for Unspace for putting the event together .
At that point , I broke out the accordion and played For He ’s a Jolly Good Fellow , partly for the Minister for showing up on a Saturday afternoon , but partly for Pete for putting the event together .
Here ’s a close - up of the award :
It reads :

Conservative leader David Cameron has said the government is " falling apart " after the third resignation by a cabinet minister in three days .
He said Britain needed " a strong united government " and said Gordon Brown should call a general election " for the sake of the country " .
James Purnell 's shock resignation on Thursday night follows news that Jacqui Smith and Hazel Blears are quitting .
The Lib Dems said it was clear the government was in " total meltdown " .
Mr Purnell 's resignation letter - printed in Friday 's newspapers - calls on Mr Brown to " stand aside " to give Labour " a fighting chance of winning " .
' One final act ' Downing Street said Mr Purnell had informed Mr Brown " shortly before 10 pm " - when the story broke across news outlets .
Mr Cameron , who has been calling for a general election in the wake of the MPs ' expenses scandal , said a united government was needed to deal with the recession and political crisis .
" Instead we have a government falling apart in front of our eyes .
Britain deserves better than this .
The people of this country have clearly lost confidence in the Labour government and it seems now that ministers are losing confidence in their droves
Danny Alexander
Liberal Democrats
PM told to go as minister quits " With this resignation , the argument for a general election has gone from being strong and powerful to completely unanswerable . "
He added : " For the sake of the country , Gordon Brown must carry out the one final act of authority left open to him , go to the Palace and call the general election we have been demanding . "
Mr Purnell 's resignation is the first direct challenge to Mr Brown 's leadership from a cabinet minister .
Expenses allegations In Hazel Blears ' resignation letter on Wednesday she said she wanted to return to the grassroots .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The only honourable course of action would be for the PM to call a general election and then the people can decide if they want Gordon Brown as leader Joanna Jones , Twickenham
But the timing of the resignation , the day before the local and European elections , raised questions - while she also did not pay the customary tributes to the prime minister , who had criticised her behaviour over expenses .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is understood to have told Mr Brown at Easter she wanted to stand down for her family - following expenses allegations against her .
She said on Thursday he was the right man to lead the Labour Party .
For the Liberal Democrats , Danny Alexander told the BBC : " It is clear that the Labour government is in total meltdown , that Labour is finished as a government .
" The people of this country have clearly lost confidence in the Labour government and it seems now that ministers are losing confidence in their droves .
We may well see more resignations . "
He said it was " simply not possible to imagine " Labour continuing to govern for another year and called for a general election .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
When the Department of Homeland Security warned in April that the financial crisis and Barack Obama ’s election were inflaming right - wing extremists , many conservatives were outraged .
But a spate of high - profile murders this year has prompted questions about whether the government should have been more proactive .
In April , Richard Poplawski , a 22 - year - old frequenter of white supremacist websites , was charged with fatally shooting three Pittsburgh cops .
In May , former militiaman Scott Roeder was accused of gunning down abortion doctor George Tiller ( he pleaded not guilty this week ) .
In June , 88 - year - old neo - Nazi James von Brunn allegedly killed an African American security guard at the Holocaust Museum in Washington , DC .
Only then did the government spring into action .
Later that month , federal agents in three states moved against a prominent far - right leader and his associates , with almost no attention from the national press .
At 6:45 a.m. on June 25 , agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) arrested Dennis Mahon on domestic terrorism charges stemming back to a crime committed more than five years ago .
An indictment from a federal grand jury in Phoenix , unsealed in late June , charges Mahon with constructing a pipe bomb that exploded in Scottsdale city office that promotes racial and cultural diversity .
The blast severely injured the office ’s director and hurt two other staffers .
Mahon and his twin brother , Daniel , were also accused of conspiring to build and send the bomb , and with disseminating training materials on domestic terrorism .
Also on June 25 , the ATF arrested Robert Joos — a 56 - year - old white supremacist preacher in Missouri — in connection with the Mahon investigation .
According to court documents , Dennis Mahon had told an undercover agent that Joos was an expert on bomb making .
( In the end , Joos was only charged with illegal possession of weapons . )
On the same day , ATF agents also raided the northern Indiana home of the 71 - year - old Tom Metzger , the head of White Aryan Resistance ( WAR ) and a longtime associate of Dennis Mahon .
Mahon has been known to the feds for many years .
During my years of reporting on right - wing extremists , I ’ve encountered him on several occasions , and interviewed him a couple of times .
He ’s known as a blustery self - promoter who likes to be the center of attention ( in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing , he sent reporters Christmas cards signed “ the white terrorist . ” )
Mahon , who is 59 , is a former aircraft mechanic .
He once belonged to a Klan group called the White Knights , and later joined Tom Metzger ’s WAR , which advocates for racial separatism .
On Metzger ’s behalf , Mahon traveled to Germany in September 1991 to meet with Berlin skinheads , reporting in a newsletter that he had visited the Reichstag : “ It was very inspiring to walk up the same steps that Adolph Hitler walked up …
We did visit a Concentration Camp at Sachsenhausen , and had a real laugh at the wild stories and oversize photos of the ‘ victims . ' ”
In the 1990s , Mahon and his girlfriend , Carol Howe , spent time at a religious compound in the Ozarks .
At some point during this period , Howe became an ATF informant .
Then , on April 19 , 1995 , a bomb exploded in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , killing 168 people and injuring more than 600 others .
During the trial of Terry Nichols , who was eventually convicted of conspiring to help carry out the attack , Howe testified under oath that she had heard Mahon advocate violent action against the government , and that she had accompanied a group from the compound on a possible expedition to case the bombing site .
Mahon himself expressed support for Timothy McVeigh , who was sentenced to death for the bombing .
However , he was never charged with any involvement in the attack .
For several years after that , Mahon , like many white supremacists , laid low .
“ After the bomb went off in Oklahoma City , the White Knights completely collapsed , ” Mahon told the Kansas City Star .
“ They were scared to death .
They just went down the hidey - hole . ”
But by 2004 , Mahon had moved to Arizona and , according to the investigation , he was ready to take up the cause again .
The indictment says that in February that year he helped to construct a bomb , disguised it in a cardboard box , and mailed it to Scottsdale ’s Office of Diversity & Dialogue .
When the director , an African American named Don Logan , opened the package , it exploded in his hands .
Five years later , Mahon was apprehended by the feds .
The big question looming over the case is :
What took them so long ?
HUMAN EVOLUTION :
Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains ?
Science , Volume 283 , Number 5410 Issue of 26 Mar 1999 , pp. 2004 - 2005
A controversial new theory suggests that cooking -- in particular , cooking tubers -- sparked a crucial turning point in human evolution
Already this work , which Wrangham has presented at meetings , has provoked skepticism , for it challenges the current dogma that meat - eating spurred the evolution of Homo erectus , the 1.8 - million - year - old species whom some anthropologists say was the first to possess many humanlike traits .
But the idea dovetails with another challenge to the primacy of meat - eating as an evolutionary force : the notion that gathering by females was crucial , which another team of anthropologists will present in the May issue of the Journal of Human Evolution ( JHE ) .
And some researchers find the new perspective , based on a potpourri of data from both archaeology and modern human societies , quite refreshing .
" Cooking as making such a difference is not something that I had previously considered , " says Andrew Hill , a paleoanthropologist at Yale University .
" It 's nice to have this put forward . "
But skeptics say there is a very good reason why this idea may be half - baked .
If early humans did cook tubers , then they must have controlled fire about 1.8 million years ago -- but the first clear evidence for hearths is n't until about 250,000 years ago .
" The application of heat for food was a late thing , " says C. Loring Brace , an anthropologist at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .
" I think [ Wrangham ] is on the wrong track . "
Invoking diet to explain the differences between H. erectus and earlier forms such as H. habilis , a species known only from fragmentary fossils , and our more apelike ancestors , the australopithecines , is nothing new .
The size difference between males and females in H. erectus is narrower than it is in the australopithecines of half a million years earlier .
And the brains of both sexes grew larger while their guts and teeth shrank ; the most dramatic changes occurred between specimens assigned to early Homo species and those classed in H. erectus .
" There 's no other point [ in time ] when you get such large changes , " says Wrangham .
The traditional dietary explanation , however , is a shift from nuts and berries to meat .
Cut marks on animal bones suggest that humans had mastered meat - eating , perhaps by scavenging carcasses , by 1.8 million years ago .
Many researchers have assumed that this high - quality food fueled the rise of H. erectus , enabling it to process food with smaller teeth and guts and nourishing larger brains and bodies .
And with more food to go around , females began to catch up with males in size .
But Wrangham and his Harvard team think a range of evidence , from archaeology to studies of primates and modern human societies , argues against that scenario .
They question whether scavenged carcasses could have been a major staple .
And they point to hints that even the more apelike australopithecines may have consumed meat more than a million years earlier ( Science , 15 January 1999 , pp. 303 , 368 ) , without evolving big brains or changing their overall size ; indeed , other modern omnivores eat meat without large increases in body size .
Nor do modern tropical hunter - gatherers rely heavily on meat .
Among modern tropical African tribes , " there is no case of [ people ] eating more meat than plant food , " Wrangham points out .
For example , anthropologists James O'Connell and Kristen Hawkes of the University of Utah , Salt Lake City , found that although a hunter belonging to the Hadza tribe of Tanzania on average might catch one large animal per month , often weeks would go by with no kills .
The Hadza hunt with bows and arrows , technology far more advanced than that of any early humans , yet even for these modern hunters , " this is no way to feed the kids , " says Hawkes .
But if meat was n't responsible for the increase in brain size 1.8 million years ago , what was ?
Cooked tubers , says Wrangham , arguing that these starchy roots would have been quite abundant on the plains of Africa 2 million years ago , even when drier climates made fruits , nuts , and perhaps animal prey scarce .
Today , there are 40,000 kilograms of tubers per square kilometer in Tanzania 's savanna woodlands , for example .
Other tuber - eating animals , such as wild pigs , thrived in Africa during this time , and Wrangham notes that fossil mole rats , which subsist almost entirely on tubers , have been found among hominid remains from 2 million years ago .
Observations of living apes also offer some precedence for primates digging up roots .
For example , chimps in a dry region of the Congo dig down an arm 's length to reach the root of a particular vine , then chew on its moist root and carry it as a canteen for long trips .
Some apes pull up lakeside herbs and eat the subterranean parts , says Wrangham .
Thus even Australopithecus may have munched tubers .
But the real revolution came once human ancestors tasted a tuber baked in a lightning - sparked grass fire and realized the value of cooking , Wrangham asserts .
Heat turns hard - to - digest carbohydrates into sweet , easy - to - absorb calories .
Using the protein , fat , and carbohydrate makeup of modern fruits , seeds , meats , and tubers , Wrangham 's team calculated the caloric value of diets containing various proportions of these foods , assuming a constant total amount of food dry matter .
A diet of 60 % cooked tubers , about the proportion used in modern native African diets , and no meat boosts caloric intake by about 43 % over that of humans who ate nuts , berries , and raw tubers , says Wrangham .
A 60 % meat diet offers just a 20 % advantage .
" There seems to be a genuine energetic advantage in cooking food , " agrees Yale 's Hill .
" This could lead to a shift in human behavior " as well as physical changes such as smaller teeth .
" Tubers have a lower fiber content [ than other plant foods ] , and that would fit very nicely with this [ idea ] , " adds Leslie Aiello , an anthropologist at the University College in London .
" And cooking would just accentuate this . "
Wrangham takes his tubers even farther , arguing that they set off another whole chain of evolutionary events .
As a valuable resource , cooked tubers needed to be safeguarded from theft .
Because cooking requires food to be gathered and held in one place rather than eaten during foraging , males could simply wait until dinner was done , so to speak , and steal it from females .
According to Wrangham , females attempting to thwart theft would use sexual attractiveness to recruit the best male defenders .
This tended to offer plenty of mating opportunities for males and less rivalry among them , hence less selection for large males .
Thus , while females evolved a larger body size -- either to better produce and nourish babies or to fend off stealing -- males stayed about the same size , and the size gap between the sexes narrowed .
At the same time , the rudiments of the modern human social system -- pair - bonding in family groups - - took shape .
To some , that scenario does n't add up .
" I can't imagine there was such a dependency on females cooking tubers that males did nothing , " says Anna K. Behrensmeyer , a paleoecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C.
But another group of anthropologists agrees that gathering and cooking tubers could have altered human behavior .
In their upcoming paper in JHE , O'Connell , Hawkes , and Utah colleague Nicholas Blurton - Jones assume that modern gender roles have their roots deep in the past , so that while men were out hunting or scavenging , females , including grandmothers whose own children were grown , brought home the daily bread .
Earlier humans foraged for fruits and nuts , which children as well as adults can gather , says Hawkes .
But tubers , with their high caloric value , offered a food source rich enough to feed the group without the children 's contribution .
This " means [ the group ] is no longer tethered to resources that children can get , " explains Hawkes , and led to longer lived , better nourished populations of H. erectus .
She and O'Connell also argue that these humans were then able to handle a wider range of environments , spreading into grasslands and cooler climates as the fossil record indicates .
But Henry Bunn , a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , has a more typical -- and skeptical -- reaction to the tuber theory .
He says Wrangham 's team " downplay [s ] lots of sound evidence that we have [ for meat - eating and fire use ] and [ accepts ] at face value problematic evidence . "
A major problem for the theory , notes Hill , is that where there 's cooking smoke , there must be fire .
Yet he , Michigan 's Brace , and most other anthropologists contend that cooking fires began in earnest barely 250,000 years ago , when ancient hearths , earth ovens , burnt animal bones , and flint appear across Europe and the middle East .
Back 2 million years ago , the only sign of fire is burnt earth with human remains , which most anthropologists consider coincidence rather than evidence of intentional fire .
O'Connell counters that fires for cooking tubers rather than meat " might have been very ephemeral " and left few traces , but most of his colleagues remain unconvinced .
" I think there would be evidence if it were [ behind ] as important an evolutionary leap as [ Wrangham 's team ] suggests , " says Behrensmeyer .
Even Wrangham agrees that more evidence is needed .
" There has n't been enough satisfactory archaeology for people to get their teeth into , " he says .
But he also contends that the more he looks into the question , the more convinced he is of cooking 's great importance , even 1.8 million years ago .
" What could be more human , " he asks , " than the use of fire ? "

Letter
Did the use of fire for cooking lead to a diet change that resulted in the expansion of brain size in Homo erectus from that of Australopithecus africanus ?
With regard to the discussion by Elizabeth Pennisi ( News Focus , 26 Mar. , p. 2004 ) about the debate among anthropologists regarding the cooking of tubers by Homo erectus , whether or not they cooked tubers and / or meat , they certainly had the capacity for using fire , and thus , in principle , to cook .
Not only is there considerable evidence for human association with fires before 240,000 years ago at Zhoukoudian in China , and in Africa at Chesnowanja and Swartkrans ( 1 , 2 ) , but a number of well - documented fireplaces have been recovered in the Okote tuff at Koobi Fora in Kenya , found by the late Glynn Isaac and Jack Harris ; others were found later by Harry Merrick ( 3 ) .
These fireplaces have been dated by the potassium - argon method to approximately 1.6 million years ago and were undoubtedly made by humans , as they contain a mixture of woods , including easily ignited palm wood , used to make the fires .
Charles Peters of the University of Georgia and I have a chapter on these fireplaces in a forthcoming volume in the Koobi Fora publications series ( 4 ) .
The most accessible report on these fireplaces ( 3 ) demonstrates differences between burned trees and the circular fireplaces not only among the H. erectus - associated remains -- which included one irregular burned spot containing largely phytoliths of the same wood , thus apparently a burned tree -- but also in present - day replications .
Additional fireplaces excavated from the Okote tuff by Merrick at Koobi Fora have not yet been described in the literature .
The relative thinness of the bone in the sides of the skull of H. erectus compared with that of earlier hominids , along with the smaller teeth , make it clear that H. erectus was doing something to make chewing easier .
They clearly had the pyrotechnical ability to cook tubers at least as far back as 1.6 million years ago , even if further research must determine exactly what was cooking .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Gov. Mark Sanford is set return to his office Wednesday following widespread confusion over his whereabouts , a spokesman for the South Carolina Republican said .
Gov. Mark Sanford was hiking along the Appalachian Trail , a spokesman said late Monday .
Joel Sawyer , Sanford 's communication 's director , also said in a statement the governor called his chief of staff Tuesday morning and was " somewhat taken aback by all of the interest this trip has gotten . "
The mystery surrounding his whereabouts was solved late Monday when a Sanford spokesman said he was hiking along the Appalachian Trail .
" I apologize for taking so long to send this update , and was waiting to see if ( we had ) a more definitive idea of what part of the trail he was on before we did so , " Sawyer said in an e-mail to reporters .
Sanford 's whereabouts were unaccounted for Monday when he stepped out of the public eye following a bruising session with the state Legislature .
Even his wife , Jenny , said she did not know where he was , The Associated Press reported , according to The State newspaper in Columbia , South Carolina .
" I want to emphasize that this is n't something that either staff or Mrs. Sanford is concerned about , " Sawyer wrote Monday night .
" As we said earlier today , it is n't unusual for the governor to be out of pocket for several days after the legislative session .
We knew that he would be difficult to reach , and that he would be checking in infrequently .
Given the media attention this has generated , we 'll obviously update you once we have some more specifics to pass along . "
Earlier , Sawyer told CNN in a statement , " Before leaving last week , he let staff know his whereabouts and that he'd be difficult to reach .
Should any emergencies arise between the times in which he checks in , our staff would obviously be in contact with other state officials as the situation warrants before making any decisions . "
Sawyer did not address Jenny Sanford 's comments to the AP .
State Sen. Jake Knotts , a fellow Republican and adversary of Sanford , told CNN that South Carolina law enforcement officials informed him Saturday that the governor had taken a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division vehicle on Thursday and had not yet returned .
" I found out that he was taking frequent trips at odd times of the night in a SLED car with no security , " Knotts said .
" He would be driving .
I got wind that he had taken another one of these types of capers last Thursday , and that nobody knew who he was with .
Knotts added that on Saturday , he " was getting wind that he had not shown back up and nobody knew where he was . "
He said a SLED official told him Monday that Sanford still had not returned .
" He needs to transfer the power and let the lieutenant governor , which the constitution requires , let him be the person that makes the decisions . "
Knotts said .
" My concern was ' Who would be in charge should an emergency arrive for the safety of the people and citizens of the state ? ' "
State Senate Minority Leader John Land , a Democrat , accused Sanford of engaging in " erratic " behavior .
" We 've been concerned by the governor 's erratic behavior for some time , " Land said in a prepared statement .
" We 're praying for him and his family .
I hope he is safe and that he contacts the first lady and his family soon . "

A smaller cousin of crows and ravens , the jackdaw , has eyes not unlike those of humans , with a dark pupil and whitish - colored iris .
Edgar Allan
Poe 's raven may possess demonic " fiery eyes , " but its smaller jackdaw relative can interpret human eye cues and even follow human gestures such as pointing .
The jackdaw 's ability to read communicative cues puts it on par with rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees , according to new research .
" I think they can generalize to human eyes somehow , and interpret human eyes as eyes , " said Auguste Bayern , a cognitive biologist at the University of Oxford and lead author on a study in the April 2 online issue of the journal Current Biology .
Jackdaws possess human - like eyes with dark pupils and light blue or silvery irises .
And that may give the social birds an edge in understanding signals from friendly humans .
Hand - raised birds in the study could find food in a " cooperative " scenario when a familiar person 's eyes looked back and forth from the food to the bird .
They also responded when the person pointed to the food 's location , but did not react when the person turned their head toward the food .
Wary response
That sensitivity to human eye signals contrasts with the lesser sensitivity of birds such as chickens , Bayern told LiveScience .
She explained that many birds are sensitive to eye - like patterns without showing much understanding of more subtle eye cues that communicate information .
However , the jackdaws took longer to approach food when an unfamiliar person was watching , and in this case paid attention to where a person 's head was turned .
A similar delayed reaction occurred when the person kept an eye closed or was glancing away with one eye on the food , even when the researchers replaced the person with images of a person 's face .
The skittish response to unfamiliar humans may reflect an evolved response to potential predators or other threats , when subtle eye cues are less important than head orientation , Bayern said .
Predator birds such as owls and goshawks tend to turn their entire head when looking — and besides , it 's probably too late for any unlucky jackdaws close enough to see a predator 's subtler eye movements .
Jackdaws may have evolved a response to more subtle eye cues not from threat of predation , according to the study , but instead from cooperation as social animals .
The birds often form lifelong partnerships with mates , and their survival success depends on close communication .
Big brains
This fits with the theory that social sophistication may select for intelligence in evolution , Bayern said .
Jackdaws belong to the corvid family of birds , which biologists consider among the most intelligent birds along with parrots .
Some crow cousins have demonstrated tool - usage on par with that of apes .
" If you compare them to apes , our closest relatives , they 've got exactly the same brain size relative to body size and weight , " Bayern noted .
Even chimpanzees have shown themselves less responsive to eye cues , possibly because their darker eyes lack the contrast between white human eyeballs and darker pupils .
" As it looks now , apes are surprisingly bad at looking at eyes , because it seems like other cues such as head direction are much more important , " Bayern said .
" But I think they understand a bit . "
Fire Suzanne Lukas as Bonny Eagle High School Superintendent
by : Kenny Williams
recipient : State of Maine / Maine Board of Education
The story about Suzanne Lukas denying Justin Denney , a student , his high school diploma for simply bowing and blowing a kiss to his mother is absolutely horrendous , and it 's something that Ms. Lukas should not have done .
Ms. Lukas claims that Justin was " fooling around " when it 's blatantly obvious that he was n't in any way , shape , or form .
There 's no doubt that this action by Ms. Lukas has outraged every single person who has read the story , as is evident by the numerous comments left on an untold number of websites showing support for Justin .
Ms. Lukas had absolutely no right to deny Justin his diploma for bowing and blowing a kiss to his mother , and her actions no doubt prove that she is completely unfit to be a school superintendent .
This petition is calling for Ms. Lukas 's immediate removal from her position as we , the American public and people who have heard this terrible story , feel that anyone who exhibits the kind of unnecessary behavior that Ms. Lukas did towards Justin does n't deserve to be a school superintendent , much less any kind of school employee whatsoever .
A notorious Indian bandit has been shot dead after a fierce 48 - hour gunbattle that saw him take on 400 armed police , officials said .
Ghanshyam Nishad , armed with rifles and hand grenades , was hiding in a village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh when police moved in to arrest him .
Five policemen were killed and more than a dozen wounded in the ensuing shoot - out , which only ended when police evacuated villagers from the area and set their homes on fire to smoke out the fugitive .
" We finally tracked him and killed him , " senior police officer Brij Lal said .
Alleged gang leader Nishad was wanted in connection with a string of murders and robberies across the state .

Home Secretary Alan Johnson has dropped plans to make ID cards compulsory for pilots and airside workers at Manchester and London City airports .
The cards were due to be trialled there - sparking trade union anger .
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said that the reverse in policy was " an absurd fudge " and " symbolic of a government in chaos " .
But Mr Johnson said the ID card scheme was still very much alive - despite Tory and Lib Dem calls to scrap it .
He said the national roll - out of a voluntary scheme was being speeded - up - with London to get them a year early in 2010 and over - 75s to get free cards .
Voluntary basis
As a result of Mr Johnson 's announcement , foreign nationals living and working in the UK will be the only group of people who will have to have the cards , with 50,000 already having been issued .
BBC political correspondent Jo Coburn said the government 's original vision for ID cards was that the scheme would eventually become compulsory .
This is another nail in the coffin for the government 's illiberal ID cards policy

Q&A : ID cards
The government has always insisted it would not make them compulsory for UK citizens without giving MPs a vote on the issue - and it would not be compulsory to carry them .
It had been planned to make them compulsory for all 200,000 airside workers from 2009 but instead the government announced there would be an 18 - month trial , for airside workers at Manchester and London City airports only .
But the pilots union Balpa had complained that its members had effectively been forced into signing up for the cards .
ID cards were initially promoted as an anti-terror measure , but Mr Johnson said they should not have been sold as the " panacea for tackling terrorism " which he said had been responsible for " messing up " the debate .
Mr Johnson added : " People who worked airside were resenting the fact there was compulsion involved .
" Now we can have a much more constructive discussion about the issue if we remove that one element of compulsion .
He added that ID cards were " an important tool for tackling terrorism " , but were not " the whole toolbox " .
But Mr Grayling rendered the decision made them even more of a " white elephant " .

" They have spent millions on the scheme so far - the home secretary thinks it has been a waste and wants to scrap it , but the prime minister wo n't let him , " Mr Grayling added .
" This is no way to run the country . "
Mr Johnson said it was " nonsense " to suggest he had wanted to scrap the scheme .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the proposed ID cards would now be " nothing more than a second - rate passport " .
" This is another nail in the coffin for the government 's illiberal ID cards policy , which will soon be so voluntary that only Home Office mandarins seeking promotion will have them , " Mr Huhne added .
" These expensive and intrusive plans should be ditched now . "
' Back door ' Balpa 's General Secretary Jim McAuslan welcomed the decision , which he said was " sensible " .
He added that the union would " be stressing to its members the new voluntary nature of the scheme " and " monitoring airport operators to ensure they stick to the new rules and do n't bring in compulsion by the back door " .
Brian Boyd , national officer of Unite the Union , which represents thousands of airport workers and lobbied against compulsory cards for its members , welcomed what he called a " sensible choice " by the home secretary .
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said the decision was a " victory for union campaigning " .
However , in a statement , the campaign group No2ID said the " humiliating climbdown " was not the end of the scheme .
" It 's just part of the ongoing attempt by senior Home Office officials to fortify the scheme against cancellation and to bind the hands of a future government , " the statement added .
The rollout of the ID card scheme will be accelerated on a voluntary basis for UK citizens , starting in Greater Manchester by the end of the year .
Residents in other locations in the North West of England will be able to apply from early 2010 , while the government 's intention is to roll out the scheme in London in the same year - 12 months early .
Some 3,500 UK citizens have already applied for the cards .
But the Tories - who say they will scrap the scheme if they win the next general election - have written to five firms bidding to supply ID cards warning them not to sign any long - term contracts .
Shadow Immigration Minister Damian Green accused Mr Johnson of a " flagrant breach " of a ruling by the Speaker that ministerial announcements must be made first to the Commons by briefing the media before he released a written statement .

Jim Darkmagic appears here , in his first comic at Penny Arcade - a comic we are prepared to expand upon substantially , if this is your collective desire .
Of course , that mat not be your collective desire .
It may be that you saw Lookouts last Wednesday , investigated the additional materials , and found something resonant there .
It is also entirely possible that something in Automata appealed to you - perhaps you feel , as we do , that androids and prohibition are natural fellows .
You have a choice to make .
We have invented a machine to catalog your will , and it awaits your input .
We ’ll leave it up for twenty four hours or so , assess the situation , and deliver you a full report .
Gratification wo n’t be instant , by any means : in a subversion of everything the Internet represents , the comics would run in late July .
Based solely on Twitter feedback , Automata seems to be the front runner .
As I said , I think we could give you something noteworthy on all three concepts .
Also , no matter what you picked , you ca n’t actually lose : we ’ll try to come back to all of these eventually .
We are n’t foolish enough to commit to a timeline , but there ’s a reason we put them in front of you .
Eventually , we wo n’t be able to resist .
I ’m sort of between games at the moment .
Kiko and I were attempting to play Demigod fairly regularly until we played an online match that went so incredibly wrong that I can’t bring myself to execute the application anymore .
It was harrowing on that level .
The “ tug of war ” in the game is exhilarating , but once that phase is over , it ’s like being dragged behind a truck .
Whenever I am not imagining the ways in which your three comic options can resolve themselves , I am trying to fashion my mind into something capable of perceiving Knights in the Nightmare .
Another psychotic import with an incredible translation from Atlus , the shit that goes on in this game will overwhelm your frontal lobe , leaving you in a state which is neither dead nor alive .
Imagine that a man is juggling while standing on a pile of conscious , scowling heads .
Only he ’s not juggling balls , he ’s juggling concepts , like poverty and flavor .
As you watch him , you are shaken by the unprovable yet unnerving sensation that there is , somewhere , a secret third hand , juggling a perverse cadre of unballs .
Okay .
Now , imagine that this is all a good thing .

I received an email from a listener whose coworker recommended the 2002 book Never Be Sick Again : Health Is a Choice , Learn How to Choose It , by Ray Francis .
I checked out its Amazon page , and if the book 's content was n't clear from the title , it certainly was from the reviews .
The " research " Francis presents are personal anecdotes like the following :
After meeting Ray Francis , Albert learned that his diet of processed foods and addiction to sugar were the crux of his problem .
Within one week after implementing Francis 's eating plan , he felt better physically .
In desperation , her parents consulted with Ray Francis who surmised that her newly painted , carpeted and furnished bedroom was a toxic soup .
After sleeping in another room , Anne 's seizures stopped .
Wow !
Sounds miraculous .
Could all of medical science be wrong , and could the solutions really be that simple ?
Apparently so , according to Francis ' summary of human health :
There is only one disease , only two causes of disease , and six pathways to health and disease .
His findings and astounding recovery supported his conclusion that almost all diseases can be both prevented and reversed .
People are n't actually going to believe that kind of nonsense , are they ?
They do , in droves .
Never Be Sick Again has 36 reviews on Amazon , of which 29 are 5 - star .
Readers uncritically accept that Francis has discovered the next generation of medicine .
They believe this because of their own anecdotal observations , like this one posted by a reviewer :
I am a 10 year cancer survivor .
I have had surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy .
None of it worked .
For the past 8 years I have stayed alive on alternative therapy .
If the cancer treatment " did n't work " , why are you still alive ?
This kind of self - delusion never ceases to amaze me :
For years , this person underwent proper medical therapy to treat his cancer , and is alive today as a result .
And yet , for some reason , he considers that treatment a failure , and credits nonscientific quackery with his health ever since .
It 's not hard to understand why the average person might make such a connection : Cancer therapy can be terribly painful and unpleasant , and alternative therapy generally has no side effects .
When you do recover , which treatment are you likely to credit :
The one that seemed to make things worse , or the one that was pleasant that was correlated with the time when the chemotherapy effects were wearing off ?
I have n't read Ray Francis ' book , and am not likely to .
I 've seen enough of these scams to be able to guess its contents : Francis ' " one disease " is probably " toxicity " , and his " two causes of disease " are probably diet and " environmental toxins " .
It seems so simple , and it's so easy to convince people that it 's true based on their own experiences , like that of the cancer patient .
It 's a simple , clear explanation that appeals perfectly to our tendency toward anecdotal thinking .
The book 's publisher , Health Communications , Inc. , ( www.hcibooks.com) publishes many such books , and so you might conclude that they have little regard for public health .
I certainly choose to personally make such a conclusion , despite their disclaimer inside the book that begins :
Never Be Sick Again and the information contained in this book are not intended as a substitute for the advice and / or medical care of the reader 's physician , nor are they meant to discourage or dissuade the reader from the advice of his or her physician .
I had to laugh when I read that .
Of course the book is clearly intended to discourage the reader from listening to his physician .
This disclaimer is ludicrous .
Did they not read the book ?
One of Francis ' chapters is titled " The New Theory of Health of Disease " .
When you encounter a nonscientific crank who claims to have overturned all of existing science or medicine with his " new theory " , you always have very good reason to be skeptical .
The Pinal County Sheriff 's Office arrested a 15 - year - old ninth - grader accused of bringing a soda bottle filled with drain cleaner to a Queen Creek - area school after the bottle burst and injured him and eight other children .
Sheriff 's spokeswoman Lt. Tamatha Villar said the teenager told investigators he has been practicing building such devices with different chemicals and reactive agents to see what happened .
The suspect , whose name was not released , was being held Monday night at a juvenile detention facility on suspicion of aggravated assault , disorderly conduct , disruption of an educational institution , and disposal of an explosive device .
Villar said that the teen did n't offer a motive to investigators .
� There 's no reason for us to believe his intent was to blow up the school or cause the mass damage , � she said .
The incident unfolded at 8 a.m. Monday at J.O. Combs Middle School in Pinal County and led to two children being taken to a hospital by ambulance as a precaution ; others were taken to hospitals by their parents .
Authorities said at least four children were treated and released by late afternoon .
A total of six boys and three girls suffered what were described as minor - to - moderate injuries that included burns to their hands , faces , and arms .
Villar said that one girl appeared to have suffered burns to the eyes .
District officials said staff members first thought the bottle had been filled with vinegar and baking soda , because students had been using that mixture in recent science experiments .
But Steve Henry , chief sheriff 's deputy , said the sheriff 's office was treating the bottle and mixture as an �improvised explosive device , � or IED , usually a description reserved for deadly homemade explosives used by terrorists .
Meanwhile , a Rural Metro official said the school did n't contact 911 when the explosion occurred and instead had the children take showers .
Rural Metro was finally notified about 2 � hours later .
� We were never called for the explosion .
We should have been , � said Bill Grubb , deputy fire chief for Rural Metro .
� The call did n't evolve right .
Somebody made a mistake . �
District officials said school staff called poison control and followed directions on how to treat the students , which �provided the students with temporary relief , � according to a prepared statement .
Paramedics were called later when the students again complained of � some discomfort .�
The statement said school officials were still investigating the incident .
� Poison control was good , but 911 would have been ideal , � Villar said .
Combs eighth - grader Courtney Borseth said she saw one female victim after she had taken a shower .
� She had red all over her arms , � she said .
About 1,000 students were locked down in their classrooms while officials looked for additional explosives and a HAZMAT crew cleared the area .
Early Monday afternoon , the students were bused to the district office at Combs and Gantzel roads , where parents were asked to pick them up .
Some parents who showed up at the school after being notified of the incident by phone said they were upset and faulted district officials for a lack of security at the school .
Staff writer Emily Gersema and the Associated Press contributed to this report .
" The orthodoxy says that you will be attractive with a certain waist - hip ratio no matter how the rest of your body varies , " Prof Brooks told the New Scientist .

President commits more than 3 % of GDP to research & development
On Monday , President Barack Obama reiterated his administration ’s focus on science by promising a new level of commitment — one with the same intensity and urgency as that which put Americans on the moon — and stressing that “ the days of science taking a back seat to ideology are over . ”
“ We have watched as scientific integrity has been undermined and scientific research politicized in an effort to advance predetermined ideological agendas , ” said Mr. Obama .
Speaking at the 146th National Academy of Science annual meeting in Washington , D.C. , Mr. Obama pledged to raise spending on research and development to more than three percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product , an increase of approximately $ 46 billion annually .
“ This represents the largest commitment to scientific research and innovation in American history , ” said the President .
The federal share of the proposed increase on scientific research and development is in the ballpark of $ 15 billion — $ 15 billion that is no easy sell in today ’s tough economic climate .
“ We have finally closed the books on the Bush era of climate denial once and for all , ” said Carl Pope , Executive Director of the Sierra Club , in a Tuesday statement .
“ Science is allowed to lead and agencies like the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are once again in the business of protecting the public and our planet , ” Pope said in advance of President Obama ’s 100th day in office on April 30 .
>> See also : Bush Administration Just Says No to Science
Much of President Obama ’s remarks centered on the role of math and science in developing a new ways to create and save energy , stressing that faith in scientific inquiry should be embraced , not shunned , in the face of difficult challenges like global climate change .
“ Our future on this planet depends on our willingness to address the challenge posed by carbon pollution , ” said Mr. Obama .
“ And our future as a nation depends upon our willingness to embrace this challenge as an opportunity to lead the world in pursuit of new discovery . ”
The President also announced for the first time that the the government would be funding an initiative recommended by the NAS called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy ( ARPA-E ) .
ARPA-E is modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which was created during the Eisenhower administration in response to Sputnik and charged throughout its history with conducting the kind of high - risk , high - reward research that produced the APRANET , the precursor to the internet , stealth technology , and Global Positioning System .
The President said that to rise to the challenge of global climate change , the United States “ will not just meet , but we will exceed the level achieved at the height of the space race . ”

Hoping to persuade possible Mac buyers that Apple charges an arbitrary " tax " for its computers , Microsoft has paid one analyst to create a report that portrays Windows PCs as less expensive — even if it has to artificially pad the Mac 's price and hide Windows ' costs to get there .
Analyst Roger Kay of technology research firm Endpoint Technologies was told to produce a paper that shows the " hidden tax " of buying Macs , both in the cost of the systems themselves as well as in the software and services to accompany them .
In the study , Kay claims that Apple has marginalized itself and its market share by producing a closed ecosystem that only allows users to buy Mac OS systems from Apple and thus prevents them from buying models that are potentially cheaper or in more appropriate configurations .
The company has deliberately chosen to ask a premium for a small range of computers and , as a consequence , locked itself out of the wider market — a boon when the economy was doing well and Windows Vista poorly , but not in the current financial climate , the analyst says .
" Appleâs premium pricing strategy actually enhanced the productsâ appeal ( for a select few ) .
As in , only I can afford this fancy stuff , " Kay writes .
" [ But ] by holding a price umbrella over the entire market , even with arguably better products , Apple allowed the entire Windows ecosystem to establish itself underneath ...
Mac users may be paying more for image than substance and investing heavily in coolness thatâs cooling off . "
He also echoes Microsoft 's recent marketing lines by questioning whether Apple systems are " really so cool " given the alleged extra overhead .
Coincidentally , Microsoft has released a third anti-Apple ad which sees a mother and son that go to Best Buy to look for a gaming - capable notebook below $ 1,500 .
They dismiss Macs as too expensive and too small , ultimately buying a 16 - inch Sony VAIO FW instead .
To illustrate his point , Kay draws comparisons between Macs and purportedly equivalent systems , but it's here that Microsoft 's position as the source for the report manifests itself in multiple factual errors as well as calculated additions or omissions .
Roger Kay 's notebook comparison : note the obsolete MacBook used as an example .
While pointing out that Apple 's MacBooks lack memory card readers or HDMI video output , Kay uses an already - obsolete version of the white , $ 999 MacBook to portray the system as slower than less expensive PCs from Dell and HP .
And while certain features such as the amount of memory and hard drive space are unambiguously in the Windows PCs ' favor , he also consciously overlooks other figures when they would tilt in favor of Apple , such as newer processor generations or faster graphics chipsets .
The presences of Bluetooth or faster 802.11n Wi -Fi support , as well as portability considerations such as battery life and system weight , are also excluded from the available data .
Many of the same errors are repeated and at times magnified for desktops .
Even when discounting glaring mistakes made in describing only discontinued Macs in charts but new models in text , the analyst dismisses the relevance of significantly faster graphics in the Mac mini , iMac and Mac Pro while simultaneously trumpeting relatively small advantages in the Windows PCs , like card readers and TV tuners .
The processors , amount of memory , and storage in current - generation Macs are now equal to and sometimes better than the Dell and HP systems chosen by Kay and Microsoft for the comparison chart .
Unusually , Kay and Microsoft also choose to sidestep Apple 's higher - end iMacs altogether and try to equate a Mac Pro with a HP Pavilion desktop ; according to the paper , a modern Xeon workstation is feature - equivalent to a mid-range home system with a previous - generation Core 2 Quad processor and slower graphics .
Roger Kay 's desktop comparison ; all the Macs illustrated are obsolete and now outmatch rivals in some areas .
The Endpoint researcher further attempts to exaggerate any difference by attempting to portray a real - world scenario for buying a high - end desktop , a low - end notebook , accessories and software over a five - year span .
Here , he claims a $ 3,367 " Apple tax " over the period but pushes the cost of the Apple system upwards by selectively adding systems and add - ons to the Mac that are unnecessary .
Aside from picking the significantly more expensive Mac Pro instead of a 24 - inch iMac , Kay forces the Mac buyer to maintain a 5 - year subscription to MobileMe , a year of One - to - One service at an Apple retail store , an upgrade copy of iLife , and to buy copies of Microsoft Office and Quicken that he presumes the Windows user already owns .
Moreover , he insists that the Mac buyer must also make stranger and arbitrarily more expensive hardware purchases to equal the Windows sample .
Rather than buy the equally Mac- compatible Linksys wireless router , the Mac owner is pushed to buy a more expensive Airport Extreme unit , and is told that a stand - alone Sony Blu-ray movie player meant for TVs is equivalent to an internal Blu-ray drive for computers , adding $ 205 to the price .
All told , the Mac user in a typical situation is asked in the study to pay $ 2,517 more than would be necessary over the period , assuming the example shopper buys a $ 1,799 iMac .
While a gap still exists , the difference closes to just $ 850 and assumes not only that the systems are equivalent but that the Windows user has no other hidden costs , such yearly subscriptions to security suites ( which remain more common than free alternatives ) or the bundled trial software used to subsidize the actual cost of the PC .
Kay 's five - year plan for Macs and Windows PCs .
Note the Mac Pro , Sony movie player and unequal purchases of services and software .
Kay has already had an opportunity to present his point of view on the report since its publication and told CNET on Thursday that Microsoft had padded costs even further in the information it initially hand - fed to him to produce the report ; if he had n't excluded these , the portrayed gap between the Apple and Windows purchases would have been even higher .
Still , he contends that it " would n't change things much " if he found some additional costs to pare back .
Endpoint 's author also maintains that , despite the obvious discrepancies , Microsoft 's core argument remains : since Apple only offers a relatively small collection of systems , buyers are less likely to get the exact systems they want or to know they 're being charged fair prices .
The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra has lived through a lot in the past 20 years .
Yugoslavia has been reinvented in different , ever - shrinking configurations , finally dissolving altogether with the divorce of Serbia and Montenegro .
Belgrade has gone from being the capital of the West 's favourite communist state to a warmongering pariah , target of 78 days of Nato bombing raids , to being the latest applicant to join the EU .
Through it all the band played on .
So it is ironic , now Serbia has at last a real prospect of rejoining the West , that the city 's finest flowering of classical Western culture should be struggling to survive .
But that was the sub - text of an advertisement that recently appeared in the city 's papers , to readers ' consternation .
" The national Philharmonic orchestra , with 85 years of tradition and a rich repertoire , can now play at your house for a reasonable fee , " the advertisement ran .
The 96 " perfectly trained musicians " offered to play " at weddings , funerals , baptisms , birthdays , divorces and saints ' days ...
We have suitable attire for all occasions . "

Could the mighty Belgrade Phil be serious ?
Blasting away at bar mitzvahs , in full penguin get - up ?
" This was our way of drawing the attention of a broader public to the problems of the Philharmonic , to somehow present our financial problems in an absurd , Monty Python way , " the orchestra 's director , Ivan Tasovac , 42 , explained .
Because today the orchestra is in serious trouble .
Having climbed a hill since the end of the Yugoslav wars , clambering back from near - extinction , the orchestra has found itself sliding down another slippery slope because of the global recession .
Serbia has slashed its culture budget from € 78 m ( £ 66 m ) to € 56 m , of which only about 1.5 per cent goes to the orchestra .
Like other important national institutions including the National Theatre and the National Museum , it is staring into the abyss .
Yet while high culture languishes , the government pours millions of euros into commercial events such as a pop festival called EXIT in the northern city of Novi Sad and a popular folk trumpet festival held in the town of Guca in central Serbia , events that that attract hundreds of thousands of young people from all over former Yugoslavia and beyond .
Millions are spent subsidising concerts by huge stars such as Santana ( in July ) and Madonna ( in August ) , which are sure to be attended by tens of thousands of fans .
Critics complain that financing events of this sort , although they undoubtedly boost tourism , is a misuse of the state 's culture budget .
Meanwhile the members of the Belgrade Philharmonic are paid a pittance by international standards .
The top musicians earn some € 700 per month , but most earn only €350 .
" It 's no wonder , " said Mr Tasovac , " that , in order to survive , members of the orchestra moonlight at jam sessions , or with popular folk music singers " .
Everything is relative , of course : with EU membership beckoning , the orchestra has begun to compare its pay packets gloomily to those of its counterparts further to the west .
In the days of President Slobodan Milosevic , the salary of a player was the equivalent of a few pounds a month , while the central Belgrade building that is its headquarters was crumbling away .
It was also used for end - of - year children 's concerts , and parents who came to hear their little ones tootle worried that the building might collapse around their ears .
Seats were broken , as was the air conditioning system , and both the performers and the audience practically suffocated .
After Milosevic fell in 2000 following the Kosovo war , the Philharmonic underwent an unprecedented revival .
Its home was substantially rebuilt and the auditorium completely renovated .
Today the air conditioning is perfect , defying the scorching heat of June in Belgrade .
The lightly - perfumed white marble halls echo with the footsteps of an ensemble that has an average age of 30 .
Many of the young musicians were educated abroad , like Mr Tasovac himself , and began their careers outside Serbia , returning after 2000 in the hope that the future would be brighter .
Since then the orchestra has toured the world and played before the most sophisticated audiences , and has also hosted famous artists from abroad , including Zubin Mehta , Sarah Chang and Nigel Kennedy .
" But all this is in danger now , " said Mr Tasovac .
Hence the " Monty Python " advertisement .
The effect was almost instantaneous .
Within 36 hours a Facebook support group had sprung up with several thousand members .
" With the advertisement , we galvanised our audience , " he said .
" The people who greeted the downfall of Milosevic with great enthusiasm , the same people who last year elected the pro-European Boris Tadic Serbia 's President . "
At the same time the advertisement attracted a surge of support from new , younger music fans .
Classical music lovers now hope that Mr Tasovac 's professionalism , marketing skills and charisma will enable the orchestra to make it through the crisis .
And the wit of the " we will play anywhere " ad was intrinsic to the orchestra's new appeal – in the same spirit , according to Mr Tasovac , as the jocular protests against Milosevic in the 1990s , which in his view had a greater role in precipitating his overthrow by a popular revolt than the isolation of Serbia by the West during the 1990s .
To say thank you for the overwhelming show of support , the orchestra recently held a " Concert of Gratitude " at its headquarters , playing to a packed hall and tens of thousands more who listened in via the internet .
" During the 1990s , middle - class values almost died here , " commented one Belgrade resident , Mirjana Jankovic , 53 .
" It 's good to see them staging a revival . "
" I know classical music is as popular in Serbia as roast pig in Tehran , " Mr Tasovac added .
" In that sense , Serbia is no different from other countries .
But with a little humour we have drawn the public 's attention to what is one of the best Serbian brands , and its financial problems . "

Have you ever discussed the bible in which many Christians claim to believe with a Christian ?
If so , the odds are good that you may have asked the Christian about some of what you found in the Old Testament .
When you did this , you were almost certainly told that whichever part you asked about is no longer valid ( although depending on who you are talking to , some parts of Leviticus may still apply ) .
Somehow , the good parts of this book are still perfectly valid but the bad or embarrassing ones are not .
Interesting how that seems to work , is n't it ?
Jesus , the Christian might insist , did away with the various bad parts you point out .
Of course , the Christian will not be able to show you anything in their bible that makes it clear that this was the case .
The Christian just knows it somehow , and you are expected to believe it too .
A reader - I 'll call him Jason - e-mailed me a great question recently .
It is one I have received several times .
In fact , it is one I have asked several times !
I am going to post it here , take a stab at answering it and then invite you to chime in .
I readily admit that my answer is tentative , as I am really not sure about the most effective way to respond .
Let 's get to the question .
Here is Jason 's question :
I recently had a discussion with a Christian , and I asked him why Christians cherry pick from the bible .
I brought up stuff from the old testament , like women not being allowed to dress fancy in church .
His response was , " That 's mosaic law and we are under a new law now . "
I did n't know how to respond to this .
What would you say ?
I also hear Christians respond with " that 's the old testament or Judaism .
Christians follow the new testament " .
Are these legitimate responses to challenges to the bible ?
No , I do not regard these as legitimate responses at all .
The challenge , and what I hope to get some input from my more informed readers , is how best to articulate why .
It seems to me that one has a couple of avenues from which to respond .
First and most challenging , there are passages in the New Testament where the statements attributed to Jesus seem to make it clear that he was NOT coming to change anything about the old laws ( e.g. , John 14:15 says , " If you love Me , keep My commandments . " ) .
So the first line of response might be to point the Christian to such statements .
The problem with this and the reason I described this route as most challenging is that the Christian bible can be used to support virtually anything .
There are so many inconsistencies that it is difficult to come away without concluding that it is utter gibberish .
Some will argue that Jesus only abolished certain rules while endorsing others .
Thus , I believe that Matthew 5 - 7 is often used to support the notion that Jesus came to fulfill prior law so that continued observance was no longer necessary .
Of course , nobody seems to agree on what was supposedly abolished and what was supposedly retained .
In fact , interpreting the meaning of " fulfill " is a massive controversy ( Matthew 5:17 says , " Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets .
I did not come to destroy but to fulfill " ) .
Spend a little time on Google , and you 'll get a sense for just how contentious this issue remains .
A second response and the one which I prefer takes the Christian 's claim at face value and probes the implications .
I might remind them that their Ten Commandments are found in the Old Testament .
I might remind them that the biblical basis for anti-gay bigotry is found there as well .
If this does not get me where I want to go , I might present them with some of the more atrocious parts of their New Testament and see how they excuse those .
I might share some of the many contradictions of the New Testament .
And then , the character of this supposed Jesus figure could be addressed too .
Finally , I might demonstrate how the New Testament is cherry - picked as well .
Of course , one could also argue that none of the above really matters because there was likely no historical Jesus .
Based on what we know of how and when the Christian bible was written , it is highly probable that none of the quotes are even remotely accurate .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has set out wide - ranging proposals to " clean up " and modernise British politics in an effort to reassert his authority .
He promised a consultation on changing the voting system - but he said there were " no plans " for a referendum on this issue before the next election .
He also pledged tougher sanctions for MPs guilty of misconduct , including the power for constituents to recall MPs .
Tory leader David Cameron said the " real change " needed was an election .
And he accused Mr Brown of trying to " fix " the electoral system in his party 's favour by scrapping the current first - past - the - post system , which allowed voters to get rid of " weak , divided and incompetent governments and that is what we should be doing now " .
He said proportional representation was a " recipe for weak coalition governments " and Mr Brown had only started talking about it " because he fears he is going to lose " .
Expenses scandal Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg - whose party has long argued for electoral reform - welcomed Mr Brown's " deathbed conversion " to the cause " from the man who has blocked change at every opportunity for the last 12 years " .
The SNP and Plaid Cymru are to hold a debate on calling a general election now , backed by the Tories and Lib Dems .
KEY PROPOSALS MP code of conduct Independent regulation Electoral reform Complete Lords reform Recall bad MPs Written constitution Lower voting age Extend freedom of information
In full : Constitution proposals A rallying cry for reform ?
Cabinet papers ' to stay secret '
But Justice Secretary Jack Straw said the scandal about MP expenses has increased the public 's appetite for further constitutional change .
He told the BBC News channel : " The responsibility of this House of Commons , of the people in the House of Commons , is to sort out the expenses scandal first .
" It 's completely disingenuous of David Cameron to say have a general election - that will sort it out .
It wo n't sort it out at all .
It 's a precondition of having a general election to sort it out . "
Mr Brown made his statement to MPs on constitutional reform as he seeks to regain the political initiative after a week of turmoil .
' Seize the moment '
In his statement , Mr Brown confirmed plans for a new independent Parliamentary standards authority and a new bill to be introduced before MPs break up for the summer recess setting out a legally binding code of conduct for MPs .
This would set out what the public could expect from their MPs and make it easier to expel those who misbehaved .

He also pledged a crackdown on misconduct in the House of Lords and vowed to press ahead with democratic reform of the Upper Chamber and he promised to give urgent consideration to lowering the voting age .
He said Labour MP Tony Wright , chair of the public administration committee , would work with a cross-party Parliamentary commission to discuss constitutional reform .
This will look at other reforms such as making select committees " more democratic " and a mechanism to allow the subjects of petitions handed in to Downing Street to be debated in the House .
He also pledged to consult on extending Freedom of Information laws to bodies spending public money that were not currently covered by it and said official papers would be published after 20 rather than the current 30 years - excluding Cabinet papers and material relating to the Royal Family .
' Stand together ' A review headed by Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre recommended lifting the veil of secrecy after 15 years .
In the midst of all the rancour and recrimination , let us seize the moment to lift our politics to a higher standard
Prime Minister Gordon Brown
As it happened : Brown statement Mr Brown repeated his commitment to consult on a written constitution - something he said he personally supported - and House of Lords reform .
He told MPs : " In the midst of all the rancour and recrimination , let us seize the moment to lift our politics to a higher standard .
" In the midst of doubt , let us revive confidence .
Let us stand together because on this at least I think we all agree : that Britain deserves a political system equal to the hopes and character of our people .
" Let us differ on policy ; that is inevitable .
But let us stand together for integrity and democracy ; that is now more essential than ever . "
Tory leader David Cameron said he supported some of the proposed measures such as a Parliamentary standards authority and more power for local government .
But he repeated his call for unelected regional quangos to be scrapped and the number of MPs to be cut .
' Prepared to do it '
He said Mr Brown had promised constitutional change before and " nothing ever happens " and his current enthusiasm for it was merely a " relaunch distraction strategy " designed to get Mr Brown out of trouble .
Mr Cameron said a
Tory government would introduce true reforms such as referendums on council tax increases and the " right of initiative " - allowing voters to propose new laws .
Just to be clear : the prime minister 's statement will not - and was never going to - endorse a change of voting system nor any particular system

He also called on the PM to back select committee elections to end the power of prime ministerial " patronage " , adding : " I am prepared to do it , is he prepared to do it ? " .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said he welcomed many of the changes proposed by Mr Brown but said they had to be put in place before the next general election rather to put out to yet more committees .
Anything else would be a " betrayal of the British people who are angry and demanding that we change the rotten way we do politics for good , " added the Lib Dem leader .
On electoral reform , Mr Brown said he did not favour proportional representation for Westminster elections as he did not want to break the link between MPs and constituencies .
But he said a debate on whether the vote system should change .
Ministers are thought to have discussed an " alternative vote " system to replace the current first - past - the - post method .
Campaign group Unlock Democracy said they welcomed Mr Brown's " rhetoric " on constitutional reform but it was no substitute for action .
Unlock Democracy director Alexandra Runswick said : " This afternoon , Gordon Brown was reduced to performing the role of a bingo caller , listing a whole series of potential reforms yet offering almost nothing of substance . "

I came across this interesting article on Pattern matching in Python .
The article asks :
Can we recreate in Python the pattern matching semantics present in languages like Haskell and Erlang .
For those not familiar with the way pattern matching works , I 've copied the example from the article above .
What the above code does is to return " not a resource " if you call the handle function with the path parameter as " / " and any method .
If you call handle with any path and method parameter as " GET " then it calls retrieve_resource ( Path ) and so on .
A method to replicate this in Python was given using match objects , but I thought hey why go through all this trouble when PEAK - Rules does most of this for us ?
PEAK - Rules is a library that enables multimethod dispatch in Python .
Those with an OO background will recognise a specific instance of this in method overloading .
When an overloaded method is called , execution can go to different method implementations depending upon the type of the parameters passed .
In generic multimethod dispatch , you can route execution based on any criteria that you define .
PEAK - Rules brings this sort of generic multimethod dispatch to Python .
So lets take a concrete example .
Our goal is to rewrite the above Erlang code in Python using two libraries : PEAK - Rules and an add - on called prioritized_methods that allows prioritised method ordering .
First , you 'll need to get install PEAK - Rules and prioritized_methods .
You can pick them up from the links given or if you 've got setuptools , then you can just easy_install them .
Then type out the following code :
Here is what is happening : We first define an abstract function handle ( path , method ) .
Do this by placing the @abstract ( ) decorator on it .
Now consider this snippet :
This defines one implementation for the handle function .
It says , when the handle function is called , and the condition given is True ( in this case method == " GET " ) , then call the implementation given below ( here : the get_resource function ) .
Similarly we define the other implementations to be called on some other conditions .
The only thing left is the usage of @prioritized_when .
Now , when a call is made to handle ( " / " , " GET " ) , we see that the condition for not_a_resource as well as get_resource are satisfied .
Which implementation should be called ?
In this case , we use the @prioritized_when decorator and set the priority to 1 .
This tells the system to give priority to this implementation in case of conflict in match .
Here is how the output looks : Pretty cool !
The best part of this is that you can dispatch on virtually any condition .
While the resulting code is a little more verbose than the Erlang example , its not too bad and it does the job well .
“ Thank you very much .
Sometimes my wife asks me a very feminine question : that is , am I happy .
Well , let me say that at this moment in time , I am very happy .
Much thanks also to Thierry Frémaux for including me in this prestigious competition ; to my producers , for letting me do what I wanted ; to the funding sources which financed the film , and to the children , who were an enormous gift to me .

If you ’re seeking stats from 2008 , I ’ve compiled them on this similar post of 2008 social networking stats .
Update , now see the 2010 stats .
Stats are important – but on their own , they do n’t tell us much
Stats on social networks are important , but I ’m going to need your help in creating a community archive , can you submit stats as you find them ?
I ’m often asked , “ What are the usage numbers for X social network ” and I ’ve received considerable traffic on my very old post ( way back in Jan 08 ) of MySpace and Facebook stats , even months later .
Decision makers , press , media , and users are hungry for numbers , so I ’ll start to aggregate them as I see them .
How I interpret stats
Numbers do n’t tell us much without insight and interpretation , in fact , you ’re going to see conflicting numbers of usage from many of the agencies and social networks themselves .
The key is to look at trend movements , do n’t focus on the specific numbers but the changes to them over time .
I put more weight on active unique users in the last 30 days vs overall registered , in fact , the actual active conversion rate will often range from 10 - 40 % of actual users sticking around and using the social network , so do n’t be fooled by puffed numbers .
No single metric is a good indicator , you have to evaluate the usage from multiple dimensions , so you also have to factor in what are users doing , time on site , interaction , and of course , did they end up buying , recommending products , or improving their lives .

Twitter
Having spent time with Ev and Biz , they do n’t provide a lot of data and certainly not a total user count , as a result , we often have to estimate based on the following sources .
According to Compete , the growth rate for Twitter was 752 % , for a total of 4.43 million unique visitors in December 2008 , in the start of 2008 , Twitter had only around 500,000 unique monthly visitors .
Source : Mashable / Compete , Jan 9 , 2009 Demographics of Twitter : Lots of stats here : 11 % of online adults use Twitter or update their status online Twitter users are mobile , less tethered by technology , Pew Research , Feb 12 Quantcast data on Twitter indicates that Twitter.com is a top 500 site that reaches over 4.1 million U.S. monthly people .
The site attracts a more educated , slightly more female than male , young adult audience .
Quantcast , March Compete shows that Twitter is receiving 8 million unique visitors in the month of March 2009 .
Compete ( via Nick ) March 10 Comscore data shows that “ In February , 4 million people in the U.S. visited the site , up from 2.6 million the month before , according to the latest data from comScore .
That represents a 55 percent month - over - month growth rate , compared to 33 percent growth in each of the two months prior . ”
Comscore , March Unique visitors to Twitter increased 1,382 percent year - over - year , from 475,000 unique visitors in February 2008 to 7 million in February 2009 , making it the fastest growing site in the Member Communities category for the month , Nielsen , March “ Worldwide visitors to Twitter approached 10 million in February , up an impressive 700 + % vs. year ago .
The past two months alone have seen worldwide visitors climb more than 5 million visitors .
U.S. traffic growth has been just as dramatic , with Twitter reaching 4 million visitors in February , up more than 1,000 % from a year ago . ”
Comscore , April “ - the average user has 126 followers ; - only 20 % of its traffic comes through the Twitter website ; the other 80 % ( logically ) comes from third - party programs on smartphones or computers .
So if you ’re looking at Twitter stats on your website , you ’re probably underestimating that source of traffic by a factor of five ; - an early peak test of the service came during President Obama ’s inauguration in January , when more than 300 tweets per second were being added to the message queue . ” Guardian UK ( Quoting Twitter ’s Engineer Weaver ) , June .
“ 5 % of users accounted for 75 % of all activity .
This finding was based on indexing 11.5 million accounts , and then looking at the top 5 % users who accounted for most number of Tweets … .
We found that 32 % of all tweets made by the most active Twitter users were generated by machine bots that posted more than 150 tweets / day .
The actual percentage of machine - generated tweets among the most active users is probably higher than 32 % because there many bots that update less than 150 times / day , August , 2009 , Sysomos Highlights include : “ This shows us the exponential growth experienced by Twitter in 2009 .
In Q3 , this plateaus at a rate of about 8 million new users per month ” and “ As of September 1st , the actual number of live Twitter accounts was just above 50 million . ” and “ the average Twitter user has 42 followers .
It ’s interesting to see the distribution of users by the number of people following them ” and “ over 75 % of all Twitter users have tweeted fewer than ten times ” read more data from the source captured on , Oct 5 , RJReynolds Social Networking stats indicate that microblogging adoption has increased , those that are ‘ younger ’ are embracing ( there ’s limited age breakdown to justify what young means ) and those with mobile devices are more likely to tweet .

Clever hack :
Back during the debate for HR 1 , I was amazed at how easily conservatives were willing to accept and repeat lies about spending in the stimulus package , even after those provisions had been debunked as fabrications .
The $ 30 million for the salt marsh mouse is a perfect example , and Kagro X documented well over a dozen congressmen repeating the lie .
To test the limits of this phenomenon , I started a parody Twitter account last Thursday , which I called “ InTheStimulus “ , where all the tweets took the format “ InTheStimulus is $x million for ______ ” .
I went through the followers of Republican Twitter feeds and in turn followed them , all the way up to the limit of 2000 .
From people following me back , I was able to get 500 followers in less than a day , and 1000 by Sunday morning .
You can read through all the retweets and responses by looking at the Twitter search for “ InTheStimulus “ .
For the most part , my first couple days of posts were believable , but unsourced lies :
Terrorist group al - Qa'ida is likely to fragment in the coming years but an attack on Britain involving chemical or nuclear weapons is now " more realistic " , the Government warned today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith highlighted the danger posed by new technologies and failed states around the world as she published an updated counter - terror strategy .
The report - known as Contest Two - is the first unclassified document to contain a detailed account of UK officials ' assessment of the underlying causes of the terrorist threat and its likely future direction .
It contains a stark warning about the likelihood of an attack involving a " dirty bomb " .
The report says : " Contemporary terrorist organisations aspire to use chemical , biological , radiological and even nuclear weapons .
" Changing technology and the theft and smuggling of chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear and explosive ( CBRNE ) materials make this aspiration more realistic than it may have been in the recent past . "
It also notes that terrorists have created new explosives and new ways of using them , and that technology developed in conflict zones is quickly shared around the world .
Ms Smith was asked whether there was a greater threat of a CBRNE attack than five years ago .
She replied : " There is the potential , given the international situation , what we believe to be the aspirations of some international terrorists , that it could be . "
She outlined the underlying causes of the risk of terrorists using a CBRNE device .
" Failed states , conflict , technology - both in terms of the ability to use materials and the ability to learn about how materials are used - contribute to our concern about that as a threat , including what we know about what terrorists may have previously planned to do and may be planning to do , " she said .
The report said the threat to the UK came primarily from four sources .
These are : the al - Qa'ida leadership , terrorist groups affiliated to al - Qa'ida , " self - starting " terror networks or lone individuals motivated by an al - Qa'ida - style ideology , and terrorist groups with their own identity and agenda following a broadly similar ideology to al - Qa'ida .
The document said al - Qa'ida itself was " likely to fragment " under international pressure , and might not survive in its current form .

But its ideology will outlive changes to its structure , possibly leading to greater threat to the UK from smaller " self - starting " organisations .
The report added : " Terrorist organisations will have access to new technology and may become capable of conducting more lethal operations . "
The Contest strategy is divided into four strands - Prevent , Pursue , Protect and Prepare .
These cover preventing radicalisation of potential terror recruits , disrupting terror operations , reducing the vulnerability of the UK and ensuring the country is ready for the consequences of any attack .
Ms Smith called for the use of " civil challenge " to those who hold extremist viewpoints .
She cited the example of the Muslim activists who recently protested at a homecoming parade in Luton for British forces returning from Iraq .
She said : " The civil challenge means that , if people feel it appropriate to demonstrate against our troops coming home from defending this country abroad , we - as Government and others - will say in turn that we think that that 's wrong .
" Not that they 've broken the law - one of the things we 're defending in this country is the right to free speech , but that is n't free speech that will go unhindered or unchallenged by either Government or , I think , the broader community . "
But she ruled out a face - to - face meeting with the group , saying : " I 'm not inviting them in for a meeting because I think they 're wrong . "
The report comes amid ongoing controversy over the possible collusion of British agencies in the alleged torture of Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed .
The document said the Government 's stance on the issue was " uncompromising " .
It added : " The Government opposes the use of torture in all its forms , and the Government has always and will continue to condemn the practice of ' extraordinary rendition ' .
" UK agencies and police have not and will never engage in these practices . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " The horrific recent events in Mumbai have highlighted the need for fresh thinking in counter - terrorism , and the whole community needs to be involved in tackling the danger .
" No part of the UK is free from threat and we know that terrorists want soft targets .
" We have argued strongly that the Government is not doing enough to tackle the problem of individuals and groups in the UK who are fostering the hatred and extremism that lies behind the terrorist threat .
That really does have to change . "

Why Is The Senate Not Even Considering The Only Health Care Plan That Really Works ?
How many police does it take to silence the voice of the people ?
That 's a question a despot might ask in a totalitarian police state .
But this week the Senate Finance Committee thought it was a hilarious joke as they ejected one brave activist after another , for protesting that not even one spokesperson for single payer health care was being allowed to sit at the hearing table .
Yes , Senator Max Baucus ( MT ) , who had preemptively declared that consideration of a single payer option was off the table , actually joked " We need more police . " [ 1:58 on video ]
And the rest of the Senate panel just laughed their heads off .
Senator Chuck Grassley ( IA ) , the ranking Republican , not to be outdone in his contempt for the people , then asked if there was " somewhere they can watch it on television [ 2:05 on video ] , " which elicted additional hearty guffaws .
Yes , what a wonderful entertaining show that would be , the spectacle of the will of the people being excluded while corporate special interests , like butchers , carve up our pocketbooks and our bodies .
It 's time for the U.S. Senate to get the message that we the people are not just a joke to be laughed off .
Why is it that not ONE senator on that committee has the integrity to stand up for a even handed debate of health care issues ?
Why should any of them be elected to public office ever again ?

Comics writer Mark Sable was detained and intensively questioned by the TSA for carrying a script for an upcoming comic book about a writer who is detained and intensively questioned by the TSA for writing a comic about terrorism .
" Flying from Los Angeles to New York for a signing at Jim Hanley 's Universe Wednesday ( May 13th ) , I was flagged at the gate for ' extra screening ' .
I was subjected to not one , but two invasive searches of my person and belongings .
TSA agents then ' discovered ' the script for Unthinkable # 3 .
They sat and read the script while I stood there , without any personal items , identification or ticket , which had all been confiscated .
" The minute I saw the faces of the agents , I knew I was in trouble .
The first page of the Unthinkable script mentioned 9/11 , terror plots , and the fact that the ( fictional ) world had become a police state .
The TSA agents then proceeded to interrogate me , having a hard time understanding that a comic book could be about anything other than superheroes , let alone that anyone actually wrote scripts for comics .
" I cooperated politely and tried to explain to them the irony of the situation .
While Unthinkable blurs the line between fiction and reality , the story is based on a real - life government think tank where a writer was tasked to design worst - case terror scenarios .
The fictional story of Unthinkable unfolds when the writer 's scenarios come true , and he becomes a suspect in the terrorist attacks .
" In the end , I feel my privacy is a small price to pay for educating the government about the medium . "
“ The recent discovery that the hippocampus is able to generate new neurons throughout a human ’s lifespan has changed the way we think about the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and drug addiction , ” says Wen Jian and colleagues in a study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2005 .
It appears that cannabinoids are able to modulate pain , nausea , vomiting , epilepsy , ischemic stroke , cerebral trauma , multiple sclerosis , tumors , and many other disorders .
Cannabinoids act on two types of receptors , the CB1 receptors ( found mainly in the brain ) and the CB2 receptors ( found mainly in the immune system ) .
The CB1 receptor is one of the most abundant G protein coupled receptors in the mammalian brain and it accounts for most , if not all , of the centrally mediated effects of cannabinoids .
Cannabionoid receptors are evolutionarily conserved amoung various vertebrates and invertebrates which have been separate for 500 million years .
Hippocampal neurogenesis is suppressed following chronic administration of the major drugs of abuse ( including opiates , alcohol , nicotine , and cocaine ) .
However , CB1 - knockout mice display significantly decreased hippocampal neurogenesis , suggesting that CB1 receptors activated by endogenous , plant - derived , or synthetic cannabinoids may promote hippocampal neurogenesis .
Wen Jiang and colleagues have given the first evidence suggesting that both embryonic and adult hippocampal neural stem / progenitor cells ( NS / PCs ) express CB1 receptors .
Cannabinoids can regulate the proliferation of hippocampal NS / PCs by acting on CB1 receptors .
They found that both the synthetic cannabinoid HU210 and the endocannabinoid anandamide profoundly promote embryonic hippocampal NS / PC proliferation .
Chronic , but not acute , HU210 significantly increases the number of newborn hippocampal neurons in adult rats by promoting NS / PC proliferation .
These promoting effects are not the outcome of hippocampal neuronal death , as no neuronal loss or dying hippocampal neurons were detected following chronic HU210 injection .
A significant increase was observed in the hipoppocampal newborn neurons of mice following twice - daily HU210 injection for 10 days .
It has been shown that acute , high doses of cannabinoids produce anxiety - like effects in rats and depression - like effects in mice .
But chronic administration of high , but not low , doses of HU210 exerts anxiolytic - and antidepressant - like effects .
This suggests that cannabinoids are the only illicit drug that can promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis following chronic administration .
“ This increase in hippocampal neurogenesis underlies the mechanism of anxiolytic - and andtidepressant - like effects produced by a high dose chronic HU210 treatment . ”

The floor in the room above the kitchen in our house has a floor that slopes almost 1 inch per foot for half of the room .
Experimentally , we have found that this is steep enough to make a desk chair roll– kind of irritating , particularly to my special ladyfriend who happens to occupy such a chair in that zone .
To compensate for the slope , I decided to fit a stack of masonite sheets to the curve of the floor .
Unfortunately , the floor slopes nonlinearly in two directions , like the rounded corner of a swimming pool .
After making a series of measurements of the floor , I decided to fit a polynomial in two variables to the cloud of points using a least squares estimate .
( In retrospect , the floor was close enough to singly - curved that I could have gotten away with a linear fit . )
The blue thing in the picture is a level .
I shimmed the level until it was worthy of its name , and then measured the distance to the floor with calipers .
Estimating the flatness of the floor
I ’ll recount the basics from my earlier post about least squares fitting in Python .
Skip ahead to the next section if you read that already .
As before , the first step is to arrange the equations in canonical form :
Ax=y where :
* A is an M x N full rank matrix with M > N ( skinny ) * x is a vector of length N * y is a vector of length M
As matrices , this looks like
In polynomial fitting , A is called the Vandermonde matrix and takes the form :
The 3D case
In the 2D case , we ’re trying to find polynomial in x such that f( x ) approximates y.
In the 3D case at hand , we have two independent variables , so we ’re looking for a polynomial in x and y such that f( x , y ) approximates z .
Rather than the 2D case :
we want the final output to look like this :
( Spike Curtis astutely notes in the comments that I am omitting the cross terms , such as xy , and refers us to a Matlab script .
Spike is right , but the floor ’s already fixed . )
We can use two Vandermonde matrices next to each other .
Here ’s the Python code that creates the two Vandermonde matrices and joins them into one matrix .
x , y , and z are lists of corresponding coordinates , so , for example , x [ 5 ] , y [ 5 ] and z [ 5 ] are the coordinates of one point that the surface should approximate .
The order of the points is not important .
import numpy as np z = [ 0.0 , 0.695 , 1.345 , 1.865 , 2.225 , 2.590 , 0.0 , 0.719 , 1.405 , 1.978 , 2.398 , 2.730 , 0.0 , 0.789 , 1.474 , 2.064 , 2.472 , 2.775 , 0.0 , 0.763 , 1.453 , 1.968 , 2.356 , 2.649 ] x = [ 0.0 , 12.0 , 24.0 , 36.0 , 48.0 , 60.0 , 0.0 , 12.0 , 24.0 , 36.0 , 48.0 , 60.0 , 0.0 , 12.0 , 24.0 , 36.0 , 48.0 , 60.0 , 0.0 , 12.0 , 24.0 , 36.0 , 48.0 , 60.0 ] y = [ 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 , 24.0 , 24.0 , 24.0 , 24.0 , 24.0 , 24.0 , 48.0 , 48.0 , 48.0 , 48.0 , 48.0 , 48.0 , 72.0 , 72.0 , 72.0 , 72.0 , 72.0 , 72.0 ] degree = 3 thickness = 0.167 # Set up the canonical least squares form
Ax = np .
vander ( x , degree )
Ay = np .
vander ( y , degree )
A = np .
hstack (( Ax , Ay ) ) # Solve for a least squares estimate ( coeffs , residuals , rank , sing_vals ) = np . linalg .
lstsq ( A , z ) # Extract coefficients and create polynomials in x and y xcoeffs = coeffs [ 0 : degree ] ycoeffs = coeffs [ degree : 2 * degree ] fx = np .
poly1d ( xcoeffs ) fy = np .
poly1d ( ycoeffs )
Once I knew the coefficients of the polynomial approximation , I could calculate the contours of the masonite .
From a measurement of the stack of masonite , I knew the average thickness is 0.167 inches .
( Thanks to Dr. Alex T. Tung , Ph.D. , for helping me get the masonite home from Home Depot . )
To find out where the first layer should end , I picked a series of stations spaced every 12 inches along the length of the floor in the y - direction .
Along those stations , I solved f( x , y ) = 0.167 , f( x , y ) = 2 * 0.167 , f( x , y ) = 3 * 0.167 and so forth .
In practice , solving f( x , y ) = c , where c is a constant , means finding the roots of the equation f( x , y ) - c = 0 .
( The mathematicians call this solving the homogeneous equation . )
In Python , the numpy .roots method solves the homogeneous case .
For each contour / section crossing , I generated a polynomial of the form f( x , y ) - c and solved it with numpy .roots .
ystations = range ( 0 , 84 , 12 ) sections = [ [ np .
poly1d ( xcoeffs - [ 0 , 0 , zoffset - fy ( ypos ) ] ) for zoffset in np .
arange ( thickness , max ( z ) , thickness ) . tolist ( ) ] for ypos in ystations ] pts = [ [ min ( func .
roots ) for func in list_of_fs ] for list_of_fs in sections ]
For fabrication , I printed out a list of the locations where the masonite contours crossed the stations .
for ( pt_list , ystation ) in zip ( pts , ystations ) : print ( '
Boundaries at station y = { 0} inches : ' . format ( ystation ) ) print ( ' \t ' . join ( [ ' { 0:.3} ' . format ( pt ) for pt in pt_list ] ) )
Armed with my list of measurements , I headed to the garage and set up some sawhorses with a sheet of plywood to keep the masonite from bowing and flopping around .
It took a few hours of marking points and cutting gentle curves with a jigsaw , but the results were delightful .

As you can see above , I have n’t fastened the layers together yet .
They seem to be sticking together reasonably well .
In the end , I think the slope went from about a 2.75 ″ drop across the 48 ″ span , to within 1/8 ″ of flat across the same distance .
Sharon was delighted , and I found the whole project both more time - consuming and more satisfying than I expected .
President Obama suggested at a town hall event Wednesday night that one way to shave medical costs is to stop expensive and ultimately futile procedures performed on people who are about to die and do n’t stand to gain from the extra care .
In a nationally televised event at the White House , Obama said families need better information so they do n’t unthinkingly approve “ additional tests or additional drugs that the evidence shows is not necessarily going to improve care . ”
He added : “ Maybe you ’re better off not having the surgery , but taking the painkiller . ”
Obama said he has personal familiarity with such a dilemma .
His grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given less than nine months to live , he said .

She fell and broke her hip , “ and the question was , does she get hip replacement surgery , even though she was fragile enough they were not sure how long she would last ? ”
Obama ’s grandmother died two days before he was elected president in November .
It was unclear whether she underwent the hip - replacement surgery .
The event , hosted by ABC News ’ Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer , gave Obama a prime - time forum to promote his healthcare overhaul .
A total of 164 guests were invited .
ABC pre-screened questions , though the White House was not made aware of what they would be .
Republicans described the event as an “ infomercial , ” faulting ABC for giving the president such valuable TV time in the midst of a high - stakes partisan policy discussion .

The audience -- which included doctors , patients , health insurers , students and people with ailing relatives -- clearly was unhappy with the current healthcare system .
Gibson asked for a show of hands to see how many wanted to leave the system unchanged .
No one raised a hand .

Over twenty years ago , the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody lambasted the Australian government , police and prison authorities over the number of Aborigines dying in their care .
While it ruled out deliberate , foul play - people were n't being murdered - it found a widespread culture of neglect towards Aboriginal prisoners .
Basically , those in power did n't give a shit about them , and were quite content to see them die or hang themselves in jail .
Unfortunately , it seems that nothing has changed :
A coroner has found that an Aboriginal man was " cooked to death " after he spent four hours in the back of a security van in searing heat with no air conditioning as it drove across the goldfields of south - west Australia .
The 46 - year - old Aboriginal elder suffered third degree burns after collapsing in the heat and falling to the floor of the van while it travelled 250 miles from Laverton to Kalgoorlie in 47C heat . [...]
The West Australian coroner , Alistair Hope , found that Ward was effectively " cooked " to death and heavily criticised the state prisons department , the private security firm that operated the van and the two guards who escorted Ward .
The security staff could apparently see and hear all of this happening , but did nothing .
It is hard to imagine them showing the same level of neglect to a white prisoner .
The case has now been referred to the Western Australia Department of Public Prosecutions .
Hopefully they 'll do a better job of it than Queensland did over the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee .
( Oh , and as a final note , the security company responsible , Global Solutions Ltd , formally known as Group 4 , are likely to be a contender for running National 's private prisons in New Zealand .
I wonder how the Maori Party will feel about that ...)
写真は、学研『大人の科学マガジン』Vol.24に付録される｢4ビットマイコン｣。
CPUは4MHz、プログラム領域が40バイト、データ領域が8バイトしかないコンピューターで、表示はLEDのみ！ シンプルすぎて素敵です。
でもこんなシンプルな構造でもちゃんとプログラムが組めるようになっているんですから、また驚きなんですよねー。実際にここ数日間プログラムを組んでみたのですが、まさにプログラミングの原点に触れている感じでした！
プログラムを組むというと、人間の理解できるニモニック（アルファベットの表記）を打ち込んでコンピューターに命令をするんですが、実はそれらはコンピューターが直接解釈できる｢機械語｣に変換されているんです。しかし、この｢4ビットマイコン｣は、直接CPUに機械語で命令をするしくみで、まさに原点のプログラミングが体験できるようになってるんです！
もちろん、一発でメモリから呼び出せるプログラムも、電子オルガン・モグラたたき・テニスゲーム・タイマーなどなど入っているので、組み立てて、プログラムしないで遊ぶこともも可能ですが、是非ちまちまと機械語でプログラミングしていただきたいですね。
Aレジスタの内容に数値7をいれて、Aレジスタの数値をLEDに点灯させるから...1001 0111で...16進数だから｢97｣だ...こんな風に汗してLEDのイルミネーションのプログラムが動いたときなんかめちゃくちゃ感動ですし、パソコンって原理はこうなのかーって思うと、大好きなガジェットを持つ目が変わりますよー。

These days , it 's a challenge to remember all the tasks you need to accomplish across every imaginable platform and technology , not to mention the daily errands and responsibilities you also need to care for .
From updating your passwords to checking your online bank accounts to getting your car checked to meeting new people , there does n't seem like there 's enough room in your brain to handle it all .
But your memory is a valuable , powerful tool that relies on you to nurture through diet , exercise , and lifestyle habits that improve brain cognition and alertness .
Consider these 50 ways to make your memory more like an elephant 's , and you 'll be surprised at how much more you can pack into your day .
Diet
Simply stated , there are certain foods and ingredients that heighten brain function and keep you sharper than a diet consisting only of junk food and fatty foods .
Spinach and leafy greens :
Dark leafy greens like spinach contain a lot of B6 , B12 and folic acid , which help facilitate the flow of oxygen and protect brain neurons .
Blueberries : Blueberries are an outstanding source of antioxidants which protect cells .
Milk : Milk contains B vitamins , calcium , potassium and magnesium , which are essential for brain health .
Pink salmon : Eat pink salmon to get omega - 3 fatty acids .
Black beans :
Black beans are also rich in folic acid and B vitamins , which are essential to brain health .
Orange juice :
Fresh orange juice is another good source of calcium , Vitamin C , folate and B6 .
Onions : Onions are a good source of fisetin , which is credited as helping improve long - term memory .
Walnuts : Walnuts are an especially healthy source of omega - 3 fatty acids .
Strawberries : Strawberries are good sources of antioxidants and B vitamins .
Green tea :
Green tea has antioxidants and caffeine to protect and stimulate your brain .
Lifestyle Habits
Sleep , social interaction , exercise and stress all play important roles in your brain 's ability to retain information .
Learn which lifestyle habits you need to nurture and which to give up .
Sleep well :
Your sleeping habits are one of the most crucial indicators of how good your memory is .
When you enter into a deep sleep , your brain is able to make connections between thoughts and situations that you may not have been able to make sense of before , enhancing your ability to solve problems and remember things .
Stay social : Actively engaging in social activities and staying in touch with friends extends brain life and helps you stay young .
Exercise : Aerobic activity increases oxygen flow and helps you feel more alert .
Do n't smoke : Smoking negatively affects memory , so ditch your cigarettes once and for all .
Manage stress :
Stress hinders memory by causing your brain to produce too much cortisol , which impedes your brain 's ability to create and access memories .
Live life with all of your senses engaged :
The more you experience a situation or thought , the more likely you 'll be to remember all angles of it .
Be more organized : Organization makes it easier for you to learn new things , remember appointments and tasks , and navigate through your chaotic life with more order and less stress .
Stay grounded : Staying grounded and engaged with the environment around you will keep your brain more alert and tuned in generally .
Meditate :
Take time to meditate , which improves your focus and helps your brain recall memories .
Learn how to deal with a crisis : Panic also makes your brain create too much cortisol , which makes it difficult to remember even simple tasks or protocol .
Clever Hacks
These little tricks will help you improve your memory over time .
Test yourself : Review things you 've just learned or experienced , even if there 's no formal test .
Reflect : Reflect on a new idea or situation to give your brain time to develop a strong memory .
Make everything relatable : Relate a new experience to something you 've already done to help your brain make lasting connections .
Do n't get too drunk : Drinking too much slows brain function and makes you less able to focus .
Use mnemonic devices :
Use mnemonic devices like rhyming or acronyms to help you remember .
Monitor your mental health : Just like stress , depression triggers the release of extra cortisol which can make it harder for the brain to hold onto memories .
Pick out the basic information first :
If you 're afraid you 'll forget something because it 's too complicated to grasp , only focus on the basic principles first .
Your brain will be able to more easily build upon that foundation later .
Visualize important information :
The visualization trick is a popular way to make information sink in .
Break down groups : Remember phone numbers , credit card numbers , lists and groups of names by breaking each element down and relating it to something else that makes sense to you .
Repeat names :
When you meet someone new , repeat their name a couple of times in the conversation .
Really listen :
If you make a point to pay attention the first time you learn something new , your brain will be able to form a more developed memory .
Leave physical reminders for yourself :
If you can't leave out a printed sign to help you remember something , leave little clues to help you remember , like putting your dog's food bowl in a different spot if you need to remember to pack it in the morning .
Write things down :
Writing things down reinforces what 's going on internally in your mind and provides you with a written record for later .
Stay positive : Positivity actually helps your mind stay clear , focused and alert .
Leave yourself messages :
Send yourself texts , voicemail , sticky notes and e-mails about something you need to remember .
Talk about it :
The more you talk about something , the more your brain will start to analyze it from different angles and create an in - depth memory .
Bring up whatever you 're trying to remember in conversation , or just recite it out loud to yourself .
Involve others :
Let others know that you 're trying to remember something specific , and it 'll be more likely to come up in conversation .
You may also feel more responsible for yourself if someone else is holding you accountable .
Tools
Use these tools to amp up organization in ways that work with your mind 's memory systems , not against it .
Evernote : Evernote lets you capture information in all kinds of formats , including audio , photos and text , making it easier for you to remember things and store notes .
Yoono :
Yoono syncs your social networks so that you do n't forget to keep up with your contacts across different portals .
Remember the Milk : Constantly mange your tasks and sync them with Google calendar so that you 're surrounded by your to - dos , reminders and lists .
The more you run into your tasks , the more likely you 'll remember them .
FreeMind :
This open source mind mapping software will help you map out your problems and projects so that your brain can make better sense of them .
Google Calendar : Keep your appointments , special dates and other important information organized on Google 's calendar , which syncs with many other platforms and can send you reminders .

Americans are increasingly putting more and more money on the sidelines .
For the month of May Americans put away 6.9 percent of their income into savings .
Not the stock market or real estate but bona fide savings .
This is a stark contrast from the zero rates achieved back in April of 2008 .
When we discussed the new austerity for Americans , much of this is being driven by the loss of jobs and the fact that nearly 26,000,000 Americans are unemployed or underemployed .
Now why are Americans suddenly finding the need to save some money ?
First , the decade long housing bubble has shattered the notion that phantom equity is the same as actual wealth .
The next major issue is the stock market is no longer seen as a safe investment .
Even if someone had his or her funds in the S&P 500 the index is still down approximately 40 percent and that is after the major rally since the March low .
Something is definitely going on here :
We have never seen such a rapid change in the savings rate .
Of course , going from zero anything would be an improvement .
The current seasonally adjusted annual rate has not been seen since 1993 but as the chart above shows , the percent of change is unmatched with 50 years of data .
What is occurring here ?
I ’ve seen a few articles talking about the new found frugality that Americans are now embracing .
This is something I hesitate to agree with because it presupposes that Americans are electing to save as a choice rather than being forced by external circumstances .
I do believe many Americans are becoming more frugal by choice but the vast majority are simply responding to the horrific economy that has evaporated $ 13.8 trillion in American household wealth .
But who are the big winners here ?
Banks .
The Fed shows that deposits at many banks now stands at $ 7.5 trillion showing the largest increase for the year .
These banks are getting insanely cheap deposits from the government and now you to help mend their broken balance sheets .
Call it double dipping .
Look at how much money is being put into savings :
We have never seen so much money move to the sidelines .
We are now approaching an $ 800 billion SAAR which means , nearly $ 1 trillion in money is being put on the sidelines .
This is good right ?
Unfortunately the way our economy is set up this means more and more money is n’t out there chasing consumer goods .
With massive market volatility this is actually viewed as bad .
That is the irony here .
Savings should be a good thing yet 70 percent of our economy depends on consumption .
Taking out $ 800 billion from commission will do damage since banks are not lending this money :
So all that is happening is banks are building up their reserves for the second round of hits that will occur with commercial real estate , credit cards , and higher unemployment coming down the pipeline .
It is fascinating to note that during the last month more insiders were selling stock than buying .
These are the folks smiling on TV one minute telling you everything is okay while quietly dumping their holdings now that the market is artificially propped up .
Let us go on a quick test shall we ?
Many banks are being bailed out with golden parachutes with diamond pull strings so let us see what kind of savings rates they are offering Americans :
Do n’t adjust your glasses or monitor .
You are reading the above right .
Bank of America is offering a stunning 0.10 percent for your regular savings account .
You might as well stuff the money in a mattress !
Let us see what Wells Fargo is offering :
If you thought Bank of America was low Wells Fargo is offering a 0.05 % rate !
You know how much money you would get if you left $ 10,000 with them for one year ?
Five stinking dollars !
Just for the sake of it , let us look at Chase since they now own WaMu as well :
Say what ?
At these rates people are saving out of fear and not a new sense of frugality .
People figure that it is better to get the service of an ATM card than putting their money into the Wall Street casino or the housing bubble .
Oh , but it gets better .
The U.S. government through the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve do not want Americans to save any money .
In fact , they are offering even lower rates :
That is correct .
A 0 percent savings rate .
And this is all designed by purpose .
The Federal Reserve is intentionally keeping the Fed funds rate low so banks can fix their balance sheets and the U.S. can inflate itself out of debt .
Yet this is bad news for prudent savers .
The attempt is to make every option so unattractive that people have to pump their money back in the stock market that is now operating like a game of blackjack in Vegas .
Yet even though we hear about historical low rates , banks are making a ton on the margin of money they are borrowing from the government ( aka taxpayers ) .
That is , they are taking in money paying 0.05 percent or whatever it is , and getting 5 or 6 percent on mortgages and taking in 15 to 20 percent on credit cards .
Give me access to those kind of terms and I ’d make money too .
The bottom line is the government and Wall Street do not want Americans to save .
This is reflected in these absurdly low rates .
It is easy to encourage savings .
Increase the yield on savings accounts through hiking the Fed Funds rate .
Yet the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve know that their Wall Street friends and our government debt is so large , that we are going to have to deflate our currency and destroy the dollar .
Enough with the “ strong dollar ” policy talk since all actions point to a weak dollar policy .

The Montreal Canadiens are returning to familiar hands .
George Gillett has reached an agreement in principle to sell the storied hockey franchise and the Bell Centre to the Molson family , the National Hockey League team announced Saturday .
The NHL board of governors is to meet Wednesday in Montreal but is not likely to be ready to approve the sale on such short notice .
A news conference will be held when the deal is finalized following approval by the league 's board of governors .
The vote is expected in late August .
In a statement released by the Canadiens , Gillett said he was pleased to return the ownership of the Canadiens to the Molson family , which has been associated with the team for more than three generations .

Molsons make comeback
The Molson family , specifically brothers Geoff , Andrew and Justin , is back in the game of majority ownership of an NHL team .
George Gillett has reached an agreement in principle to sell the storied hockey franchise and the Bell Centre to the Molsons , pending approval by the league 's board of governors .
Geoff Molson , above right , is a director of the Molson Coors Brewing Company , which owns 19.9 per cent of the Canadiens and is the brewery 's representative on the team 's board of directors .
A former player at St. Lawrence University in Canton , N.Y. , he learned the brewery business from the ground up after working for Coca - Cola and a New York - based consulting firm .
Andrew , above left , is the vice - chairman of Molson Coors .
The Molson family 's first foray in the NHL came in 1957 with the purchase of the Canadiens by Senator Hartland Molson and his brother , Thomas , from Senator Donat Raymond .
Seven years later , they sold the club to cousins David , Peter and Bill Molson , who were in charge until 1971 .
Molson Breweries purchased the Canadiens in 1978 for $ 20 million from a company controlled by Peter and Edward Bronfman .
It owned 100 per cent until Gillett bought a controlling interest in 2001 .
Included in the latest tentative sale is 80.1 per cent of the Canadiens and 100 per cent of the Bell Centre and Gillett Entertainment Group .
" Our family has been very proud to be associated with the Montreal Canadiens over the past eight years and particularly to be a part of their centennial season , " Gillett said .
" I am fully confident that the Molson brothers … will ensure the preservation and development of this great sports institution . "
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman tentatively confirmed the deal when asked about it while in Las Vegas .
Bettman likes deal
" That 's what I heard , subject to board approval , " Bettman said , adding he thinks the deal is a positive step forward for the franchise .
" I think to the extent that they 've been able to find people who are obviously passionate about the game and structure a transaction that makes sense for everybody , that 's a real plus for the franchise and the fans in Montreal . "
Geoff Molson said he , along with his brothers Andrew and Justin , would endeavour to maintain the tradition of the Canadiens while working with general manager Bob Gainey to ice the strongest team possible .
" This is a very exciting time for our family and we are grateful to the many people and organizations who came forward to offer their collaboration in the development of our proposal , " said Molson .
Citing an unidentified source , La Presse in Montreal reported the sale price is well over $ 500 million , which would include Gillett 's 80.1 - per cent interest in the team and 100 per cent stake in the Bell Centre and event promotion company Gillett Entertainment Group .
Gillett paid $ 275 million for that package on Jan. 31 , 2001 and has built it into one of the NHL 's most profitable clubs .
He is also co-owner of soccer giant Liverpool FC with Dallas Stars owner Tom Hicks .
Former Habs player and general manager Serge Savard will reportedly have an important role with the team , the newspaper stated , possibly as an investor .
The Molson family owned the team from 1957 - 71 and Molson Breweries re-acquired the club for $ 20 million in 1978 .
The brewery then sold the team and its arena to Gillett in 2001 .
Now known as Molson - Coors , the company stayed on as a minority owner of the club , with a 19.9 per cent share , while Gillett owned 80.1 per cent before the sale reported Saturday .
Brothers Molson took offer in early June
The Molson brothers announced they had fielded an offer for the team and arena on June 11 .
Geoff Molson is on the team 's board of directors , but he withdrew from its activities during the sale process .
The Molson family was among several groups vying to buy the Canadiens , including Quebecor Media , the Solidarity Fund of the Quebec Federation of Labour .
Another who reportedly expressed interest was Seagram heir Stephen Bronfman , as well as at least one bid from the United States .
" I know we had two or three very prominent and impressive groups that were bidding for the team , " Paul Kelly , head of the NHL Players ' Association , said in Las Vegas .
" I know that the purchase price got up there in numbers that are well above all of our pay grades .
That 's a great franchise and a great city . "
Kelly added , " Mr. Gillett was really a fine owner .
" We will miss him in the National Hockey League .
I thought he brought a lot of creativity and ingenuity and colour to the sport . "
Word the Canadiens were for sale surfaced last November from Research in Motion head Jim Balsillie , but that was vehemently denied at the time by Gillett .
In March , the team confirmed BMO Capital Markets had been asked to evaluate Gillett 's assets , including the Canadiens , and look at ways to refinance or sell them .
It sounds different because it is different .
" When you speak , the vocal folds in your throat vibrate , which causes your skin , skull and oral cavities to also vibrate , and we perceive this as sound , " explains Ben Hornsby , a professor of audiology at Vanderbilt University .
The vibrations mix with the sound waves traveling from your mouth to your eardrum , giving your voice a quality — generally a deeper , more dignified sound — that no one else hears .

A SPECIES of starfish has confounded climate change doom - mongers by thriving as sea temperatures and acidity increase – a scenario that is likely as the world gets warmer .
Most studies have concluded that sea animals with calcified shells or skeletons , such as starfish , will suffer as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels dissolves in the sea , making the water more acidic and destroying the calcium carbonate on which the creatures depend .
But the sea star Pisaster ochraceus may ride out the climate storm .

Real Madrid have warned Arjen Robben that they are prepared to leave him out of their squad next season if he refuses to leave the club this summer .
The Dutchman is not keen to leave the Santiago Bernabéu and his father responded to reports of a move to Tottenham Hotspur by insisting there was " no way " his son would sign for the White Hart Lane club .
But Robben has been left in little doubt as to his position at Madrid .
The club 's director general , Jorge Valdano , has admitted : " It would be better if Robben listened to the offers coming in for him . "
And it has now emerged that he has threatened the Dutchman with the possibility of being banished to the stands in a World Cup year if he insists on staying .
Robben risks being left without a squad number and not being registered for La Liga or the Champions League .
Madrid consider Robben too injury prone to stay at the Bernabéu and have earmarked Bayern Munich 's Franck Ribéry to occupy his position on the left of the attack .
The club 's adviser , Zinedine Zidane , has said that Madrid " will do all we can to sign Ribery " .
Although sources at the club play down its significance , Robben is not helped by his status as Ramon Calderon 's marquee signing – the one promise the former president kept .
However , the central reason for wanting to sell Robben is financial , as Madrid seek to recoup some of the money spent on Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka and to raise cash to make more signings this summer .
Madrid already have 30 players in their squad and plan to sign as many as five more , with the president , Florentino Pérez , tonight claiming the transfer of David Villa was " just a matter of time " .
Spanish league rules allow for only 25 first - team squad members .
That has left Madrid looking to offload as many as nine current players and Robben is top of the list .
He is the one expendable player for whom Madrid believe they can command a major fee .
He joined the club for £ 24 m from Chelsea two years ago and Madrid remain hopeful that , after an impressive second half to the last campaign , he could bring in as much as £ 30 m .
Madrid will have been encouraged in their pursuit of the Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso after he failed to dismiss suggestions that he was looking to leave Anfield .
Asked by the Cadena Ser radio station if he would be disappointed having to stay at Liverpool next season , he responded : " I ca n't answer that question . "
To which the interviewer replied : " And with that you have said it all . "
Meanwhile Barcelona have met representatives of Alonso 's current midfield partner , Javier Mascherano .
A two - hour meeting was held between Mascherano 's agent , Walter Tamer , and Barcelona in the Rey Juan Carlos I hotel in the Catalan capital .
Barcelona , however , believe the ball is in Liverpool 's court and Rafael Benítez says the Argentinian is not for sale .
Reports Suggest Obama Faces Early Choice On Iran Covert Ops
January 13 , 2009
By Ron Synovitz
The arrests of four Iranians for alleged involvement in a U.S. - financed plot to topple Tehran 's Islamic government come amid fresh U.S. media reports that President George W. Bush has authorized a major program for covert operations in Iran .
According to those reports , the Bush administration has been sponsoring a campaign of " subtle sabotage " to undermine Tehran 's controversial nuclear program -- which Washington alleges is aimed at building nuclear weapons .
James Denselow , a security expert at King 's College in London , says such operations constitute a secret proxy war between the United States and Iran .
" The Americans have been playing Iran at its own game , " Denselow tells RFE / RL .
" Iran has been sponsoring anti-U.S. groups in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
As late ago as 2005 , the U.S. has been sponsoring anti-Iranian groups in Iran -- particularly in the southern provinces on the eastern side where a population that is not homogeneous or acquiescent to the rule in Tehran is able to be co-opted with money and with weapons . "
" This is very much a secret war , " Denselow said .
" But it puts pressure on Iran just as Iran has been putting pressure on the United States in Iraq . "
Indeed , authorities in Tehran have alleged for years that Washington has been financing sabotage operations in Iran .
David Sanger , the chief Washington correspondent for " The New York Times , " says he learned details about such operations while conducting interviews with senior U.S. officials for his new book , " The Inheritance , " which was released this month .
Sanger 's book focuses on the challenges that Barack Obama will inherit from the Bush administration when he is inaugurated on January 20 .
Iran is seen as one of Obama 's key challenges .
Speaking on the U.S. television program " Meet The Press , " Sanger said Obama ultimately will have to decide whether to allow such covert U.S. operations to continue .
" We are beyond the point of saying that Barack Obama inherits a lot of messes around the world , " Sanger said .
" He also inherits a lot of activities that President Bush began .
And he is going to have to make some very difficult decisions about whether to continue them . "
" There are covert actions that have begun that Obama is going to have to look at even before he fully understands them , " Sanger said .
" One of Obama 's aides said to me , ' You know , in many ways , we have a " Bay Of Pigs " problem , ' which is the action [ in Cuba ] that President Kennedy inherited from Dwight Eisenhower .
And [ Eisenhower ] did n't fully understand it . "
Behind The Scenes
Sanger says Bush stopped Israel from carrying out air strikes on Iran 's nuclear infrastructure last year by telling Israeli officials that ongoing U.S. covert operations in Iran would be more effective .
He says U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates convinced Bush that an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities would probably be ineffective -- leading to the expulsion of international nuclear inspectors and causing Iran to be even more secretive about its uranium - enrichment program .
Sanger has reported that Bush denied an Israeli request to fly its warplanes through Iraqi airspace in order to attack the nuclear complex at Natanz -- Iran 's only known uranium - enrichment plant .
He says Bush also refused a request by Israel last year for powerful bunker - piercing bombs needed to attack the underground nuclear complex .
Israel 's attempts to obtain bombs and permission to fly over Iraq appears to have grown out of its concerns about a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 that suggested Iran had effectively suspended development of a nuclear warhead in 2004 .
Mike McConnell , director of U.S. National
Intelligence , says he regrets that the publicly released portions of the National Intelligence Estimate emphasized only the changes in Iran 's nuclear work rather than a broader overview .
Speaking recently on the interview program " Charlie Rose , " McConnell said the National Intelligence Estimate was misinterpreted as saying that Iran was not trying to develop nuclear weapons .
In fact , McConnell says , the report refutes Iran 's claims that it has never tried to build nuclear weapons .
McConnell noted that Iran continues to develop missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead into Israeli territory , and that it continues to enrich uranium needed to build nuclear weapons .
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh quotes numerous sources as saying that the U.S. Congress agreed to a Bush request in late 2007 to fund an escalation of covert operation in Iran .
Hersh says those operations began as early as 2005 .
" The president signed a series of executive orders and findings [ in late 2004 ] permitting the Pentagon to run clandestine , covert operations -- operations which Americans go into countries under cover .
American commandos , run by the Pentagon .
The CIA no longer is the sole agency doing these kinds of missions .
And I 'll tell you why that is very important , " Hersh says .
" Under the law as it now stands , the CIA when it runs a covert operation , the president has to approve .
He has to sign a finding -- a formal paper saying , ' I know about it .
And here , Congress , is what 's going on . ' "
But unlike covert CIA operations , Hersh says , the Bush administration 's interpretation of the law is that Congress does not need to be informed about clandestine military operations controlled from the Pentagon .
That means U.S. lawmakers have only been partially informed about how the money they appropriate is being used in joint operations by the Pentagon and CIA .
Talk Of Talks
In a shift from Bush 's policy approach , Obama has pledged to increase diplomatic efforts on Iran and talk directly to its leaders .
While it is not yet clear whether Obama will allow U.S. covert operations to continue in Iran , he has spoken about the need to provide resources and guidance for those who carry out U.S. intelligence missions :
" Here in Washington , we have also learned some tough lessons .
We have learned that to make pragmatic policy choices , we must insist on assessments grounded solely in the facts , and not seek information to suit any ideological agenda , " Obama says .
" To support those who carry out our intelligence mission , we must give them the resources they need and the clear guidance they deserve .
And we know that to be truly secure , we must adhere to our values as vigilantly as we protect our safety - with no exceptions . "
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi says Iran ultimately will undertake what he called " appropriate , timely , and proportionate measures " to any new approaches by the United States after Obama is inaugurated :
" Many times , we 've said that we will see in what form this change will take place , " Qashqavi says .
" Is it a fundamental change in the behavior and stance of the United States in relation to the Islamic Republic of Iran , or not ? "
Denselow , the security expert at King 's College in London , concludes that Obama is unlikely to put an immediate end to ongoing covert operations in Iran :
" The Iran policy that Obama picks up will have to be one of carrots and sticks and normal diplomacy , " Denselow says .
" He will have to chose whether to use [ those covert operations ] as a means of putting pressure on Iran or to stop it as a mans of alleviating that pressure to try to foster greater relations .
There is a lot of questions to be answered relating to Iran 's nuclear program and its relationship with Israel .
And I think Obama will be careful about not giving away all his cards onto the table .
The proxy war in southern Iran is , after all , simply another pressure point that the Americans can use to play hardball with Iran .
It certainly is a lot more subtle than full - on airstrikes or an Israeli attack .

On the right - hand side of Twitter 's homepage , there 's this little box that shows the top ten " trending " topics , or tags — those words with the pound sign , old man .
Usually , this little box reflects the kind of garbage most people assume has piled up on Twitter — last night 's episode of Jon and Kate , say , or " jokes " from Jimmy Fallon .
Not this Sunday .
This Sunday , there they were : #iranelection and #cnnFAIL .
I 'd like to think I clicked on #iranelection because I 'm a savvy news consumer who works in online activism .
But in reality , I clicked on it because I realized that for a foreign election to be trendy — well , shit must have hit the fan .
It was at once gross and engrossing : I saw Iranians live - tweeting the locations of tanks and militia , photos of Moussavi supporters taking to the streets , videos of government militia beating citizens .
I saw dorm rooms invaded , faces bashed in .
I saw non-Iranians live - tweeting the locations of proxy servers in a kind of smuggling operation dealing in unfiltered bandwidth that would have made Pablo Escobar proud .
I also saw the tags # cnnFAIL and #iranelection appear together fairly often .
A few clicks and Googles later , and it became obvious to anyone who cared to care that CNN had utterly dropped the ball on covering the election results .
( I mean , seriously , when did it become legitimate journalism to report retweet the story shilled by a lunatic like Ahmadinejad as if it were just another press release ? )
Now , admittedly , I did n't comb the entire Internet last Sunday afternoon to verify this yellowcake - caliber dropping of the ball , but I did notice that other legitimate news sources —
The Wall Street Journal , for one — had essentially begun shelling the Iranian government 's propaganda .
This despite , you know , smart people calling out the agitprop for what it was ; the Iran guru from The Council of Foreign Relations had declared that " The fact that this was a stolen election is not in doubt at all . "
I 'm pretty sure someone important once said something about evil winning when good people do nothing .
It seemed , at least to this ( somewhat liberal , somewhat skeptical , but not emotionally so ) activist , that the evil in Iran had begun to win because the watchdogs were acting like lapdogs .
So I decided it was time to cut off the flow of false information and force them to , you know , report .
If Ahmadinejad 's propaganda machine stopped functioning , maybe the truth would start to .
Twitter can stop and start at the same time .
The link that I repackaged and distributed on Twitter this week was to a tool called PageReboot.com .
It does exactly what you 'd expect it to do : refresh whatever Web site you want at whatever frequency you set .
Sure , the site 's intentions center more on winning eBay auctions than , say , affecting the outcome of a democratic election , but democracy 's a loose term in Iran .
All people had to do , then , was click my link and leave it open , and the lie - spewing servers of The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ( IRIB ) would be slammed 3,600 times an hour .
So anyway , my tweet did n't take long to catch on .
( I work in political new media , so the people I interact with online really know how to make some noise . )
And it did n't take very long for the IRIB site to start slowing down .
So I tweeted about it , and e-mailed a few friends in the new - media world , who retweeted it out of courtesy and ( somewhat mischievous ) human decency .
By sundown , our army of not - quite - hackers had swelled to forty or so , and just like that , the official news site of Iran was gone for a few hours .
A few repackaged tweets later , and the Ayatollah 's Web site was gone .
So was was Ahmadinejad's .
Let me be clear :
This most definitely would have happened without me .
All told , I probably only broadcasted directly to about two hundred people .
But because Twitter is the most powerful communications tool since the telegraph , my little text messages evolved into seventy - five separate micro-broadcasts that were then — theoretically , at least — exposed to a collective 26,000 followers .
Think about it :
If only the seventy - five people who cared enough to retweet clicked my IRIB - crashing link , then we 're talking about a quarter million hits per hour , or six million page views per day .
That 's about 50 percent more traffic than HuffPo gets .
If we assume that just 1 percent of the 26,000 followers clicked the link , then we 're talking about Twitter sending more traffic to Iran 's ( really crappy ) servers than NYTimes.com has to handle every day .
So can we stop looking at Twitter as the mouthpiece for Ashton Kutcher 's quotidian bullshit , people ?
Can we start taking quotidian " bullshit " for what it 's worth these days — the rapid - response hive of the truth ?
Now CNN and the like have since begun to report the kinds of things my friends and I saw on Sunday .
I 'm pretty sure this had nothing to do with our little adventure in information warfare , and everything to do with the fact that Ahmadinejad is fucking stupid .
By banning transmissions from foreign journalists and blocking most of the Internet , he enabled Twitter and its multi-platform , multi-device telegraphic power to become an information bottleneck for the very people about whom he was spewing lies .
No wonder it took only four days — four long ( or , for those of us on the new side of the truth , pretty damned short ) days — for the global press to go from legitimizing Ahmadinejad 's " victory " to eviscerating him .

It is faster out of the blocks than a V12 Ferrari and can do 0 - 60 mph in four seconds .
It will go faster than 140 mph and can be fully charged over lunch .
But the most remarkable thing about the first British electric supercar is that it is not being built by one of the world 's great car companies with a limitless research budget , but has been knocked up in a few months by some middle - aged engineers in a Norfolk garage from off - the - shelf parts mostly available on the web .
But these are no ordinary men .
The small team commissioned by Ecotricity wind power company chief Dale Vince last August to " blow the socks off Jeremy Clarkson and smash the stereotype of electric cars " are an A - team of British motorsport engineers .
All have worked at different times for Lotus , and between them have developed nearly every car that a generation of petrolheads have swooned over — like the McLaren F1 , the Lotus Elan , the Corvette 2R1 , the Jaguar XJR15 and the De Lorean .
The project leader was director of engineering , another was chief electrical engineer .
All six problem - solve for the world 's top motor sports teams .
But the brief they were given was unusual .
" It was to prove to middle England that electric cars can be quick to develop , beautiful to look at , cheap to run , and run entirely on wind power , " says Vince .
The fact that none of them had ever worked on electric cars was immaterial .
With ultimate British pragmatism , the team went on toeBay , and found a second - hand Lotus Exige with about 20,000 miles on the clock .
They drove it back from Harrogate and started pulling it apart .
Seven months later , the car which still has no name , is raised on blocks in a Norfolk garage .
Chickens run around the yard outside and the A team can barely suppress its excitement .
Their car is just a few weeks away from full testing , but with its bonnet and hood off , it looks more like a wreck .
To convert the Lotus , the engineers lengthened the chassis by 90 mm , there are 96 lithium - ion polymer batteries , two brushless motors , a completely new transmission , and a lot of electronic wizardry hidden in boxes marked " test " .
The car 's centre of gravity has been lowered and shifted forward , and because the engines have only one moving part and do not need cooling , the engineers have dispensed with the Lotus air ducts and bumps .
The consensus is that no large auto company could have developed anything like this so fast or for the modest £ 200,000 it has cost .
" If this were Ford it would have taken years and millions of pounds to develop .
Big car companies are very conventional .
We can keep it small and can make decisions quickly .
They get bogged down in management systems and find it hard to be innovative , " says Ian Doble , the project leader .
He also points out that they have created their new car without having to invent any new technology .
" The batteries came from Korea , the brushless engines from America .
Everything is now available off the shelf . "
Vince adds that the engine 's virtual lack of moving parts means the car would require little maintenance : " It 's a car for life .
It will last longer than an ordinary car , the engine will not run out . "
The Guardian is not allowed to even sit in it , but with a couple of clicks from a remote controller the twin engines start and the wheels whirr like those of a dodgem .
" We thought about adding external speakers to go ' grrrrrrr ' or make the sound of birds swooping , " said Vince .
Vince is a mix of green visionary and a boy with the ultimate toy .
The former hippy , now nearly 50 , drove one of the buses on the infamous peace convoy in 1985 which was ambushed by the police at the Battle of the Beanfield , but he survived the mass beating to build Britain 's largest independent wind power company and has sat on the government 's Renewables Advisory Board .
He admits to being a petrolhead in love with speed and new technology but desperately worried about the state of the planet .
His vision is for all 30 m vehicles in Britain to be run on wind power via an extra 3,000 - 10,000 turbines feeding electricity into the grid at off peak times .
It would save 25 m tonnes of oil , and 12 % of all UK carbon emissions , " he said .
The only direct competitor for the car is the Tesla , an equally fast all - electric sports car backed by Hollywood A - listers such as George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger , as well as the founders of Google .
But last month the company which has poured more than $ 100 m into a short production run admitted it was losing money and said it would be scaling back expansion .
" Theirs is a production car and this is a prototype .
But from a technical point of view this is way ahead of Tesla , and formula one technology , " said Vince .
" This is about turning heads .
We are trying to reach out to Daily Mail readers .
This is making the dream sustainable .
We will show Clarkson . "
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
Someone recently asked me what I dislike about gnomes in D&D that I feel Paizo has at least partially fixed in Pathfinder RPG .
I figured I ’d take a shot at explaining it , and this SOB entry is the result .
The three major problems I ’ve had with gnomes in earlier editions that come immediately to mind at the moment , and how PRPG fixed those problems ( at least in part ) , are :
Gnomes are really short in D&D .
They ’re actually ridiculously short .
Hell , even dwarves seem ridiculous in their shortness , and gnomes make them seem tall by comparison .
To make a race that small seem less ridiculous as an equal of PCs would , I fear , require making it entirely non-human — maybe like a squirrel .
PRPG , meanwhile , mitigated this problem by making them a bit taller .
There are n’t exact measurements provided in the PRPG Beta to give me canonical heights , but based on the picture at the beginning of core races section where a member of each race is standing alongside the rest of them , the height of a gnome relative to a human seems to have increased .
Yes , I did the math , based on a reasonable average for a human and the ratio of illustration heights .
Gnomes look ridiculous in D&D .
Have you ever noticed that , before 3E , gnomes always look like half - size dwarves of the most preposterous sort ?
They have bulbous red noses , rosy red cheeks , puffy white beards , and so on .
Hell , they ’re a bit like knee - high Santa Clauses in appearance the way they ’re generally depicted , described , and imagined in D&D editions prior to third .
In 3E , meanwhile , they suddenly look like the bastard love children of halflings and “ greys ” ( those spindly aliens with the gigantic noggins and funny looking eyes ) to judge by the illustrations in the books and some of their descriptions .
No way am I playing one of those , or letting one of them slip into a game I ’m running where they simply wo n’t be taken seriously by at least some of the players .
PRPG describes gnomes as being of mixed fae blood , and their appearance as described in various Paizo / Pathfinder books ( vaguely ) and illustrated really reflects that origin of the race .
They now look more pretty and , well , fey , and as a result they appear far less absurd and comical .
It helps that they look a fair bit more nimble , too , considering that an old - school illustration of an AD&D gnome often looked like it could trip over its own belly or nose at any moment .
The racial origin also gives the race a fair bit more reasonable explanation for why they ’d be so good at illusion magic , if you want to go that route , too .
Gnomes are annoying by nature in D&D .
Why is it that gnomes always seem to talk fast , act like absent - minded professors , and behave in a manner designed specifically to bug the living crap out of anyone and everyone ?
This is the last nail in the coffin , the final piece of evidence that even the people who developed the canonical D&D gnome think of them substantially as comic relief .
The only D&D gnome I ’ve ever liked was the “ I ’m a monster ! ” guy from the animated marketing video for 4E from WotC , and that ’s only because the whole point of that video is to be funny .
The whole “ gnomes have to be incoherent babbling stereotypes of accident prone nerds ” thing has entirely gone out the window , with the flavor of things presented in PRPG .
This makes me much happier with the prospect of a “ gnome ” race in my fantasy RPG campaigns .
Far from being relegated primarily to the realm of comic relief , the descriptions of gnomes in the PRPG Beta give them a role in the implied setting that can much more easily be taken seriously .
In fact , given the description and images , I could easily see them becoming tragic or dark figures that lend to more depth in a setting , such as in the case of a gnome prostitute who caters to the desires of depraved pedophiles .
For almost as long as there has been Star Trek , there have been Trek comics .
Offering stories too expensive , epic and , often , stupid for the series , here 're some of the comic 's high - ( and low - ) lights .

While Star Trek 's original comic run , which lasted from 1967 through 1978 from publisher Gold Key , may have often seemed like the work of people who has never seen the show ( In part because its artist had really never seen the show ; he was working off publicity shots and his imagination the whole time ) , it had a certain charm ; look at the image at the top of this post , for example , and tell me that you do n't wish that you 'd seen it happen in the TV show , just to watch William Shatner acting like a man under voodoo attack .
Mostly , though , the charm was that the stories were goofy ; not for nothing is Chris Sims ' list of The 11 Most Ridiculous Moments
In Star Trek Comics mostly made up of Gold Key stories ( Especially that awesome shower scene ) .
But when Star Trek : The Motion Picture was released , the comics started appearing from Marvel and DC , and being worked on by fans ... and that 's when things started to get good .
Or , at least , goodesque .
Unconvinced ?

The Stories The Movies Should 've Done
Do n't get me wrong ; I loved the original Star Trek movies as much as the next man - Well , aside from Star Trek V , obviously ; I have some taste - but DC 's 1980s comics did manage to tell a couple of stories that really should 've been coming soon to a theater near you .
For example , the Mirror Universe Enterprise invading our reality :

Yes , that 's right ; Evil Kirk just slapped Regular Kirk 's face .
Just to show how evil he is .
There was also the pre-Star Trek VI " Trial of James T. Kirk , " in which our favorite Starfleet Captain has to deal with finding out that the price of intergalactic peace with the Klingons is going on trial for thirty years of recklessly disobeying orders , complete with cameos and shoutouts to numerous episodes of the original series .
Hey , it could 've been a warm - up for Boston Legal .
The Stories The Movies Could n't Have Done
The comics were also , often , home to stories too small for the movie screen ... which often translated as " stories about characters other than Kirk or Spock . "
For example , Doctor McCoy meeting up with the daughter who'd rejected him :

Or a Harold Pinter - inspired ( No , really ) look back at Scotty 's love life , complete with awkward , unconvincing accents :

We were also given the final tale of the Enterprise 's original five year mission , the return of Kirk 's dead son , spotlights for Uhura and Sulu ( Alas , Chekhov always kind of got the shitty end of the stick even in the comics ) and all manner of Klingons , Romulans and Vulcans .
The comics even managed to almost give Saavik a personality .
Almost .

Okay , admittedly , it was n't all gold .
Occasionally , there would still be the occasional clunker .
Like , for example , this :

Worst of all would be when creators would try and recapture the whimsy and sense of wonder of the original series and fail badly .
After all , Tribbles are one thing ( sadly ) , but there 's never any excuse for gnomes :

Let 's move on quickly , shall we ?
The Guest - Stars !
The Guest - Stars !
The Guest - Stars !
Of course , one of the benefits of making Trek without actors is that you can always get the guest - stars that you want , regardless of whether they 're available .
For example , here 's " Sweeney , " a bounty hunter who was pretty much just John Cleese with goggles :

The guest stars did n't even need to be alive ; here are some famous historical figures about to beat the crap out 've the Enterprise crew :

Not that every historical figure advocated violence , of course :

More than anyone else , though , Trek comics allowed guest stars that would be impossible without ridiculous and unconvincing amounts of technology .
I mean , here 's 1960 William Shatner meeting 1980s William Shatner :

Or what about the 1960s Enterprise being helmed by Jean - Luc Picard ?

That said , it does n't get any better than this :

If JJ happens to be reading this , all I 'm saying is : Imagine the box office if you managed to make a movie that crossed Trek over with the X - Men franchise .
Hell , never mind the money ; imagine the lens flares .
Last evening our night watchman Cajun Boy reported that Chicago radio talker Erich " Mancow " Muller may have faked his waterboarding for publicity .

" We went into this thinking it was going to be a joke , " Muller said very quickly when we called him .
" But it was not a joke — it was horrible .
' Hoax ' is probably not the right word , but we did think it was going to be a joke . "
According to e-mails from Muller 's publicist obtained by Cajun Boy , on the day before the heavily promoted stunt was supposed to happen , Muller was frantically looking for anybody to perform the waterboarding :
It is going to have to look " real " but of course would be simulated with Mancow acting like he is drowning .
It will be a hoax but have to look real .
Would be great if they could dress in fatigues and bring whatever is needed .
We will supply the water .
" It was a marine who did it , " Muller said .
" I do n't know his training .
Is he a professional interrogator ?
I do n't think so .
But he knew what to do .
If I wanted to fake it , it would have lasted for six minutes — I lasted six seconds .
I'm on the air , bud , I 'm on the air . "
Then he hung up .
So we called Klay South , the marine Mancow found at the last minute to perform the waterboarding .
He says he had no idea what he was doing !
To wit :
I know nothing about waterboarding .
I had never done it before , I have no formal training in it , and I 've never had it done to me .
The only thing I knew was what I saw on the internet .
I went to waterboarding .org and looked it up .
I just did what I was told — poured the water on his face and that was it .
I 'm probably the last person they should have had do it .
I did n't know what I was doing .
That settles it for us !
South is the founder of Veterans of Valor , a nonprofit that helps out wounded vets , and he said he agreed to the gig just to gain a donation and publicity for the organization , a noble enough reason .
According to South 's main resource , waterboarding.org , waterboarders should " restrain the interrogation subject on a board " and " incline the board about 15 - 20 degrees so that the feet are above the head . "
South says Muller 's feet were bound , but his arms were not .
And although his feet were elevated , he was laying on a flat surface .
We asked South if it seemed like Muller was faking it : " I do n't know .
I could n't tell you if he was in distress or not . "
UPDATE : Mancow called us back to say that even though his waterboarder did n't know what he was doing , and his publicist called the whole thing a " hoax , " it was n't supposed to be a REALLY real waterboarding to begin with .
Just the radio stunt kind !
" Of course I was n't a radical terrorist , " he said .
" Of course it was simulated .
To compare what I went through to what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed went through — of course it was not the same .
I 'm sure it was worse for them . "
Undoubtedly it was .
But is n't the whole point of these exercises to let people know exactly what we talk about when we talk about waterboarding ?
We 've learned that Mancow can't take six seconds of having water poured on his face — we guess he does n't take showers ? — but we 've learned absolutely nothing about the mechanics or ethics of what goes on at CIA black sites .
If anything , a bullshit stunt like this one gives ammunition to torture proponents , who can poke holes in Muller 's grand conversion by pointing out that it's a bullshit stunt .
Keith Olbermann and other righteous anti-torture advocates are holding up Muller 's experience as evidence — someone who was inclined to support waterboarding and deny that it 's torture has actually experienced it , which Sean Hannity and his ilk lack the courage to do , and the facts have changed his mind .
Only he has n't actually experienced it , or anything remotely approaching what actual torture victims experienced .
None of it is real .
On last night 's show , Olbermann brought up Muller during an interview with Jesse Ventura :
Mancow went into this knowing that — being a swimmer as a kid and in fact having been drowned and resuscitated — he knew what this was really like and he knew this could n't possibly be that .
He lasted six seconds and he said , not only is it torture , not only is it drowning — it 's death !
It 's being undersold .
Compare that to South , the waterboarder , who could n't even answer whether Muller was actually in any kind of distress .
We have know idea if Muller was deliberately faking the whole episode for publicity , or if he ginned up a fake waterboarding as a gag and then was surprised to find himself actually terrified by it .
But either way , Olbermann is a disingenuous ideologue who hurts his own cause — and ours — when he takes this fakery at face value and promotes it as evidence of his own rectitude on the torture debate .
Astonishingly , MSNBC is standing by its flackery for Muller 's hoax .
An MSNBC spokeswoman acknowledged that Olbermann 's producers had been made aware prior to airing the Muller interview that his publicist had described it as a hoax , saying , " We asked the publicist and were assured by her that she just used a poor choice of words . "
But when asked if MSNBC still believes that publicist , in light of the fact that Muller 's waterboarder had no idea what he was doing , she declined to comment .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
A year ago , the Pakistani public was deeply divided over what to do about its spreading insurgency .
Some saw the Taliban militants as fellow Muslims and native sons who simply wanted Islamic law , and many opposed direct military action against them .
But history moves quickly in Pakistan , and after months of televised Taliban cruelties , broken promises and suicide attacks , there is a spreading sense  apparent in the news media , among politicians and the public  that many Pakistanis are finally turning against the Taliban .
The shift is still tentative and difficult to quantify .
But it seems especially profound among the millions of Pakistanis directly threatened by the Taliban advance from the tribal areas into more settled parts of Pakistan , like the Swat Valley .
Their anger at the Taliban now outweighs even their frustration with the military campaign that has crushed their houses and killed their relatives .
“ It ’s the Taliban that ’s responsible for our misery , ” said Fakir Muhammed , a refugee from Swat , who , like many who had experienced Taliban rule firsthand , welcomed the military campaign to push the insurgents out .

Long boring explanation ( not required reading ) - apparently there had been some sort of promo / contest going on at Spreadshirt .
Because a couple of you rad folks bought tshirts in the past month I received a " yay you " coupon code .
I asked them if I was allowed to give out the code , which would simplify the whole process ( you just use the code to get what you want ) but apparently it only works through my account .
SO what we 're going to do is I 'm going to hold a contest , something really simple , and then I 'll use my coupon code to purchase the item of your choice and ship it to you .
I think that would work out okay .
So. Yeah .

Apple on Monday finally got around to patching a widely - publicized security flaw in the version of Java shipping with Mac OS X , which could leave a Mac open to attack while browsing the web .
The Mac maker came under criticism from a pair of security firms last month for failing to patch the exploit , which it has reportedly been aware of since January .
The vulnerability , which theoretically exists on all platforms supporting Java , could allow a remote user to run code , delete files , and execute applications on a Mac through a maliciously crafted Java applet .
When executed together with a privilege escalation vulnerability , hackers could remotely run any system - level process and get total access to a Mac .
This could leave users open to âdrive - by attacks , " according to security firm Intego , which had recommended that users disable Java until a fix was made available .
On Monday , Apple released Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 4 ( 158 MB download ) and Java for Mac OS X 10.4 , Release 9 ( 80.11MB ) , which address the problem on its Leopard and Tiger operating systems but updating Java versions 1.4 , 1.5 , and 1.6 to new versions .
Apple also noted that there were multiple vulnerabilities in its " Aqua Look and Feel for Java " implementation for Java 1.5 affecting only Mac OS X 10.5.7 and later .
The update for Leopard addresses this issue as well by denying access to internal details of Aqua Look and Feel for untrusted Java applets .
A planet six times as massive as Jupiter ( left ) has been found around the red dwarf star VB 10 ( right ) .
The star is the lightest known to host a planet ( Illustration : NASA / JPL - Caltech )
An extrasolar planet has been found by observing subtle changes in a star ’s position in the sky for the first time .
The technique , called astrometry , is best suited to finding planets at great distances from their stars , complementing more common techniques , which tend to turn up planets orbiting their stars at close range .
The planet ’s star is also the lightest known to host a planet , and researchers hope other such discoveries will shed light on how common planets are around low - mass stars , which far outnumber their higher - mass cousins .
Most of the 350 or so known exoplanets have been discovered by the so - called radial velocity technique .
Stars and planets actually orbit each other around their common centre of mass , and this method looks for telltale shifts in a star ’s light spectrum that indicate the star is wobbling due to an orbiting exoplanet .
Another popular technique looks for periodic dips in a star ’s brightness that occur when an orbiting planet passes in front of , or transits , its star .

Both of those techniques are most sensitive to planets that orbit their stars at close distances .
That ’s because massive , close - in planets cause the most dramatic changes in a star ’s velocity , measured in the radial velocity technique , and planets on tight orbits transit their stars more often than do planets orbiting farther away , making detections easier to confirm .
Now , astronomers led by Steven Pravdo of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have discovered the first planet found using the astrometry technique , which was first used to hunt for extrasolar planets 50 years ago .
The method searches for tiny changes in the position of a star in the sky as it moves due to an orbiting exoplanet .
‘ Like a teeter - totter ’
The technique is sensitive to finding planets far away from their stars .
“ With astrometry , you can picture it like a teeter - totter , ” says David Charbonneau , a planet hunter at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
“ The star is very massive and the planet is low mass , so the way you get a big wobble is by putting a planet way out on the other end of the balance beam . ”
“ The star is going to execute a circle on the sky because it ’s do - si - do- ing with an unseen planet , ” he continues .
“ The size of that circle is bigger if the planet is farther out , so it ’s easier to measure . ”
Indeed , even though the newly found planet lies relatively far away from its star , measuring changes in the star ’s position was difficult .
Several times a year for the past 12 years , Pravdo and JPL colleague Stuart Shaklan bolted an instrument with a 16 megapixel CCD onto the 5 - metre Hale Telescope at California ’s Palomar Observatory .
After observing the positions of 30 stars over that time , they spotted tiny changes in the position of one star that showed it had a planet .
The detection was equivalent to measuring the width of a human hair from a distance of about 3 kilometres .
Small and cool
The newly found planet , which weighs about six times as much as Jupiter , orbits a type of low - mass star called a red dwarf .
Dubbed VB 10 , the star lies about 20 light years away from Earth and weighs about one - twelfth the mass of the sun .
It is so small and cool that the newfound planet , called VB 10b , gets very little heat from the star , even though it lies about as far away from the star as Mercury lies from the sun .
“ We found a Jupiter - like planet at around the same relative place as our Jupiter , only around a much smaller star , ” said Pravdo in a statement .
“ It ’s possible this star also has inner rocky planets . ”
Red dwarf planets
Pravdo says astronomers may be able to find any such planets , adding that Europe ’s Very Large Telescope may be able to detect them with the radial velocity technique .
He adds that this discovery will shed light on how common planets are around low - mass red dwarf stars , which are the most abundant type of star in the galaxy .
“ The statistics are not as well known as for the solar - type systems , ” Pravdo told New Scientist , adding that fewer than 10 red dwarfs have so far been found to host planetary systems .
If planets do turn out to be common around red dwarfs , “ that would be really exciting ” , he says .
“ Since more than seven out of 10 stars are small like this one , this could mean planets are more common than we thought . ”
Proposed space missions , including NASA ’s Space Interferometry Mission and Europe ’s Gaia probe , would use the astrometry technique , with SIM hunting for planets slightly larger than Earth .

With urban density expected to soar over the next 100 years , what will the future city look and feel like for its inhabitants ?
Across the street from City Hall in downtown Dallas , a neglected parking lot spanning one square block will soon be transformed into one of the worldâ€™s most sophisticated models for sustainable urban development .
Today , Urban Re:Vision announced the winners of its international design competition , Re: Vision Dallas , which drew hundreds of entries from the worldâ€™s top architecture firms and city planners in 26 countries .
The self - sustaining inner-city block will run â€œoff the gridâ€ using advanced technologies to capture wind , solar , water and geothermal resources .
Meant to contribute to an array of revitalization programs in Dallas , the block will generate resources , and support and empower the community , all while acting as a working model of sustainability for cities around the world .
A local community development organization , the Central Dallas Community Development Corporation ( CDC ) , is the lead developer for the project .
â€ œThe quality of the thought and effort of the design teams is astounding .
It was very clear that a lot of people had put their hearts and souls into this competition , â€ said CDC Executive Director John Greenan .
â€œIt was an absolute privilege spending time with the competition entries and seeing their creative vision.â€ 
On Dec. 5 , 2008 , prior to the competition , Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert hosted urban planners and leading design professionals from around the country for an intensive â€œdesign charetteâ€  put on by Re: Vision to examine the necessary framework and community impact of what will become the first fully sustainable , urban square block in the U.S. â€ œIâ€™d like to see Dallas be at the forefront of design , sustainability and vibrancy of cities , â€ says Mayor Leppert .
( VIDEO : Watch Mayor Leppertâ€™s Kickoff Speech )
Entries were judged by a panel comprised of a number of Dallas community leaders as well as several expert global architects and community planners .
Among the judges were Eric Corey Freed , principal of organicARCHITECT and Aidan Hughes , principal at ARUP , leading North American planning practice .
Also on the panel were Nathanial Corum , an architect with Architecture For Humanity , Pliny Fisk , director / co - founder of Maximum Potential Building Systems and Sergio Palleroni , director / co - founder of the BaSiC Initiative at University of Texas at Austin .
Acting as advisors were Cameron Sinclair , executive director / co - founder of Architecture For Humanity , and Peter Head , director of ARUP .
The jury criteria were evenly balanced to consider :
Sustainability and reality of intent
Affordability / Constructability : Could it be built in the next few years ?

Re:Vision Dallas is the 6th in a series of global competitions that focus on :
Images : Re:Vision Dallas
1 .
By virtually every measure — name , race , origins , and upbringing — Barack Hussein Obama was a revolutionary presidential candidate .
In Mideast policy at least , there is little reason to imagine that he will be a revolutionary president .
The radical break with traditional US policy came with the Bush administration , during which the US invaded and then occupied Iraq , shunned Syria , and engaged in an effort , at once ambitious and irresponsible , to reshape the region .
Bush ’s presidency represented an upheaval because it was both guided and blinded by a rigid ideological outlook and because of its uncommon proclivity to choose military over diplomatic means .
Obama ’s first step will be to close that stormy parenthesis .
It will be no small achievement .
His own agenda for the Middle East is at the center of greater speculation , and at the heart of that speculation is the question of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict .
There are signs — the fact that they are taking their time , reviewing their policies , consulting broadly — that the President and his team are committed to pragmatism and patience , qualities they found wanting in Bush ’s rash attempt to impose a new order on the Middle East but also in Bill Clinton ’s impetuous efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement .
Their focus , at the outset at least , likely will be on improving conditions on the ground , including the West Bank economy , curbing if not halting Israeli settlement construction , pursuing reform of Palestinian security forces , and improving relations between Israel and Arab countries .
But there also are hints of a grand ambition biding its time .
Obama has not staked his presidency on resolving the conflict , but he has not shied away from the challenge either .
Judging by what the new president and his colleagues have suggested , attending to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is a matter of US national interest .
The administration seems prepared to devote considerable diplomatic , economic , and , perhaps , political capital to that end .
And the goal , once the ground has been settled , will be to achieve a comprehensive , two - state solution .
At first glance , there ’s more reason to be confounded than convinced .
If such is the President ’s objective , it will be pursued under unusually inauspicious circumstances .
In Israel , a prime minister , Ehud Olmert , who never tired of reiterating his commitment to a Palestinian state has been replaced by one , Benjamin Netanyahu , who can barely bring himself to utter the words .
His coalition partners — a mix of right - wing , xenophobic , and religious parties — make matters worse .
Even the participation of Ehud Barak and his Labor party in the coalition is of scant comfort .
Barak was prime minister when Israeli–Palestinian negotiations collapsed at the Camp David summit in 2000 ; the principal lesson he seems to have drawn is to distrust all things Palestinian .
As defense minister under Olmert , he barely concealed his disdain for the talks the Palestinians conducted with his own government , dismissing them as an “ academic seminar . ”
It is hard to imagine this new coalition going further …

Unrequited High - Five Leads to Assault Claim
It 's Better to Have High - Fived and Lost Than Never to Have High - Fived at All
The high five is dated .
Once the handshake 's cool younger brother , it 's now watching out the window from its room in the Home for the Aged Greetings & Celebratory Gestures , just down the hall from the doffed hat , as those whippersnappers the fist bump and the " bro hug " run rampant throughout most segments of society .
The decline in the high five 's popularity may be due to the " putting yourself out there " vulnerability we 've all felt , in those nervous seconds when the naked hand is raised and you 're praying the move wo n't end in the High - Fiver 's Worst Nightmare : getting left hanging .
Just ask the El Paso school superintendent who last month was celebrating test scores by high - fiving a line - up of school principals , one of whom charged him with assault .
At a school district celebration on May 22 , the high - fiver was Lorenzo Garcia , Superintendent of the El Paso Independent School District , and the high - five denier was Barron Elementary School Principal Mary Helen Lechuga , according to the El Paso Times .
When Lechuga refused Garcia 's gesture , the superintendent tapped her on the head instead .
OK , that move certainly can't touch the gold standard by which all high - fives should be measured :
The " Let 's Go Up - High First and I 'll Meet You Down Low on the Backhand " double version unveiled by Maverick and Goose in Top Gun 's volleyball scene .
Was Garcia 's gesture awkward ?
Sure .
But assault ?
Not according to a number of witnesses who say Lechuga did n't appear to be injured or visibly shaken immediately after the incident .
In any case , according to the El Paso Times , Lechuga told police , " I did not deserve this .
I have done nothing wrong , and I am afraid of what he may do next . "
Well , if there is a next time , we 'd suggest that Garcia go with the fist bump .
If it 's ignored , a quick flick of the wrist turns the overture into a non-committal glance at your watch or an urgent examination of your cuticles , and that way no one gets hurt ( or pretends to get hurt ) .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif ( Reuters ) - Google Inc GOOG .O is closing in on its goal of producing renewable energy at a price cheaper than coal , the company 's so - called green energy czar , the engineer in charge of the project , said on Tuesday .
But the United States needs to raise government - backed research significantly and take much bigger risks if it wants to make alternative energy mainstream , executive Bill Weihl told Reuters in an interview .
Google , known for its
Internet search engine , in late 2007 said it would invest in companies and do research of its own to produce affordable renewable energy -- at a price less than burning coal -- within a few years .
The often - quirky company cast the move as a philanthropic effort to address climate change , but the work is done by a unit of the for - profit corporation , Google.org , and Google investors will profit from any breakthroughs .
The story of its pursuit of cheap , clean energy became an overnight phenomenon , and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt conferred with U.S. President Barack Obama on economic revival and green jobs .
Weihl said the odds of success had gone up in the last year or so from a long shot to a real possibility of demonstrating working technology in a few years ’ time .
“ It is even odds , more or less , ” he said .
“ In three years , we could have multiple megawatts of plants out there . ”
The company has made investments in advanced geothermal and wind , but engineers inside Google are focused mostly on solar thermal , in which the sun ’s energy is used to heat up a substance that produces steam to turn a turbine .
Mirrors focus the sun ’s rays on the heated substance .
By contrast , photovoltaic solar cells , the most commonly known form of solar power , turn the sun ’s rays directly into electricity .
“ We are looking at ways of cheaply getting to much higher temperatures and also making the heliostats , the fields of mirrors that have to track the sun , reflect the sun , keep it focused on the target we are trying to heat up -- make those much , much cheaper .
And I think we ’ve made some really interesting progress in the last six to nine months , ” he said .
Google ’s investment has been modest , so far .
The company has put less than $ 50 million into clean energy start - ups , while the efforts of Weihl ’s group are probably about $ 10 million or $ 20 million .
Deploying technology on a large scale , however , would not be cheap , he said .
If the test project is successful , “ we ’ll see whether we or us in combination with other people are prepared to fund much , much bigger facilities , or if we want to get a few more years ’ experience before we really start to scale it up , ” said Weihl .
Still , the United States is not making enough of the start - up , risky investments it needs , he argued .
“ As a society we need much more , and it needs to be sustained , ” Weihl said , calling recent funding in the U.S. economic stimulus bill a good start .
Coal is plentiful and cheap in the United States and China , making it a crucial source of both power and the carbon dioxide that produces global warming .
So producing carbon - free energy for less than the price of coal is seen as a yardstick for the renewable energy industry ’s success .
Part of the process will be hitting dead ends , he added .
Years from now , investors should be telling themselves that , in retrospect , some of the efforts were stupid .
“ If we are not saying that about some things , then we are not taking the risks we need to take to actually find the breakthrough innovations we need , ” said Weihl .
Enlarge South Dakota Lottery Neal Wanless promised not to " squander " his $ 232.1 million Powerball winnings after he thanked " the Lord for this opportunity . "
PIERRE , S.D.  Hours after Neal Wanless claimed a $ 232 million Powerball prize and vowed to use his new fortune to help others , those who know him said they could n't think of anyone better to win the ninth - largest jackpot in the history of the game .
Wanless , a 23 - year - old rancher who lives outside Mission , S.D. , said his family has been helped by the community " and I intend to repay that help many times over . "
Wanless decided to take a one - time cash prize of $ 118 million , and will get about $ 88.5 million after taxes .
At the Pheasant Bar in Winner , S.D. — the town where the winning ticket was sold —
Dave Storms of Clearfield echoed a sentiment heard around Winner and Mission as word spread in recent days that the Wanless family may have won millions .
" It could n't have happened to better people , " Storms said .
Rick Odenbach added , " I 'm glad it was them ; they need the money . "
Wanless is " a typical South Dakotan , a good hard - working kid , " said Norm Lingle , executive director of the South Dakota Lottery .
Lingle said he thinks thinks Wanless will stay grounded despite his millions and all the publicity .
Wearing a cowboy hat , jeans and a western shirt , Wanless was introduced to the rest of the world at a ceremony Friday in Pierre .
" Winning the Powerball is something I 've always dreamt about but did n't think would happen , " Wanless said .
" I want to thank the Lord for giving me this opportunity and blessing me with this great fortune . "
It took just 23 seconds for Wanless to become $ 232 million richer .
That 's how much time it took from the instant that " 05 " was readable on the first white ball drawn during the May 27 Powerball drawing , to when the " 07 " was clearly viewable on the red Powerball .
Winners usually contact the lottery via telephone , but Lingle said Wanless came to the office in Pierre .
The day after the big drawing , Lingle 's receptionist came to his office and told him that the possible winner was up front .
Lingle said he thinks Wanless " was still stunned and full of disbelief " when he walked into the lottery office .
" He was full of questions , " Lingle said .
The ticket was sold at an Ampride store in Winner — about 35 miles from the Wanless ranch .
It matched all five white balls and the Powerball with Wanless ' incredibly lucky combination of 5-16- 6- 21 - 12 and the 7 Powerball .
The numbers represent the day and month of family members ' birthdays , state lottery officials said .
Shawn Ulmer , manager of the Ampride for the last seven years , said her store sold about 300 to 400 tickets for the lottery drawing .
" Everyone here is very excited about selling the winning ticket , " she said .
In the days after the winning ticket was sold , there was rampant speculation about who may have won .
During his brief remarks at Friday 's news conference , Wanless thanked South Dakotans " for your patience in waiting for me to come forward . "
He declined to answer questions from reporters later .
The family raises cattle , sheep and horses on their ranch in eastern Todd County , the nation 's seventh - poorest county in 2007 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
" They work hard , backbreaking hard work , " said county assessor Cathy Vrbka , a family friend .
Neighbors said Wanless ' father Arlen , 54 , has made a living in recent years mainly by buying and selling scrap metal .
Dan Clark , an auctioneer from Winner and a friend of more than two decades , said Arlen Wanless helped him at many auctions by buying things no one else wanted .
" Over the last 20 years , Arlen 's bailed me out a lot of times , " Clark said .

As a society , we reap the consequences of the unquestioned acceptance of the belief in evolution every day .
It reduces human beings from being “ made in the image of God ” to being mere players in the game of survival of the fittest .
Find hope .
Find truth .
Find answers today .
Why do young men walk into schools and start shooting ?
From Columbine to Dawson College to a small Amish community , today ’s newspapers report stories of young people without hope , without a sense of right and wrong , who end up destroying the lives of others with just the pull of a trigger .
And it ’s not just young men in schools — this year in America , more than 1.8 million people will suffer a violent crime ( SSBR on Crime ) and up to 1.4 million babies will be killed ( NRTL ) .
And what about Africa ?
The Middle East ?
South America ?
Around the world , senseless violence destroys lives because some people no longer value life .
Is there any hope ?
Is there any truth ?
Are there answers ?
Every day we are inundated with evolution - based messages intended to remove the Creator from the fabric of our society , our lives , our thoughts .
But if we evolved from lower life forms , then the Bible ca n’t be trusted and life ’s supposed billion - year history is one of continual death and struggle .
( See “ What Should a Christian Think About Evolution ? ” and “ 10 Dangers of Theistic Evolution . ” )
If the Bible is n’t true , then why should we be fair and kind and love our fellow human beings , as the Bible teaches ( Matthew 22:39 ) ?
After all , evolution relies on survival of the fittest — no matter who gets in the way .
The Bible says something very different .
Genesis tells us that we are created in God ’s image ( Genesis 1:27 ) .
We matter to God ( Psalm 8:4–5 ) —we are fearfully and wonderfully made ( Psalm 139:14 ) .
We were not created through millions of years of violence and death , as evolutionists believe ;
God did not create us to be violent !
Therefore , when we commit acts of violence and evil toward our fellow man , God is grieved .
And God has been grieved by these recent acts of violence in the headlines .
The Creator holds each person accountable for their sinful deeds .
But God chose to send
His perfect Son ( John 3:16 ) to the Cross to pay the penalty ( Romans 6:23 ) for our sin — our failure to obey Him .
He did that for us .
Those who feel that neither they nor their actions matter to God lose their motivation to care for the lives of others or for their own life .
God ’s Word — beginning in Genesis — can rescue people from hopelessness .
Help others find hope , truth and answers .

London 's City Hall will formally refer a sacked adviser to Boris Johnson to police today over allegations he misused a corporate credit card .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ian Clement resigned as Mr Johnson 's deputy major for external relations on Monday after " discrepancies " were discovered in his use of the card .
Three Conservative council leaders have denied they dined with Mr Clement on occasions when he listed them as his guests in his expenses claims .
The head of financial services for the Greater London Authority ( GLA ) contacted Scotland Yard 's Economic and Specialist Crime unit about the case yesterday , members of the London Assembly heard .
Martin Clarke , the GLA 's executive director of resources , told a meeting at City Hall : " An initial meeting has been held .
" A formal referral to the police will be held today .
It will then be the police 's decision whether to take that forward . "
Concerns about Mr Clement 's use of his corporate credit card were first raised last August , the assembly 's business management and administration committee heard .
Mr Johnson ordered him to give up the card after learning that he had used it to upgrade himself to business class on a flight to the Beijing Olympics .
But the former deputy mayor kept the card , despite receiving further warnings about his spending from November onwards .

Mr Clement used it to pay for meals including a £ 700 dinner in New York , and to buy more than £ 200 - worth of groceries and a £ 535.49 audio system for his Jaguar .
He also withdrew cash on the card - incurring fees and interest payments - even after being told not to .
Mr Clement , the former leader of Bexley Council in south east London , finally had the card confiscated last week for using it to buy £ 2,300 - worth of personal items in a breach of GLA regulations .
An initial internal GLA investigation found he repaid all the money at the earliest opportunity and made no personal gain .
But new discrepancies came to light , and he was forced to resign from his £ 127,000 - a- year post on Monday .
Sir Simon Milton , London 's deputy mayor for policy and planning , said Mr Clement offered to repay any money he should not have claimed .
He went on to say that he was " surprised " by the large amounts claimed by the former deputy mayor for entertaining , noting they were higher than those of Mr Johnson 's other senior advisers .
He said : " There was an imbalance in that it was quite clear that most of the people who were being entertained were Conservative politicians .
" If he had been doing his job properly , there would have been a much greater balance across political parties . "
Len Duvall , leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly , observed that some of Mr Clement 's claims for lunch were contradicted by receipts showing the meal happened in the evening .
Mr Clarke said there were only seven corporate credit cards issued to people in the GLA , and the mayor does not have one .
The expenses claims made by Mr Clement which are under the spotlight include :
* £ 32.50 for lunch at Pizza Express in Barnet on October 31 last year with Michael Rye , leader of Enfield Council in north London .
Mr Rye says he saw Mr Clement in Enfield that day but did not dine with him ;
* £ 72.50 for a meal with Mike Freer , the leader of Barnet Council in north London , at the Blue Olive Greek restaurant in Barnet on November 5 .
Mr Freer insists he was attending a funeral in Inverness on that day ;
* £ 51.70 for dinner at the New Mayflower Chinese restaurant in London 's West End with Merrick Cockell , leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , on November 6 .
Mr Cockell says he was not there .
He attended an awards ceremony before going to an event organised by the Local Government Chronicle .
Mr Johnson will be invited to address the business management and administration committee at a future date .
Guaranteed review by our judges within 3 to 7 business days of submission .

A group of popular London deejays used stolen credit cards to buy their own music on iTunes in an elaborate scheme that netted about $ 650,000 in bogus royalties and sent the musicians skyrocketing up the “ indie ” charts , The Post has learned .
The deejays recorded 19 compilations of music they spun at nightclubs , uploaded them on iTunes through a Brooklyn - based service and then downloaded them an astonishing 65,000 times on accounts set up with the pilfered cards , law - enforcement sources said .
Along with the profits , the performers nearly made a second killing — they caught the attention of music industry executives curious about their newfound popularity .
Authorities in New York and London unmasked the group of “ independent musicians ” in recent months , and ring members are expected to be rounded up as early as this morning in Britain .
The takedown caps an international Internet manhunt conducted by Brooklyn prosecutors inside DA Charles Hynes ’ office , NYPD computer crime experts and their counterparts and a London Metropolitan Police unit known as SCD - 6 .
Britished authorities announced this morning that they had made nine arrests in connection with the scam .
The scam began in August with the DJs paying an annual $ 30 - per-album fee to the Williamsburg company Tunecore , a music distribution service , to get their albums uploaded onto iTunes .
The ring then obtained thousands of stolen credit card numbers and painstakingly opened iTunes accounts with them and began downloading their albums at $ 10 apiece .
In December , Apple , the parent company of iTunes , began to receive stop - payment orders from various credit card companies , saying accounts were established fraudulently .
A month later , Apple contacted the NYPD , which enlisted the help of the Brooklyn district attorney .
Investigators scoured the Internet for the origins of the downloads and ultimately determined they were made on London computers .
They then matched the identities of IP computer - address owners and musicians .
The thieves collected about $ 389,000 of the loot — and nearly got the rest before the scam unraveled , the sources said .

There are numerous myths about fitness and exercise .
It is a strange fact that people , who are exercising for long , possess lots of knowledge about exercise but many of them are just misconceptions .
As an instance , many workout performers think , they would not be able to gain a firm body without painful exercise sessions , which has no relevance with reality .
Nevertheless , awareness towards a healthy and toned physique has faded numerous fitness myths but still there are hundreds .
Here is a check on 10 most common myths on fitness and exercise :
Myth 1 : One needs a good exercise to get ‘ lower abs ’
Nothing else exists like the lower abs .
There is an only long muscle that is called rectos abdominal .
If you are looking forward for six pack abs , you must concentrate in the direction of working out for four muscles , which are respectively , the rectos abdominal , internal oblique , external oblique and transverse abdominal .
Many people do crunches to get six - pack abs and you too are thinking about it ; prior to performing them make it sure that you will be melting your body - fat into lean muscles .
This is going to assist you a lot in your endeavor of attaining a toned body .
Myth 2 : If the body is not aching then the workout is not enough
This is one among the funniest fitness and exercise myths .
A painful workout session is not going to get you a firm physique ; it leads you towards many muscle related ailments .
When a workout is performed with right movements , it does not cause any soreness in body .
In accordance with a fact , 35 - 40 minutes long workout session a day is adequate for a healthy adult .
An overdose of exercise causes tiny tears in muscles .
Myth 3 : If a woman is looking for muscle - bound , she must lift weights
This one is for fairer sex ; this fitness and exercise myth advocates weight - lifting , as it helps everybody in getting firm muscles but in accord with science , women do not have testosterone hormone , which is supposed to be the key element in building of muscle - bound .
Weight - lifting helps women in building muscles , which improves their femininity .
Myth 4 : If you ca n’t workout harder , then better not do it
You are always told about this but do n’t worry , it is just a myth .
You do not need to spend hours in gym .
Almost every fitness expert suggests to spend just 120 - 225 minutes for cardio exercises in an entire week , which can be divided in 4 to 5 sessions a week and almost 60 to 70 minutes for weight training , this can be divided into 2 - 3 sessions a week .
Myth 5 : Vigorous exercises help in ‘ padding out ’
Maximum people go for vigorous fitness workouts , as they think this is most effective in gaining muscle or bulking up .
These power exercises are not actually for muscle building instead they are important for a healthy and strong body .
Myth 6 : More protein means bigger muscles
It is a common fitness and exercise misconception among people that the more they take in protein , the bigger muscle they will get .
However , this has no relevance with reality .
The fact says that too much of protein consumption may cause a nutrient imbalance , which can lead to kidney strain and dehydration .
Another research done on protein consumption makes it clear that an overdose of much protein results in stored calories .
Nonetheless , calories are essential for a healthy body but must be taken in the right amounts .
Myth 7 : Machines are always better than Dumbbells and Barbells
In the present scenario , almost everybody is opting for machine - based workout sessions instead of the usual way of barbells and dumbbells .
Though machines are very advanced and lets you workout in a comfortable manner , free weights ( barbells and dumbbells ) are most important for strength training .
Free weight exercises bring lots of advantages for you , as it helps you in burning more calories in comparison of workout - machines and also allow you to perform exercises that train numerous large muscle groups at a time .
These Stretching Exercises are Guaranteed to Improve Your Athletic Performance and Minimize Sports Injury .
If you are without health insurance or , for that matter , any health insurance leads , then this should be no small factor in your workout decision .
It means you are able to burn calories in every set of exercise , which regulates a fast and better result .
As an example , when you perform an exercise with the help of barbells and dumbbells , you can squat train your calves , abs , lower back and hamstring ; but while practicing on treadmill , you would be able to perform only leg extension exercise that targets only the quadriceps .
Free weights ( barbell and dumbbell ) exercises also help in increasing your body balance and bone density .
These exercises are supposed to be the best exercises , as they have a long term impact .
In accordance with studies , these exercises always maintain balance and make one stronger , which is important in older ages , as these exercises diminish the risk of old age falls and enhance bone density thus preventing elderly diseases such as osteoporosis [ preventing osteoporosis ] .
Myth 8 : One must lose weight by dieting before starting weight - lifting
This is one of the most worked out fitness and exercise myths .
Many people believe that they must lose their weight before starting the practice of weight - lifting .
This myth generally exists among women .
Often women possess a tendency to aim for quick results from weigh - lifting or diet programs and when they do not see any major difference on the scale , they immediately become discouraged .
Such exercises and diet sessions cut the body fat first and then assist in shaping the body but females try to diet more to get the perfect shape as soon as possible , which is not good for the health .
Studies suggest that a combination of aerobics , strength training and moderate dieting is best for a toned body .
Compared to serious starvation that leads to death causing ailments such as anorexia nervosa , this approach is the healthier one .
Myth 9 : One should avoid dinner after 8 PM
How can it work for those , who are active till late ?
For people who exert more energy , they require more nutrition .
It is very important for them to eat accordingly .
They must follow a healthier diet plan for dinner , as this will help them in consuming the much needed nutrients .
Nevertheless , dinner should be taken almost two hours before you are going to sleep , as it helps in healthy digestion .
Myth 10 : Supplements are a must to attain a good body figure
Well , supplements are just supplements .
In fact , they were named such because they were just designed to add - up or supplement the basic needs of the body , especially at times when there seems to be little or less intake of good nutrients .
However , it must be made known that these substances are n’t the exact answer towards getting fit .
They are definitely not your ultimate fitness wonder drugs .
If you have enough intake of the necessary nutrients like Omega - 3 and proteins , then you do n’t need to pour more supplements to your daily intake .
The right balance of nutrients that is within the set daily recommended values is most appropriate .
By now , I believe you have become more informed about the most common fitness and exercise myths circulating around you .
Continue to be wiser in your fitness strategy .
Do n’t just believe in what other people say .
Know the theory behind the commonly used fitness regimen .
Above all else , stay healthy !

Exercises To Get Lean Body
Religion , Rationality , and a letter to a rabbi in response to a phone call .
[ Jan. 15th , 2009 | 06:38 pm ]
Psy - Kosh Okay , a bit of background : A while back , the head of a chasidic sect ( not Lubavitch , the Rebbe of a different group ) was apparently visiting in the area .
Anyways , bunch of people ( including my parents ) went to get blessings from him blah blah blah ...
So , apparently when they spoke to him and they had mentioned me , he requested to meet me .
Anyways , so my parents asked if I would come .
me : " fine ... "
Anyways , met him , etc etc , do I do this or that , eventually I explained that the issue is that I 'm an unbeliever , blah blah ... he was nice , but used some rather poor argments .
Fast forward about half a year .
It was thanksgiving evening , we were watching some movie we rented , and we get a call .
Turns out to be some rabbi that represents / works for this Rebbe , specifically wanted me , started telling me random stuff about how I have the potential to be a great scholar , blah blah blah .
I politely explained him why that was unlikely .
( The whole me being an atheist and so on thing .. ) aaanyways , he managed to get out of me a promise to email him and discuss the issues .
I decided to carefully write a rather comprehensive letter , detailing my basic views and to respond to some of the things he said on the phone .
I got a bit technical , but at least what I tried to do was to make it as clear as possible .
I did n't want to simply impress with a wall of confusing stuff , but to communicate and argue about actual ideas .
Took me a bit to write the letter , then I asked a couple people to look over it just to see if it was comprehensible ( not if they agreed with what I was saying , but I simply wanted to verify whether I was at all succeeding in communicating what I was trying to communicate )
Anyways , so it was about two weeks or so after thanksgiving when I finally sent the letter .
I have yet to see a reply , and I took a while writing it , so why waste that effort ?
Might as well let others read it too , so here it is :
Hello .
First , well , I wish to apologize , I forgot to write down the name of the specific person that called me , and I do n't know if this address goes straight to that person , or is used by a group of people in your organization , so if I say stuff like " you said " , and the person reading this is n't the specific person that called me , well , that 's the explanation .
Second , I 'd like to apologize again , this time for the lateness of this reply .
First it took me a little while to write it .
But then I was n't sure how well I was communicating that which I wished to communicate , so I printed it up and asked some people to read it over .
Not to try to convince them , but simply to see if they managed to understand what I was saying .
( That is , if I managed to communicate the relevant concepts . )
Had to wait a bit for all of them to get back to me , then I took a little longer making a few corrections and so on ...
Well , let 's see , where to begin ...
You had said on the phone that I should once again start putting on tefilin regularly and so on , and that I had the potential to be a great Torah scholar .
( Why do you think that , anyways ? )
As I indicated , the fact that I 'm an atheist might be at least a slight impediment to that . :)
Anyways , you 'd indicated I should give some of my reasons in an email and we could discuss it .
I may as well start with what I consider an important point .
In fact , this is , to me , the central issue .
Not the only one , but to me this is the major primary issue .
Basically my attitude here is that if you can't adequately and intelligently address this matter , there 'd be little point in continuing this conversation .
The specific issue is the matter of faith itself .
Allow me to clarify :
It would perhaps be more correct to describe myself as an afaithist rather than an atheist .
Where by faith I mean the whole notion of " belief without or in spite of rational evidence is somehow a useful and virtuous way to arrive at truth , and further , real doubt or disbelief is immoral " and all the related cluster of concepts .
If you use the word " faith " in a different way , well , it 's not the word that 's really at issue , but the concepts I 'm trying to refer to .
Now , I 'd like to note something :
It is n't just " faith in god " that I object to , but _faith itself_ .
( In other words , the exact same reasoning applies to rejecting Soviet style communism , with faith in " The Party " , Nazism with faith in the fuhrer , etc ...
Obviously , those are rejectable on moral grounds too .
I was simply here clarifying that I have far more objection to the idea of faith than to the idea of god , which , to me is more of almost an incidental " oh , by the way , looking at the evidence , it seem that no such being , at least nothing resembling the entity Judaism or most other religions I 've heard of describe , actually exists " style matter , while I have serious revulsion at the idea of faith as described above . )
Now , perhaps I ought give some justification for this .
( In other words , give some of the more detailed aspects of this , that , if you want to convince me , you 'll need to address . )
Let 's start like this :
What is a belief or a set of beliefs ?
It 's simply a map of reality .
I believe I am sitting on a chair right now , I believe there 's a computer in front of me , I believe the earth is , to the extent that time exists ( there 're certain interesting models of physics which completely remove time from the equations , but I digress ) , it is approximately 4.5 billion years old .
I believe that 1 + 1 = 2 , etc etc etc ...
Some of my beliefs may be accurate , some may be inaccurate .
Does that all make sense so far ?
( If I was unclear on something , or it otherwise does n't make sense , let me know .
I do n't want my poor communications skills , to the extent that they are poor , to get in the way of this . )
So , now , let 's try thinking this through :
I desire to believe things that are true , and disbelieve things that are false .
I desire my map of reality to be as accurate as possible , for I am curious .
This is not my only desire , but it is certainly one of them , and having an accurate map of reality is also useful for doing other stuff .
Let us examine this in more detail
If , say , a slice of pizza in front of me has mushrooms on it , I desire to believe it has mushrooms on it .
If it does not have mushrooms , then I desire to believe it does not have mushrooms .
And if there is , in fact , no slice of pizza in front of me in the first place , then I desire to believe that there is no slice of pizza in front of me .
In other words , I desire my beliefs to be reliably correlated with reality , as best as possible .
Ideally , given thus , one would simply take all the information they have , put it in front of them and say " given all this , what is the best guess ( es ) I can make about the world ?
To the extent that my conclusions are less than certain , let me track that uncertainty and attempt to narrow it further by accumulating more information . "
More generally , how can one endeavor to ensure that there is correlation between their beliefs and reality ?
Well , where would reliable correlation come from ?
Essentially we would need to ensure at least one of these options are true : a certain aspect of reality _causes_ , directly or indirectly , a belief that is a reflection of that aspect .
Alternately , aspect of reality A causes aspect of reality B _and_ belief about aspect of reality B . Finally , we have the option of belief in B itself causing B to be true .
This last one is one an option that , for now , I will ignore as a nonstarter .
( Unless you wish to consider the possibility that , say , belief in God would _cause_
God to exist , and non belief would _cause_
God to not exist .
I do not consider this model plausible , although I have heard of some mystics that do consider it .
Again , for now I will assume that the general case is that a belief does n't neccessarally _cause_ itself to be true . )
( There 're subtleties to all this , of course .
The ability to take all the information into account fully in practice is limited by resources ( time , energy , computational , etc . .. )
Now , given all this ...
Where could there possibly be room for faith ?
This line of reasoning would seem to me to annihilate the notion of faith , rendering it as silly nonsense .
What should one believe given all this ?
Simply whatever their best effort information collection / reasoning leads them to .
Yes , fully acknowledging human limitations and attempting to work around them or simply insert ( ideally quantitative ) representations of uncertainty .
But to simply instead consider faith , to say " no matter what I observe in reality , I will simply believe what I believe , for I have faith " is to sever the link between belief and reality , and thus almost ensure failure in the endeavor .
Similarly , where is there room for the notion of one " choosing what to believe " ?
To say one must simply choose what to believe is to suggest a criteria for belief _other_ than " what is the best guess based on the available data ? "
For me , all of the above more or less destroys the notion of faith , reveals the notion of faith to be a confusion rather than a valid idea .
Faith , ultimately , forbids me from ever saying " oops , my deeply held beliefs turned out to actually be wrong .
I 'd better simply admit that I 'm wrong and actually try to figure out the correct answer . "
I do not wish to be forbidden from ever admitting to a ( fundamental ) mistake .
Before I continue though , I 'd like to briefly discuss something which I hinted at here with mentions of quantitative representations of uncertainty , of computation , and so on .
Specifically , is there a proper way to manage uncertainty , to update ones beliefs in light of new evidence ?
Yes .
There are multiple theorems which mathematically show that the only reasonable option for representing subjective uncertainty are the axioms of probability .
Cox 's theorem is one , there 're also the " dutch book " / coherence arguments and the related vulnerability proofs which actually construct both probability and decision theory all at once .
This notion , incidentally , that subjective uncertainty = probability is known as the Bayesian view of probability and statistics .
Basically , I wanted to emphasize that even if one does n't know the math ( or if one does know the math , but the relevant computations are not really , in practice , computable ) , given a certain piece of evidence , there is a specific correct way to update ones beliefs in light of that evidence .
I may as well try to give an intuitive notion of what Bayesian evidence is .
The basic idea is that a certain piece of evidence E favors hypothesis A more strongly than hypothesis B if A places a greater likelihood of E being observed than B does .
( Specifically , the ratio of those likelihoods basically is how one modifies the odds one assigns to A and B .
If you 'd like , I could go a bit more into the math of this , but that probably is n't needed right now . )
Consider again the previous example with the pizza .
What 's one way to find out ?
Well , I could look at the slice of pizza and see if there are mushrooms on it .
Why does this help ?
Because the pattern of photons entering my eye would be different depending on if there was or was n't mushrooms to be seen , so updating my belief in the topping of the pizza based on what I see when I look at the pizza is valid .
ie , if there had not been mushrooms , I would have expected to not see mushrooms , so if I do see mushrooms , it supports the notion that the pizza has mushrooms on it .
See ?
Simple , obvious , and intuitive .
The subtleties come in when one starts poking around with the actual math of this stuff and with the issue of the " prior . "
Perhaps this is what I ought discuss next , especially since it leads into a discussion of Occam 's Razor , which is definately something I 'd like to bring up .
I 'm not sure how obvious this was , though I may have hinted at it , but the techniques of Bayesian Inference basically operate by having a set of prior beliefs , that is , confidence levels in various hypothesies .
Then , upon encountering new info , combining that , using the mathematics of probability , with ones prior beliefs to produce the new levels of belief .
So , on obvious question would be " what priors ought one start with ? "
This is an important and nontrivial question .
There 're several ways of addressing it , many of which differ in their mathematical details but are inspired by and have in common the notion of Occam 's razor .
Have you heard of it ?
There 're several ways to phrase the idea , but the basic notion is " all else being equal , give preference to the simpler hypothesies " or " the simplest hypothesis that is consistent with the data is the one most likely to be true . "
Now , rather than merely assert this principle , to be taken as a matter of , ahem , faith , I 'd like to try to actually show why I think it 's valid .
That is , I 'd like to try to communicate what I consider the core reasons behind trusting it .
Imagine I was flipping a fair coin , and I was following the rule that if it comes up heads the first time , I stop .
If it comes up tails , I flip it again and then stop .
So there are three possible outcomes , right ?
H , TH , TT , correct ?
( Where H is for heads and T for tails )
Now , let 's say in advance I was trying to make a prediction about what was going to happen .
How much relative belief should I place in the H hypothesis vs the TH hypothesis ?
I say I should have rather more belief ( in fact , in this specific example it would be exactly twice as much ) in the H hypothesis .
Why ?
Because I have no particular reason to believe more in the first flip coming up heads or tails .
However , the second option is more specific .
That is , _IN ADDITION_ to the first flip coming up tails , I would be claiming that the second flip comes up heads .
This example gives the basic spirit of the idea .
Each additional thing that would need to be " just so " , that is , each additional assumption that a hypothesis makes ought to be viewed as a burden , an additional piece of belief that needs to be justified .
ie , if you have a hypothesis that claims A AND B AND C are all true , that 's almost certainly less likely than simply claiming that A is true and uncertainty about the rest .
Each additional detail required is an additional thing that can go wrong .
Now , later evidence may end up being so strongly in favor of a somewhat complex hypothesis as opposed to a certain simple hypothesis that it overcomes this and justifies a belief in the more complex hypothesis .
This is the basic essence of it .
Another way to think about it : Imagine I dropped a weight and noticed how long it took to fall , etc etc etc .
And then I considered the following question : " why did it fall like that ? "
Well , I could perhaps try to explain it by saying " A witch did it ! "
It may even seem on the surface like it's a simpler explanation than all those complicated physics explanations science type people talk about .
But it 's not .
In fact , it 's , in a sense , a non explanation .
What do I mean by this ?
Simply ask this question : " A witch did _WHAT_ ? "
More to the point , let 's say I was trying to write a computer program to simulate the path the weight took over time .
I might notice that adding anything about witches to the program does n't help at all ... it simply does n't in any make any predictions , does n't actually describe in any way what happened .
But , I may notice that no matter what hypothesis I use , having part of my program square the amount of time that has passed actually helps in computing this .
So my hypothesis perhaps should involve something like that mathematical operation , but has no need of witches .
ie , even if I consider the " witch " hypothesis ...
I still have to tack on all the physics stuff to actually make a complete hypothesis .
So the " witch " hypothesis is n't simpler , it just has an extra bit dangling from the rest of the theory , an extra bit that does n't add anything .
Basically , when describing a hypothesis in detail , each additional AND in the assumptions should be considered a bad thing , and " punished " by having a lower belief in the hypothesis , at least initially .
Now , there are a few subtleties I 'm kind of glossing over here .
There 're certain ambiguities in exactly how to compute the complexity of a hypothesis , but generally keeping this notion in mind can help distinguish between hypothesis that are significantly different complexitywise or hypothesies in which one hypothesis has to contain the entirety of the other , plus contains something extra in addition to that .
Does this make sense ?
Not just as a pile of words , but have I successfully communicated some of the intuitions behind the idea ?
Here 's a more mathematical way of looking at it : P( A AND B ) <= P( A )
( Not sure if that 'll help , but if you happen to be familiar with the mathematics of probability , that statement might help clarify what I 'm saying )
Now , consider : effectively you 're asking me to believe , _in addition_ to all the physics and so on stuff , the following : " a fundumental yet intelligent entity ( ie , God ) , as an act of will , chose those principles to be true , willed this reality into existance . "
First , I 'd like to note that things like intelligent willful entities are _COMPLICATED_ , not simple .
If God is the sort of thing that _choses_ this and not that , etc etc etc , that 's a complicated entity with lots of structure , no ?
( I have heard of the kabbalistic notion that HaShem is " pashut " , but I do n't buy that .
Pashut things do n't have complex structure , do n't say " okay , I 'll chose to make a universe like this _instead_ of a universe like that , I will chose specifically human forms like this rather than forms like that , I choose they should behave this way instead of that " etc etc etc ... the more specific details it outputs as a whole , the more structure is involved .
Now , if the belief was " HaShem made all possible universes in all permutations " or something like that , then perhaps the " pashut " notion would hold some water .
But that would really correspond at all to the claims the Torah makes , now would it ?
The notion that HaShem made specific decisions , chose how the universe should be , chose " this and not that " even though He , in some sense , " could have " done it a different way , could have done it any way .
But I digress ... )
Anyways , in addition to tacking on to the rest of our knowledge the belief that it was all caused by a supreme intelligent willful being as , well , an act of will , you ask me to further believe that this entity has communicated with humanity _AND_ has chosen a specific subset of humanity _AND_ we ( Jews ) happen to be that subset _AND_ that there 's specific things the supreme being wants us to do and not do _AND_ the document that encodes that communication starts with the letter Bet _AND_ the next letter is ... etc etc ... _AND_ the supreme being is good and loving _ AND_ etc etc etc etc ...
That 's a whole lot of " AND "s .
Therefore I ought to start by placing a very low starting credence on it compared to simpler hypothesies .
( Incidentally , I do n't apply these ideas to just religion .
For example , I also reject the specific view / component of quantum mechanics known as the " collapse postulate " since it actually does n't add anything at all to QM .
No , I take that back .
It adds confusion and nonsense .
But it does n't really solve any mysteries , does n't actually explain anything that we can't explain without that one particular part .
Now , the implications of rejecting that specific part of QM are interesting , but from the important thing for the sake of this discussion is that it simplifies the theory without removing any predictive ability . )
Anyways , all of the above are really the fundamental things , primarily the whole bit about me rejecting the notion of faith itself , and the Occam 's razor business showing why , otherwise , religion gets a very low prior belief .
Even though the above represents the primary fundamental thing that , if you want to convince me , you need to address , I will at least respond now to the couple of things you mentioned on the phone .
Mainly just so you do n't think I 'm trying to avoid the issue by ignoring your arguments and trying to hide behind a big pile of words instead . :)
First , you tried to use the argument that the Torah is one of the , if not the most translated , commented , written about , and so on books in all of history .
There 're several responses I might make to that .
A quick " smug " reply might be " perhaps , but even if so , think how much time it 's had .
Even in the few years since it was written , the Harry Potter books have been widely translated .
Perhaps I ought go to a spiritual quest to find the Hogwarts School ? "
However , while responding like that and merely stopping there may be amusing to me , it does n't fully address all the fundamental reasons of _why_ that argument breaks down , why it does n't help , so here I will do a rather more considered analysis of it .
So , to consider that argument , I have to ask " well , what could I learn from this fact ? "
And for that question , I should ask " _why_ has the Torah been so translated , commented upon , etc etc etc . "
The answer to that , as near as I can make out , is " because lots of people believe that it represents truth " and perhaps also ( though not as much ) " even those that do n't would note that since many people through history have believed it , it has influenced history significantly , so it 's useful to look at what people believed "
So , really your argument there comes down to telling me that I should perhaps believe it simply because so many other people believe it .
That is , " if so many other people believe it , it 's probably true . "
This then , is the notion that I must address to address your argument .
First , I will propose some quick counterexamples to quickly show that , on the surface , there clearly are things wrong with your argument here :
" More people believe in Christianity than Judaism .
Perhaps you suggest I ought become a Christian then ? "
" Although not as many , think how many people believe that Elvis is alive , claim to have seen him at their local gas station or whatever . "
" In the past many people believed everything in the universe revolved in circles around the earth . "
And , of course , " over the years there have been many antisemites .
If we are to use this logic , then would it not imply that the fact that many people have believed that Jews are evil means that we really are ? "
_CLEARLY _ the fact that many people believe something does _NOT_ imply that thing is true .
I could stop here , but still , doing that might just be me avoiding the issue of why it is then that so many people believe in the validitiy of the Torah or in God or whatever .
So , let 's probe that issue a bit more deeply :
Imagine if person A believes some strange idea .
Let 's say B thinks A is smart , so B , upon finding out A believes it , starts believing it too .
C , seeing that both A and B believe it , starts believing it too , same with D and E .
By the time we get to F , B , C , and D's belief has been strengthended by the fact that they 've noticed that all those other people are starting to believe it too .
Finally , Z comes along and says " wait , this does n't make sense .
Why do you believe what you believe ? "
And almost everyone simply just points at everyone else and says " because they believe it too . "
Clearly something went very wrong here .
You ca n't say " so many people believe it " as a valid argument in this cause _because_ the only one other than Z that actually considered the issue was A .
Everyone else was effectively just " copying " the belief .
So the fact that many people believed it does n't actually change anything , does n't really tell us anything new .
( Well , may tell us a bit about gullibility ... :) )
Now , if I know a lot of people who actually consider deeply an issue , think rationally and independantly have concluded , without connection to the fact that other people believe something that they themselves believe it , then I may be justified in saying ( at least to myself ) that it may be an idea worth considering .
But religion does n't really work like that .
It _explicitly_ makes a virtue of believing , of not having true doubt .
( True doubt being doubt that could go _either way _... that is , that there 's a nontrivial chance that by the end of it you end up disbelieving , rather than the more popular false doubt , where one is simply looking for excuses / rationalizations to believe what they already believe )
There 's plenty of , say , in Judaism , " if you believe in God and the Torah you 're good , but if you disbelieve , you are , simply due to that disbelief , bad and will be punished by God .
( or , if still a kid , perhaps your parents or teachers .
Or , in the old days or in some places , whether or not you 're a kid . ) "
Religious parents raise their kids to believe this stuff even before the kids know what it is .
The point is , with religion , there 's been plenty of " believe or else " , right ?
Or , more generally , the reason that many people believe are reasons _OTHER_ than having rationally considered it .
Therefore , the fact that many people believe it does n't mean much since the specific cause of their belief in this matter is n't something really correlated to whether or not it 's actually true or not .
It 's often based on faith , which , as I argued above , is not in any way a useful way to actually get at the actual truth of things .
Let 's see , what else did you say on the phone ?
Oh yeah , two other things :
First , you used the argument that there were hidden prophesies in the Torah , that it predicted things like World War 2 .
The essense of my response is " no it did n't . "
If you 're talking about Torah Codes type stuff , last I heard , it 's been shown that you can do that sort of thing with pretty much any large book .
How many of these predictions were found in advance ?
I claim that it 's more a case of looking for patterns , then squinting and saying " well , is there _any_ historical event that we can compare this to , especially if we squeeze this metaphor , stretch that interpretation , etc ? "
The problem with finding prophesies " after the fact " is that it 's like shooting an arrow at a wall , and then painting a target around the arrow .
It 's not exactly an achievment to hit the bullseye if the bullseye was put in _after_ the arrow hit .
Not to mention the related issue of remembering the " prophesies " that came true and ignoring the rest .
Sure , if you keep looking at different stuff in the Torah and the set of all historical things that have actually happened , you 'll probably find _some_ set of things that can pair up , especially if you 're willing to be creative in " interpreting the metaphors . "
But that 's hardly the most rigorous of methods .
Finally , you said that the Zohar claimed that people disbelieve simply because they feel guilt about having spoiled their connection with God , so they try to rationalize that guilt away .
If nothing else , that was a profoundly rude response .
Almost comically rude .
The type of thing that one imagines jokes about : " You 're in denial . "
" No I 'm not . " " See ? "
It 's basically a complete and utter dismissal of even the possibility that I may have actual reasons ( however flawed ) for thinking as I do .
Of course , I must right away counter what I 'm saying here by admitting that even if something is rude , that does not make it false .
The truth is n't necessarally polite , it merely is true .
However , _now_ , in this email , I 've given you some of my thinking on it .
Even with regards to your other arguments , I carefully responded to them .
I ask that you do the same and actually address the fundamental issues I have raised ( most importantly the whole " faith " thing itself ) or admit plainly that you cannot .
I ask you do not do what other rabbis have done and basically utterly ignore it , simply saying " oh , that 's just mind games , you 're just rationalizing , you just have to choose to believe the proper thing " .
especially in light of the fact that I ( hopefully clearly ) explained why I consider the notion of " choosing to believe " as completely absurd .
One last thing .
I do actually understand that you mean well , that you probably believe something to the effect of " a Jew who rejects the Torah and the idea of God has a suffering neshama " or something to that effect , but please recognize that I do _not_ believe this .
If you wish to convince me , then you 're going to have to use arguments that do n't depend on me already believing these things .
Further , those arguments should be stronger than those I 've thus far seen and already found to be flawed .
This is a project that I have been working on for almost two years now .
Just spending a little time on it here and there .
It started as an idea to make a custom journal , and has been the most complicated wax carving and casting project .
I started by making a design on paper , and cutting out the wax into that shape .
Then I traced the design with an x-acto knife .
Then I got to carving ( using my home made carving tools ) .
Then I made a mold to cast ( lead free ) pewter into .
Then melt the pewter and cast .
Two crysknive ’s at the bottom of the badge .
Muad ’dib the mouse on the second moon .
Shai -Hulud rising from the sand .
Water drops around the edge
It looks good on a journal as well .
I am just overjoyed with how well this turned out .
I am going to be selling both the book plate on its own , and along with a journal on my etsy store .

Full disclosure : I 'm a New Orleanian , not by birth but by adoption .
We adopted each other , New Orleans and me .
While some of my friends , who suffered no damage from the 2005 floods , used the moment to flee the city ( and even to denounce it in the New York Times ) , I saw the moment as more akin to what you do when a stranger hideously attacks your loved one : unless you 're Newt Gingrich ( who famously demanded a divorce from his first wife on her cancer bed ) , you do n't abandon her .
You cleave to her , and defend her .
As I watched New Orleans flood , from my birth home in Los Angeles , then read the dispatches appearing over the next few weeks in the remarkably reborn New Orleans Times - Picayune , a strange awareness arose .
The national media placed the " Katrina " story in a couple of handy templates : a natural disaster story , and a story of the suffering of African Americans at the hands of an unfeeling Republican administration .
What local media -- also including WWL Radio and WWL and WDSU TV - - reported was that flooding , and suffering , extended far and wide throughout the metropolitan area , to rich and poor neighborhoods , black and white neighborhoods , urban and suburban neighborhoods .
And they began , as October turned to November , to report results of on - the - ground investigations , by distinguished engineers working pro bono , that showed the levees had n't been overtopped , that Katrina was not what flooded New Orleans ( even though it whacked the Mississippi Gulf Coast ) , that the floods were triggered by more than four dozen breaches in levees and floodwalls that had been poorly designed and constructed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers .
US taxpayers , in short , had paid billions over four decades to flood New Orleans .
We 're almost four years on , and national media reporters still like to fly into the city , root about for a new change on the familiar story , and jet back out .
Latest example : this , from the Los Angeles Times ( yes , complaining about accuracy in that paper is like regretting that skunks do n't emit Chanel # 5 ) .
High up in the story , the reporter , who 's doing a piece about supposed continuing controversy over whether the city 's footprint should be shrunk and how that controversy is " tak ( ing ) on a new racial dimension " , writes this :
" Immediately after the storm , many residents , often African Americans , worried that low - lying flood - ravaged neighborhoods would be left unbuilt and turned into wetlands . "
Utilizing an almost Cheneyesque skill at conflation and elision , the reporter leaves in the reader 's mind the notion that those " flood - ravaged neighborhoods " , like the Lower Ninth Ward , are all " low - lying " .
Perhaps the reporter , like so many out - of - towners , misinterprets the name of the district ; in fact , the " Lower " in the name refers to the neighborhood 's location on the river , downriver from the French Quarter and Garden District ( the latter of which is Uptown ) .
In fact , many parts of the city that flooded during " Katrina " had never before flooded .
They were n't low - lying , but lying in the direct path of water unleashed by catastrophic levee breaches .
And , though New Orleans is in the midst of racial controversies , they tend to circulate around the legacy of Mayor Nagin , the battles between the new city council and the Mayor 's functionaries , and the issues surrounding health - care and housing for the working poor .
One of these days , a few years on , someone in the mainstream media -- assuming it still exists -- will win a Pulitzer for discovering what New Orleanians have known since August 30 , 2005 .

It does n’t happen as often as it would if the fight was actually fair , but it ’s nice to see the underdog win for a change .
Israel Lancho had the misfortune of getting impaled by a bull , last Wednesday , in Madrid .
The bull ’s horn went in 8 inches and doctors said it was a miracle that it did n’t hit the matador ’s heart .
30 - year - old Israel is now recuperating .
I wonder if he ’s ever going to go into the bull - ring again .
UPDATE : One of our visitors left a comment saying the matador died of complications .
That is not true , but , while he received medical attention , the bull did in fact die as a result of his wounds .
Others said this is tradition and should be accepted as such …
Well , the shearing of the beasts , donkey basketball , Grindadrap or Afghan dog- fights are also old traditions , but I refuse to respect them .

( CNN ) -- Credit cards are as much a part of the American economy as $ 20 bills , but a fervent subset of consumers has sworn off plastic money altogether .
Some consumers are making the choice to eschew credit cards and stick strictly with cash .
" Credit card debt is our biggest hindrance in being able to take care of our families and set ourselves up for prosperity , " said finance student Brad Chaffee , 34 , of Charlottesville , Virginia .
" If your paycheck is going toward paying all these credit card companies off , you can't get very far , " added Chaffee , who has a Web site called enemyofdebt.com .
" You certainly can't use your income as a wealth - building tool -- which is what it becomes when you do n't have all these debt payments .
I feel very strongly about that . "
So do thousands of others , many of whom are followers of charismatic financial expert Dave Ramsey , whose Web site , books , arena rallies and radio show on 400 stations hammer away at the " freedom from debt " theme .
" Debt is not a tool ; it is a method to make banks wealthy , not you .
Debt is dumb , " says Ramsey 's Web site , where users can find blunt advice on how to deal with creditors and develop sound money habits .
Ramsey 's site does n't even accept credit cards to pay for his products .

Nearly 80 percent of American families have at least one credit card , 44 percent of families carry a balance on their credit cards , and Americans pay about $ 15 billion a year in penalty fees , according to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner 's office .
The Credit Card Act of 2009 , signed into law in May , is intended to protect consumers from sharp or retroactive interest rate increases , harsh penalties , short payment windows and other abusive practices .
It also requires card holders under 21 years of age to have co-signers , prove they have adequate income or pass a money management course .
Another organization hopes to help consumers through education but takes a position that 's more moderate than Ramsey's .
" The root issue is not that credit cards are evil .
The issue is that a person needs to have self - control , " said Chuck Bentley , CEO of Crown Financial Ministries .
His radio program , " MoneyLife , " is carried on 800 stations .
" If you have self - control , the credit card can be a very meaningful tool to manage your money wisely , " Bentley said .

Prudent use of a credit card means taking advantage of reward programs and paying off the balance every month , he said .
" We think that if a person is having trouble paying off their credit card balances , then they do need to stop using them , that they do need to pay down their balances and start to manage them wisely , " he said .
Bentley himself carries a credit card and notes that the late Larry Burkett , the ministry 's revered co-founder , carried one also .
Nevertheless , some people need to listen to Ramsey and go cold turkey , he said .
" They need someone very directive to help them correct their behavior , and Dave does a very nice job with the audience he 's speaking to , " Bentley said .
" He 's got a sizable audience that needs that kind of help . "

Frugaldad.com blogger Jason
White , 31 , of Macon , Georgia , spent six years working with distressed customers at a major credit card company 's service center .
" I heard a great analogy once , that credit cards are kind of like power tools :
They 're a great convenience , they can get the job done faster , but they can be dangerous , definitely , in untrained hands , " he said .
" And I would consider untrained hands to be someone who is not disciplined financially , or maybe they 're young and have n't had the exposure to credit and debt .
" But for the average American , I do n't have a problem with them having one or two credit cards " to combine recurring expenses into a single monthly payment , he added .
White , a software manager by day , draws the line at carrying a balance .
" I think it 's dangerous , " he said .
" And one of the things we 've seen lately in this recession is that some of the rules are changing , and credit card companies are upping interest rates without a lot of warning , if any warning , reducing credit limits -- and sometimes if you 've got a really large balance out there , you can get caught . "
Fellow blogger Chaffee agrees that some can handle credit cards , " but I still think there 's a better way . "
" I think if we just use cash and debit cards , it 's a much better idea , " he said .
" Credit cards are too risky , and when something does happen to you and you have a bunch of debt -- like for instance when life happens to you , you lose your job or whatever it may be -- you 've got all this debt in your life , whereas if you did n't use credit cards and you did n't use debt , then you might be in a little better situation . "
Crown Financial Ministries ' Bentley cited Proverbs 22:7 to drive home the point : " The borrower is servant to the lender . "
" We believe excessive debt is a clear warning sign in Scripture , " he said , " that people who leverage beyond their means are in danger of being enslaved .
...
We think in the current environment , debt elimination is essential . "

BOB SCHIEFFER :
This seems to go beyond just the fact that , you know , he became involved in this relationship .
He was basically missing in action for five days .
...
Is n’t this more than just a sex scandal here ?
I mean , this is dereliction of duty , is n’t it ?
GOV .
HALEY BARBOUR : You know , Bob , I do n’t know all the details .
But I ’ve been in politics a long time .
I ’ve made it my policy , I just do n’t talk about people ’s personal problems .
I do n’t-- I do n’t think it ’s appropriate , I do n’t think it ’s polite , and I do n’t think it -- it achieves any purpose .
Here 's Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , the ethically challenged incoming chairman of the Republican Governors Association , on Face the Nation yesterday
Note that Schieffer never asked Barbour to comment on Sanford 's personal life .
In fact , Schieffer was referring to Sanford 's public lapses , not his private ones -- yet Barbour still refused to answer .
Of course , the other thing about Barbour 's non-answer is that it was a complete lie .
He was more than happy to discuss President Clinton 's sexual misconduct in quite graphic terms .
Here he is on September 15 , 1998 , appearing on Fox 's " Special Report with Brit Hume " :
HALEY BARBOUR : And now we have this president who treated Monica Lewinsky in such a way that it makes prostitution look dignified and ennobling .
I mean , he made her a sex toy , a sex object .
And now what do these women say ?
That it does n't make any difference ?
The American people hear that with a voice louder than a bolt of lightning and thunder when these same people never say one word about the way that this young woman was treated , when they 've spent their whole careers complaining about it when it was the president of a company or a Republican Senator or a possible judge ?
The public sees through that like nothing you ever saw .
It never fails with them .
The good news in the latest World Bank China Quarterly :
One .
China is growing , thanks to China ’s government .
The World Bank estimates that the government ’s policy response will account for about 6 percentage points of China ’s 7.2 % forecast growth ( p. 8 ) .
That ’s good .
There is a big difference between growing as 7 % and growing at 1 % .
This was the right time for China ’s government to " unchain " the state banks .
Ok , it would have been better if China had allowed its currency to appreciate back in late 2003 and early 2004 to cool an overheated economy instead of imposing administrative curbs on bank credit and curbing domestic demand .
Then China might not have ever developed such a huge current account surplus and avoided falling into a dollar trap .
But better late than never : this was the right time to lift any policy restraints on domestic demand growth .
China has , in effect , adopted its own version of credit easing .
It just works through the balance sheets of the state banks rather than through the balance sheet of the central bank .
Andrew Batson :
By some indicators , credit in China is even looser than in the U.S. , where the Federal Reserve has extended unprecedented support to private markets .
…
China ’s methods for pumping cash into the economy are quite different from those of other major economies .
Its banks , almost all of which are state - owned , made more than three times as many new loans in the first quarter as a year earlier .
Central banks in the U.S. , Europe and Japan lack such control over lending , and have instead used extremely low interest rates and direct purchases of securities to support credit .
Two .
China ’s fiscal deficit will be closer to 5 percent of GDP rather than 3 percent of GDP .
That ’s cause for celebration in my book .
Last fall I was worried that the desire to limit the fiscal deficit to three percent of GDP would mean that there was less to China ’s stimulus than met the eye ( or hit the presses ) .
I was wrong .
If the likely future losses on the rapid expansion of bank credit are combined with the direct fiscal stimulus , China almost certainly produced a bigger stimulus program than any other major economy .
Three .
China ’s current account surplus is now projected to fall in 2009 .
Exports still have n’t picked up -- and we now have data through the first five months of the year .
Imports by contrast are starting to pick up .
That shows up clearly in a chart of real imports and real exports , a chart that draws on data that that the World Bank ’s Beijing office generously supplied me :
Some of that is commodity stockpiling and thus not a reflection of underlining demand .
And some stockpiling sounds a lot like simple speculation .
But let ’s set those debates aside for a bit .
In dollar terms , China ’s 2009 current account surplus will be a bit smaller than its 2008 surplus ( The World Bank assumes that China ’s trade surplus in the last half of 09 to be significantly smaller than its surplus in 08 , as the surplus was up in the first five months of 09 ) .
And since the fall in commodity prices would be expected to push the surplus up , all other things being equal , that indicates a real shift in net exports .
Net exports , according to Dr. Kuijs of the Bank ’s Beijing office , will subtract about 2.5 % from China ’s overall GDP growth in 2009 .
The not - so - good news :
One .
It is n’t clear that China has put in place policies that will bring about a sustained rise in domestic consumption .
The stimulus has worked by pumping up investment , especially state investment .
And investment already loomed large in the national accounts .
Olivier Blanchard :
“ In response to the crisis , China has embarked on a major fiscal expansion , with a focus on investment rather than on consumption .
This was the right policy given the need to increase spending quickly , but this increase in investment can only last for a while .
The question is whether , as time passes , China will allow an increase in consumption . ”
Two .
The negative drag from net exports stems from a faster fall in real exports than in real imports , not a rise in real imports that exceeds the rise in real exports .
For the year , real exports are forecast to fall by 10 % and real imports by almost 5 % .
If China ’s exports fall faster than global demand , that opens up space that allows others to cut back less .
The alternative -- fast Chinese export growth amid a shrinking global economy -- would be a sure source of trouble .
But China still is n’t really acting as a locomotive for overall global demand growth .
Three : Real imports of manufactured goods are still down 16 % y/y .
The rebound in Chinese imports has been driven entirely by the rise in commodity imports ; real imports of primary products were up 17 % ( y/y ) in April .
Back in 2003 , when China was going through another lending boom , real imports of all kinds were up way more than they are now .
Of course , back in 2003 , China ’s export sector was also booming and that pulled in imports for the " processsing trade . "
The comparison is n’t perfect .
But it does highlight how different China ’s current lending and investment boom is from past lending and investment booms .
Part of the explanation for the weak rebound in Chinese demand for manufactures is no doubt weak demand for exports , and thus weak demand for imported components .
And part of it is that there is plenty of spare capacity in China to meet a surge in Chinese demand .
For say cars .
Chinese auto sales may top US auto sales this year – and China seems able to meet that rise in demand without importing a lot of finished cars or auto parts .
But part of it seems to be that Chinese consumers are less interested in Western -- or even Korean and Japanese -- brands .
Maybe Chinese consumers concluded that if foreign banks were n’t better than Chinese banks , they should n’t assume that foreign goods were better than Chinese goods .
And China ’s government also seems particularly keen on making sure China ’s stimulus is spent in China .
Jamil Anderlini reports : “ Beijing said government procurement must use only Chinese products or services unless they were not available within the country or could not be bought on reasonable commercial or legal terms . ”
Kind of risky for a country that still exports way more than it imports .
But it should n’t be a total surprise .
The usual argument for why China would keep its exchange rate undervalued even though the undervalued exchange rate meant that China was overpaying for foreign assets and thus would eventually take losses was that China needed to keep up Chinese employment , and this was a way to do so .
And do n’t forget , the undervalued renminbi has encouraged jobs through import substitution – not just the expansion of China ’s export sector .
China ’s has n’t been interested in undistorted trade ; it has been interested in using trade to support domestic activity in China .
It is n’t a huge jump then to see why China might want to make sure that its domestic stimulus creates , in the first instance , as many Chinese jobs as possible .
But it does suggest that China ’s commitment to say the G - 20 is limited .
Just giving China a seat at the international negotiating table wo n’t necessarily change China ’s policies .
All in all , I would say the good trumps the bad .
But real problems will come if China ’s buy China policy is still holding down Chinese demand for the world ’s goods when global demand for Chinese goods returns ; rising exports and still stagnant manufacturing imports from the world ’s biggest surplus country would n’t be terribly popular globally .
China is also courting trouble .
Recently  in the name of censoring pornography 
China blocked access to Google and demanded that computers sold in China come supplied with an Internet nanny filter called Green Dam Youth Escort , starting July 1 .
Green Dam can also be used to block politics , not just Playboy .
Once you start censoring the Web , you restrict the ability to imagine and innovate .
You are telling young Chinese that if they really want to explore , they need to go abroad .
We should be taking advantage .
Now is when we should be stapling a green card to the diploma of any foreign student who earns an advanced degree at any U.S. university , and we should be ending all H - 1B visa restrictions on knowledge workers who want to come here .
They would invent many more jobs than they would supplant .
The world ’s best brains are on sale .
Let ’s buy more !
Barrett argues that we should also use this crisis to : 1 ) require every state to benchmark their education standards against the best in the world , not the state next door ; 2 ) double the budgets for basic scientific research at the National Science Foundation , the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ; 3 ) lower the corporate tax rate ; 4 ) revamp Sarbanes - Oxley so that it is easier to start a small business ; 5 ) find a cost - effective way to extend health care to every American .
We need to do all we can now to get more brains connected to more capital to spawn more new companies faster .
As Jeff Immelt , the chief of General Electric , put it in a speech on Friday , this moment is “ an opportunity to turn financial adversity into national advantage , to launch innovations of lasting value to our country . ”
Sometimes , I worry , though , that what oil money is to Russia , our ability to print money is to America .
Look at the billions we just printed to bail out two dinosaurs : General Motors and Chrysler .
Lately , there has been way too much talk about minting dollars and too little about minting our next Thomas Edison , Bob Noyce , Steve Jobs , Bill Gates , Vint Cerf , Jerry Yang , Marc Andreessen , Sergey Brin , Bill Joy and Larry Page .
Adding to that list is the only stimulus that matters .
Otherwise , we ’re just Russia with a printing press .
It made big news yesterday when Erich “ Mancow ” Muller was waterboarded live on his radio show .
It happened to be on the one month anniversary of Sean Hannity ‘s offer to do the same to support the troops .
Of course , Hannity has not followed through on his word .
Keith Olbermann , showing what charity and support looks like , withdrew his offer to donate $ 1,000 per second to charity in Sean Hannity ’s name , calling him “ unnecessary . ”
Instead he decided to give $ 10,000 to charity in Mancow ’s name , even though Mancow only lasted around six seconds .

Steve Jobs had taken medical leave until the end of June
Apple boss Steve Jobs received a liver transplant about two months ago and is expected to return to work later this month , a US newspaper has reported .
The Wall Street Journal said the Apple chief executive would be returning to his job on schedule , but may initially work part - time .
Neither Mr Jobs nor a company spokeswoman confirmed the report , the newspaper said .
Mr Jobs ceased his normal management role more than five months ago .
In January , he announced that he was being treated for a " hormone imbalance " , and had been losing weight throughout 2008 .
Mr Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 .
He left in 1985 , before returning in 1997 and becoming full - time chief executive in 2000 .
He is seen to have played a crucial role in Apple 's growth .
The company 's share price has recently risen and fallen in step with rumours or news about his health .
He has already survived a pancreatic cancer that was diagnosed in 2004 .
The " darkest day in American business history " is coming , said Matthew DeBord in The Big Money via Reuters .
General Motors will likely file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on or about June 1 .
Yes , GM has been in a " limbo - like quasi - bankruptcy " for months , and , yes , the giant automaker has made its share of mistakes .
But this is a company that helped build America , so you'd " have a cold and mercenary character " not to be saddened by a GM bankruptcy .
This will be perhaps " the biggest and most - watched " bankruptcy filing in legal history , said Micheline Maynard and Michael J. de la Merced in The New York Times .
Splitting off GM 's good and bad assets -- so desirable brands like Chevrolet and Cadillac can be sold to a new company , while " less- attractive assets " stay in the old GM -- will be extremely complicated .
Auto workers may be losing jobs , but the GM bankruptcy " will be putting a lot of lawyers to work . "
True , but " bankruptcy is not a done deal , " said David Goldman in CNNMoney .
GM can still avoid Chapter 11 if it can convince its bondholders , who hold 40 percent of the company 's debt , to accept a smaller stake in the company -- say , 10 percent .
A GM bankruptcy could be a better deal for the bondholders , though , so they might be " willing to take that gamble . "
The little known island nation of Palau recently catapulted into the spotlight when it agreed to take 17 detainees from Guantanamo Bay .
We think the news may unexpectedly prompt outrage in Americans , who might prefer that their tax dollars be spent sending them to Palau instead .
At least , that ought to be their reaction– as soon as they figure out what and where Palau is .
The tiny island country is one of the world ’s youngest and smallest nations , with a population at around 21,000 people and having only just achieved its independence in 1994 .
It also happens to be an absolute paradise .
Those Gitmo prisoners just scored themselves a serious upgrade .
Although we doubt that the detainees will be free to enjoy the utopian delights that abound in Palau , it seems like a good opportunity to shine a light on what this enticing nation offers to travelers and expats - to - be .
Palau is made up of several islands and atolls , but most of the population lives on the islands of Angaur , Babeldaob , Koror , and Peleliu .
The latter three lie together within the same barrier reef , while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south .
The islands also enjoy an annual tropical climate without much variation throughout the year– just a steady , nice 75 - 85 degree ( F ) average .
In fact , the islands sit conveniently outside of the main typhoon zone , so unlike many islands along its latitude and region , typhoons and major storms are very rare .
All in all , Palau is n’t just another tropical island– it ’s a floating Garden of Eden .
Aside from living the relaxed life , Palau also offers a plethora of snorkeling , diving , fishing and ocean activities .
It also has an intriguing history .
Long before European contact , the islands were home to the oldest known burial ceremonies in Oceania .
Going back even further , there ’s evidence that the island was once inhabited by the same short , hobbit - like humans that archaeologists have discovered remains of on the nearby island of Java .
Mythical !
The good news is that it ’s very easy for American citizens to move in and out of Palau , since the nation keeps very close ties to the U.S. .
In fact , native Palauans are allowed to enter and leave the U.S. without visas or passports .
Enticed yet ?
With Palau in the news , it might not remain a secret for long .

Speaking at the recent Happiness and It's Causes conference in Sydney as part of a panel discussion on rage , Morton said she became a " warrior " .
She gave birth to two sons and , while she never hit her kids , was physically violent to the men in her life .
" Violence and abuse was part of my emotional dialogue , " Morton said .
" Desperation " motivated the young single mum to check into a Queensland clinic where she embarked on " years of therapy " .
" I still get angry ... and I 'm certainly in no danger of becoming a saint , but when I get angry I 'm better at asserting my needs , " Morton said .
She went on to establish the Emotional Fitness Foundation to help other people deal with rage and related issues .
She says a diverse range of clients visit her Brisbane clinic , from street kids and sex workers to barristers and elite athletes .
But not all anger is bad .
Morton says it is " a necessity of life ... it's an alarm system to let us know that our boundaries have been crossed " .
Tom Denson , a psychology lecturer at the University of NSW who researches rage , agrees .
Everyone gets angry , he told the conference .
" Animals get angry , it 's just part of our nature ... in our evolutionary past it was generally successful , it helped you secure resources and pass on your genes . "
It 's when anger boils over into rage , which Denson describes as " behaviour with the intent to harm another person " , that problems arise .
Dr Denson , originally from California , says stewing over things is a recipe for problems .
" It makes you lose control , " he told the audience .
" If you can do something distracting to calm yourself down , something as easy as cleaning the apartment ... or doing a crossword puzzle , something that takes your mind off things , you feel a lot better . "
Dr Denson said twin studies had found controlled anger was a 50 - 50 combination of nature and nurture and people prone to anger could " re-learn new ways of behaving " .
" I do n't really see human nature as being inherently good or evil , I think situations can determine to what extent we 'll do good and bad things , " he said .
Morton said people who have n't experienced trauma make the mistake of labelling fiery people as " drama queens " .
" When you have a physical ailment like a migraine or a toothache it is all - consuming ... when you 've got emotional trauma and it's not been dealt with you 're in a hyper - sensitive state , " she said .
Morton has learnt to cope with her rage through daily meditation and " self - love " .
But she admits there is still one thing that will see her inner " warrior " emerge .
" If you touch my children or threaten my children I 'd kill somebody in a heartbeat .
" You could lock me up and I would be happy and peaceful that I protected my children , whether that 's wrong , I 'm not interested . "
Do n't stew over things , distract yourself if you 're feeling mad

History records that the Chinese were the first to invent the rocket , back in the 1200s under the Song Dynasty .
But the Americans were the first to perfect it , with Robert Goddard kicking off the modern era of rocketry in the 1910s and 1920s , and the German military further refining the technology in the crucible of World War II .
But the spectacular highlight of the rocket era was the Apollo 11 mission , when three Americans rode the largest rocket ever built by the US to the moon .
On the morning of July 16 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong , Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin , and Michael Collins laid on their backs in Columbia , the command module that topped the Saturn V rocket SA - 506 that was to take them from their terrestrial confines into lunar orbit .
On July 20th , 1969 — 40 years ago today — Armstrong and Aldrin descended from lunar orbit to the moon 's surface in the Eagle lunar module and became the first two humans to ever set foot on another celestial body .
I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth .
The moon has always played a large role in civilization .
A rock carving found in Ireland , dating to around 3000 BC is believed to be the first known human depiction of the moon .
Often playing the mythological counterpart to the Sun , a number of ancient and prehistoric cultures viewed the moon as a deity to be worshiped .
The Greeks , specifically Anaxagoras , were the first to correctly hypothesize the nature of the moon as a large spherical rock — although this was also how Anaxagoras described the Sun .
The idea of humans making the voyage from the Earth to the Moon is known to exist in ancient Indian myths , and is found in written form first in 120 AD in the manuscript titled True Histories , written by a Syrian named Lucian .
Because the ancients lacked the ability to even fly over the surface of the Earth , any trips to other heavenly bodies were purely in the realm of fantasy .
And though powered human flight was not technologically achievable until the Wright brother 's historic flight in Kitty Hawk , NC , it did not stop authors and wonderers from dreaming of what may lie beyond the Earthly sphere and await us elsewhere in the heavens .
Leaving the Earth was a little closer after Orville and Wilbur 's historic flight , but only just a little — the flight traveled for a total of 120 feet and attained an altitude of about 10 feet above sea level .
Modern rocketry

While many focused on advancing the theory and engineering of airplanes and powered flight , others were thinking about the use of rockets for travel through the cosmos .
As would be the case for the several decades following the achievement at Kitty Hawk , the major work in the field came out of Russia .
In 1903 , the same year as the Wright brother 's flight , Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , a Russian mathematics teacher , published The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices , in which he derived the basic theory and principles of rocket science .
His work was unknown outside of Russia , and it was the American Robert Goddard who made the fundamental leap to the era of modern rocketry .
Goddard changed the core propulsion technique from the solid engine - propelled rockets of antiquity to a liquid propulsion system where the exhaust gases were forced through a De Laval nozzle .
The first modern liquid - fueled rocket was launched by Goddard in 1926 in Massachusetts .
In the 1930s , advances in engine designs were made , rocket cars were built and raced , and the first rocket - powered plane was flown .
Work in Russia , Austria , Germany , and the United States advanced the hobby to a science .
One of the most important amateur groups was the German Verein f?r Raumschiffahrt — the German Rocket Society .
This group launched its first liquid - fuel - based rocket four years after its inception in 1931 .
As Germany 's war machine ramped up in the 1930s , a trio of members from this group were recruited to work for the Wermacht , most notably among them Wernher von Braun .
Over the course of World War II , German rocket scientists built a series of increasingly larger rockets .
This work culminated in the design and production of the V - 2 rocket — the first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital space flight .
During the course of the war , the Germans launched about 3,000 V - 2s at Allied military and civilian targets .
While not accurate enough for specific strikes against military targets , the V - 2 was leaps and bounds beyond the Allies ' capabilities in this area .
Given the advanced state of the German rocket program , rounding up rocket scientists and capturing equipment became a key objective for Allied forces shortly after VE day .
The United States ' Operation Paperclip was one of the most successful of these operations , and the US recruited a number of high - level scientists ( including Wernher von Braun ) and a number of complete and incomplete V - 2 rockets .
These weapons of war would be taken back to the US and used as research and test vehicles .
The V - 2 and related technology brought back from Germany allowed von Braun and other German and US researchers to design and construct the Redstone missile — the booster that took Alan Shepard into a sub-orbital flight in 1961 , making him the first American in space .
While Operation Paperclip may have brought a large number of top German rocket specialists to the US , it was the USSR who would routinely make headlines by being the first to achieve a number of major space exploration advancements — often catching the US with its pants down .
In 1957 , as part of the International Geophysical Year , the USSR launched the first ever artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 .
Launched atop an R - 7 missile — the world 's first intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) — Sputnik orbited the planet emitting signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz , signals that anyone in the world with an amateur radio could listen in on .
Space race
The launch of Sputnik marked the unofficial start of the space race between the US and the USSR .
Named as an analogy for the nuclear arms race between the two countries , the space race became a point of pride and indirect competition in the escalating Cold War .
The urgency for the US to actually enter the space race increased when , a month after the launch of Sputnik 1 , the USSR launched Sputnik 2 , which carried scientific equipment along with the first living creature to be put into orbit — a dog named Laika .
Coupled with the very public failure of Vanguard TV3 , the US desperately needed to get out of the starting block in the race .
The US finally got off the ground with the launch of Explorer 1 in February of 1958 .
After an exchange in various satellite launches between the US and the USSR over the next two years , the USSR once again stunned the world with the launch of Vostok 1 , and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human to ever visit space on April 12 , 1961 .
The US again found itself playing catch - up — Gagarin had spent 108 minutes in orbit , US astronauts had spent none .
Less than one month later , on May 5 , 1961 , US astronaut Alan Shepard , aboard Freedom 7 , became the first American in space .
While Freedom 7 was the first manned Mercury mission , it did not get Shepard into orbit .
The suborbital flight lasted a total of 16 minutes .
Twenty days later , President Kennedy addressed a joint session of Congress where he laid out his challenge to them and to the people of America .
" First , I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth .
No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important in the long - range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . "
At the time of President Kennedy 's challenge , the American space program had a sum total of 16 minutes in space , it had never put a man in orbit , had never seen an astronaut get out of a spacecraft , and had no spacecraft capable of even getting close to the moon .
To meet this challenge , American scientists , engineers , and workers had just under nine years to invent , test , and deploy technology that had not yet even been given serious thought .
Over the next five and a half years , one of the most rapid paces of technological development in history occurred .
Projects Mercury and Gemini cleared a number of technological hurdles — spacewalks , multi-man spacecraft , rendezvous and docking of craft in orbit , and long - duration flights — even though the USSR had accomplished many of these first .
To get to the moon would require the power of the massive Saturn rocket boosters — rockets developed at the Marshall Spaceflight Center headed up by Wernher von Braun .
America 's space program proceeded uninhibited until the tragedy on the launch pad during a routine test for the Apollo 1 mission .
A fire in the command module on January 27 , 1967 took the lives of Gus Grissom , Ed White , and Roger Chaffee , and threatened to derail the US ' goal of reaching the moon by the end of the decade .
After 20 months of investigation and a re-design of the command module , Apollo 7 demonstrated that Apollo technology was ready for the next big leap .
Just before Christmas of 1968 , Apollo 8 put three American Astronauts into lunar orbit , officially leapfrogging the Russians in space achievements .
Apollo 9 proved that the lunar module could indeed fly in space , if only in Earth orbit .
Apollo 10 would take and fly the lunar module in actual lunar orbit .
During that flight , commander Tom Stafford and lunar module pilot Eugene Cernan would fly their lunar module , Snoopy , to within an altitude of 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface .

Who needs the Waldorf ?
A wealthy inmate was allowed to host a lavish bar mitzvah behind bars for his son at the downtown lockup known as the Tombs , The Post has learned .
The proud papa , Tuvia Stern , is a financial - scam artist who jumped bail and spent nearly 20 years on the lam .
City Correction
Department officials permitted him to use his own caterer , who supplied kosher food , china , forks — and knives — for about 60 guests who partied and danced the hora for six hours in the jailhouse gym .
Stern ’s family and friends were allowed to keep their cellphones — normally a huge security no - no .
And Stern was given the OK to dress in clothing appropriate for the occasion .
The guest list at the jail included several prominent rabbis as well as Yaakov Shwekey , a popular Orthodox singer , and a band .
The city threw in its own present — overtime pay for the correction officers staffing the soiree .
The Dec. 30 bash was so successful that jailbird Stern chose the same venue four months later for his daughter Breindy ’s engagement party for 10 family members , sources said .
Shame - faced Correction officials yesterday quietly disciplined five top employees , including a rabbi and an imam , for signing off on the bar mitzvah .
“ I ’ve never seen , in my career , anything as stupid as this , ” said a Department of Correction insider about the bar mitzvah , which was permitted over the objections of at least one jail official .
“ It ’s outrageous what transpired . ”
Correction Commissioner Martin Horn was “ livid ” and “ views the events as a spectacularly gross error of judgment up and down the command chain , ” said a department source .
Horn suspended Rabbi Leib Glanz , the correction chaplain who arranged the bar mitzvah , for two weeks .
Four other officials were stripped of two weeks of vacation .
They include the assistant commissioner for ministerial services , Imam Umar Abdul - Jamil .
Abdul - Jamil had been suspended for two weeks in 2006 after The Post revealed that he had given a speech referring to “ Zionists of the media ” and “ terrorists ” in the White House .
The other department officials losing vacation pay are Tombs warden George Okada , and two chiefs , Peter Curcio and Frank Squillante .
Department spokesman Stephen Morello said only that Horn “ took immediate disciplinary action ” after an internal probe was completed .
A source said all Jewish inmates were moved out of the Tombs yesterday for unknown reasons .
Stern , a Brooklyn native who had been a fugitive in Brazil for nearly two decades , was shipped to an upstate prison days after the engagement party to begin a sentence for bail jumping and grand larceny .
He went on the lam in 1989 after he was busted for swindling $ 1.7 million .
Glanz and Abdul - Jamil both declined to comment .
The other three officials could not be reached .

Google is set to challenge online retail giant Amazon by selling contemporary electronic books .
And unlike Amazon , it will let publishers set the prices .
The move is a new development for the Google Book Search scheme , in which the firm scans texts so that users can search for particular phrases .
While Google does intend to bring in paid access for full editions of some books covered by Book Search , the vast majority of titles in the scheme are either out of print or out of copyright .
At the moment , most modern books included in the scheme only have 20 per cent of their pages available for searching .
If a reader does want to buy the book , they are given a link to the relevant pages for both print and electronic editions at other sites such as Amazon or Barnes and Noble .
No Kindle Needed
Under the new scheme , publishers can make such books eligible for sale in electronic editions through Google .

Difference between Google Books vs Amazon Kindle
The biggest difference between this and what Amazon offers will be the ability for publishers to set their own prices .
When it comes to Amazon 's Kindle , the publisher sets the wholesale price ( the amount they receive from Amazon per sale ) and Amazon then sets the retail price -- often at a loss for Amazon .
Google says it will allow publishers to set the retail price at any level , though it reserves the right to lower ' exorbitant ' prices .
While the firm did n't explicitly say so , it appears Google will take a percentage of the designated price , too .

You know what 's awesome ?
Playing Left 4 Dead with the writer of Portal .
You 're not here to read my smug little boasts , however , you 're here to read a preview of Left 4 Dead 2 .
We were at Valve Software this past week to check the game out ( as well as some other stuff ) , giving the " Swamp Fever " campaign a close and detailed look .
You 've likely heard about this Louisiana - themed stage quite a bit , and now you get to hear some more .
What 's it like playing as characters that are n't Bill , Zoey , Francis and Louis ?
Just how dangerous are the new Special Infected ?
Why is incendiary ammo so much fun ?
All this and more will be revealed in our preview of Left 4 Dead 2 .
Left 4 Dead 2 ( Xbox 360 , PC )
Developer : Valve Software
Publisher : Valve Software
To be released : TBA
The campaign starts as any Left 4 Dead campaign should , with the usual kitting up in the middle of the Louisiana swamps .
I tried out both the new shotgun and submachine gun to get a feel for the changes .
The shotty seems to be a tiny bit improved from the original game , while the rapid - fire weapon now feels a little more unwieldy , more of a " spray and pray " type of firearm .
Almost as soon as the campaign begins , we 're greeted by our old friend , The Witch .
As you may have heard , The Witch has been re-tooled this time around , acting differently depending on whether it 's day or night .
Since " Swamp Fever " is set in the evening , she 's back to her familiar self , weeping on the floor and glowing a menacing red .
Easily avoided in this rather open area .
While Left 4 Dead 2 is still grounded in linearity , it feels less restricted in where you can venture .
There are also multiple routes and branching paths at various points , helping to keep things interesting .
As the Infected attacked , I had to sit back and regard just how much scarier they are this time around .
The Southern clothing somehow seems to make them look even creepier , most likely thanks to the fact that rednecks are pretty terrifying in their own right , not to mention zombie rednecks .
Some wear overalls , some have no shirts on , some look like white trash .
All of them look unnervingly spooky .
It was n't long before The Charger made his first appearance .
He 's something of a shock trooper .
Not exactly the guy that will turn the tide of battle in the Infected 's favor , but his sudden appearances and ability to completely bullrush the team keeps you on your toes .
He managed to grab one of our numbers and push him to the ground before hammering away at the poor guy .
He was quick to put down , but he managed to do some significant damage .
As we picked our way through the abandoned houses , we came upon some incendiary ammo .
This provided a temporary upgrade to our main weapons , setting on fire any Infected that we see .
While it does n't last an incredibly long time , it 's great fun to use .
However , caution is advised , as a crowd of flaming Infected obscures vision and one can never quite tell if you 've managed to kill them or not .
I also got my hands on a melee weapon , something that had eluded me when I played the game at E3 .
Armed with a trusty frying pan , I was pleased to see that melee weapons were very useful and fun without being overpowering .
You can't just pick up a frying pan and then batter your way from beginning to end .
It 's still much more useful to rely on firearms most of the time , but it 's a good way to conserve ammo , and can get you out of a tight spot .
It also makes a hilarious clanging noise .
As the level progressed , I was able to ditch the frying pan for an axe , which is more of a precise weapon .
Swinging it at the right location does specific area damage to the Infected , meaning you can lop off a leg , an arm or even a head with the right swing .
With a little help from a Charger and some lucky Infected , Rochelle was taken out , leaving us with only three Survivors .
We got our first glimpse of banter upon Rochelle 's death , with a disappointed Nick looking at the corpse and saying , " So much for repopulating the Earth . "
After I used my health pack and then discovering that Rochelle 's own health pack had been flung into the swamp , out of reach , I moved on .
Eventually , we came to a ferry that we had to call across the water .
Naturally , of course , this was a Horde Event , and we prepared to stand out ground , choosing the roof of an old shack as our position .
At first , things were going decently , but then The Spitter arrived .
The Spitter is the difference maker as far as The Infected goes , an undead horde 's ace in the hole .
Gone are the days when Survivors could just camp out in a corner , melee attacking anything that comes along .
Doing so now will lead to death .
In case you do n't already know , The Spitter spews up a big ball of corrosive acid that causes splash damage wherever it hits .
Once it explodes , the surrounding area is coated with acid and any Survivors caught standing on it will take damage fast .
It dramatically changes Horde events , with teams needing to scatter and then regroup , making for a much more tense experience .
By the way , you 've no doubt seen The Spitter in concept art form , and she looks incredibly creepy .
However , the way she moves is even worse .
Staggering about with her arms bent like some sort of zombie dinosaur in heels , she is by far the most twisted Special Infected yet designed .
The Horde is eventually put down , the ferry arrives , we cross the river , and rescue Rochelle .
Now we have to trek through the swamps , which slows the group down .
Walking in the water dramatically reduces your pace , and you feel so much more vulnerable when stuck in the swamp .
This is made worse by the fast - paced Mud Men , four - legged " Common Uncommon " that splash mud in your eyes , temporarily blinding you .
Fortune smiles upon me when I lay hands on the AK - 47 .
It 's very similar of course to the Assault Rifle , but everybody knows AKs are cooler .
This helped me during the final Event , as we defended a crashed plane from a ravening Horde .
Soon enough , a Spitter turned up and doused the plane in delicious acid , forcing us all to bail and break apart .
It was a close - won fight , but we escaped through the skin of our teeth , and the demo ended .
Left 4 Dead 2 is , at its core , more of the same .
This you could probably already tell .
However , the changes in place are more than enough to create a game that feels unique in its own right .
The new Infected are immensely fun to tackle , and additions like incendiary ammo and melee weapons are subtle , but very welcome .
If you loved the first game and you 're not planning on playing this , you 're an idiot .
It 's just that simple .
As president , Barack Obama mentions Jesus Christ in a number of high - profile public speeches .
Obama invokes Jesus more than Bush
He ’s done it while talking about abortion and the Middle East , even the economy .
The references serve at once as an affirmation of his faith and a rebuke against a rumor that persists for some to this day .
As president , Barack Obama has mentioned Jesus Christ in a number of high - profile public speeches — something his predecessor George W. Bush rarely did in such settings , even though Bush ’s Christian faith was at the core of his political identity .

In his speech Thursday in Cairo , Obama told the crowd that he is a Christian and mentioned the Islamic story of Isra , in which Moses , Jesus and Mohammed joined in prayer .
At the University of Notre Dame on May 17 , Obama talked about the good works he ’d seen done by Christian community groups in Chicago .
“ I found myself drawn — not just to work with the church but to be in the church , ” Obama said .
“ It was through this service that I was brought to Christ . ”
And a month before that , Obama mentioned Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount at Georgetown University to make the case for his economic policies .
Obama retold the story of two men , one who built his house on a pile of sand and the other who built his on a rock : “ We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand , ” Obama said .
“ We must build our house upon a rock . ”
More than four months into the Obama presidency , a picture is emerging of a chief executive who is comfortable with public displays of his religion — although he has also paid tribute to other faiths and those he called “ nonbelievers ” during his inaugural address .
Obama ’s invocation of the Christian Messiah is more overt than Americans heard in the public rhetoric of Bush in his time in the White House — even though Bush ’s victories were powered in part by evangelical voters .
“ I do n’t recall a single example of Bush as president ever saying , ‘ Jesus ’ or ‘ Christ , ’ ” said Tony Perkins , president of the conservative Christian group Family Research Council .
“ This is different . ”
To Perkins , Obama ’s overtly Christian rhetoric is a welcome development from an administration that he largely disagrees with on the issues , though Perkins sees a political motive behind it , as well .
“ I applaud that .
It gives people a sense of comfort , ” Perkins said .
“ But I think it ’s a veneer , a facade that covers over a lot of policies that are anti-Christian . ”
That includes , in his view , Obama ’s stance in favor of abortion rights .
The Rev. Barry Lynn , the executive director of the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State , does n’t like the trend with Obama : “ I do n’t need to hear politicians tell me how religious they are , ” Lynn said .
“ Obama in a very overt way does what Bush tended to do in a more covert way . ”
Obama ’s public embrace of his Christianity so far has not included choosing a church in the capital .
Since taking office , he has attended Sunday services in Washington just once , on Easter Sunday .
The White House said at the time the family was still looking for a spiritual home .
White House officials say the president also has attended church services at Camp David , but could not say how many times .
But inside his White House , Obama has placed his Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships — run by a 26 - year old Pentecostal minister named Josh DuBois — under the White House ’s Domestic Policy Council .
That was widely seen as an effort to involve a religious perspective in the administration ’s policy decisions .
Also , religious leaders meet with White House policymakers on a regular basis — and help to shape decisions on matters large and small .
A White House speechwriter working on Obama ’s Egypt speech called several faith leaders to get their thoughts .
After the White House unveiled its budget in April , officials convened a two - hour conference call with religious leaders to discuss how the spending plan would help the poor .
“ President Obama is a committed Christian , and he ’s being true to who he is , ” DuBois told POLITICO .
“ There ’s an appropriate role for faith in public life , and his remarks reflect that .
And they also reflect a spirit of inclusivity that recognizes that we are a nation with a range of different religious backgrounds and traditions . ”
Still , it is ironic that Obama , who rode a wave of young , Internet - savvy and more secular voters to the White House , would more freely invoke the name of Jesus Christ than did Bush .
In his first year as president , Bush mentioned “ Jesus ” or “ Christ ” a handful of times — but only in innocuous contexts , such as his Easter proclamation , a Christmas message and a proclamation on “ Salvation Army Week . ”
To be sure , Bush talked openly about his faith .
On the day of his second inauguration as governor of Texas , Bush reportedly told Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention , “ I believe that God wants me to be president . ”
As a Texas governor running for president , Bush declared in a presidential debate that the philosopher he most identified with was Jesus .
And in an interview for Bob Woodward ’s 2004 book “ Plan of Attack , ” Bush was asked whether he ’d talked to his father , the President George H.W. Bush , about the decision to invade Iraq .
“ There is a higher father that I appeal to , ” Bush said .
But there are different political imperatives driving the two presidents .
Obama has every incentive to broadcast his Christianity , while Bush , for other reasons , chose to narrowcast his religious references to a targeted audience .
For Obama , Christian rhetoric offers an opportunity to connect with a broader base of supporters in a nation in which 83 percent of Americans believe in God .
What ’s more , regularly invoking Jesus helps Obama minimize the number of American who believe he is a Muslim — a linkage that can be politically damaging .
According to a Pew Research Center study , 11 percent of Americans believe , incorrectly , that Obama is a Muslim ; it ’s a number that is virtually unchanged from the 2008 presidential campaign .
Yet Obama has targeted his messages , too .
He used speeches in Turkey and last week in Egypt to highlight the Muslim relatives in his past as a way to draw a connection with his Muslim audiences — something he shied away from during his presidential campaign .
For Bush , invoking Jesus publicly was fraught with political risk .
He was so closely politically identified with the Christian right that overt talk of Christ from the White House risked alienating mainstream and secular voters .
Bush instead quoted passages from scripture or Christian hymns , as he did in his 2003 State of the Union Address when he used the phrase “ wonder - working power . ”
That sort of oblique reference resonated deeply with evangelical Christians but sailed largely unnoticed past secular voters .
To some , the difference between the two presidents goes beyond rhetoric .
David Kuo , a former official in Bush ’s faith - based office who later became disillusioned with the president he served , worries that both men have exploited religious phraseology for political gain .
“ From a spiritual perspective , that ’s a great and grave danger , ” he said .
“ When God becomes identified with a political agenda , God gets screwed . ”
And he suspects that Obama has an even larger goal : the resurrection of the largely dormant Christian Left , a tradition that encompasses Martin Luther King ’s civil rights leadership and dates back as far as Dorothy Day , the liberal activist who co-founded the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s .
Recast in 21st Century terms , that long - dormant stream of American political life could become a powerful political force .
A Pew survey released May 21 found that even as Americans remain highly religious , there has there been a slow decline in the number of Americans with socially conservative values – especially among young voters .
That creates an opening for Obama , especially at a time when some conservative evangelicals are telling pollsters they are frustrated and disillusioned with politics .
“ In the long term , this could be huge , ” said Stephen Schneck , director of the Life Cycle Institute at The Catholic University of America , who is active in left - leaning political efforts .
“ There are swing Catholics and swing Protestants even within the evangelicals .
To the extent Obama can mobilize those people as part of a new Democratic coalition , that marginalizes Republicans even further . ”
Zachary Abrahamson contributed to this story .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story said President Obama has only gone to church services once since being elected president .
White House officials say he also has attended services at Camp David , but could not say how many times .
When Dorothy Stutzman was 5 , she began a habit that would carry her through most of her life : Sunday school at the West Olive United Methodist Church in Bloomington , Ill .
" My parents said ' go , ' and I went , " recalled Ms. Stuzman .
It was that simple .
Ms. Stutzman went on to teach Sunday school at West Olive Methodist for more than 50 years .
She loved telling Bible stories , putting on little skits and befriending kids who did n't have it so easy at home .
A few years ago , however , West Olive was forced to pull the plug on Sunday ...
For example , arthropods all have chitinous exoskeleton , hemocoel , and jointed legs .
Insects have all these plus head - thorax - abdomen body plan and 6 legs .
Flies have all that plus two wings and halteres .
Calypterate flies have all that plus a certain style of antennae , wing veins , and sutures on the face and back .
You will never find the distinguishing features of calypterate flies on a non-fly , much less on a non-insect or non-arthropod .
Dogs are another example .
There should be species we would group with dogs , and there are - such as wolves and coyotes .
So we are not surprised when dogs and foxes turn out to share some peculiar features of the middle ear .
This group - the Family Canidae - can be grouped with the bears , raccoons and weasels , because their ears have some similarities to those of dogs .
All of these have carnassial teeth , but so do cats , civets and seals - so we group the entire lot as being Order Carnivora .
Carnivores all have 3 middle ear bones , mammary glands , placental development , hair , a diaphragm , a four - chambered heart , and a larynx .
But they share those features with humans , bats , elephants and whales .
So we group that entire lot as being Class Mammalia .
But mammals have amniote eggs , and so do birds , lizards , snakes and turtles .
And amniote animals share with frogs and salamanders the property of having four legs - they 're tetrapods .
Tetrapods and fish both have backbones - they 're vertebrates .
Vertebrates and starfish are both deuterostomes because they share the way their embryos develop a mouth .
Deuterostomes are left - right symmetric , so we group them and insects and snails as bilateral .
The bilaterals , the jellyfish and sponges are all animals .
Animals , fungi , rose bushes and amoebas all have a nucleus inside each cell - they 're eukaryotes .
Eukaryotes and bacteria and archaea share the DNA mechanism , lipid - based cell membranes , and hundreds of other biochemical details .
( And that 's the short version of the story !
For all the fancy Latin names , see the Tree of Life . )
Notice that the dog - to - bacteria story has some apparent irregularities .
For example , I said that elephants and whales are mammals , and that mammals have hair .
It is not obvious , but elephants and whales do have a small amount of hair .
Also , scientists group whales and snakes as tetrapods .
So where are their four legs ?
From the theory of Common Descent , we see that they must be descended from four - legged creatures , and that they have lost their legs .
( Loss is an easy mutation - as witness hairless dogs . )
So , we predict that there should be fossils of whales with legs , and snakes with legs .
These fossils have been found .
Similarly , starfish outwardly have radial symmetry , but we classified them as bilateral .
So Common Descent predicts that their group ( echinoderms ) had bilateral ancestors , and such a fossil has been found .
Holiday ’s always special for every ones .
Holidays are the perfect time to plan a great party with friends and family members .
Holiday parties do take a little extra bit of planning and preparation , so checklists and endurance are a must .
To make great party time need to be considering professional party planners .
Party like one time enjoyment , so party need to be best one .
We as a people just appear to have a lot of holidays on our calendars , and therefore we 've get a vast reason to have lots of parties .
The coolest thing about holiday parties is that the holidays are always quite diverse and really lend themselves to different themes and arrangement .
Holidays that fall in the summer months tend to lean toward outdoor barbeques while winter holidays would more than likely be an indoor party .
Holidays like Thanksgiving would most likely be a sit down dinner party with Turkey and lots of fixings .
Now Christmas time very near and Christmas party can be simply a stand up cocktail party .
The party planning for the diverse holidays is n't really very unusual even though the result may be fairly different .
Party Rentals or Party Planners have a master checklist .
You 'll still need to do party budgeting , plan a menu , pick a venue , develop a guest list , ensure that you have enough supplies , etc .
All of this while you still need to plan for the regular holiday .
Christmas Party Planning , or birthdays party rentals for example , will require shopping for presents and gifts as well as decorating the house for the holiday .
Holidays and special events can become a bit overwhelming and it may make good sense to get some assistance from a professional party planner .
The easy part of holiday party planning is that the theme is already selected for you as well as the standard sustaining decorations , and maybe even the menu .
But , one should usually try to find a way to make the event unique to you and your guests .
You may want to pick some new and appealing activities to assist make your party different from all of the other parties going on throughout the similar holiday period .
Perchance you can find a really stunning invitation rather than send the same old thing that everybody else is sending .
Party favors are an additional way you can truthfully differentiate your party from all the others .
If your party is around a gift giving season like Christmas or Chanukah , possibly your invitation can be included into a small party goodwill that can be send to the homes of your guests prior to the party .
Perhaps you can find a brilliant art party planner who can make invitations to your Thanksgiving dinner look like something different .
Holidays are so much fun loving because you can let your imagination run feral and no one is going to make fun of you .
When all is said and done the purpose of throwing a party is to let people have fun and have a memorable time .
It 's usually a time of year when a " break " is quite welcome and you can be the person that gives all of your friends and family the break that remains a part of their memories for years to come .
Fleet Foxes ' self titled album was considered by Pitchfork and many other music critics to be the best album of 2008 .
Interestingly , Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold says the band could not have made the album without the inspiration he got from the hundreds of albums he pirated over the years .
After their successful debut album Fleet Foxes ’ singer Robin Pecknold immediately made it clear that he dislikes the corporate greed that surrounds the major record labels .
“ Fleet Foxes will never , ever , under no circumstances , from now until the world chokes on gas fumes , sign to a major label , ” Pecknold wrote in a blog post after the rumor spread that they ’ve signed up with a major record label .
According to Pecknold the major labels seem to be anti-music .
What really helped him and other bands to shape their sound and spark their creativity is file - sharing .
“ That was how I was exposed to almost all of the music that I love to this day , and still that ’s the easiest way to find really obscure stuff , ” he told the BBC .
“ I ’ve discovered so much music through that medium .
That will be true of any artist my age , absolutely , ” Pecknold added .
He explained that he is not the only musician to have benefited from ‘ stealing ’ music , as the major labels like to call it .
Having access to an unlimited library of music only makes a musician better .

Indeed , many BitTorrent trackers dedicated to music are populated by thousands of artists , who share their own work and that of others .
Most famously , Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor was a proud member of the now defunct OiNK tracker .
Pecknold is no different , and he recalls the finesse of his own music changing for the better after his dad brought home a modem to connect the family to the Internet – a candy store for the modern age musician .
And if the fans want to share their latest album he ’s totally fine with that .
“ I ’ve downloaded hundreds and hundreds of records – why would I care if somebody downloads ours ?
That ’s such a petty thing to care about .
I mean , how much money does one person need ?
I think it ’s disgusting when people complain about that , personally , ” he admitted .
The labels have a different view on the piracy issue of course , claiming that they lose billions of dollars because of it .
Most people know by now that this is far from the truth .
However , after chasing down music fans in court they are now starting to lose respect among musicians .
While they still might be able to successfully market a kid star here and there , most artists do n’t really need a label to distribute music in the digital age .
BitTorrent does that just fine , right Robin ?
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Two days after the death of Michael Jackson , the family of the pop superstar thanked his fans for their condolences and support in " one of the darkest moments of our lives . "
A girl holds up signs in memory of Michael Jackson outside New York 's Apollo Theater on Saturday .
" Please do not despair , because Michael will continue to live on in each and every one of you , " family patriarch Joseph Jackson said in a statement to People magazine obtained by CNN .
" Continue to spread his message , because that is what he would want you to do .
Carry on , so his legacy will live forever , " the statement told fans .
" Our beloved son , brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly , in such a tragic way and much too soon , " the statement said .
" It leaves us , his family , speechless and devastated to a point , where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times . "
Watch how one fan mourns pop star »
Family members including Jackson 's mother , Katherine , were at the estate Jackson had rented in Holmby Hills .
Around midday , two moving vans pulled up .
One left empty , and the other apparently contained objects from the house .
Other vehicles came and went , including a silver Range Rover driven by a plain clothes police officer .
Meanwhile , the doctor who may have been the last person to see Michael Jackson alive was expected to meet with police Saturday along with his lawyer , an associate of attorney Ed Chernoff said .
Matthew Alford , an associate of Stradley , Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston , Texas , said Dr. Conrad Murray , who is represented by Chernoff , was upset but willing to cooperate .
Watch what Alford said about doctor 's involvement »
The ongoing meeting could spill into Sunday , according to the firm .
" It 's a human tragedy , and he 's upset obviously over the loss of Mr. Jackson .
But he is not a suspect in the death of Mr. Jackson , " Alford said .
" We intend to cooperate fully . "
Los Angeles police , who met briefly with Murray after Michael Jackson 's death , had been trying to set up an interview , Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Charlie Beck said .
" Is important to interview everybody that was in contact with Mr. Jackson immediately prior to his demise particularly anyone involved in his medical care , " Beck said .
" So it 's extremely important to talk to his doctor . "
Police said the doctor has been cooperating .
Jackson 's family suspects that Murray can answer some questions about the singer 's death , but they have been unable to contact him , the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday .
The parents need to know what happened in the last hours of Michael Jackson 's life , Jesse Jackson said .
" The routine inquiry is now an investigation , " Jesse Jackson said .
" They ( Jacksons ) did n't know the doctor .
...
He should have met with the family , given them comfort on the last hours of their son . "
Alford said Murray has " not been hiding out .
He 's just being prudent . "
Detectives impounded Murray 's car , which was parked at the singer 's rented home , because it may contain evidence related to Jackson 's death , possibly prescription medications .
Police have released no information on what they may have found .
Alford said he did not have any details .
" I have no information as to what if any treatment , or course of treatment he was doing for Mr. Jackson at all , " he said .
Michael Jackson died Thursday , and an autopsy was performed the following day .
A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner 's office told reporters Friday that more tests must be conducted before a cause of death can be determined .
That could take four to six weeks .
The coroner said there was no indication of external trauma or foul play .
Watch the coroner 's spokesman discuss the autopsy »
The 50 - year - old pop star was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home , where Murray apparently had tried to revive him .
He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center , where he was pronounced dead .
" They need an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead day before yesterday , " Jesse Jackson said .
Watch Jesse Jackson detail the family 's concerns »
There are lingering questions , such as : " How long had he stopped breathing ?
How long had he been unconscious ? " he said .
Jackson had been preparing for a comeback tour -- aimed at extending his legendary career and helping him to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt .
Jackson is survived by his three children , Prince Michael I , Paris and Prince Michael II .

A medic at Lister Hospital in Stevenage , Hertfordshire , has advised men against attempting DIY circumcision with nail clippers , after a young man who'd decided this was the best way to go roundhead was admitted for emergency treatment .
Staff disinfected the unnamed victim 's wound , and he was dispatched to an observation ward bed .
According to the Telegraph , the medic stressed : " This is something we would advise men never to attempt .
The results can be quite horrific and long - lasting and have quite an effect on a man 's sexual performance . "
Hinting at what had provoked the patient to treat his foreskin in such a cavalier fashion , the medic concluded : " Using a pair of nail clippers must have caused excruciating pain , even if he had had a few drinks beforehand . " ®
The debate over Net neutrality has quieted considerably since the Federal Communications Commission rebuked Comcast in August for its discriminatory handling of BitTorrent traffic .
Congress has been silent on the issue as one of the leading proponents of Net neutrality , Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) , has focused on cap - and - trade legislation to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
The FCC is still awaiting confirmation of President Obama 's pick for its chairman , Julius Genachowski , and has been preoccupied by the looming analog TV cutoff .
The new chairman of the Federal Trade Commission , Jon Leibowitz , has dropped hints about regulating broadband providers , but for the most part , whatever momentum that the Net neutrality drive had in 2007 and 2008 seems to have dissipated .
So when Obama brought up the issue today in a speech on cyber - security , it seemed like a bolt out of the blue .
Here 's the relevant excerpt :
" Let me also be clear about what we will not do .
Our pursuit of cyber - security will not -- I repeat , will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic .
We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as Americans .
Indeed , I remain firmly committed to net neutrality so we can keep the Internet as it should be -- open and free . "
This is n't a change for Obama -- he strongly endorsed Net neutrality during the presidential campaign .
And it 's consistent with some elements of the cyber - security strategy he laid out today , which emphasized ( in a striking contrast with the previous administration ) protecting individual liberties and privacy along with critical digital infrastructure .
On the other hand , such a regulatory impulse conflicted with another important tenet of Obama 's cyber - security initiative : that private companies will be free to choose how to protect themselves .
As Obama put it :
" The vast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the United States is owned and operated by the private sector .
So let me be very clear :
My administration will not dictate security standards for private companies .
On the contrary , we will collaborate with industry to find technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity . "
At any rate , it looks like the Net neutrality debate may be revving up again .
Let the lobbying begin !

Healey writes editorials for The Times ' Opinion Manufacturing Division .
Restrictions [ on free speech ] should never be used to protect particular institutions or abstract notions , concepts or beliefs , including religious ones .
Frank la Rue , the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to free expression , got a firm telling off by representatives of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Geneva last week .
His crime ?
To suggest that
And that
defamation of religions does not accord with international standards on freedom of expression
Enraged diplomats from Egypt ( on behalf of the African Group ) , United Arab Emirates ( on behalf of the Arab Group ) , Pakistan ( on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ) , and individual delegations such as Algeria , Egypt , Malaysia , Sudan and Yemen claimed that La Rue was overstepping the bounds of his mandate by saying such things .
Many of them threatened to have La Rue removed from his post if he did not conform to their interpretation of his mandate .
Roy Brown of the International Humanist and Ethical Union summed up ,
Mr LaRue ’s report was strongly supported in the Council by the United States , the United Kingdom and several NGOs who pointed out that under the terms of his mandate he was fully entitled to make recommendations to the Council and the UN without pressure or outside interference .
It is becoming intolerable that some states , unable to win arguments on their merits are now stooping to such blatant bully - boy tactics .
Allah forbid that an officer responsible for the protection of freedom of expression should be free to express his support for freedom of expression !
( Tip – Article 19 )
UPDATE : ( June 9 ) Read Roy Brown ’s full report here .
Larry Fowler figures that what works for car dealerships and furniture stores just might find work for an unemployed software engineer , so he 's laying out $ 1,500 to buy a series of radio ads touting his technical skills and achievements ... delivered in his own everyman voice .
After all , they say finding a job is an exercise in salesmanship .
The local newspaper has already bought Fowler 's pitch , publishing a front - page story about the Hopkinton , Mass .
resident and his radio gambit last Friday .
( Disclosure : Fowler is a neighbor of mine , although we 've met only once .
I did n't know he worked in IT until reading the story . )
His radio commercial can be heard here .
A self - employed consultant since 1984 , the 65 - year - old Fowler has served a who's who of industry and government clients , yet finds himself in the unfamiliar position of having to drum up work .
From that article :
He tried more traditional routes after his last job as a consultant ended a year ago .
He said at one time , he got almost nightly calls with job leads , but the phone has stopped ringing .
Fowler scoured the Internet for positions to no avail .
He enrolled in training sessions on giving interviews and finding jobs .
" I called all my friends and buddies , but everyone 's out of work or not hiring , " Fowler said .
I asked him a few questions of my own via e-mail , which seemed a bit odd given that we live on the same street .
Here 's that exchange :
When did the radio idea come to you and when did you really decide to follow through ?
I thought of the idea years ago but never really considered doing it until lately .
I am working with a coach to teach me interview techniques and resume writing , as I have survived on word of mouth , friends and colleagues and never really had to make a concerted job search .
I guess a long career never having to look for a job should be considered good , but now I am missing a few of the essentials .
What kind of work do you see yourself best suited for at this point ?
One thing I have learned is that programming is not about a language but a thought process .
This has enabled me to develop many interesting solutions to problems over the years , not all associated with programming .
I have worked as both an engineer and an engineering manager , both with a fair measure of success .
I 've also worked as a liaison between defense contractors and the military .
My work has been predominately but not exclusively associated with testing ; everything from designing the test system Boeing uses to certify their airplanes with the FAA to Internet switches and disk drives .
Many times I am hired to solve immediate last - minute design and development problems .
What kind of reaction are you expecting from the radio ad ?
I have no idea what to expect .
It has never been done before , as least not that anyone I know has heard of .
I am hoping someone will see the ad as a unique , creative and innovative solution to a problem and be interested in talking to someone who is able to approach problems in new ways .
Everyone I talked to initially thought the ad was a dumb idea but changed their minds after considering it for a while .
This included the radio station .
The one glaring omission in the newspaper story ( at least in my mind ) was this :
Do you believe your age is hampering your ability to find work ?
I think my age is a consideration for a permanent position ... for a consulting assignment it probably is n't .
Good luck , neighbor .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) -
Two spacewalking astronauts on Saturday tackled one of their toughest repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope -- a meticulous fix of a broken camera -- and installed a new spectrograph that can divine the properties of distant galaxies .

Astronauts John Grunsfeld and Andrew Feustel spent 6 - 1/2 hours outside the shuttle Atlantis for the third of five back - to - back spacewalks to upgrade the famous space observatory for another five to 10 years of work .
NASA officials had billed Saturday ’s spacewalk as the “ hold your breath ” day for Atlantis ’ ongoing 11 - day mission , the fifth and final servicing call to Hubble before the shuttle fleet is retired next year .
But Grunsfeld and Feustel ’s tasks came off without a hitch , after two earlier spacewalks were beset with balky equipment that required astronauts to improvise .
Thursday ’s installation of a new wide - field camera was almost derailed by a frozen bolt .
Saturday ’s work required Grunsfeld to clamber into Hubble ’s body , dig into its electronic guts and replace sharp - edged computer circuit boards that were never meant to be repaired in space .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
32 TINY FASTENERS
Working mostly by feel , Grunsfeld cut off a mesh grid , unscrewed a protective plate and used a specially designed pair of tongs to pluck out four circuit boards .
It was the first time that NASA had tried to fix an instrument on Hubble rather than replacing it .
“ This activity is dedicated to studying the behavior of tiny screws in space , ” Grunsfeld joked after removing 32 fasteners securing the faulty circuit boards in Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys , which shut down in 2007 after a power failure .
Hubble ’s observations have reshaped scientists ’ understanding of how galaxies form and change over time , of planet origins and of the mysterious “ dark energy ” force that is inflating the universe at a faster and faster rate .
To keep Hubble on the cutting edge of scientific discovery , it is being outfitted with two new instruments .
One is a panchromatic wide - field camera , installed on Thursday , which can see closer to the origins of the universe .
The other is the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph , installed on Saturday , which replaces a package of mirrors that was installed in the telescope in 1993 to correct for blurry vision caused by flaws to the original telescope .
The spectrograph -- the most sensitive such instrument to ever fly in space -- delivers precise astrophysical data on the temperature , density and speed of distant cosmic bodies .
“ It wants to go as deep out in space , as far back in time , as fast as it can , ” said senior Hubble project scientist David Leckrone .
The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and Advanced Camera for Surveys passed initial tests .
But NASA engineers were not immediately able to confirm that the instruments were functioning fully .
On Friday astronauts replaced gyroscopes that will allow Hubble to steady its gaze on distant galaxies .
Replacing Hubble ’s six gyroscopes was the top priority for the mission .
NASA hopes the improvements will keep Hubble operational until at least 2014 so it can work in tandem with its replacement , the James Webb Space Telescope .
1. Twitter Is a Tool and Thus Difficult to Censor
Twitter aspires to be something different from social - networking sites like Facebook or MySpace : rather than being a vast self - contained world centered on one Web site , Twitter dreams of being a tool that people can use to communicate with each other from a multitude of locations , like e-mail .
You do not have to visit the home site to send a message , or tweet .
Tweets can originate from text - messaging on a cellphone or even blogging software .
Likewise , tweets can be read remotely , whether as text messages or , say , “ status updates ” on a friend ’s Facebook page .

Unlike Facebook , which operates solely as a Web site that can be , in a sense , impounded , shutting down Twitter.com does little to stop the offending Twittering .
You ’d have to shut down the entire service , which is done occasionally for maintenance .
2. Tweets Are Generally Banal , but Watch Out
“ The qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half - baked are what makes it so powerful , ” says Jonathan Zittrain , a Harvard law professor who is an expert on the Internet .
That is , tweets by their nature seem trivial , with little that is original or menacing .
Even Twitter accounts seen as promoting the protest movement in Iran are largely a series of links to photographs hosted on other sites or brief updates on strategy .
Each update may not be important .
Collectively , however , the tweets can create a personality or environment that reflects the emotions of the moment and helps drive opinion .
3. Buyer Beware
Nothing on Twitter has been verified .
While users can learn from experience to trust a certain Twitter account , it is still a matter of trust .
And just as Twitter has helped get out first - hand reports from Tehran , it has also spread inaccurate information , perhaps even disinformation .
An article published by the Web site True / Slant highlighted some of the biggest errors on Twitter that were quickly repeated and amplified by bloggers : that three million protested in Tehran last weekend ( more like a few hundred thousand ) ; that the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi was under house arrest ( he was being watched ) ; that the president of the election monitoring committee declared the election invalid last Saturday ( not so ) .
4. Watch Your Back
Not only is it hard to be sure that what appears on Twitter is accurate , but some Twitterers may even be trying to trick you .
Like Rick ’s Café , Twitter is thick with discussion of who is really an informant or agent provocateur .
One longstanding pro-Moussavi Twitter account , mousavi1388 , which has grown to 16,000 followers , recently tweeted , “ WARNING : http://www.mirhoseyn.ir/ & http://www.mirhoseyn.com/ are fake , DONT join .
... # IranElection 11:02 AM
Jun 16th from web . ”
The implication was that government agents had created those accounts to mislead the public .
ABCNews.com announced that Twitter users who said they were repeating ( “ retweeting ” ) the posts from its reporter , Jim Sciutto , had been fabricating the material to make Mr. Sciutto seem to be backing the government .
“ I became an unwitting victim , ” he wrote .
Space Pips :
The hottest Geometry Wars - style action seen in a Flash game !
Shoot those space muthas .
The idea of a savant : someone who exhibits a particular exemplary skill while somehow presenting with a seeming deficit in other areas , is fascinating to me .
In particular because I ’ve always had a suspicion that I was , somehow , fooling everyone into believing I was talented , smart , cute , whatever .
As though I had some level of faerie charisma that enabled me to ruse everyone simultaneously .
A rather surreal notion once you Occam ’s Razor that shit , but I was a weird kid and have only developed deeper and more Byzantine emotional branches since then .
When first clued into the idea that I was not a “ Normal Child ” I had little to deflect me from that notion .
I was a professional actor at the age 5 .
I went to a school for the weird .
And praise gods because it was all I could do to not be eaten alive by other , more “ normal ” kids who inhabited my neighborhood .
I spent my early childhood in the Johnson Projects .
Both there as well as in the after - school center I attended , other Black kids routinely threatened violence against me physically and carried it out verbally and emotionally because I was “ too white ” too “ stuck - up ” “ not - right - in - the - head . ” and , of course and always , “ weird . ”
So I ’ve an affinity , of course , for those who are outliers , removed from the standard , separate from the mainstream .
And that attraction slipped naturally into place when I came out on the BDSM and Leather Communities .
I felt that I was finally coming home and had found “ My People . ”
Well , not so fast , rabbit .
There are factions , fragments , fickleness and fissures within the “ Community ” up to and including those who wo n’t even use the word “ Community ” to refer to the loose confederation of alternative people who practice WIITWD .*
One of the more pronounced rifts is between those who are very spiritually focused in their kink vs. those who really love and deeply experience the sensation , but refuse to ascribe a deeper spiritual connectivity to the BDSM practice .
I have the interesting perspective of not belonging firmly to either camp and that is because my kink is amoral .
I do n’t really go in much for assuming I will have a deeply connected spiritual experience across the board with everyone with whom I play .
I ’m not wired that way .
Neither do I assume that , just because the skies opened up for me and I called The 42 Sacred Names for G_d that the person administering the treatment that got me to that point is also exactly where I am .
In fact , it is usually best that they are NOT .
Someone has to steer the ship .
Which brings me to the idea of “ Dominant Savants ” and the double - edged scimitar that this particular idea presents .
If you accept that there are people who possess an astounding skill in one particular aspect of life but lack it in another , you are with me in the beginning of this thought process .
Someone who is a stellar whipmaster , bondage aficionado , piercer , what have you , may be able to act as your guide throughout an incredibly earth - shattering experience , but you would be absolutely making a dangerous assumption if you automatically piggyback a deep spirituality to their expertise .
It MAY be there .
It MAY not .
It may be there for one partner and not for another .
This does n’t intrinsically make them a shitty player , it means you have to know what is happening for them .
It means doing your fucking homework .
It means listening to your gut .
And yeah , absolutely it means taking risks and falling flatsplat on your face , alone , and having to get your shit together your damned self .
But YOU NEED TO DECIDE if that risk is worth it it TO YOU .
Read it again , my friend .
The rituals and emotional trips and triggers of BDSM have deep resonance for some , and not for others .
And it is all good , so long as , when you come together to play , you are all reading the same fucking playbook .
A Priest may break the bread , bless it , and present it , but it is the Catholic worshiper ’s personal belief in Transubstantiation that makes it “ the body of Christ . ”
Same with the wine to blood thing .
The ritual is part of it but the supplicant is doing most of the work there , frankly .
No matter what the fuck the Priest does , without the worshiper ’s belief and buy - in , ai n’t no holy moment .
Just some cheap - ass sour fucking wine and a bit of stale weird cracker thing .
If the dominant is , in this analogy , leading the service , the individual spirituality of the supplicant , or bottom , can be entirely personal .
I am not saying it always is , but I am saying , without judgement , is that it can be .
And my surprising realization is this : I am fine with that .
So long as I know what I am doing , who I am dealing with , and I fully take responsibility at the end of the ride for myself , a brilliant “ dominant savant ” whom you share little or no spiritual connection outside of the scene can be a midwife to your own experience .
If you can respect their skill and accept their different approach , I believe that this can be a very successful type of power exchange .
I spent over year bottoming to and , for a while , submitting to someone who would have been , at the time , hard - pressed to tell you exactly why he enjoyed BDSM .
In my case , I ’m a person dedicated to self - analysis and tasting nibbling stirring sniffing and dissecting what takes me , again and again and again , to the depths of profound humiliation and the out - of - body - highs of intense sensation play .
In his case , he just … liked it .
This of course made me a “ bit ” obsessively fascinated by his approach to BDSM .
No matter how I framed the line of inquiry , I got the same baffling opaque non-response time after time .
This eventually made me batshit crazy until I realized something critical :
It does n’t fucking matter .
See , my experience is mine .
As reflexively silly as this sounds , it is the thing that cut through my need to cling to the idea of connection that I so desperately craved .
It was an idea I created pretty much on my own and guess what ?
It does not always translate well to real live people .
If I go horseback riding , jump on a roller - coaster , swim in the ocean , I do n’t expect to process that with the horse , the Cyclone , or the Pacific .
I experience these things , perhaps even in a profoundly spiritual way , and I let it become a part of my experiential self .
And if I fall off of the horse , or get stuck on the Cyclone in Coney Island , or get pulled by an undertow , I have to take care of myself .
This is , I think , the way I have experienced “ dominant savants . ”
Those who can take me on startling journeys but are not , for whatever reason , on my wavelength emotionally and spiritually .
It does NOT NEGATE , DIMINISH , or COMPROMISE the play / scene / relationship we have .
But it does define and demark it .
In the year plus of this intense play relationship that was particularly marked by this interestingly connected disconnect , I had quite a few people either pull me aside to “ Make sure I was OK . ” or to straight up ask why I played with this person .
Many , many people with whom he ’d played vowed they would n’t ever do so again as they just could n’t deal with the feeling of being the rawhide chewtoy for some brutally rough play that did not have , as the upshot , an emotional connectivity that they needed within and as part of aftercare for the scene .
At first I worried that I was also broken .
That I was allowing myself to be emotionally damaged in a way that I was , somehow , missing .
But I concluded that was not the case then and in retrospect , I still do not think it is now .
I believe that people come into your life for various reasons and those reasons are n’t always apparent at the time .
In this case the benefit was clear .
I played with a particular freedom I had n’t enjoyed before , and very rarely since .
I felt safe .
Regardless of the reality , I FELT .

And that is no mean feat to pull on me when I am , in fact , doing some crazy shit .
I sure as fuck have had deeply connected and spiritually conscious play with people .
But as I slowly reprocess the past 16 years , I realize that the vast majority of play I ’ve done falls into the category of submitting to the universe , to god , to my journey , to life , by way of a guardian who facilitated this and gained a measure of pleasure from it themselves , but remained essentially unchanged .
I have never had a top or dominant tell me that the scene we did altered their perception of kink , of who they were , of their role in life , and that they felt a kinship that defied speaking due to what we shared in terms of our play .
And yet I have , in some way or other , expressed these very sentiments to several people in my life .
Perhaps dominants “ Just do n’t do that . ”
Or perhaps my submission simply does n’t inspire that level of revelation in the people with whom I play .
Pleah … I do n’t care much for that thought … it stings .
Or …. yeah this a good one …. maybe no one has taken me that far yet .
Even as I say this to myself it is without self - pity , just puzzlement .
I really have to go back to the first interaction that spontaneously inspired me to submissiveness , that of a particular British Musician , to find someone who acknowledged and really SAW me , and told me what he saw , and was dead to rights and devastating on target .
And I know , in his case , I left dragmarks on his heart .
Since then , not so much .
Perhaps I was spoiled at an early “ age ” within my kink .
Maybe I ride these kinky double black diamond slopes in the hopes of seeing that beautiful eternal liminal dissolution again .
Running like a blind child along the edges of other ’s singularities .
Foolishly .
I was hashing this out with my dear friend the other night ( I strongly recommend discussing your perversions with a Rabbinical student .
That shit ROCKS and your own personal Midrash takes on gorgeous flourishes and has to withstand the scathing light and pointy pokiness of thousands of years of feisty Hebraic argumentativeness .
SO awesome . ) and was tossing out analogies .
I drew a parallel between playing in this “ dominant savant ” arena and messing around on a volcano .
See , we have plenty of empirical data letting us know that volcanoes sit there all cool and slopey , looking sexy , but will , on occasion , fuck you up and all of your shit too .
And your goats .
So whose fault is it is you get burned ?
You have no business being there if you know it is a fucking volcano .
Of course , some volcanoes pop outta nowhere and are all like ::: SURPRISE BUTTSECHS !!::: and , if they fuck you up , not your fault .
Still sucks to be you though .
But more often than not you have warnings .
Rumbles .
Shifts ,
Stinky gas .
And if you stick the fuck around and wind up Pompeiied , we can’t really feel bad for you .
“ Aha , but people DO live on volcanoes , ” my Rabbinically Enhanced friend pointed out “ … and after an eruption , the soil and the land created is extremely rich and beneficial , and so it attracts people back to it despite the risk . ”
Yes , of course .
People live in dangerous fucking places .
On volcanic islands .
On huge fucking fault lines .
( * sigh * )
In the path of annual monsoons , floods hurricanes .
On floating shanties atop of pirhana infested waters .
But you live there in hope .
In hope that the benefit you derive from your location will outweigh he possibility of loss , damage , death , devastation .
My thoughts here are unedited and raw and imperfect and I would really REALLY love your feedback .
other here or in the forum where we can have a more interactive dialogue .
But , for now …
I think I think it is OK to ride the tiger .
Just do n’t be surprised if you are at a bit of a loss when it comes time to dismount and get away unbloodied .
* What It Is That We Do : one of those cutesy acronyms for perverted shit .
Dear Cecil :
What exactly does it mean to say that someone is " passive - aggressive " ?
I hear this term used frequently , usually with reference to a coworker , child , parent , etc , who is being a pain in the ass .
Surely there 's a more rigorous clinical definition than that .
Frank Caplice , Chicago
Cecil replies :
You might get some argument there , Frank .
It ’s true that if you look under “ passive - aggressive personality disorder ” ( PAPD ) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( the older editions — more about that below ) , you find the syndrome solemnly described as a “ pervasive pattern of passive resistance to demands for adequate social and occupational performance . ”
But once you delve into the history of the term , you realize that — at least in the eyes of its critics — it ’s mostly useful as a high - flown way to call someone a pain in the ass .
The term “ passive - aggressive ” was introduced in a 1945 U.S. War Department technical bulletin , describing soldiers who were n’t openly insubordinate but shirked duty through procrastination , willful incompetence , and so on .
If you ’ve ever served in the military during wartime , though , or for that matter read Catch - 22 , you realize that what the brass calls a personality disorder a grunt might call a rational strategy to avoid getting killed .
After the war the term found its way into civilian psychiatric practice and for many years was listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , the bible of the mental health trade .
According to the revised third edition ( DSM - III -R , 1987 ) , someone had PAPD if he displayed five or more of the following behaviors : ( 1 ) procrastinates , ( 2 ) sulks or argues when asked to do something he does n’t want to do , ( 3 ) works inefficiently on unwanted tasks , ( 4 ) complains without justification of unreasonable demands , ( 5 ) “ forgets ” obligations , ( 6 ) believes he is doing a much better job than others think , ( 7 ) resents useful suggestions , ( 8 ) fails to do his share , or ( 9 ) unreasonably criticizes authority figures .
You may say : I know a lot of people like that .
Or even : I ’m that way myself sometimes .
Exactly the problem .
From the outset skeptics argued that passive - aggressive behavior is an ordinary defensive maneuver and should n’t be considered symptomatic of a mental disorder .
Reacting to such criticism , the authors of previous versions of the DSM had defined PAPD narrowly : in DSM - III ( 1980 ) , they ’d said PAPD should n’t be diagnosed in the presence of any other disorder ( you can see how depression might contribute to procrastination or sulkiness , for example ) .
The idea apparently was to curb careless use of the term — though shrinks were n’t likely to say somebody was mentally ill if he was just a PITA , if he had some other psychiatric problem , they ’d throw in PAPD too .
Sure enough , after DSM - III diagnoses of PAPD declined sharply , to the point that some researchers felt the category should be abolished .
Others , however , thought the exclusivity criterion was unnecessarily limiting and persuaded the editors of DSM - III -R to drop it .
PAPD diagnoses shot back up .
Conclusion :
If we define PAPD rigorously , almost nobody has it ; if we define it loosely , just about everybody does .
Recognizing that the definition as then formulated was n’t working but uncertain how to fix it , the compilers of DSM - IV ( 1994 ) dumped PAPD from the list of official disorders and relegated it to an appendix .
The most telling complaint , in my opinion , was that merely being passive - aggressive is n’t a disorder but a behavior — sometimes a perfectly rational behavior , which lets you dodge unpleasant chores while avoiding confrontation .
It ’s only pathological if it ’s a habitual , crippling response reflecting a pervasively pessimistic attitude — people who suffer from PAPD expect disappointment , and gain a sense of control over their lives by bringing it about .
Some psychiatrists have suggested that PAPD be merged into a broader category , called negativistic personality disorder .
Diagnostic criteria : passive - aggressive plus ( a ) mad at the world , ( b ) envious and resentful , ( c ) feels cheated by life , and ( d ) alternately hostile and clingy .
We ’ll let the specialists work out the details .
For now , though , we lay folk should strive to use the term “ passive - aggressive ” more precisely in everyday life .
Say for instance that a coworker cheerfully agrees to refrain from a specified uncool act , then does it anyway .
Is this passive - aggressive behavior ?
No , this is being an asshole .
Comforting as it can be to pigeonhole our tormentors with off - the - shelf psychiatric diagnoses , sometimes it ’s best just to call a jerk a jerk .

Duckweed Turns Animal Poop into Fuel
April 9th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Move over , corn : there ’s a new biofuel in town .
A tiny flowering plant called duckweed , often seen in shallow ponds , produces significantly more starch per acre than corn according to researchers North Carolina State University .
The plant thrives on animal waste , quickly transforming it into a leafy starch that can be turned into ethanol .
Since animal poop from factory farms is largely responsible algae blooms that create coastal dead zones , the NC State discovery could have ramifications far beyond our gas tanks .
Small scale tests have proven that the same technology used to convert corn into ethanol can also turn duckweed starch to ethanol .
Next up : testing on a large scale and doing an economic analysis of the process .
Ultimately , the economics will decide if duckweed can compete with other sources of ethanol .

Sometimes , it 's the absurd that tells the real story .
A cartoon by Peter Brookes in The Times today pictures Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei standing on a chair , afraid of a mouse - not a rodent , but the computer kind !
It brought to mind Peter Ustinov 's bon mot , " comedy is simply a funny way of being serious " .
Earlier this week , the BBC and other international news organisations were banned from attending what Iran 's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance called " unauthorised gatherings " .
Essentially , it means that we 're supposed to only operate from our bureau and not to report from the streets .
It was a disappointing development and one that means that we 're now operating under formal " reporting restrictions " .
While John Simpson and Jon Leyne are prevented from travelling to opposition rallies , and must seek permission to attend something like Friday prayers , there are no " minders " sitting on their shoulder with a red pen , deciding what they can and cannot say .
Such restrictions only have limited impact .
Two thirds of Iranians are under 30 , " tweeting " and " blogging " are second nature to them .
While we 've used Twitter for information on previous stories , such as the Hudson plane crash , it 's the protest in Iran that has seen it become mainstream , providing real - time commentary on events in Tehran and elsewhere - events which we 're banned from attending , but which we can follow " online " .
Farsi is now the second most popular language on the web - members of the new generation in Iran are " wired " in a way their parents , who lived through the Iranian Revolution 30 years ago , could never have imagined .
So while the authorities in Tehran are trying to limit just how much we can see and hear , technology opens a window on what 's going on .
My colleague Steve Herrmann has written previously of the importance of verifying what we get from social media and of content supplied direct to the BBC by viewers , listeners and readers .
At one stage earlier this week , BBC Persian was getting five pieces of video every minute ; the challenge of authenticating what we receive is immense , but the value is even greater .
It 's why the Ayatollah is probably right to be afraid of that mouse !

State 's unemployment fund short by billions UNEMPLOYMENT
Gov. Arnold Schwarzengger tells reporters that he and lawmakers will try to quickly solve the state 's $ 21.3 billion budget deficit without taxes , gimmicks or much borrowing , after appearing at a prayer breakfast in Sacramento , Calif. , Thursday , May 21 , 2009 .

California is paying out so much for jobless benefits and collecting so little in payroll taxes that its unemployment insurance fund could be $ 17.8 billion in debt by the end of 2010 , according to a new report from the state Employment Development Department .
This latest fiscal crisis wo n't immediately affect the 1.1 million Californians now collecting benefits because the state is using an interest - free federal loan to cover their checks .
But the state is supposed to repay that loan and restore its unemployment fund to solvency by 2011 - and right now , policymakers are n't sure exactly how to do that , or at what cost .
" The deficit that California looks like it is facing is staggering , " said Bud Bridger , fiscal officer for the unemployment insurance program .
To rebalance the system and pay back the federal loan , lawmakers must raise payroll taxes on employers , reduce benefits for recipients , or both .
In 2009 and 2010 , the state expects to pay out $ 29 billion in benefits .
It will collect just $ 11 billion .
Counting the small positive balance that was in the fund at the end of 2008 , the result is a $ 17.8 billion deficit at the end of 2010 .
State leaders have seen the problem coming .
Unemployment insurance is funded primarily by a payroll tax that costs employers up to $ 434 per employee , per year .
That formula has n't been changed since 1985 .
Meanwhile , the current maximum jobless benefit of $ 450 per week was increased to that level in stages starting in 2002 .
In November , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a tax increase on employers and benefit cuts to recipients to fix the fund .
The governor proposed to make employers pay an additional $ 56 to $ 417 per worker per year starting in 2010 .
He also wanted to cut jobless benefits from $ 1 to $ 44 per week starting in 2010 .
When Schwarzenegger made that proposal , the state expected a $ 4.9 billion deficit in 2010 .
The rapid rise in unemployment since then has more than tripled the expected shortfall .
Now the Republican governor 's proposal awaits action in a Legislature preoccupied with more pressing budget issues while the governor looks for the political support and the right mix of policies to restore the unemployment fund to solvency .
" The governor believes this has to be addressed in this coming legislative session , " said Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Camille Anderson .
How the state got into the unemployment jam is a story with a familiar ring .
Starting in 2002 , the Democratic - controlled state Legislature enacted benefit increases that raised the maximum weekly payment from $ 230 to $ 450 - which they were able to do by a majority vote .
But Democrats lacked the two - thirds margin to change the 1985 formula under which employers are taxed on only the first $ 7,000 of each employee 's wages .
Schwarzenegger 's proposal calls for taxing the first $ 10,500 in wages .
Marc Burgat , chief policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce , said the shortfall is the consequence of increasing benefits without increasing funding .
He said California should study how other states handle unemployment and consider tightening up " some of the broadest criteria for eligibility " of any state .
Emily Clayton , policy coordinator for the California Labor Federation , said the tax formula should have been changed in 2002 , but getting the necessary two - thirds vote was difficult then , as it is now .
Cutting benefits to solve the shortfall would be " fundamentally unfair and economically unsound " during a recession , she said .
If California misses the 2011 federal deadline , the state could have to use $ 609 million from its general fund to pay interest on that $ 17.8 billion loan , the state estimates .
Staffers of the Assembly insurance committee said the federal government can , over time , effectively double unemployment insurance taxes on California employers to repay the loan if the state fails to bring the program into balance by itself .
Alicia Trost , spokeswoman for state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , said legislative leaders met with business and labor officials Monday to discuss the unemployment issue , but it took a back seat to more pressing problems .
" We 're going to have to address it , " Trost said .
" But the most important thing now is to close the current budget shortfall . "
In this post , I want to discuss Pfaffians , a topic which I wish I had learned about as an undergraduate .
I ’m very interested in syzygies of ideals and such , and every now and then Pfaffians come up , so if only I knew what they were !
Now that I know , I want to explain what they are and how they ’re related to Plücker ideals .
Everything will be over the field K .
If an n x n matrix has rank < r , then this can be checked by showing that all of the r x r submatrices of it have determinant 0 .
In particular , since these r x r minors are polynomials in the entries of the matrix , this says that the set of all matrices of rank < r is an algebraic subset Y of the space of all matrices .
That it 's irreducible can be seen by the following argument : let X be the space of n x n matrices , and let Gr( r - 1 , n ) be the Grassmannian of r-1 planes in n-dimensional affine space .
Then consider the subset Z of Gr( r - 1 , n ) x X given by .
If R is the tautological subbundle on Gr( r - 1 , n ) , then is a vector bundle over Gr( r - 1 , n ) and hence is irreducible .
But the image of Z under the projection is Y , so Y is also irreducible .
It 's not so clear that the ideal generated by the r x r minors of a generic ( = entries are algebraically independent variables over K ) n x n matrix is radical , but this turns out to be true ( one way to show that this is true is to find an explicit Gröbner basis for it ) .
But what if we only care about skew - symmetric matrices ?
To check if a matrix has rank < r , we could do the same as above , but the ideal generated by the r x r minors of a generic skew - symmetric matrix will NOT be radical .
One problem already is that the determinant of any skew - symmetric matrix is always a perfect square in the field K , and hence our ideal should contain these square roots , which are called Pfaffians .
First I ’d like to prove this last statement .
Say M is a skew - symmetric n x n matrix .
We want to find a number r such that M can be transformed isometrically into the matrix where is the r x r identity matrix ( r could be 0 , in which case these rows do n’t appear ) , and the bottom row consists of n - 2r rows of zeroes .
First , M represents a bilinear form given by , where is the standard basis for .
The skew - symmetry of M means that this form is skew - symmetric .
Let L be the kernel of this form , i.e. , the set of all x such that for all y .
Then the form restricted to any complementary subspace L’ of L inside of will be nondegenerate .
So for any nonzero x in L’ , we can find y in L ’ such that .
Repeating this on the orthogonal complement of L’ inside of L , we can find a basis for L’ such that and is the Kronecker delta .
Representing M in this basis gives the desired form .
Note that if B is the matrix whose columns are , then the matrix representing the bilinear form with respect to this new basis is instead of .
This says three things : ( 1 ) the rank of M is always even , and ( 2 ) is either 0 or 1 , so is the square of something , which we call the Pfaffian of M , and ( 3 ) if we want to test the condition that rank M < r , we need only check if the principal r x r minors ( i.e. , when the row indices and column indices are the same ) are 0 .
Since these submatrices are themselves skew - symmetric , they also have Pfaffians , so it 's equivalent to check if they are 0 .
Do these give polynomial equations ?
Let M now be a generic skew - symmetric matrix with algebraically independent entries for , so that , and let K be the function field .
By the above , the determinant of M is a square of something in , which we denote by Pf ( M ) .
But the determinant of M is a polynomial in , so by the fact that is a UFD and Gauss ' lemma , this square root actually lives in .
There 's some ambiguity up to sign regarding which root to take , so we just pick one .
So we see that the Pfaffians are polynomials in the entries of M , and hence the locus of skew - symmetric matrices of rank < r is also a subvariety of the space of skew - symmetric matrices .
Since the rank of M must always be even , we should assume that r is odd .
It turns out that the ideal generated by the Pfaffians of the ( r+1 ) x ( r+1 ) principal minors of M ( just call these the ( r+1 ) x ( r+1 ) Pfaffians of M ) will be radical .
Now that we 've done that , how are Pfaffians related to Plücker ideals ?
First I 'll say what those are : given the Grassmannian Gr(r , n ) , we can embed it inside of dimensional projective space by representing a subspace by an r x n matrix and then sending it to the - tuple of its r x r minors .
The homogeneous ideal which defines the image is a Plücker ideal .
Of course , we could forget that this ideal is homogeneous , and then it would define a subvariety ( the affine cone ) of dimensional affine space .
In the case that r=2 , the elements of dimensional affine space can be identified with skew - symmetric n x n matrices ( there are elements above the diagonal ) , and the image of the Grassmannian corresponds to those which have rank at most 2 ( because they are minors of a 2 - dimensional subspaces ) .
Hence the Plücker ideal is generated by the 4 x 4 Pfaffians of a generic n x n skew - symmetric matrix .
Why is this relevant ?
It 's known how to write down the minimal free resolutions for the Pfaffians of a generic skew - symmetric matrix ( you can find this in Section 6.4 of Jerzy Weyman 's book Cohomology of Vector Bundles and Syzygies ) , so this gives for free the case of the Plücker ideals when r=2 .
The general case r> 2 is not known , however .
The case r=3 and n=6 can be done in Macaulay 2 in a few seconds ( use the command res Grassmannian ( 2,5 ) ) , but I think any larger examples are computationally too expensive .
In principal , they can be written down by hand using the techniques of Section 7.3 of the above book .
There , the difficulties arise in trying to solve some plethysm problems for the general linear group .
So it ’s likely that a closed form solution will never be attainable .

An official commented : " If there are many more incidents like these then the dungeon will have to be toned down . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
About 500 students will graduate this weekend from Atlanta 's prestigious Morehouse College .
One person who wo n't be there is Rashad Johnson , shot three times by a fellow student .
But the shooter will receive his diploma -- part of a plea deal that spared him up to 20 years in prison .
Joshua Brandon Norris was given a plea deal that avoided jail time and mandated he stay in college .
It 's a puzzling case that raises a huge question :
How can this be ?
Even Atlanta 's chief district attorney , Paul Howard , is outraged by the generous plea deal , an offer that was made by a prosecutor under his command .
" First of all , for the victim and his family , they deserved a better resolution , " said Howard , a Morehouse graduate himself .
" It seems like the wrong person got the right benefit . "
Joshua Brandon Norris faced one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a second count for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony .
But in a court hearing in January , he was presented with what the judge described as " the break of your life . "
Watch Justice for all ? »
He pleaded no contest to the first count ; the second charge was dropped .
He got six years of probation , a $ 1,000 fine and 240 hours of community service .
He avoided any jail time , and the plea also mandated that he " remain in college and complete your college degree , " according to court transcripts .
The sentence was not the judge 's idea , but he followed the prosecutor 's recommendation .
Johnson , who still has a bullet in his left leg , says he was n't told about the court hearing .
When he learned of the plea deal , his reaction was : " He 's gotta return to college ?
This criminal ? "
Johnson 's father died three months before the shooting .
He had taken the semester off to grieve for his father , but remained in Atlanta and had planned to return to Morehouse the following semester .
After the shooting , he went home to California to be with his mom and recover from his injuries .
His mother , Fahizah Johnson , said , " I am so disappointed because Morehouse has been an institution in my family for three generations . "
" This guy shot my son three times , and he 's still in school ?
He 's still a student with other students ? " she said .
" I 'm hurt for my son .
I 'm hurt for his dream deferred , but it 's not over .
And I 'm thankful for his life and I 'm thankful for his spirit . "
The incident began at a Halloween party in 2007 at an Atlanta club , where Morehouse college kids had gathered for a bash .
The club owner said he saw Norris causing trouble , and a bouncer threw him out the front door .
Minutes later , the people in the club heard gunshots and everyone hit the floor .
The club owner said the shooter was the man he saw kicked out .
Johnson told CNN that there was an altercation outside the club and that he exchanged words with Norris .
He said he did n't think much of it , and he began walking to his car when Norris pulled up in his Hummer , got out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at his head .
" When he put the gun to my head , all I could think about was I 'm not going to let this kid take me away from my mom , especially with what she 's dealing with right now , " Johnson said .
He said he grabbed Norris ' wrist and pulled his arm down when shots rang out .
" I felt the sharpest burning sensation when the first bullet hit my leg .
It actually made my leg buckle , " he said .
Norris would not go on camera with CNN , and neither would his attorney .
But his lawyer said that at the time of the shooting , his client felt his life was threatened and was defending himself .
CNN also asked Morehouse officials to comment on why Norris was allowed back in school and asked if they ever talked about safety considerations involving other students there .
The school had allowed Norris to return to classes , even before the plea was entered .
Morehouse refused to discuss the issue on camera .
But in a written statement , the school said , " The college cannot comment on specific student conduct matters , incidents of inappropriate student behavior , whether on or off campus . "
The assistant district attorney who made the plea deal could not be reached for comment .
Howard , his boss , said that the prosecutor of the case has resigned and that he would have been fired for his handling of this case .
Howard feels a stiffer penalty was warranted .
" We are sorry this happened for so many reasons , " Howard said .
" When something like this happens , I am very upset by it . "
He added , " It was an inappropriate sentence . "
As for Johnson , he is attending Sacramento City College and plans to attend law school after he graduates in 2011 .
Johnson said he no longer wants to be a Morehouse man .
The fact that Norris is graduating this weekend , he said , is an injustice .
" I really feel sick , like how could this happen , " he said , fighting back tears .

First , two quotes from my review of the original iPhone :
“ The issue is that the iPhone interface is just as responsive as a computer , so you inherently expect the sort of performance you 'd see on a notebook and it's just impossible on a device like the iPhone . "
“ I think overall we need a handful of upgrades to the iPhone alongside 3G ; we need a faster processor , possibly more system memory , maybe even faster flash .
The MLC flash in the iPhone has absolutely horrendous write speeds compared to SLC , which could be holding the iPhone back a bit .
I can see Apple introducing a 3G version in about 12 months , addressing many of these issues at the same time . ”
Indeed , 12 months after the launch of the first iPhone - Apple did fix the wireless performance issues with the iPhone 3G .
Unfortunately , the hardware remained untouched .
All of my other complaints in those two quotes remained open ticket items between Apple and I .
In fact , things got worse .
Here we have what I wrote at the end of my iPhone 3G review :
“ Apple must be wary of the direction the iPhone is headed in .
While the UI was absolutely perfect for the phone that launched a year ago , today ’s iPhone is hardly the same .
With easily over twice as many applications on an iPhone today vs. a year ago , performance and navigation have both suffered .
The impact is n’t tremendous , but Apple will have to adjust the iPhone accordingly in order to avoid turning the platform into a bloated , complicated mess . ”
Two days ago , Apple announced the iPhone 3GS - designed to address one thing : performance .
The other half of my complaint in the conclusion of my 3G review , addressing navigation and UI with the new expanded iPhone platform , is n’t addressed by the 3GS .
I suspect that in another year we ’ll see that .
But today , it ’s about hardware .
The Impetus
After yesterday 's Pre vs. iPhone 3G battery life article I got a few emails from people very close to the chips used in the iPhone 3GS .
A couple of exchanges later and I realized it might be time to go a little deeper with the hardware behind the iPhone 3G , iPhone 3GS and the Palm Pre .
The Original
The iPhone and iPhone 3G use a system on a chip ( SoC ) from Samsung .
The SoC is a custom part and actually has Apple ’s logo on the chip .
The SoC houses the CPU , GPU and memory for the iPhone .
The CPU is based on the ARM11 core , in specific it is the ARM1176JZF - S .
The CPU runs at 412MHz to save power , although the core is capable of running at 667M Hz .
The ARM11 CPU is a single - issue in - order microprocessor with an 8 - stage integer pipeline .
It ’s got a 32 KB L1 cache ( 16KB for instructions , 16 KB for data ) and no L2 cache .
The ARM11 CPU in the iPhone also has a vector floating point unit , but thankfully the SoC includes a separate GPU for 3D acceleration .
You can think of this core as a very high clocked , very advanced 486 .
And extremely low power .
Under typical load , the CPU core should consume around 100 mW .
By comparison , the CPU in your laptop can require anywhere from 10 - 35W .
Idle power is even lower .
Paired with this CPU is a PowerVR MBX - Lite GPU core .
This GPU , like the CPU , is built on a 90nm process and is quite simple .
The GPU does support hardware transform and lighting but it ’s fully fixed function , think of it as a DirectX 6/7 class GPU ( Riva TNT2 / GeForce 256 ) .
Here ’s PowerVR ’s block diagram of the MBX :
The MBX - Lite in the iPhone shares the same architecture as the MBX but is optimized , once more , for power efficiency and thus is significantly slower .
I do n’t have exact clock speed information for the MBX - Lite in the iPhone but I ’m guessing around 60MHz .
Coupled with the CPU and the GPU in the iPhone ’s SoC is 128MB of DDR memory , all on the same chip .
It ’s a pretty impressive little package .
You get a CPU , GPU and memory all in a package that ’s physically smaller than Intel ’s Atom .
Now the 486 came out in 1989 and the original 3dfx Voodoo graphics card came out in 1996 .
The iPhone ’s SoC would be ridiculously powerful if it were running the sorts of applications we had back then , but it ’s not .
We ’re asking a lot from this little core and although it has performed admirably thanks to some clever software engineering on Apple ’s part , it ’s time for an update .
Enter the ARM Cortex A8
This past weekend Palm introduced its highly anticipated Pre .
While I ’m still working on my review of the Pre , I can say that it ’s the closest thing to an iPhone since Apple first unveiled the product two summers ago .
In many ways the Pre is lacking in areas that the iPhone has honestly perfected , but in others the Pre easily surpasses Apple ’s best .
One such area is raw performance .
While both the iPhone and iPhone 3G use the same old CPU / GPU , the Pre uses TI ’s OMAP 3430 processor .
The 3430 , like the SoC Apple uses , has both a CPU and GPU on the same package .
Instead of the ARM11 and the PowerVR MBX - Lite however , the OMAP 3430 uses an ARM Cortex A8 core and a PowerVR SGX GPU .
Both are significant improvements over what was in the original iPhone .
Thankfully , Apple fans do n’t have to be outclassed for long - the newly announced iPhone 3GS uses a comparable CPU / GPU pair .
Although unannounced , the iPhone 3GS uses ( again ) a Samsung SoC but this time instead of the ARM11 + MBX - Lite combo it ’s got a Cortex A8 and PowerVR SGX ; just like the Pre .
A derivative of this is what you 'll find in the iPhone 3GS
If the ARM11 is like a modern day 486 with a very high clock speed , the Cortex A8 is like a modern day Pentium .
The A8 lengthens the integer pipeline to 13 stages , enabling its 600MHz clock speed ( what I ’m hearing the 3GS runs at ) .
The Cortex A8 also widens the processor ; the chip is now a two - issue in - order core , capable of fetching , decoding and executing two RISC instructions in parallel .
The ARM11 processor in the iPhone / iPhone 3G has a basic vector floating point unit , but the A8 adds a much more advanced SIMD engine called NEON .
The A8 also has twice as many double precision FP registers as the ARM11 .
The addition of NEON and the improved vector FPU in the A8 makes the processor much less like the original Pentium and much more like Intel ’s Atom .
Granted ,
Atom is significantly faster than the A8 , but it also draws much more power .
Caches also get a significant improvement .
I believe Apple will be using a derivative of Samsung ’s S5PC100 , which has a 32KB / 32KB L1 cache ( I/D , we may see a 16KB / 16KB config instead ) and a 256KB L2 cache .
The L2 cache , as you ’ll remember from the first section , is a new addition to the A8 ; the ARM11 core did n’t have an L2 .
i Phone 3G ( ARM11 ) iPhone 3GS ( ARM Cortex A8 ) Manufacturing Process 90nm 65 nm Architecture In - Order In - Order Issue Width 1 - issue 2 - issue Pipeline Depth 8 - stage 13 - stage Clock Speed 412MHz 600MHz L1 Cache Size 16KB I - Cache + 16KB D- Cache 32 KB I - Cache + 32 KB D- Cache L2 Cache Size N/ A 256KB
The combination of higher clock speeds , more cache and a dual - issue front end results in a much faster processor .
Apple claims the real world performance of the iPhone 3GS can be up to 2 x faster than the iPhone 3G , and I believe that ’s quite feasible .
The new SoC is built on a 65nm manufacturing process , down from 90nm in the original hardware .
However , power consumption should still be higher for the new SoC compared to the old one .
ARM ’s own site lists ~ 0.25 mW per MHz for the ARM11 core but < 0.59 mW per MHz for the A8 .
That ’s for a 650MHz low power A8 core and I ’m expecting 600MHz for the 3GS , that ’s at most 3 x the power consumption of the CPU in the original iPhone .
So how can Apple promise better battery life ?
The thing about these comparisons is that they do n’t show the full picture .
With the same battery capacity , running at full speed , the new iPhone 3GS would run out of juice faster than the existing iPhone 3G .
But that ’s rarely how people use their phones .
Chances are that you ’ll perform a few tasks before putting the phone back to sleep , and what matters then is how quickly you can complete those tasks .
Just under nine years ago Intel talked about a technology called Quick Start .
Let me quote from our IDF 2000 Day 2 coverage ( wow , that was a while ago ) :
“ " Intel has figured out that it is best to use full CPU power for a split second to finish a task and then put the CPU to idle as this conserves battery life the best .
Although one may suspect that when running complex operations the CPU would not have time to go idle , this is not the case .
To illustrate this point , Intel used an example of DVD playback .
Very stressful on the system as a whole , Intel 's quick start technology allows the CPU to " hurry up " and perform the DVD decoding operations and then go idle until the frame is displayed to screen and the next scene needs to be calculated .
This saves battery life because , although the system may require 3 watts or so to " hurry up " , the power consumption goes down near .25 watts when idle .
By averaging these two numbers , one can quickly see how quick start can extend battery life . " ”
The A8 ’s power consumption has to be well under that 3 x max I quoted above , and the iPhone 3GS needs to be more than just 2 x faster at executing instructions , but if possible then it ’s quite feasible for the faster A8 to draw more instantaneous power but draw less power on average than the ARM11 core in the original iPhone .
The iPhone Becomes a Gaming Platform : Enter the PowerVR SGX
Now that we ’re familiar with the 3GS ’ CPU , it ’s time to talk about the GPU : the PowerVR SGX .
Those familiar with graphics evolution in the PC space may remember Imagination Technologies and its PowerVR brand by their most popular desktop graphics card : STMicro ’s Kyro and Kyro II .
The Kyro series used the PowerVR3 chips and while STMicro ultimately failed to cement itself as a NVIDIA competitor in the desktop , the PowerVR technology lived on in ultra-mobile devices .
The SGX is on Imagination Technologies ’ fifth generation of its PowerVR architecture , and just like the Kyro cards we loved , the SGX uses a tile based renderer .
The idea behind a tile or deferred renderer is to render only what the camera sees , not wasting clocks and memory bandwidth on determining the color of pixels hidden by another object in the scene .
Tile based renderers get their name from dividing the screen up into smaller blocks , or tiles , and working on each one independently .
The smaller the tile , the easier it is to work on the tile on - chip without going to main memory .
This approach is particularly important in the mobile space because there simply is n’t much available bandwidth or power .
These chips consume milliwatts , efficiency is key .
The MBX - Lite used in the original iPhone was also a tile based architecture , the SGX is just better .
Also built on a 65nm process the PowerVR SGX is a fully programmable core , much like our desktop DX8 / DX9 GPUs .
While the MBX only supported OpenGL ES 1.0 , you get 2.0 support from the SGX .
The architecture also looks much more like a modern GPU :
Pixel , vertex and geometry instructions are executed by a programmable shader engine , which Imagination calls its Universal Scalable Shader Engine ( USSE ) .
The “ coprocessor ” hardware at the end of the pipeline is most likely fixed - function or scalar hardware that ’s aids the engine .
The SGX ranges from the PowerVR SGX 520 which only has one USSE pipe to the high end SGX 543MP16 which has 64 USSE2 pipes ( 4 USSE2 pipes per core x 16 cores ) .
The iPhone 3GS , I believe , uses the 520 - the lowest end of the new product offering .
A single USSE pipe can execute , in a single clock , a two - component vector operation or a 2 or 4 - way SIMD operation for scalars .
The USSE2 pipes are upgraded that handle single clock 3 or 4 component vector operations , have wider SIMD and can co-issue vector and scalar ops .
The USSE2 pipes are definitely heavier and have some added benefits for OpenCL .
For the 3GS , all we have to worry about is the single USSE configuration .
i Phone 3G ( PowerVR MBX - Lite ) PowerVR SGX @ 100MHz PowerVR SGX @ 200MHz Manufacturing Process 90nm 65 nm 65 nm Clock Speed ~ 60MHz 100MHz 200MHz Triangles /sec 1M 3.5M 7M Pixels / sec 100M 125 M 250M
In its lowest end configuration with only one USSE pipe running at 200MHz , the SGX can push through 7 M triangles per second and render 250 M pixels per second .
That ’s 7 x the geometry throughput of the iPhone 3G and 2.5 x the fill rate .
Even if the SGX ran at half that speed , we ’d still be at 3.5 x the geometry performance of the iPhone 3G and a 25 % increase in fill rate .
Given the 65nm manufacturing process , I ’d expect higher clock speeds than what was possible on the MBX - Lite .
Also note that these fill rates take into account the efficiency of the SGX ’s tile based rendering engine .
Final Words : Preparing for 3GS
As I mentioned earlier , the Palm Pre uses a similar combination of hardware to what I expect from the iPhone 3GS .
TI ’s OMAP 3430 combines a Cortex A8 CPU core with a PowerVR SGX 530 GPU .
The difference is that while the Pre uses its excess horsepower to enable user - level application multitasking , Apple wo n’t be .
The Pre is most definitely faster than the iPhone , but it still has some rough edges .
Combine the power of the Pre with the highly optimized software stack of the iPhone and you ’ve got the recipe of an extremely fast iPhone .
While I ’ve yet to play with one , on paper , the 3GS should be every bit as fast as the videos make it seem .
The iPhone 3GS ' performance upgrades should make the phone feel a lot faster , but the real improvement will be what it enables application and game developers to do .
Apple recently hired two former AMD / ATI CTOs , presumably to work on some very graphics - centric projects .
The iPhone 3GS may be a mild upgrade from a consumer perspective , but what it 's going to enable is far from it ; watch out Nintendo .
Remember the performance gains we saw in the early days of 3D graphics on the PC ?
We 're about to go through all of that once more in the mobile space .
Awesome .
Looking toward the future , there ’s always more around the corner .
There ’s the Cortex A9 which brings multiple cores to the table , and the PowerVR SGX engine can be scaled up simply by adding more USSE pipes to the architecture .
Newer manufacturing processes will enable bringing these technologies to life without any decrease in battery power .
It ’s curious to me how central ARM and Imagination Technologies are to these smartphones .
On the PC side it ’s all about Intel , AMD and NVIDIA but when we ’re talking Pres and iPhones it ’s all ARM and PowerVR .
Intel wants to bring
Atom down to ARM power consumption levels and NVIDIA desperately searches for treasure in the mobile market , but those two are the underdogs in this race .
For the foreseeable future at least .
There you have my take on the iPhone 3GS ’ hardware .
If Apple would just get their pre-ordering system working right I might not even have to camp out this year ...
In an earlier post , we mentioned that EFF filed comments with the FCC in connection with the Child Safe Viewing Act of 2007 .
This process unexpectedly drew our attention to a copyright issue , which we discuss below .
The comments of one blocking technology company , TVGuardian , reveal an interesting angle : TVGuardian and companies like it are unexpected victims of DRM and the DMCA !
The conflict between copyright law and companies that try to edit or block " offensive " language or images in movies is not new ; it came to a head a few years ago when movie studios sued ClearPlay over products that automatically skipped particular scenes in movies , based on lists of time - codes that ClearPlay supplied .
The studios argued that this was a copyright infringement ; Congress intervened by passing a law called the Family Movie Act ( FMA ) to immunize ClearPlay 's product from copyright liability .
The FMA says that
the making imperceptible , by or at the direction of a member of a private household , of limited portions of audio or video content of a motion picture , during a performance in or transmitted to that household for private home viewing , from an authorized copy of the motion picture , or the creation or provision of a computer program or other technology that enables such making imperceptible and that is designed and marketed to be used , at the direction of a member of a private household , for such making imperceptible , if no fixed copy of the altered version of the motion picture is created by such computer program or other technology
is " not [ an ] infringement [ ] of copyright " .
17 USC 110 ( 11 ) .
The FMA , by its terms , only protects a narrow category of products and only from a specific set of legal claims .
( Notably , a company called CleanFlicks , which actually purchased movies and edited out portions of them before reselling them , was sued at about the same time as ClearPlay ; only ClearPlay received legislative relief , and CleanFlicks ultimately stopped editing movies after a court ruled against it . )
One thing the FMA failed to do was to create an express exemption to the DMCA :
Nothing in paragraph ( 11 ) shall be construed to imply further rights under section 106 of this title , or to have any effect on defenses or limitations on rights granted under any other section of this title or under any other paragraph of this section .
So just as the movie studios argue that you 're not allowed to break DRM in order to exercise your fair use rights – one of the biggest problems with the DMCA scheme – they are also sure to argue that you can't break DRM in order to exercise these rights under the FMA .
TVGuardian seems to have run squarely into this problem ; according to the company 's FCC filing :
Initially , TVG [ TVGuardian ] was sold as an add - on hardware solution , that is , via a small box that consumers could connect between their TV and cable / satellite box or a VCR tuner .
Hundreds of thousands of consumers purchased these boxes through Wal - Mart and other outlets . [...]
Once the transition to digital TV is completed , without further action by the necessary parties , families that currently have access to TVG will lose their ability to use the technology , which was designed to work with their analog sets by reading the hidden closed - captioning that is no longer accessible by an external device for digital television through cable , satellite and IPTV .
As their filing explains , the original version of the product reads closed - caption ( CC ) data in an analog TV signal .
It then uses pattern - matching to find words or phrases that the company has defined as " foul language " and can then mute the audio and even replace the captioned words or phrases with alternatives .
This strategy is reminiscent of the crudest pattern - based Internet censorware , and it's sure to produce false positives and sometimes comical results .
It brings to mind Marc Rotenberg 's satire of pattern - matching : " Congress shall make no law [...] abridging the freedom of sXXXch or of the press , or the right of the people peaceable to XXXemble , and to peXXXon the government for a redress of grievances . "
However , TVGuardian reports that " hundreds of thousands " of people nonetheless wanted the product ; presumably many of them thought the risk of overblocking was worth it .
The FCC 's docket contains many comments from extremely satisfied TVGuardian customers .
Why ca n't TVGuardian get access to CC data after the digital TV transition ?
The real reason is not that the television programming is digital , but that a large portion of it ( including satellite TV and much of pay cable service ) will be encrypted , and the DMCA will prohibit TVGuardian from circumventing that encryption in order to read the captioning .
The captions are carried along with the video signal – in analog TV , as a particular part of the vertical blanking interval ( the brief time when the electron beam is returning from the lower right part of the TV screen to the upper left and hence not displaying anything ) ; in digital TV , as metadata packets inside the digital video stream .
If the video stream is encrypted , only devices that decrypt it will be able to read the captions .
As TVGuardian complained , devices like set - top boxes normally only render the caption text as part of the video , rather than making it available on a separate interface like USB .
But since devices that decrypt these signals – even for the use of pay TV customers – are restricted by the DMCA ( and a host of licensing agreements that depend on the DMCA ) , all kinds of applications like TVGuardian 's are foreclosed .
As we 've noted , open standards without DRM allow third parties to make useful add - ons without asking permission ; DRM together with the DMCA puts a stop to this kind of add - on innovation .
There are lots of things that add - on boxes could do with the kind of access to caption data that all TV viewers used to have : not only blocking but also search or automated translation ( in fact , Google had an experiment in 2005 along these lines ) .
In the past some major electronics manufacturers made deals to incorporate TVGuardian 's technology into their devices .
According to the company , " [t ] he TVG feature was built into DVD players , VCRs and other devices manufactured by companies such as Sanyo , Magnavox , RCA , Memorex , Polaroid and Disney . "
Now these companies seem uninterested ; TVGuardian complains that the manufacturers have been unreceptive to the idea of an update for digital TV .
Essentially , TVGuardian is asking the FCC to recommend that Congress force these companies to negotiate with TVGuardian to include its technology , or something similar , in their future products .
We think that would be a bad idea , but there is something to TVGuardian 's complaints about the digital TV transition .
At root , it 's really a DMCA problem .
As with Apple 's iPhone , we do n't want to force companies to carry or integrate technology they 'd prefer not to – but we think it 's absurd that the DMCA lets companies intimidate other innovative third parties from offering things customers want .
Der Internet - Krieg der Editoren Rudolf Stumberger
Auf den Seiten der elektronischen Enzyklopädie Wikipedia wogt ein " Edit - War " um die von Arbeitgebern ins Leben gerufene " Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft "
Die umstrittene Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) war bislang schon für diverse Schlagzeilen gut ( Think Tanks sollen Stimmung schaffen und lassen die Grenze zwischen PR und Journalismus verschwimmen ) , nun sorgt sie auch im Internet für Turbulenzen : Auf den Seiten der basisdemokratischen Enzyklopädie Wikipedia tobt ein Streit um das Wesen dieser von einem Arbeitgeberverband ins Leben gerufenen Propaganda - Abteilung .
1
Immer wieder werden kritische Beiträge zur INSM von bestimmten Nutzern gelöscht - manche vermuten dahinter zahlende Auftraggeber ( vgl .
Wie versucht wird , Wikipedia zurecht zu trimmen ... ) .
Anhand der sich fast täglich verändernden Einträge unter dem Stichwort " Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft " in dem Netz - Lexikon lässt sich ein Kampf um Bedeutungen und Begriffe begutachten , der eine Schlacht um die Deutung von Welt ist .
Wikipedia2 wird damit zwangsläufig zum Terrain eines gesellschaftlichen Kampffeldes und jener Kämpfe die „ auf eine Änderung der Wahrnehmungs - und Bewertungskategorien der sozialen Welt und darin auf eine Veränderung der sozialen Welt selbst abzielen “ , wie es der französische Soziologe Pierre Bourdieu ausgedrückt hat .
Beginnen wir mit dem Anfang : Am 6 .
Dezember 2004 war in Wikipedia unter dem Stichwort „ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft “ zu lesen :
Die SPD kritisierte im Dezember 2004 die ‚ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ’ ( INSM ) als ‚ Tarnorganisation ’ .
Die grüne Finanzpolitikerin Christine Scheel verließ im Dezember 2004 die Initiative .
Zuvor hatte attac der Initiative anläßlich der Vergabe der Auszeichnungen ‚ Blockierer des Jahres ’ und ‚ Reformer des Jahres ’ vorgeworfen , sie betreibe ‚ Industriepropaganda ' .
Der Hintergrund für diesen Eintrag war , dass durch diverse kritische Medienberichte öffentlich wurde , dass die INSM unter dem Deckmäntelchen der Unabhängigkeit und Neutralität Lobbyarbeit für die gesellschaftspolitischen Interessen des Arbeitgeberverbandes Gesamtmetall leistete .3
Denn dieser gründete 2000 diese Initiative und gönnt sich seither für zehn Millionen Euro pro Jahr die Dienste einer Werbeagentur , die neoliberale Botschaften wie den Abbau des Kündigungsschutzes unter die noch immer „ sozialstaatsgläubige “
Bevölkerung bringen soll .
Und auch die dazu eingekauften Journalisten taten ganze Arbeit : Sie plazierten die politischen Ansichten des Arbeitgeberverbandes geschickt in den Redaktionsstuben der Zeitungen , finanzierten genehme Beiträge im Fernsehen , vermittelten „ Botschafter “ als Interviewpartner .
Dies alles , ohne dass in den jeweiligen Medienbeiträgen klar wurde , dass finanziell und geistig federführend die Organisation der Metallarbeitgeber dahinter stand .
4
Dies ging soweit , dass ganze Szenen in der Soap - Opera „ Marienhof “ gekauft wurden .
Diese Manipulation der Öffentlichen Meinung war der Grund , warum die INSM selbst zum Gegenstand der Berichterstattung und von Wikipedia wurde .
Dort allerdings mutierte die kritische
Beschreibung mehr und mehr hin zu einer „ Neutralität “ der Darstellung .
So hieß es am 15 .
Februar 2005 nun :
Die Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) ist eine im Jahr 2000 gestartete Kampagne , ‚ Reformbewegung ’ und Denkfabrik , die strikt marktwirtschaftliche Positionen vertritt .
Am 17 .
Juni 2005 erfolgte eine weitere Weichspülung .
Statt „ strikt marktwirtschaftliche Positionen “ ist jetzt nur noch von „ marktwirtschaftlichen Positionen “ die Rede .
Im September schließlich ist der Weichspülvorgang dann nahezu abgeschlossen :
Die im Jahr 2000 gegründete Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) bezeichnet sich selbst als Reforminitiative .
Sie sieht sich als parteiübergreifende Plattform , die sich der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft verbunden sieht .
In dieser Definition ist jeglicher kritische Impuls getilgt und das Eigenbild der Propaganda - Truppe übernommen , was ungefähr ähnlich naiv ist wie an eine halbe Schwangerschaft zu glauben .
Das sehen auch die Mitglieder der Wikipedia - Gemeinde auf der Diskussionsseite so :
Dieser Artikel macht ja eine erstaunliche Metamorphose durch !
Alte Versionen stellten mal eine kritische Betrachtung der Lobby - Organisation und ihrer Ziele dar , aber Stück für Stück hat er sich wie von Zauberhand in das gesäuselte Loblied einer tüchtigen Gruppe von Reformern verwandelt , die nur unser Bestes wollen .
62.180.160.80 01:17 , 3 . Sep 2005 ( CEST )
Anfang März 2006 schließlich eskaliert der Streit um die inhaltliche Ausrichtung des INSM - Artikels in einem sogenannten „ Edit - War “ , wobei die „ gegnerische “ Version jeweils gelöscht und durch die eigene ersetzt wird .
So konnte sich folgende immerhin wieder leicht kritische Version nicht durchsetzen :
Die im Jahr 2000 gegründete Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) bezeichnet sich als ‚ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform ’ , die für ‚ marktwirtschaftliche Reformen ’ eintritt und mittels professioneller PR - Kampagnen und Medienkooperationen versucht , Mehrheiten für ihre Ziele zu gewinnen .
In den Augen ihrer Kritiker ist sie hingegen eine getarnte PR - Agentur eines Arbeitgeberverbandes .
Diese Version wurde insgesamt zehn Mal gelöscht und durch die Weichspülversion ersetzt , der Wächter über die „ neutrale “ Version hatte schlicht den längeren Atem im „ Edit - War “ .
Edit - War oder : Mythen des Internet
Um diesen „ Edit - War “ zu verstehen , muss man die Regeln und die Konstruktion von Wikipedia kennen .
Als „ basisdemokratische “ Enzyklopädie ( „ umfassendes Wörterbuch “ , „ Grundwissenschaft “ ) kann jeder einen Artikel ins Leben rufen oder bestehende Artikel verändern .
Damit letzteres nicht im Chaos endet , gibt es gewisse Grundregeln : „ Vandalismus “ etwa ist verboten ( das Löschen von Teilen oder ganzen Artikeln ) , der „ Werdegang “ eines Artikels ist aufgezeichnet und in seinen verschiedenen Versionen nachvollziehbar , für Streit unter den Autoren gibt es eine Diskussionsseite , auf der dieser Streit ausgetragen werden soll .
Wikipedia setzt damit auf den Sieg der Rationalität und des Arguments , die „ Wahrheit “ solle sich im rationalen Austausch der Argumente herstellen - Aufklärung pur also .
Mit diesem zweifelsohne sympathischen Ansatz nährt Wikipedia freilich - in Anlehnung an Roland Barthes „ Mythen des Alltags “ - die „ Mythen des Internet “ .
Diese Mythen erzählen vom demokratischen und aufklärerischen Potenzial des Netzes , von der Gleichheit der Benutzer , von der Redefreiheit der Massen und der subversiven Kraft gegenüber den politisch und ökonomisch Mächtigen .
Der Streit um den INSM - Artikel freilich zeigt die Grenzen dieser Eigenschaften auf .
Jener eifrige Nutzer , der über die „ neutrale “ - sprich weichgespülte Version - des Artikels Tag und Nacht wacht , beruft sich gerne auf die „ fehlende Neutralität “ der kritischen Beiträge .
Damit ist argumentativ natürlich nichts gelöst , sondern der semantische Streit um das „ Wesen “ der INSM lediglich auf eine andere Ebene verschoben , in der es dann um den semantischen Streit von „ Neutralität “ geht .
Interessanter Weise lässt sich an diesem Wikipedia - Artikel sozusagen in Zeitrafferform ein gesellschaftliches Phänomen studieren , das „ in der freien Natur “ als vielfältigster und langandauernder Prozess stattfindet : Der Kampf der Klassifikationssysteme als Teil eines Kampfes um gesellschaftliche Ressourcen .
Bourdieu hat dies so formuliert5 :
Darum geht es in den Auseinandersetzungen um die Definition des Sinns der Sozialwelt : um Macht über die Klassifikations - und Ordnungssysteme , die den Vorstellungen und damit der Mobilisierung und Demobilisierung der Gruppen zugrundeliegen .
Und darum geht es grundsätzlich in der Auseinandersetzung zum INSM - Artikel , nämlich darum , ob von „ Reformen “ oder von „ Sozialabbau “ , von „ Flexibilisierung “ oder von „ Abbau des Kündigungsschutzes “ , ob von einer „ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform “ oder von einer „ getarnte PR - Agentur eines Arbeitgeberverbandes “ gesprochen wird .
Diese Wörter sind Politik und es geht eben entweder um die „ Mobilisierung von Gruppen “ für den neoliberalen Umbau des Staates oder für die Verteidigung sozialer Rechte .
Und dies nicht im luftleeren Raum , sondern höchst verbunden mit den Interessen der Akteure :
„ Die Klassifikations - und Ordnungssysteme bildeten keine derart hart umkämpften Streitobjekte , trügen sie nicht bei zum Bestand der Klassen , indem sie mittels der entsprechend dem Ordnungssystem strukturierten Vorstellung die Wirksamkeit der objektiven Mechanismen noch verstärkt .
Dem Arbeitgeberverband
Gesamtmetall ist eben sehr daran gelegen , mithilfe eingekaufter Journalisten und Werbeagenturen die Wirksamkeit seiner politischen Ansichten zu verstärken , also unter die Leute zu bringen , und einen Meinungswechsel hin zur Befürwortung neoliberaler „ Reformen “ zu bewirken .
Die Sache mit der Neutralität
„ Neutralität “ ist in diesem Kampf der Klassifikationssysteme natürlich selbst ein Kampfbegriff , der „ gut “ ist , weil „ interesselos “ - freilich eine im realen sozialen Universum nicht existierende Position .
Denn natürlich sind , so Pierre Bourdieu , „ zahllose von den etablierten Wissenschaften geschaffene ethische , ästhetische , psychiatrische und juristische Klassifikationen...gesellschaftlichen
Funktionen unterworfen , wobei ihre spezifische Effizienz freilich gerade auf dem Schein ihrer Neutralität beruht “ .
Die „ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft “ beherrscht diese Klaviatur perfekt , indem sie sich auf wissenschaftliche Expertisen beruft , „ unabhängige “ Rankings in die Welt setzt und eben grundsätzlich und generell mit dem Deckmäntelchen der „ branchen - und parteiübergreifende Plattform “ den Schein der Neutralität erzeugen will .
Dem „ Mythos der Neutralität “ in der Konstruktion von Wikipedia ist der Mythos einer
Welt beigestellt , in der soziale Kämpfe durch den Austausch rationaler Argumente entschieden werden .
Dieser Ansatz hat ebenso wie sein Scheitern eine lange Geschichte .
1907 zum Beispiel kamen reformorientierte Sozialarbeiter und Wissenschaftler in die US - amerikanische Stahlstadt Pittsburgh , um das Leben der Stahlarbeiter und die Arbeitsbedingungen in den Fabriken und Eisenhütten - geprägt durch große Hitze , Rechtlosigkeit , tödliche Arbeitsunfälle etc. - zu untersuchen und zu dokumentieren .
Das Ergebnis wurde in sechs Bänden6 festgehalten .
Die dahinter stehend Idee war , dass sich angesichts unwiderlegbarer Fakten ein Konsens über die Notwendigkeit von Reformen ( Reformen im ursprünglichen Sinne als Verbesserung von Arbeits - und Lebensbedingungen und nicht im heutigen oft propagierten Sinne von Sozialabbau ) einstelle .
Die Stahlbarone sollten also kraft rationaler Argumente dazu gebracht werden , die Arbeitsbedingungen in ihren Fabriken zu verbessern .
Das Ergebnis war freilich ernüchternd : Einige kleinere Reformen kamen auf kommunaler Ebene in Gang , die grundsätzlichen Lebens - und Arbeitsbedingungen der Arbeiter änderten sich aber nicht .
Erst durch eine gewerkschaftliche Organisation verbesserten sich in den 1930er Jahren die Arbeitsbedingungen in den Stahlwerken .
Ein jüngeres Beispiel für diesen Glauben an „ Neutralität “ ist die umstrittene Werbeaktion der Modefirma Bennetton aus dem Jahre 2000 .
Auf Plakatwänden und in Anzeigen wurden die Fotografien von Todeskandidaten in US - Gefängnissen gezeigt .
In einer Presseerklärung zu dieser Kampagne hieß es , der Firma Bennetton gehe es NICHT um eine Kampagne GEGEN die Todesstrafe , sondern um eine Kampagne ÜBER die Todesstrafe .
Auch hier wieder der Mythos , man stelle „ neutrale “ Fakten zur Verfügung und der Betrachter solle sich sein eigenes Urteil bilden .
Doch es ist wie bei der Fotografie : Auch sie bildet „ objektiv “ die Welt so ab , wie sie ist .
Aber was abgebildet wird und was nicht und aus welchem Blickwinkel etc. , das ist längst jenseits einer „ Objektivität “ und interessensbestimmt .
Redlichkeit ( auch in der Wissenschaft ) besteht darin , diesen Standpunkt offen zulegen .
Bei Wikipedia freilich besteht das Veröffentlichungsprinzip im Gegenteil : Die Nutzer bzw .
Autoren sind in der Regel anonym und schreiben unter Fantasienamen .
Eine Zuordnung oder Einschätzung einer Information ist so nicht möglich , es fehlt der Kontext .
Was bleibt ist das pure Wogen der Argumente , freilich wird in diesem Wellengang gerne von Betroffenen eingegriffen , wie die Manipulation von Wikipedia - Artikeln durch US - Parlamentarier zeigte ( Wikipedia - Gate ) .
Statt dem Mythos einer „ neutralen “ Wissensquelle zu folgen , sollte man sich also bewusst sein , dass Wikipedia natürlich auch ein gesellschaftliches Kampffeld um Klassifikationssysteme ist und diese Kämpfe nicht nur mit den Mitteln des „ rationalen Diskurses “ , sondern auch durch bezahlte Agenten , durch Manipulation und Betrug , durch Verschweigen oder Verschleierung und interessensgeleitet geführt werden können - eben wie im richtigen Leben .
Ein Nutzer hat dies auch klar erkannt und sich vom Mythos der Neutralität verabschiedet :
Um einen Artikel in eine bestimmte Richtung zu drängen , braucht man nur ‚ Sitzfleisch ’ , lies Hartnäckigkeit .
Gute Argumente braucht man gar nicht .
In wikipedia zählt Stärke , nicht Argument . ( [ Benutzer : Anorak ] ]
