KAZAKH STEPPE ( Reuters ) - A Russian space capsule landed about 260 miles off course in Kazakhstan on Saturday but South Korea ’s first astronaut and the other two crew were safe .
The Soyuz capsule landed west of the target area and about 20 minutes past the scheduled time after it adopted a so - called “ ballistic landing ” , space officials said .
Rescue helicopters rushed to the site .
“ The capsule landed with an overshoot .
Such things happen , ” said mission control spokesman Valery Lyndin .
He said the crew had begun leaving the capsule , which carried Yi So- yeon , a 29 - year old nanotechnology engineer from Seoul , U.S. commander Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko .
A Reuters photographer , who traveled to the landing site in a helicopter with rescue crews , saw plumes of smoke rising from the capsule , which was lying in its side stamped about 30 cm into the ground with its parachute burning .
The photographer said the U.S. astronaut looked pale and was not fit enough to take part in a brief news conference .
He said the Korean and the Russian looked fine as they traveled in a helicopter from the site to the Kazakh city of Kustanai .
He said the Korean had been dozing in the helicopter most of the way back to Kustanai but started smiling and made a flower drawing on the wall after she was served tea and had her blood pressure measured .
Ground crew help South Korea 's first astronaut Yi So - Yeon after the Soyuz space capsule she was in landed in northern Kazakhstan April 19 , 2008 .
A Russian space capsule landed about 420 kms ( 260 miles ) off course in Kazakhstan on Saturday but the three - member crew was safe , an official at the mission control centre told Reuters .

“ Even though it is a very small place you can float back and fourth under each other , over each other , ” smiling Yi So - yeon told in English of her experiences in zero gravity environment at the International Space Station .
Russian space officials back at mission control in Moscow had waited nervously before confirmation came that all three were safe and their health was satisfactory .
STEEPER TRAJECTORY
The capsule landed so far off course because of a ballistic landing when the capsule follows a much steeper and shorter trajectory to earth , Anatoly Perminov , head of Russia ’s Federal Space Agency , told reporters .
A ballistic landing puts much higher gravity loads on the astronauts as the capsule spins towards earth .
“ The crew did not report that they had taken the ballistic landing course on re-entry , ” Perminov told a news conference , adding that the incident will be investigated .
Russian space officials said the capsule landed close to the Kazakh border , just south - east of the Russian city of Orsk .
Yi became the first South Korean aboard the International Space Station earlier this month .
In October last year , the Soyuz capsule carrying Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor , an orthopedic surgeon from Kuala Lumpur , touched down about 125 miles off course in a similar ballistic landing caused by a cable glitch .
A U.S. - Russian crew lost radio contact on re-entry and landed almost 500 km off target during a Soyuz landing in May 2003 .
The crew had to wait for over two hours before they were located by rescue groups .
The Soyuz is the world ’s longest - serving manned space capsule .
It was an early version of the craft , the Vostok , that took the world ’s first cosmonaut into orbit in 1961 .
DISCLAIMER : What you are about to read is a story about grown men who should know better .
It is included here as a means of illustrating the legend of one man and his unique place in baseball history .
It should not be construed as an endorsement of the activity described , although we must admit it makes for a pretty cool story .
How many times had he heard someone say it ?
How many times over the past 22 years had some catcher or coach or broadcaster said , " Greg Maddux ?
I bet you could catch him with your eyes closed " ?
Sounded plausible enough , maybe coaxed a chuckle or two from the pitcher , but mostly it was just something to say .
Nobody realized it was just a matter of time before somebody decided to prove it .
This was in mid-September , in the home bullpen at Petco Park .
Maddux , the human metronome , kept going into his windup with the same hands - over - the - head motion he 's used since he was a kid in Las Vegas .
Pitch after pitch hit the mitt , wherever it was placed , like always .
Padres bullpen catcher Ben Risinger , perhaps bored with the persistent perfection of it all , turned to bullpen coach Darrel Akerfelds and said , " I bet I could catch him with my eyes closed . "
That was all fine and rhetorical until Akerfelds said , " Okay , let 's go for it . "
First , a system had to be put in place .
It was quickly decided that Akerfelds would stand a few paces in front of the plate and to the side , so he could track the path of the ball and yell " Now ! " to let Risinger know when to squeeze his mitt .
Risinger , a blocky Australian who spent some time in the minors , promised not to cheat .
Maddux , despite his long - standing commitment to the pursuit of a good laugh , was lukewarm on the exercise , citing liability concerns .
" I know I do n't throw very hard anymore , " he said , " but I 'd like to think I can still hurt a guy who 's not looking . "
His protestations were ignored .
There are times when a legend must bend to the public 's will , when the accumulated weight of transcendent talent forces him to display his gifts for the amusement of those less burdened .
This , apparently , was one of those times .
Risinger closed his eyes , and Maddux threw .
A catcher 's mitt is roughly 33 inches in circumference .
To be caught , the ball must hit an area that is roughly one - third the size of the mitt .
A regulation major league baseball has a diameter of roughly 2.9 inches .
We 're not talking about throwing a strike here ; we 're talking about hitting the palm of a hand from 60 feet 6 inches away .
You can do the math , or just take Risinger 's word for it : " He 's the only guy I 'd even come close to trusting with my eyes closed . "
The first pitch glanced off the top of Risinger 's mitt and hit him in the mask .
" That 's enough , " Maddux said , walking off the mound .
" One more , " Risinger said .
The second pitch hit Risinger square in the pocket , but something went awry .
Either Akerfelds ' " Now ! " was too late or Risinger 's mitt squeeze was too slow .
The ball dropped at his feet .
" That 's enough , " Maddux said .
" One more , " Risinger said .
" Please ? "
Maddux wound up and threw .
By now , pitching coach Darren Balsley was watching , along with a few other Padres who had received word that a strange experiment was taking place involving a catcher attempting to catch without the benefit of vision .
The ball left Maddux 's hand , and Akerfelds yelled " Now ! " and Risinger clenched his mitt around the ball .
He opened his eyes .
There it was , in the mitt .
Arms were raised in celebration .
It was a beautifully stupid scene .
Risinger laughed so hard he fell down .
Akerfelds was doubled over , laughing to the point of tears .
Maddux looked on with a wry smile , shaking his head .
" One of the most amazing things I 've ever seen , " said Akerfelds , who is 45 years old .
And so it was proved , once and for all :
You really can catch Greg Maddux with your eyes closed .
DISCLAIMER : Greg Maddux is quoted in this story saying exceedingly humble things .
You are under no obligation to believe them .
You are encouraged to believe in the spirit of the words — Maddux is almost obsessively self - deprecating — but that does not make them true .
And when he says , " Whenever you 've had a little success in this game , people think you know more than you do , " do n't believe that one at all .
This is the kind of guy Maddux is :
When he plays poker on planes with teammates , they believe he knows what 's in their hands from looking at their faces .
Even if he does n't know , they think he does , which serves the same purpose .
Maddux has this weird pull over people .
Had he opted to be a cult leader rather than a pitcher , he would have much land and many followers , most of whom would probably spend their days tending to his private golf course and / or rotating bottles of expensive cabernet in the cellar .
Inside the man 's head resides the most comprehensive history of the most essential confrontation in sports : pitcher vs. hitter .
Maddux sees things nobody else sees , senses things nobody else senses .
The examples are legendary , almost mythical .
He can speed - read a batter 's stance — a little more open , a few inches up in the box — in the middle of his windup , allowing him to change his grip from changeup to fastball in the time it takes him to lift his leg .
That 's why , throughout his career , Maddux has steered clear of certain catchers , because they could n't think fast enough to keep up with him .
Padres catchers Josh Bard and Michael Barrett will sometimes go an entire game without giving him a sign .
A little tap on the thigh for location is all that 's necessary .
Entering the 2008 season , two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday ( April 14 ) , Maddux had 347 wins — seven behind Roger Clemens ' 354 , and 16 behind Warren Spahn 's 363 , the most wins by a pitcher since baseball erased the color line .
He is the sport 's quiet electrical hum , a guy who continues to win games — at least 13 a season for the past 20 years , for the Cubs , the Braves , the Cubs again , the Dodgers and now the Padres — despite yielding organically to the muscle - dwindling effects of middle age .
The Rangers ' Josh Hamilton , who spent last season with the Reds , says Maddux was by far his toughest at - bat .
" He never throws anything the same speed , " says Hamilton , who went 0 - for - 3 against the old guy .
" One pitch moves this way , one moves the other .
The radar gun says it 's going slow , but it does n't feel that way in the batter 's box .
It drives you crazy . "
Padres manager Bud Black says Maddux " has the best feel for how to throw a pitch and when to throw it of anybody , maybe ever . "
Which prompts Maddux to shrug his unimposing shoulders and trot out the mantra " Whenever you 've had a little success in this game , people think you know more than you do . "
Right .
But when Brad Penny and Maddux were teammates on the Dodgers , during the last two months of 2006 , they had a conversation one day that led Penny to reach a stunning conclusion :
This guy knows my stuff better than I do .
It was eerie , really , how easily Maddux dissected Penny 's repertoire and suggested ways to maximize it .
Penny , figuring he'd take advantage of the situation , asked Maddux to call a game for him against the Cubs .
And so , on the night of Sept. 13 , Penny glanced into the dugout before every delivery and found Maddux , who signaled the next pitch by looking toward different parts of the ballpark .
Penny threw seven scoreless innings with no walks and beat the Cubs 6 - 0 .
" Maddux probably wo n't tell you that story , " Penny says .
He 's right .
DISCLAIMER : Maddux wants nothing to do with the Maddux - as - genius discussion .
In fact , if the topic veers toward the mythical nature of his achievements , the look on his face turns from mild surprise to abject befuddlement .
When his eyes ask , " Who , me ? " you know the answer : Yes , him .
In person , Maddux is kind of goofy , with a double - chinned , slack - jawed look of wonder that must be a put-on .
Maybe this is the way of the genius , or the savant .
Did Caravaggio have to explain every brushstroke ?
Would it have diminished his achievements if he did ?
Greg 's older brother , Mike , pitching coach for the Brewers , becomes defensive when asked about Greg 's reticence , saying , " Magicians do n't tell everyone their tricks , do they ?
I bet David Copperfield would be a tough interview too . "
Self - reflection is not a priority .
Maddux has spent his adult life in the eternal childhood of the big league clubhouse .
There 's no other place on earth quite like it .
One morning this spring in Peoria , Ariz . , he sat at his corner locker with a plate of bacon and eggs on his lap , talking about pitching .
He was running some sort of low - stakes golf pool out of the corner of his eye , passing out papers and collecting money without turning his head .
At one point , in midsentence and without warning , he winced like a man about to pass a stone , lifted his left cheek off the chair and let loose .
" Whoa , wow , sorry about that , " he said , then continued with the eggs and the discussion and the golf pool .
So add that to the Maddux scouting report : bats right , throws right , farts left .
A great old scout named Doug McMillan , who used to work the Western states , shot a grainy video of a 19 - year - old Maddux throwing on some field .
In the clip , Maddux is wearing high socks , a foam - front cap and tiny gym shorts , but he 's throwing the exact same way he throws today .
You can't see his face , but if you 've watched baseball at all over the past 20 years , you 'll see this 3.5 - second video and immediately say , " Maddux . "
As Greg says , " I was fortunate to have some success early , so nobody tried to change me . "
Typically modest , typically Maddux .
Part of the legend concerns a man named Ralph Medar , a scout who'd retired and moved to Vegas to get a handle on his allergies .
Medar started a series of invitation - only pickup games for the best prep players in the area .
He coached Mike and Greg Maddux as well as Mike Morgan , who retired in 2002 , after 22 seasons .
That 's a combined 60 years of big league pitching experience .
Medar ( who died before Greg graduated from high school ) taught them all the value of movement over velocity , how to shield the ball behind their gloves to hide grips and how sometimes a 57 - foot curveball is the best pitch in the world .
" We bought into it , " Greg says .
" One of the first questions we used to ask was ' Is my ball sinking , or is it just running ? '
Now all they ask is , ' Did I throw 92 or 94 ? ' "
Greg got to play in Medar 's games when he was 13 or 14 .
Pro scouts and college coaches started calling and showing up at the Maddux house during Mike 's senior year .
As one of the scouts was leaving one night , the boys ' father , Dave Maddux , shook the guy 's hand and said , " You 'll be back for the little one . "
You 'll be back for the little one .
How great is that ?
Maybe it was during those pickup games that Greg learned how to pick up a hitter 's tendencies and take advantage of them .
Watch him on the mound , how he throws the ball to a spot and hops to the right or the left on his follow - through because he knows that 's the direction the ball should go if everything works as it should .
He is a master of tendencies , sure , but his approach is rooted in an intuitive understanding of physics and geometry .
As former Cub and current teammate Mark Prior says , " I do n't know what it is , but he just knows .
Nobody else knows the way he knows . "
Prior is one of several Padres pitchers — Jake Peavy and Chris Young are also among them — who appreciate Maddux 's willingness to fill in the gaps in their experience .
It seems to be a generational thing .
Mike Maddux calls the young American pitchers coming up through the Brewers ' system " academy kids " because they were taught to play by micromanaging coaches on travel - ball teams where the fields were always perfect and the drills always robotic .
" All they 've been taught is how to take instruction , " Mike says .
" We were taught how to play the game . "
One day last summer , Greg called reliever Heath Bell into the film room .
The Padres were playing the Cardinals , and Maddux wanted Bell to see something he 'd picked up from a St. Louis hitter .
" I can't do it , but with your stuff , you can throw your fastball inside and handle this guy , " Maddux told him .
Bell started to answer , " But the scouting report says … "
" I do n't care about the scouting report , " Maddux said .
" I 'm saying your fastball can get this guy out . "
After relaying the story , Bell says , " I listened .
I got him out .
Maddux knows best . "
With the Cubs , the story goes , Maddux once sat in the dugout and watched José Hernández of the Dodgers set up in the batter 's box .
After two pitches , Maddux turned to the guys around him and said , " We might have to call an ambulance for the first base coach . "
On the next pitch , Hernández whipped a shot that hit first base coach John Shelby in the chest .
" He does that all the time , " Bell says .
" He 'll say , ' Get ready to duck , ' and two seconds later , here comes the ball . "
Maddux waves it all off , of course .
" I daydream just like everybody else , " he says .
" I just do it with my body facing the field , so everybody thinks I 'm paying attention . "
At some point , probably soon , Maddux will be gone , and all of this will leave with him .
He has told some teammates that this is his final season , which means no run at Grover Cleveland Alexander and Christy Mathewson , who are tied at 373 , and no crazy notions about joining Cy Young and Walter Johnson in the 400 - win club .
" I 'm not going to be one of those guys who pretends it 's going to be easy to walk away , " he says .
" It 's going to be hard , really hard . "
Last year , during a series at Dodger Stadium , Maddux and Bell had a conversation while shagging balls during batting practice .
Bell said something casually to Maddux about the hours he'd spent over 22 years in the big leagues doing that very thing — shagging balls and tossing them back to the bucket man behind second base .
" You know , " Maddux said , " I really should retire . "
Bell , unsure if he was entering into a conversation of historical importance , stayed quiet .
What was he supposed to say , really ?
But then , after a pause , Maddux picked up another ball and said , " Nah .
Then I 'd go home and do what ? "
Relieved ,
Bell agreed , saying , " How could you leave this ? "
And together they laughed the whole thing off .
Think Maddux is a mad genius ?

Not that these women sweat anyway .
" Horses Sweat , Men Perspire And Ladies Glow , " my mother always told me .
But you get the idea .
A group of fashion conscious women is making a difference this Earth Day - by looking fabulous !
Okay , as a man in his 40s with more children than I can count , I had a hard time even writing the word ' fabulous ' without laughing .
But there is something serious happening .
Chantecaille , a cosmetics company , has said it will donate five percent of the proceeds of its new “ Protected Paradise ” face and eyes compacts to the Pew Institute ’s Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation program , which provides a $ 150,000 award to each of five ocean experts around the world annually to develop solutions to critical ocean challenges .
The Pew Institute previously joined forces with Chantecaille in 2007 when the cosmetics firm created a faux - coral - adorned “ Coral ” compact and donated five percent of the proceeds of that limited - edition product to the Pew Institute ’s “ Reefs of Hope ” project , which seeks to understand whether temperature - sensitive corals will adapt to survive climate change .
“ The wonderful partnership between the Pew Institute for Ocean Science and Chantecaille is a natural , since both institutions care deeply about environmental protection , ” said Dr. Ellen Pikitch , Executive Director of the Pew Institute for Ocean Science .
“ Although Sylvie grew up in France and I grew up in the United States , both of us started snorkeling when we were kids and our hearts have never left the ocean .
Our passion for marine life and our concern over the threats to their environment have impacted the course of both of our lives and I ’m thrilled to be working together toward change . "
If you 're in a buying mood for your girlfriend or wife ( or both , and yes , I assume you , dear reader , are a man - have you seen our demographics ?
I have , and maybe 3 of you are women ) and want 5 % of your money to go to a cause you care about , the Protected Paradise compacts are available for $ 90 each at Neiman Marcus , Bergdorf Goodman , Barneys New York , and other retailers none of us have ever visited .
But here 's the fun part - a description of what this compact is .
I did not write this next part , as you will be able to tell instantly .
Marketing people can write anything with a straight face , though , so I will reproduce it here :
Each galvanized nickel compact contains brilliantly colored powders in an intricately embossed design that depicts the diverse beauty of an underwater marine ecosystem .
The artfully rendered design includes : two fish , representing a host of overfished and endangered species ; a school of small “ forage ” fish that serve as a critical food source for larger marine animals and are at risk from overfishing ; a sea horse , which is being heavily exploited globally for use in aquariums and traditional medicines ; coral , an integral and threatened part of the marine ecosystem that is being profoundly affected by climate change , pollution , habitat degradation and disease ; and a graceful expanse of sea grass , which serves as a crucial source of shelter and nutrition for fish but is being destroyed by threats such as nutrient pollution and siltation .
Did you count those adjectives ??
Brilliantly , intricately , diverse , artfully ... I could go on , but they had me at ' siltation . '
So go drop $ 90 on whatever a compact is if your girl is the kind who will appreciate it and you can be happy knowing $ 4.50 goes to save our oceans .
If you have no significant other to drop $ 90 on , I want you to know Chantecaille company heiress Olivia Chantecaille is hopelessly unattainable no matter how much you spend .
She 'll look fabulous , you 'll feel ... well , sort of stupid for not giving the whole $ 90 to the Pew Institute , but her looking fabulous and feeling it because you care about her looking fabulous will make that all okay .
You can learn more about the Pew Fellows and their work at http://www.pewoceanscience.org/fellows/2008/, which is the most fabulous part of all .
Happy Earth Day !

A medieval Bible scholar scrutinising parchment documents , or a philologist grappling with the language of the Dead Sea Scrolls would feel at home in the current election campaign .
President Bush has made a virtue out of his verbal clumsiness
Who else would be prepared to agonise over the true meanings of a few words , the way the candidates , their surrogates or the ringside observers of my profession are ?
The last time I came across this degree of semantic scrutiny was at Oxford University , where jealous academics took special glee in gouging each other 's eyes out over a few misused words .
The tribe of Obama is currently battling the tribe of Clinton over the exact meaning of the word " bitter " .
Gritty origins
Just how elitist , arrogant and out of touch was the Senator from Illinois when he claimed small town Americans were clinging to guns and Jesus - that obvious combination - because of bitterness about the economy , political neglect and goodness knows what else ?
" The wholesome heartland does n't do bitter " , came the response .
But then some citizens from the heartland piped up and protested that , yes , they did have every right to feel bitter , because their lives were suitably miserable .
Just as his advisers thought that he had lost the vote of every gun owner in the US - an estimated 190 million people !
- Obama got the endorsement of the American Hunters and Gun Owners Association .
As someone who covered the war in Bosnia , I can attest to the fact that landing at any airport during the conflict was ... tinged with misgivings about sniper fire and bullets
To hammer home the point he was filmed shooting hoops in sweat pants , hardly an elitist pastime , and his wife Michelle took to the airwaves flaunting her own gritty working class origins .
Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton made sure she was being filmed handling super - sized tankards of beer in a working class bar in Philadelphia , hoping that no one would ask her whether she preferred Chardonnay to Sauvignon Blanc .
The bitter row about " bitter " was preceded by the embarrassment of Hillary claiming that in 1995 she had been threatened by sniper - fire as she disembarked from a plane in war - torn Bosnia .
The TV footage , instantly to hand , showed the former First Lady grinning , ambulating and showing no visible signs of stress .
Goodness !
As someone who covered the war in Bosnia , I can attest to the fact that landing at any airport during the conflict was an experience less unpleasant that being stranded at Heathrow , but nevertheless tinged with misgivings about sniper fire and bullets , even if you grinned your way through them .
Snooty media Absurd as they are , both episodes have bled into the opinion polls .
Hillary is deemed less honest as a result and Obama too snooty for that demographic he so desperately needs to woo in order to win - disgruntled white men .
As I was feeling very bitter this morning - in a white male kind of way - about burning my toast because I had got too absorbed in the Washington Post , a thought occurred to me .
Time to cut Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama some slack ?
No -one ever hauled George W Bush over the coals for using a wrong word , which betrayed the real guy behind the mask .
That 's because George Bush was constantly misspeaking .
Bush 's character survived his language .
His mask always jelled with the Mensch behind it .
He is veneer all the way through .
Bush wallowed in dysfunctional grammar , merrily made words up as he soldiered gamely from one linguistic train wreck to the next .
And although some snooty , snarling types in the media made fun of him , no - one ever really held it against him .
George Bush brilliantly realised the benefit of inarticulacy - if you make a habit of botching language , how can anyone hold a single misspoken word against you ?
One of the best applause lines in his 2004 stump speech involved the President making fun of his own inarticulacy .
I saw Bush 's linguistic charm work its magic during one of the debates with John Kerry .
' Too smooth '
The venue was Phoenix and we were closeted in a windowless hotel ballroom with the polling guru Frank Luntz and 30 of his human guinea pigs , each strapped to an electronic dial .
There were 10 Republicans , 10 Democrats and 10 independents .
In the US , the right to express an opinion is underpinned by the Constitution , frequently leavened at church and nurtured at school
Bush fluffed his way through virtually every answer and Kerry slithered with lawyerly precision from one cogent point to the next .
Afterwards Frank asked the audience :
Who won the debate ?
26 hands went up for Kerry .
Who would you vote for ?
Astonishingly , 24 hands shot up for Bush .
" But he lost the debate ? " Frank asked .
" Yes , but Kerry sounds too smooth " , an indignant chorus retorted .
Let me state very clearly at this stage that I do n't buy into the widely held European notion that Americans are inarticulate .
The opposite is the case in my experience .
Show and tell
You rarely meet an American who is lost for words .
Their right to express an opinion is underpinned by the Constitution , frequently leavened at church and nurtured at school where even the youngest children are encouraged to stand in front of a crowd and talk about their favourite fluffy toy .
It 's called show and tell .
But the language has to ring true and that 's where John Kerry fell short and George Bush scored well .
No , I am not really arguing for the triumph of botched language .
If anything , this drawn - out election campaign has dished up some of the best speeches given on any campaign trail in recent years , from both Democratic candidates .
But with our culture of instant blogs and excessive scrutiny , where no candidate can utter a single word without it being recorded and dissected , we are in real danger of scaring our politicians into inoffensive blandness .
Then we really would n't know who they really are .
So let 's cut Hillary and Barack some slack .
Let them misspeak without fear of recrimination or persecution - long live ineloquenceness !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A small explosion damaged a U.S. military recruiting station but caused no injuries in New York ’s Times Square before dawn on Thursday , triggering a Pentagon alert for other stations across the country .
“ We ’re treating it as if it were an incident of vandalism , ” Army spokesman Paul Boyce said at the Pentagon .
Times Square -- the normally bustling “ Crossroads of the World ” with shops , restaurants , hotels , theaters and office towers -- was largely empty when the crude bomb went off at around 3:45 a.m. ( 0845 GMT ) .
Low - grade explosives packed in an ammunition box cracked the recruiting station ’s thick glass door and twisted its metal framing , police said .
The blast also shattered a window encasing the classic poster of Uncle Sam saying “ I Want You . ”
In Washington , the Homeland Security Department said there was no sign of an immediate threat to the United States from the incident and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said there was no initial sign of any link to terrorism .
The Army sent a notice to its 1,650 recruiting stations nationwide to remind recruiters to be careful , Boyce said .
New Yorkers have been on alert since al Qaeda militants used hijacked planes to destroy the World Trade Center towers in Manhattan on September 11 , 2001 , killing more than 2,700 people .
The Twin Towers were also targeted in 1993 by a truck bomb that killed six people .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly showed reporters a security camera video of the blast and said police were looking into similarities to small explosions at the British and Mexican consulates in 2005 and 2007 , also in the early morning hours .
The video was dark and grainy , but Kelly said it showed a person on a bicycle approaching a traffic island , dismounting and walking to the door of the recruiting station .
The person leaves shortly before the blast .
A witness described the suspect as “ fairly large ” but could not say for sure whether it was a man or a woman , Kelly said .
TARGETS OF PROTEST
The one - story recruiting center in a traffic island in the middle of Times Square invites people to sign up for the U.S. armed forces and periodically attracts anti-war protesters .
The Granny Peace Brigade , an anti-war group that has frequently held protests at the site , denounced the bombing and disassociated itself from “ mindless acts of terror . ”

The blast occurred before the fifth anniversary on March 19 of the start of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the attack was an insult to all military personnel serving around the world .
A witness told police of a hooded person with a backpack riding a bicycle “ in a suspicious manner ” in front of the station shortly before the blast , Kelly said .

The bomb was larger than those used in the grenade attacks on the British and Mexican consulates , Kelly said .
He said it could have caused injury or even death .
In May 2005 , the British consulate in New York was attacked by two small pre-dawn blasts from two “ novelty ” grenades in the shape of a pineapple and a lemon .
Last October , the same types of grenades were used in blasts at the Mexican consulate .
In both incidents , a man was seen fleeing on a bicycle .
Kelly said he could not definitively say Thursday ’s blast was linked to the two consulate attacks but it was “ certainly a possibility ” given the similarity in the time of day , sighting of a person on a bicycle and size of the blasts .
He said forensic teams would investigate whether they were in fact linked .
Nino Reyes , 26 , told Reuters he had just opened his coffee and snack stand when he heard an explosion and saw a plume of smoke shoot up .
Two post - graduate students have discovered a type of shrew never before seen in Ireland .
It is the first time in 44 years that a new mammal species has been found in the country .
The discovery was made by Dave Tosh from Belfast 's Queen 's University and John Lusby of UCC's Zoology , Ecology and Plant Science Department .
The two were investigating the diet of barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick and found skulls belonging to the greater white - toothed shrew in the birds ' pellets .
They noticed that the skulls were unusually large for Ireland 's native pygmy shrew .
The find led scientists to trap seven of the shrews alive at four locations in Tipperary last month .
The greater white - toothed shrew , Crocidura russula , has a natural range which extends across parts of Africa , France and Germany .
It has been spotted before in the Channel Islands and the Scilly Isles .
Mr Tosh said the discovery came after a research officer from BirdWatch Ireland sent him pellets from owls in Tipperary and Limerick .
He added : ' It was amongst a batch that I was about to dry in an oven that I noticed a very large shrew skull .
' Having looked at hundreds of pellets from Ireland already I knew that what I was looking at was very unusual as our native pygmy shrew is very small in comparison .
' I ended up looking through more and more pellets and discovered more and more of the strange shrew skulls . '
John Lusby has been collecting the pellets as part of his PhD studies , collaborating with Mr Tosh .
Mr Lusby said they noticed the large shrew skulls in the pellets and knew they were different .
The animal is likely to have been introduced recently to Ireland .
About half of Ireland 's estimated 60 mammal species are thought to have been brought to the island by humans .
The last new mammal to be discovered in Ireland was the bank vole in 1964 .
Professor Ian Montgomery , head of the School of Biological Sciences at Queen 's , said : ' Most species which occur in Ireland also occur in Britain but the nearest this species of shrew has been found is on the Channel Islands and the Scilly Isles .
' These records are evidence of at least one recent introduction event , probably accidental , from continental Europe to Ireland and has resulted in a rapid increase in numbers over a short period . '
He said the discovery raised ecological issues which need to be further studied .
While the creature is likely to help threatened birds of prey including the barn owl , it could lead to the loss of small native mammals including the pygmy shrew .
“ One of the fundamental issues in physics right now – and for the past many years – is whether or not bosons can form a supersolid phase , ” Frédéric Mila tells PhysOrg.com .
Mila is a scientist at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne Switzerland .
“ We show how a supersolid phase may be achieved in a quantum antiferromagnet . ”
Mila worked with Schmidt and Dorier , also at EPFL , and with Läuchli at the IRRMA in Lausanne on this project .
Their work , which relies on a model of bosons with correlated hopping , is described in Physical Review Letters : “ Supersolid Phase Induced by Correlated Hopping in Spin - 1/ 2 Frustrated Quantum Magnets . ”
“ One of the issues has been whether or not a boson system can simultaneously form a superfluid and a crystal at the same place , ” Mila says .
“ Most of the work has been done with helium - 4 , but at this point it is still debated whether a supersolid phase can be realized .
But , ” he continues , “ for bosons already on a lattice , it may be easier to make a superlattice and realize a supersolid which may be seen in nature . ”
In and email , Mila explains that one difference from the main approach to inducing a supersolid state in actual bosons ( like helium - 4 ) is to “ deal with effective spin 1 triplet excitations induced by a magnetic field in certain quantum antiferromagnets , such as dimer models realized for instance in several copper oxides . ”
Indeed , these excitations behave like bosons - those particles , such as photons or pions , with integral or zero spin .
“ The analogy between bosons and quantum magnets has proven to be very fruitful during the past ten years , ” Mila says , “ and there is a one - to - one correspondence between spin supersolid and bosonic supersolid . ”
Additionally , Mila reports , the Lausanne team also made use of frustration in quantum magnets to induce correlated hopping between these bosons , whereby a boson can hop provided there is another boson nearby .
This correlated hopping forms the basis of the model that Mila and his peers investigated : “ Our paper shows that if bosonic triplets move through correlated hopping , the system will want to form a local solid order in order to gain kinetic energy , ” Mila says , “ thus realizing a spin supersolid ” .
Mila admits that right now this work is still speculative : “ So far compelling evidences have not been detected in the best copper oxide candidate [ SrCu 2 ( BO 3 ) 2 ] . ”
Mila points out that , “ a supersolid is expected to undergo two phase transitions upon lowering the temperature where the two types of order develop , and only one has been reported in that compound .
One cannot exclude that experiments were not performed at low enough temperature , but this could be due as well to anisotropy effects . ”
There is potential for future uses of bosons that could display two orders in the same system .
“ First of all , ” Mila says , “ experimentally and fundamentally it would be interesting . ”
But there are also possible materials applications .
“ As far as the future goes , there is general agreement that materials that could have two different types of orders at once would be interesting . ”
He is quick to qualify : “ Of course , we are very far from any such applications . ”
For now , though , Mila is content to try and pursue the experimental route .
“ Our first interest is actually to convince experimentalists to look at quantum magnetism to see if there could be a supersolid phase . ”

The Failure of Journalism in Iraq
On March 22 , an Economist magazine editorial described the recent violence in Tibet as a “ colonial uprising ” , a “ revolt ” against foreign occupation .
This was accurate , as was the implication that China has no legitimate claims over Tibet .
( ‘ A colonial uprising — Tibet , ’ The Economist , March 22 , 2008 )
By contrast , recent media coverage of the fifth anniversary of the 2003 US - UK invasion of Iraq depicted the conflict as an “ insurgency ” , with the US military engaged in “ counter - insurgency ” .
American media analyst David Peterson commented :
“ In other words , in Tibet , China is a colonial power and does n’t belong there .
Okay .
But in Afghanistan and Iraq , the U.S. military forces are not a colonial power imposing their will from the outside , but do belong there , quite unlike the people who are resisting the U.S. forces , who clearly lack this right . ” ( E- mail , March 22 , 2008 )
Instead , in covering the fifth anniversary , the media emphasis was on the success of the “ surge ” in reducing violence .
The invasion may have been a disaster , we were told , but the addition of 30,000 extra US troops has stabilized the situation , and so the troops should stay until ‘ the job is done . ’
The presupposition is that the US - UK presence has some kind of legitimacy .
Anyone seeking the logical basis for this idea need look no further than George Bush Sr. ’s comment towards the end of the 1991 Gulf War : “ What we say goes . ”
An Independent editorial inevitably focused on “ the totality of our failure ” and “ the intelligence debacle , ” rather than on crimes and audacious lying .
The editors commented :
“ Removing a dictator was only to be the start ; the objective was a benign and democratic Middle East — an environment in which Israel and the Palestinians could make peace , and energy exports were plentiful and secure . ”
( Leader , ‘ Five years after the invasion , the totality of our failure is clear , ’ The Independent , March 19 , 2008 )
The Independent is happy to take these claims on trust from the same leaders who lied about everything else .
Compare this to an online BBC version written by Paul Reynolds , who has consistently shown a willingness to respond to the many net - based activists who have e-mailed him :
“ [ The invasion ] was intended , its proponents argued , to remove a threat to world peace and to plant the flag of freedom in a Middle East democratic desert . ”
And :
“ The critics countered that the threat was an illusion , that the US was invading illegally and sought control over the region and Iraq ’s oil . ”
Offering the official view as argument , rather than fact , and pairing it with a dissident view of events is the least one should expect of serious journalism .
The Independent commented on Iraqi violence :
“ The indiscriminate killings may have slowed , but ethnic cleansing continues apace . ”
Iraqis have been killing Iraqis , then .
As ever , the US and British armies ’ direct responsibility for mass death is treated as a non-issue .
Jason Hurd served in central Baghdad from November 2004 until November 2005 .
He has told of how , after his unit took “ stray rounds ” from a nearby firefight , a machine gunner responded by firing over 200 heavy caliber rounds into a nearby building :
“ We fired indiscriminately at this building .
Things like that happened every day in Iraq .
We reacted out of fear for our lives , and we reacted with total destruction . ”
Hurd said the situation deteriorated rapidly while he was in Iraq :
“ Over time , as the absurdity of war set in , individuals from my unit indiscriminately opened fire at vehicles driving down the wrong side of the road .
People in my unit would later brag about it .
I remember thinking how appalled I was that we were laughing at this , but that was the reality . ”
( Dahr Jamail , ‘ We Reacted Out of Fear , and With Total Destruction , ’ Inter Press Service , March 14 , 2008 )
Everyone who cares to check on the internet knows that this is the reality , and yet it rarely disturbs the media focus on “ sectarian violence ” .
The photojournalist and chronicler of the Vietnam War , Philip Jones Griffiths , who died last month , commented on one of his pictures of a wounded Vietnamese civilian :
“ This woman was tagged , probably by a sympathetic corpsman , with the designation ‘ Vietnamese civilian ’ .
This was unusual .
Wounded civilians were normally tagged ‘ Vietcong suspect ’ and all dead peasants were posthumously elevated to the rank of ‘ Vietcong confirmed . ’ ”
Who can doubt that much the same is true of the latest wars ?
Iraq veteran Jody Casey blew the whistle on one of the orders he had been given :
“ ‘ Keep shovels on the truck and an AK [ - 47 assault rifle ] , and if you see anybody out here at night on the roads , shoot them .
Shoot them , and if they were n’t doing anything , throw a shovel off . ’
At that time when we first got down there , you could basically kill whoever you wanted — it was that easy . . . ” ( See our Media Alert , ‘ You could kill whoever you wanted , ’ April 19 , 2006 )
The Truth Behind “ The Surge ”
The success of the “ surge ” is , itself , largely fictional .
In Current History ( December 2007 ) , journalist Nir Rosen argued that the main factor in reducing levels of violence was probably that there were just fewer people to kill after the terrible ethnic cleansing that Iraqis blame on the invasion .
A second factor was the actions of tribes , with US funding and support , to drive out Iraqi al - Qaeda .
A third factor was the Mahdi army truce .
A fourth factor may well have been the presence of 30,000 more US troops .
Like most media , the Independent was again content to report the official view as fact :
“ The controversial troop surge briefly subdued the violence but at tremendous cost in men and material . ” ( op. cit )
The claims of reduced violence are likely much exaggerated .
In a briefing to the German Parliament in Berlin last month , epidemiologist Les Roberts of Columbia University said :
“ Belligerents in times of war almost always downplay the number of deaths they induce … in spite of hundreds of members of the press being present , that is exactly what has happened in Iraq . ”
Over the previous two months , Roberts observed , the Iraqi Government and US military claimed that there had been 1,099 violent deaths in Iraq .
This was repeated endlessly in the press as evidence that the “ surge ” is working .
Roberts commented :
“ Virtually no one has pointed out the absurdity of these numbers .
If this is true , it suggests that the murder rate in Iraq is half that seen in Detroit and Baltimore in 2006 , and significantly lower than the rate in Jamaica and Venezuela . ”
Few journalists are aware that even in pre-war Iraq in 2002 , “ only about one - third of deaths in Iraq were recorded by the government . ” ( Roberts , Ibid )
No one would argue that a newspaper count of reported rapes in London , say , would represent more than a small fraction of all such attacks , and yet journalists assume that death rates in Iraq from newspaper reports are mostly complete .
Thus , on March 11 , the prestigious Reuters news agency informed readers :
“ The latest tolls from the widely cited human rights group Iraq Body Count ( IBC ) show that up to around 89,300 civilians have been killed since 2003 . ”
In reality , IBC record violent deaths of civilians as reported by the media .
They also include records from morgues and hospitals .
The Independent answered the question , ‘ Who won the war ? ’:
“ Not the 90,000 Iraqi civilians or the 4,200 US and UK troops killed since 2003 . ”
The 4,200 figure is accurate ; the 90,000 figure is an appalling journalistic failure .
Cockburn should understand by now what the IBC figures represent — even IBC does not suggest that they represent a total for civilian casualties .
The BBC told the public ( March 22 ) :
“ The campaign group , Iraq Body Count , says the civilian death toll since March 2003 is between 82,000 and 89,000 , although it warns many deaths may have gone unreported . ”
In October 2006 , The Guardian ‘s former political editor Michael White , wrote of the 2006 Lancet study of post- invasion mortality in Iraq :
“ I have two problems .
Firstly , the figures offered by the study range from 392,976 to 942,636 , so the 655,000 estimate splits the difference .
This is both strikingly imprecise ( not necessarily avoidable ) , and also at variance with other estimates , both governmental and more disinterested . ”
( White , ‘ A serious note of caution .
I have two problems with the Lancet ’s headline - grabbing estimates of Iraqi casualties , ’ The Guardian , October 12 , 2006 )
The idea that the 655,000 figure simply “ splits the difference ” was a gross error .
How can we explain the appearance of such a comment in a major UK newspaper ?
Last week ,
White wrote to journalist and filmmaker Gabriele Zamparini on the same issue :
“ Thanks for your email about the casualty rate in Iraq .
I read it with interest , a complex subject which arouses strong emotions as well as difficult technical arguments about data and methodology which few of us ( certainly not me ) can claim to understand . ”
It is appalling that , in 2006 , White could write with such ignorance to a key national audience on such a vital matter .
We might think the media just chatter away and are of no great consequence .
But in fact journalists have immense power to affect the fate of human beings .
George Monbiot wrote in 2004 that “ the falsehoods reproduced by the media before the invasion of Iraq were massive and consequential : it is hard to see how Britain could have gone to war if the press had done its job . ”
( Monbiot , ‘ Our lies led us into war , ’ The Guardian , July 20 , 2004 )
Once again we are faced with the ( selective ) lack of quality control in the mainstream media — journalists can write almost any old rubbish as long as it does not pain elite interests .
Although White ’s honesty is admirable , his confession inevitably recalls former New Statesman editor Peter Wilby ‘s observation :
“ I have often expressed the view that journalism needs a social class category all to itself .
It is not a profession ( no esoteric knowledge ) nor a skill ( many hacks , including me , do n’t have shorthand ) nor a working - class occupation ( no manual labour ) .
I would call it unskilled middle class . ”
( Wilby , ‘ The making of a tyrant , ’ The Guardian , December 10 , 2008 )
To its credit , The Guardian did achieve a first in mainstream journalism in five years by at last offering an excellent in - depth analysis of the death toll in Iraq .
( Jonathan Steele and Suzanne Goldenberg , ‘ What is the real death toll in Iraq ? ’
The Guardian , March 18 , 2008 )
In his recently submitted dissertation for the Department of Politics at the University of Bristol , ‘ Medialens and Britain ’s role in World Politics : An Assessment , ’ MSc degree student Brett Gillman , while generally supporting the work of Media Lens , commented :
“ The disagreement with IBC should be viewed as a tactical mistake particularly due to the negative publicity created . ” ( p.53 )
In fact any publicity for the catastrophe afflicting the civilian population of Iraq is extremely welcome , the issue having received close to zero serious analysis ( as is standard for all US - UK wars ) .
Of course there are costs but the choice is a simple one : fall silent or speak out .
Noam Chomsky makes the point with his usual élan :
“ One can proceed — that is , if one is interested in truth and justice and immune to shrieks of horror and a deluge of brickbats . ”
( Chomsky blog , ZNet , March 27 , 2008 )
The evidence that IBC ’s figures are a massive undercount is by now overwhelming — most likely by an order of magnitude ( ie roughly a factor of 10 ) .
Living Dangerously — Journalism In Iraq
Last month , the BBC ’s Rageh Omaar gave an idea of the sheer scale of the problem when he noted that “ our ability to report … has been eroded , to the point where journalists , however large and well - funded their news organisation , can only try to provide a snapshot of the war ’s impact on Iraqi society . ”
Omaar added that “ operating there as a journalist has never been harder . ”
A November 2007 survey of journalists working in Iraq by the Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEW ) confirmed Omaar ’s view .
The journalists — most of them “ veteran war correspondents ” — described conditions in Iraq as “ the most perilous they have ever encountered , ” and that this above everything else was influencing coverage .
A majority of journalists surveyed ( 57 % ) reported that at least one of their Iraqi staff had been killed or kidnapped in the previous year alone — and many more are continually threatened .
Last month , Reporters Sans Frontieres ( RSF ) reported that a total of 210 journalists and media assistants had been killed since March 2003 , with only “ an insignificant number ” of investigations into the deaths by the Iraqi authorities resulting in arrests .
The lack of government action is unsurprising .
Responding to the US military ’s arrest of one his journalists in Iraq , Associated Press president Tom Curley noted last month that at least a dozen other Iraqi photographers have been detained or arrested .
Curley commented :
“ It ’s impossible not to conclude that the words and pictures these journalists produced were considered unhelpful to the war effort and that their arrests would have served a broader strategy of information control . ”
( David Edwards and Muriel Kane , ‘ US Arrests Iraq Journalists To Censor News , ’ Associated Press , March 20 , 2008 )
Patrick Cockburn reported that when a bomb exploded in the Karada district of Baghdad , killing 70 people , the police beat and drove away a television cameraman trying to take pictures of the atrocity .
Despite recognizing government pressures and the extreme risks of reporting in Iraq , Cockburn confidently asserted : “ Civilian casualties have fallen from 65 Iraqis killed daily from November 2006 to August 2007 to 26 daily in February . ”
But as we have seen , these figures are not remotely reliable .
A majority of journalists surveyed by PEW said most of the country was too dangerous to visit .
Nine out of ten said this was true of at least half of Baghdad itself .
Even the basics of getting the story are remarkably difficult .
Outside of the Green Zone , most American journalists are forced to rely on local staff to do face - to - face reporting .
But nearly 90 percent of journalists say local staff cannot carry any equipment — not even a notebook — that might identify them as working for the western media for fear of being killed .
According to an earlier RSF report ( September 7 , 2007 ) , 73 percent of journalists killed had been directly targeted , a figure that was “ much higher than in previous wars . ”
And , as we have previously discussed , ample evidence supports the common sense understanding that the media ’s ability to accurately monitor violent deaths decreases sharply as journalists are directly targeted .
( See our alert )
The BBC reported that only 28 % of Americans recently polled could correctly identify the number of US troops killed in Iraq ( 4,000 ) , compared with more than half in August last year .
But public awareness of the Iraqi death toll is very much lower .
A poll by the University of Maryland a year ago found that most Americans believed that less than 10,000 Iraqis had died because of the invasion ( Roberts , op. cit ) — a figure that was likely 10 per cent of the real number .
A reasonable approximation of the truth is out there — but our media just do n’t want to see it .
What a difference five weeks makes .
Around the ides of March , we had the mind - focusing spectacle of the possible implosion of Bear Stearns , which was feared to take down a lot of the financial system .
But Fed and JP Morgan to the rescue , Lehman presents earnings that depend entirely on accounting rather than business activity , namely , widening credit spreads that made its own outstanding debt worth less , and everything is hunky dory .
Oh , yes , UBS announces losses equal to 5 % of Swiss GDP , but that too is rationalized as a sign that the Swiss giant has gotten past its bad patch .
And while the earnings reports from Bank of America and National City were less than stellar , the Bank of England has thrown in the towel , and following the Fed , will accept £ 50 billion of mortgage debt as collateral ( actually , they are on - upping the Fed ; the BoE ’s loans have an one - year term ) .
And while critics in the UK say this program wo n’t revive the housing market , that may not be the point of this exercise .
Most observers have deemed the credit crisis to be over , and are now focusing on such pressing questions as how fast the recovery will be and how bad inflation might get .
Perhaps I am inflexible and unable to adapt to new information , but I do n’t see what has been accomplished beyond kicking the can down the road three to nine months .
As reader Scott noted :
Basically what ’s happened is that we ’ve moved bad paper from the banks , where it needed to get marked to market , at least at some point , to the Fed , where that does n’t have to happen .
It ’s a sort of out of sight out of mind phenomenon .
But all those CDOs and MBS and CLOs are made up of individual mortgages , and of hung LBO loans .
They will either be paid off in the end , or they ’ll go into default .
Assuming , as I think seems right , that some of them default , the Fed will have another line item on its balance sheet , REO .
So as I see it , it ’s absurd to say the credit risk has been “ disappeared ” ; it ’s just been moved from the banks to the public .
Let ’s consider just a few unpleasant realities .
The Journal today points out that banks are increasing reserves , which means they need more capital ( um , guess regulators are riding them to provide for likely losses ex ante rather than when they can no longer avoid taking them ) .
The US consumer at some point is going to have to reduce spending as a percent of GDP ; the open question is whether that happens in time to avert a dollar crisis ( given the Fed determination to reflate assets and preserve demand , we seem to have an answer as far as the intent of policy is concerned ) .
But then again , as reader Steve pointed out , Fed governor Frederic Mishkin testified before Congress last week that small businesses , the big engine of job growth , are starting to have trouble getting credit ( they are heavily dependent on loans collaeralized by real estate and credit card borrowing , both of which are scarce and costly now ) .
And our old litany of woes has merely retreated from the fore rather than gone away : we still have the monolines almost destined to come apart at some point , the fact ( as John Dizard pointed out ) bigger GSEs are systemically destabilizing due to their pro-cyclical hedging , the not trivial problem that the housing market wo n’t bottom till 2010 at the earliest , with more writedowns resulting , and my pet worry , CDS .
As I understand it ( and better informed readers can chide me if I am wrong ) , the CDS market basically has to keep growing to stand still .
Again , perhaps I am too old school , but with inadequate margining / equity provisions , it seems guaranteed to go into crisis .
You do n’t get happy endings with ever mushrooming bets on underlying equity that fails to show corresponding growth .
Today , we had the biggest bank fundraising announced to date , RBS ’s hugely dilutive £ 12 billion equity sale ( and that ’s in addition to £ 4 billion of asset sales ) .
Reader Steve pointed us to a key item from the press release : the Scottish bank ’s writedowns are markedly deeper than those taken by US banks to date , suggesting that the worst is not over on this side of the Atlantic .
They have marked their US Alt - As at 50 % of face , subprime at 38 % , and CMBS at 83 % .
Eeek .
Steve ’s remarks :
{ The ] RBS summary is damn sobering and is likely the first example of the greater transparency that BOE / Treasury are demanding from UK banks in exchange for the new borrowing facility .
RBS may have exaggerated the marks to give themselves wiggle room , since they really ca n’t go back to the cap markets for a while .
But still , the difference from marks at US banks ( particularly commercial banks ) is sobering and a sign that the crisis is going to drag on `in full opacity ’ in the US for quite some time .
With this prelude , we came across some wide - ranging forecasts that we thought we ’d share , just in case readers wanted to hear different points of view .
There is one at the Financial Times , which I sadly can’t re-access now ( the FT server is not responding ) but I believe I can recount reasonably accurately .
The gist is that the credit crisis is an Anglo - Saxon , credit markets phenomenon .
Neither Asia nor Europe is big on capital market intermediation , hence they will not be affected much , if at all , by the credit crisis .
Thus emerging markets will be unscathed , making inflation the far bigger risk .
While the risk of inflation may well be underestimated , I have trouble with the notion that the credit crisis is as contained as the authors suggest .
Spain and Germany are seeing more than a wee bit of banking stress ; Eastern Europe , my sources tell me , is having a serious real estate contraction which is certain to have an impact on credit availability and the economy .
We have reader Scott ’s comments on emerging markets , which seem sound to me :
[ ]n a very broad sense that emerging economies will at some point be stronger than developed ones .
But I expect them to suffer a bunch of pain–at least as much , and perhaps more , than we do–before they rebound more strongly than we will .
I see China in a more or less analogous spot to where , say , the semi manufacturers were at the end of the tech bubble .
They were way down the supply chain , far removed from the ultimate customers , so they did n’t see the slowdown until it clobbered them in the face .
In the same way , China ’s been building capacity sufficient for a world with limitless credit and capital at its disposal , and we ’re now in a world very different from that .
Loyal Prudent Bear readers no doubt caught Doug Noland ’s weekly article ; I usually prefer the Asia Times version simply because they edit it a tad .
Noland is predictably pessimistic ; he now thinks we are going to enter an inflationary crisis that will lead to an even more wrenching ( but not fully spelled out ) ending than if the authorities had not intervened .
The whole piece is worth reading , but here are some key bits :
….we live in a unique world of unregulated credit .
Excess has evolved to the point of being endemic to an apparatus that operates without any mechanism for adjustment or self - correction .
There is , of course , no gold reserve system to restrain domestic monetary expansions .
Some years back , the dollar - based Bretton Woods global monetary regime lost its relevance .
And , importantly , the market - based disciplining mechanism ( “ king dollar ” ) that emerged at times to ruthlessly punish financial profligacy around the globe throughout the nineties has morphed into a dysfunctional dynamic that these days nurtures self - reinforcing excesses .
The “ recycling ” of our “ bubble dollars ” ( in the process inflating local credit systems , asset markets , commodities and economies across the globe ) directly back into our securities markets rests at the epicenter of global monetary dysfunction .
A historic inflation in dollar financial claims was the undoing of anything resembling a global monetary system , and now this anchorless “ system ” of wildcat finance is the bane of financial and economic stability .
To be sure , massive and unrelenting US current account deficits and resulting dollar impairment have unleashed domestic credit systems around the globe to expand uncontrollably .
Today , virtually any major credit system can and does inflate domestic credit to create the purchasing power to procure inflating global food , energy , and commodities prices …. …. there are reasons to expect this uninhibited global credit bubble to instead run to precarious extremes , and for resulting monetary disorder to become increasingly problematic .
Destabilizing price movements and myriad inflationary effects are poised to worsen .
The specter of yet another year of near $ 800 billion current account deficits coupled with huge speculative outflows of dollars is just too much for an acutely overheated and unstable global currency and economic system to cope with .
in the face of a rapidly weakening economic backdrop , global inflation dynamics coupled with our highly maladjusted economy ensure intractable trade deficits .
I would further argue that the current inflationary backdrop will prove an impetus to credit creation that then begets only more heightened inflationary pressures .
There are certainly indications that the over - liquefied global system is not well situated today to handle more dollar liquidity ( akin to throwing gas on a fire ) .
Inflation and its consequences have quickly become major issues around the world .
With crude hitting a record $ 117 at the end of last week , there is every reason to expect that newly created global liquidity will further inflate energy , food , and commodity prices generally .
The Goldman Sachs Commodities index has gained 21 % already this year .
But when it comes to monetary instability , our financial markets might just prove the unappreciated wildcard .
When the Fed and Washington radically altered the rules of US finance last month , they placed in jeopardy huge positions that had been put in place to hedge against and profit from systemic crisis .
With the end of stage one arises a major short squeeze in the credit , equities , and derivatives markets .
And when it comes to contemplating the scope and ramifications of today ’s hedging activities , we ’re clearly in uncharted waters .
It is not beyond reason that a disorderly unwind of bearish credit market positions could incite a mini bout of liquidity , speculation , and credit excess that exacerbates global monetary instability while setting the backdrop for stage two of the crisis .
Last but not least , we have a fact filled , very informative , and somewhat curious piece from the Financial Times , “ Road to ruin ?
America ponders the depth of its downturn . ”
The article goes through the cases for whether the US will have a V , U , or L shaped recession .
The Fed believes in the V , based on its rate cuts and the stimulus package ( gee , when it was proposed , most respectable economists viewed it as costly window dressing ) , but the “ great unknown ” is what happens to housing ( really ? ) .
What is striking about the piece is the number and range of not - positive views and factoids .
A sampling :
Alan Blinder , a professor of economics at Princeton and a former Fed vice - chairman , says the economy will struggle to return to normal growth in the face of “ super - headwinds ” emanating from the financial sector .
With banks under balance - sheet pressure and the financial system as a whole deleveraging , the credit squeeze on the real economy could continue even after the risk of a systemic crisis in the banking sector recedes .
Moreover , the impact of the tightening to date is only now beginning to be felt in the economy .
Richard Berner , chief US economist at Morgan Stanley , who expects a lacklustre recovery , says that “ given the time lags between when financial conditions tighten and when it shows up in the economy we still have a long way to go . ” ….
“ The trillion - dollar question is what happens to consumption – is the US household going to rein back its spending ? ” says Raghu Rajan , a professor at the University of Chicago ’s Graduate School of Business .
As results from US retailers indicate , the consumer is already pulling back .
“ But the real question is has it got much further to go ? ”
Mr Rajan says economists do not fully understand why the savings rate collapsed from the early 1980s , making it hard to be sure at what rate it might rise again .
Most explanations suggest some combination of increasing wealth ( first from equities , then housing ) and financial innovation , which made it easier to access the wealth represented , for instance , by home equity .
Kenneth Rogoff , a professor at Harvard , says US consumer spending would have to adjust following the reversal in house prices , even if there had been no accompanying credit crisis .
As things stand , “ even if we take away the immediate financial crisis , we are still left with a story where the whole credit structure that propagated the housing boom and credit boom has been seriously compromised , ” he says .
Most experts believe the US savings rate will rise as households start to repair their balance sheets , but that this will happen gradually , muting rather than derailing economic recovery .
There is a risk , however , that under stress this adjustment could be more abrupt .
Moreover , the longer an economic downturn lasts , the greater the strain on the financial system .
The IMF already estimates that losses and writedowns on all debt and securities – not just subprime mortgages – could total $ 945 bn .
Nouriel Roubini , a professor at New York University and chairman of RGE Monitor , an economic research firm , argues that underwriting standards deteriorated across a wide range of credit products during the boom , and that economic stress will result in a sharp rise in defaults and delinquencies on non-mortgage debt such as car loans , credit cards and leveraged loans .
The part I found the most surprising was when it acknowledged that a doomsday scenario seemed less likely given aggressive central bank action , but then started undercutting even that idea :
Policy activism is not a guarantee of success .
The US ’s large current account deficit increases the risk of a dollar crisis and a sudden pick - up in inflation expectations – a threat that has looked worryingly real at moments in recent months .
Moreover , there are some financial risks – such as multiple ruptures in the credit default swaps market , which banks and other financial institutions use to trade and hedge credit risk with each other – that would be very difficult for the Fed and Treasury to contain even if they wanted to .
The US government is also in a worse fiscal position than it was in 2001 , making it harder to sustain an aggressive fiscal policy such as the Bush tax cuts and increased government spending that helped pull the US out of recession last time .
Yet the likelihood is that the US – with even its external debts denominated in its own currency – has both the economic capacity and political will to prevent an L - shaped recession taking hold .
In an election year , the pressure is for action .
The US should manage to avoid an L - shaped recession – and may even escape with a short V - shaped recession .
The danger is that the extreme measures taken – already including the extension of the safety net to investment banks and the loosening of constraints on government - sponsored enterprises to support the housing market – could lay the seeds for the next financial and economic crisis .
If you believe Noland , that next crisis is waiting in the wings .
Poll :
Make gas guzzlers pay higher fees Californians want vehicles that pollute to pay a penalty
Californians support the idea of charging " green " vehicle fees that would make drivers of gas guzzlers pay higher taxes and offer discounts for those driving less - polluting vehicles , according to a survey by a transportation researcher at San Jose State University .
The state now charges drivers registration and licensing fees and gasoline taxes at rates that do not take into account vehicles ' pollution levels .
But the survey , conducted by Asha Weinstein Agrawal , a research associate with the university 's Mineta Transportation Institute , found that Californians would support a variety of taxes and fees to raise money for transportation improvements as well as combat global warming , including :
-- Raising vehicle registration fees , which now average $ 31 , to an average of $ 62 and having higher - polluting vehicles pay higher rates and cleaner cars lower rates .
-- Offering rebates of up to $ 1,000 for people who buy new cars that emit very little pollution and levying a surcharge of as much as $ 2,000 on those purchasing gas hogs .
-- Levying a mileage - based tax that would replace the 18 - cents - per - gallon gasoline tax .
The per-mile amount would vary depending on how much a vehicle polluted the air .
" The public is very supportive of these green taxes and fees , " said Agrawal .
" This shows that it is realistic to improve the way we collect transportation taxes in this state . "
The idea of using incentives to persuade motorists to drive cleaner , greener vehicles is nothing new .
People who buy hybrid vehicles get federal tax credits , and drivers of electric , natural gas and some hybrids are allowed access to carpool lanes even if they are n't carrying any passengers .
A bill that would have offered rebates to buyers of cleaner , greener vehicles made it to the Assembly floor last fall before failing .
Taxes or fees that penalize drivers of more - polluting vehicles are relatively uncommon , though some have been proposed , including a bill by Assemblyman Jared Huffman , D - San Rafael , that would allow the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to impose a 10 - cents - a - gallon gas tax in the nine - county Bay Area , pending voter approval .
Bills in the works
Sen .
Tom Torlakson , D - Antioch , has proposed legislation that would allow , with local voter approval , regional transportation agencies to impose a " greenhouse gas mitigation and funding fee " on motor vehicle registrations .
And Assemblyman Mike Feuer , D - Los Angeles , has proposed a gas tax increase of up to 9 cents a gallon , or a $ 90 registration fee hike , to fund transportation improvements and fight global warming in Los Angeles , also pending voter approval .
According to the San Jose State poll , Californians are warming to the idea of such incentives and taxes .
Sixty - three percent of those surveyed said they would support raising vehicle registration fees to reward drivers of cleaner cars , Agrawal said , compared with 40 percent support for a flat - rate increase .
A tax and rebate system for vehicle purchases , depending on their emissions , was backed by 65 percent of those surveyed .
A vehicle mileage fee of 1 cent per mile driven was backed by 28 percent of those surveyed , and support increased to 50 percent when the amount of the per-mile charge was varied to penalize more - polluting vehicles .
Researchers at San Jose State 's Survey and Public Research Institute made 1,500 random calls to adults statewide between Jan. 20 and Feb .
1 . The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points , Agrawal said .
The researchers will delve into the results more deeply to study how support for the taxes and fees varied by geography , demographics , type of vehicle driven , driving behavior and environmental concerns , she said .
" We might as well design our taxes and fees in a way that encourages people to make more sustainable choices , " Agrawal said .
Randy Rentschler , spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission , said the state already has an effective method for taxing drivers who spew more greenhouse gases into the environment : the gasoline tax .
Gas tax already penalty
The gas tax penalizes those who drive gas guzzlers , and rewards those whose cars consume less fuel , he said .
But the tax , last raised in 1984 , has failed to keep pace with inflation , the state 's growth or its increasing transportation needs .
And with the high price of gas , politicians seem disinclined to propose a gas tax increase .
" There is no problem with the gas tax , " Rentschler said .
" The problem is a political problem - a lack of political will .
The gas tax has become a political third rail - no one wants to touch it . "
State Sen . Tom McClintock , R - Thousand Oaks ( Ventura County ) , also said green pricing is unnecessary in California .
" We already have variable fees based on gas consumption .
It 's called price , " said McClintock , vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee .
" If you have a gas guzzler , you pay more to run it , which is an incentive to frugality .
" Anything else is just a clever attempt to wheedle more money from motorists , " he said .
Interview Well , here I am just a few miles from Yahoo ! ' headquarters and Microsoft's Silicon Valley residence .
It 's Sunday , and I 've yet to hear screams from either camp .
So , it seems that Microsoft 's call to action deadline around the Yahoo !
buy is passing with a lack of fanfare .
Yahoo !
may surprise us yet by leaking something to the New York Times or perhaps Steve Ballmer will call up his buds at the Wall Street Journal , but in lieu of such actual movements , I 'm left wanting .
And so it seems appropriate to turn back to Mark Shuttleworth , the ultra-rich spaceman funding the Ubuntu operating system project .
As our stats logs tell it , you people can't get enough of this dude even though he 's suspected of torturing woodland creatures in a Chelsea dungeon .
Whatever .
Call your local PETA representative .
The open source march will not be stopped by some bloodied wombats and pandas .
During a recent interview in London , Shuttleworth had plenty to say about Microhoo .
" The Microsoft and Yahoo thing is fascinating , " he told me .
" I think the ad game is lost .
So , Microsoft buying Yahoo !
now on search ?
Come on .
Two failing operators will just continue to decline together .
On search , I think it 's totally a waste of time . "
Well , if the deal is not about selling search ads , then what 's going on here ?
" Yahoo is basically a conduit to a content creation company , and I think that is a deadly business to be in , " Shuttleworth said .
" For Microsoft to own more content when content is unprofitable and content generation is unprofitable is risky , I think . "
Gee thanks , Mark .
The content creation business is actually tremendous .
Especially when you readers click on the ads surrounding this story .
Can you see them ?
( Actually , forget the ads .
Just send me an e-mail , and I 'll direct you to my PayPal account . )
" So , for Microsoft , this deal is all about flailing , " Shuttleworth said .
" For them to succeed in that next generation game , they will need to have a vision that is better than Yahoo !'s vision , which is better than Google 's vision , and they need to execute it .
" I think this game will swing from the desktop to the web and eventually back again in really interesting ways .
They already have a hell of a big investment in whatever their vision is .
It 's not like they were waiting to buy Yahoo !.
They were spending gagillions of dollars , which they have , on data centers for that sort of vision .
So , what does Yahoo give them then ?
A brand , which they will probably screw up . "
Even with all that going for Microsoft , Shuttleworth found time to highlight another troubling area .
" Integration is one problem , but no one is talking about another of Yahoo ! 's big issues , which is salaries .
Their strategy was basically to hire thousands of people to create content and thousands of them in countries where they are cheap .
We see the salaries in those countries going right through the roof .
So , I wonder if Microsoft is n't about to swallow a hand - grenade . "
Ballmer swallows hand - grenades for breakfast , Mark .
That 's part of what battling anti-trust regulators for years and years and years is all about .
Why do you think he looks that way ?
Ah , but there is a plus side to this whole planned acquisition , and that 's the open source angle .
The Clinton campaign is confident of a Pa. victory , but downplays talk of a double - digit win .
Five things to watch in Pennsylvania
PITTSBURGH – When the Democratic presidential primary moved to Pennsylvania in early March , the central question was never whether Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton would win the state .
Rather , it was by how much .
Six weeks later , the question remains the same .
Advertisement
Amidst a high stakes game of managing expectations , Sen. Barack Obama and his top advisers conceded Monday that they expected to lose .
The Clinton campaign , meanwhile , remained confident but downplayed talk of a double - digit win .
With so much riding on the expected margin of victory , here ’s a guide to what to look for as the primary results trickle in .
Check for turnout at 1 p.m .
By this point Tuesday , the campaigns should have a good sense of what kind of outcome to expect .
They will look first to Philadelphia , where a crush of voters early in the day will bode well for Obama and badly for Clinton since it will signal that he could win the big margin he needs to take out of the city .
Plus , African Americans tend to go to the polls later in the day in Philadelphia , according to a city - based Democratic strategist , which means Obama can expect a late surge from voters who support him in disproportionately high numbers .
Do n’t be fooled by early results .
The cities and suburbs usually report their returns first , which gives the candidate favored in those areas a quick – and sometimes fleeting – lead .
The conservative - leaning small towns through the center of the state usually filter in much later in the evening .
This tendency has wreaked havoc in past elections : A Democrat goes to bed thinking he or she is the winner , but wakes up the loser .
The last time it happened was 2004 , when the Associated Press called the state attorney general race for Democrat James Eisenhower and retracted it later in the night as the numbers closed .
Some newspapers went to print with the wrong results .
So Obama could show a lead in the early results , but it might be short - lived .
If Clinton is ahead at the start , she may never lose it .
Follow the undecideds .
For weeks , the campaigns have been trying to convince a stubborn group of undecided voters – an average of nine percent in polls released Monday – to make up their minds .
Voters who decide late usually go with the candidate who represents something new , potentially giving the edge to Obama .
But in this Democratic primary season , voters who have decided in the last three days have more often broken in Clinton ’s favor .
Obama and Clinton each invested significant time in recent days in Central Pennsylvania , where polls have found a slightly larger pool of undecided voters than other regions .
Watch these towns and neighborhoods .
While the campaigns are reluctant to disclose the places they will be looking at , here are some key precincts , wards and towns that unaffiliated Pennsylvania political strategists say they will be monitoring .
Obama should be aiming for at least 55 percent turnout in African American wards in Philadelphia , 60 percent in the upscale white neighborhoods of Center City Philadelphia , and 70 percent in Lower Merion , the wealthy Philadelphia suburb with large numbers of highly educated and increasingly liberal voters .
The best indicator of the level of Obama support among younger voters — a group pollsters worry may not have been captured in recent surveys — will be turnout in places like State College , home to Penn State University ’s main campus , or the precincts around smaller schools like Muhlenberg College in Allentown .
Clinton needs strong turnout in Northeast Philadelphia , a string of largely white , blue collar neighborhoods , and in working - class Philadelphia suburbs such as Bensalem and Bristol .
Key counties to keep an eye on .
Political analysts point to the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary between Ed Rendell and Bob Casey Jr. as the closest comparison to the match up between Obama and Clinton .
Rendell won that closely contested race with a coalition of African Americans and upscale , highly educated white voters — a coalition like the one assembled by Obama .
Casey focused on blue collar workers , union households , lower - income individuals and ethnic white voters — strikingly similar to Clinton ’s base in Pennsylvania .
Rendell beat Casey by winning only 10 counties out of 67 in the state .
The governor won Philadelphia by 160,000 votes , and swept the four suburban counties — Bucks , Chester , Delaware and Montgomery — with 80 - 90 percent of the vote .
He carried the Lehigh Valley , which includes Allentown , Bethlehem and Easton , by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
He edged out Casey in Penn State ’s Centre County by five points .
Casey won the other major population centers in Southwest and Central Pennsylvania , but not by enough to offset Rendell ’s advantage in the populous Southeast .
To duplicate Rendell ’s victory , Obama would need to show a similar level of strength as Rendell in the Philadelphia region and in the Lehigh Valley .
But no polls have found him getting anywhere close .
Obama remains in a dead heat with Clinton in the Lehigh Valley , said Christopher Borick , a pollster at Muhlenberg College , but he needs closer to 55 percent of the vote .
While a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday found him leading by 13 points in Philadelphia , four points in the Southeast and six points in Central Pennsylvania , that ’s still not going to be enough to carry him statewide .
An overwhelming turnout , however , would boost his numbers , analysts said .
Across the state , in Pittsburgh ’s Allegheny County , Obama will need to stay within about five percentage points of Clinton to sustain his chances for a win .
In order for Clinton to win a decisive victory of 10 points or more , she needs to win two - thirds of the votes in a group of eight industrial - oriented counties , each of which has 55,000 or more registered Democrats .
Those counties are Lackawanna ( Scranton ) and Luzerne ( Wilkes - Barre ) in the Northeast , Erie in the Northwest , Cambria County ( Johnstown ) , and the Pittsburgh - area counties of Westmoreland , Fayette , Beaver , and Washington .
In south central Pennsylvania , which got lots of attention from both candidates , Lancaster and Adams counties will provide a glimpse into Obama ’s popularity with newly - registered Democrats .
Though these areas have traditionally elected Republicans , they ’ve experienced significant growth as affluent residents have moved in from Baltimore , D.C. and southeastern Pennsylvania .

And I totally agree , I always thought the Pentagon had all sorts of air defense equipment around it ; that they could take out anything that was coming at it .
And for a plane to be able to just fly low right over Washington and slam into that thing is just -- I mean , you still just shake your head .
How in the world could that happen ? ”
Fred Burks , former Presidential interpreter , is another State Department veteran who questions the official account of 9/11 and who signed the petition to reinvestigate .
“ How is it possible that our military 's highly touted missile detection systems could not locate Flight 77 in the 42 minutes it was known to be lost before it crashed into the heart of the defense system of the U.S. ? , ” he asked in an essay . [ 4 ]
During his 18 - year State Department career , Mr. Burks served as interpreter for Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton , Vice Presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore , Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and many others .
Mr. Burks continued , “ An even bigger question is why is n't our media asking these questions ?
Why is n't our military spending many millions of dollars to find out why military defense systems failed on 9/11 ?
Why is it that the 9/11 commission budget was far less than the budget allotted to the Challenger Disaster or even the Monika Lewinsky affair ?

Making a surprise visit to Iraq , because announcing such trips in advance would be too dangerous , Dick Cheney said that , " It 's good to be back in Iraq , " as he praised the " dramatic improvement in security . "
Cheney landed at Baghdad International Airport , then flew by helicopter into the dusty , heavily secured Green Zone ...
For security reasons , Cheney officials divulged few details about the vice president 's schedule and asked reporters not to report on his location until he had moved on to another ... Cheney 's motorcade zigzagged through Baghdad to meetings as helicopter gunships circled overhead .
Can a stroll through a bustling Baghdad market be far behind ?
According to Cheney 's aides , Dick will be highlighting the drop and violence and the progress by the Iraqi government .
This after a week that has seen 13 U.S. soldiers and 157 Iraqis killed .
And the Iraqi government ?
It was more than a year ago that George Bush said :
To establish its authority , the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq 's provinces by November .
To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country 's economy , Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis .
To show that it is committed to delivering a better life , the Iraqi government will spend $ 10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs .
To empower local leaders , Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year .
And to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation 's political life , the government will reform de-Baathification laws , and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq 's constitution .
... and vowed that " America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced . "
But according to Cheney :
... it has been a difficult , challenging but nonetheless successful endeavor ... and it has been well worth the effort .
Long before fantasy leagues and Moneyball , baseball players , managers and fans embraced statistics .
Of course , common stats like batting or earned run average are relatively easy to quantify because there are a only finite number of possible outcomes in hitting or pitching .
But creating a model that accurately reflects the fielding performance of individual players is a much greater challenge .
For one thing , fielding is a more continuous aspect of the game , so there 's an enormous amount of data to analyze .
And that requires developing new statistical methods .
This week at the AAAS conference in Boston , Shane Jensen of the
University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School presented a method he developed called the Spatial Aggregate Fielding Evaluation
( SAFE ) .
Jensen 's method uses a probability model to fit a smooth curve for entire teams , particular positions or individual players .
So far the model has produced some surprising results .
For example , it might stand to reason that running backward to catch a fly ball might be more difficult — and therefore have a lower probability of success — than running forward .
But in fact the opposite is true .
The important variable , Jensen says , is actually the ball 's hang time in the air .
It also turns out that fields with a non-standard shape — like Beantown 's own Fenway
Park with the Green Monster looming in left field — do n't make as big a difference as people might think .
And by analyzing four years of high - resolution data from Baseball Info Solutions ( BIS ) — containing information on some 120,000 balls in play per year — Jensen was able to rank the best and worst fielders at each position based on the number of runs saved or cost .
The results showed what Derek
Jeter - haters have long suspected : that with and average of 13.81 runs lost per season , he 's a lousy short stop .
Meanwhile , his teammate
A - Rod is one of the best in the league with and average of 10.4 runs saved .
But what the model does n't — and can 't — take into account are intangibles like charisma and grace .
As the influential baseball writer Bill James once wrote : “ Hitters are judged on results ; fielders , on form . ”

Laying fibre in sewers saves costly and disruptive road digging
Fibre firm H2O provides super - fast broadband via the sewers and either Bournemouth , Northampton or Dundee will be offered the service first .
It will compete with more established companies , such as Virgin Media , which is speeding up its cable network .
It follows government concerns that the UK is not embracing next - gen broadband .
Transforming services ?
While other countries ' plans for next generation broadband - offering speeds of up to 100 M bps - are well advanced , the UK has slipped down the speed league tables .
For consumers , super - fast net connections could create a range of new applications including on - demand high definition ( HD ) TV , DVD quality film downloads in minutes , online video messaging , CCTV home surveillance and HD gaming services .
Last month BT announced that its own fibre to the home trial at Ebbsfleet in Kent would see the first homes connected by August of this year .
But this will initially be limited to around 600 new houses .
The development will eventually have some 10,000 homes connected via fibre with speeds of up to 100 M bps but the project will take until 2020 to complete .
We are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband
Elfed Thomas , H20
Future broadband technologies
While BT has pledged to provide all new housing estates in the UK with fibre connections it has not yet made clear its plans for existing homes .
The current telecommunications system was never designed to carry data and many have called for an urgent fibre upgrade .
BT has argued that with costs of up to £ 15 bn to roll out such a network it needs to be convinced of demand and have assurances from the government that it will be able to recoup its investment .
At the end of last year , Virgin Media announced that it would be upgrading its entire cable network - which covers half of UK homes - to provide speeds of up to 50 M bps ( megabits per second ) and this is expected to begin towards the end of this year and be completed in 2009 .
London - based firm Geo , which also offers fibre via the sewers , serves mainly businesses but also leases its fibre to consumer providers such as Tiscali and Carphone Warehouse .
Broadband caution
Antony Walker , head of the UK's Broadband Stakeholder 's Group , cautioned that the H20 scheme could not create a fibred Britain alone .
" There are clearly benefits to using the sewers and this fibre deployment is good news but it is only a small piece of the jigsaw , " he said .
The burgeoning fibre market is going to be a tough one for providers , according to Ian Fogg , an analyst with JupiterResearch .
" An optimistic view is that they will need penetration rates of between 15 and 20 % of households in a particular area and with so many providers offering services that makes the business case very challenging , " he said .
Mr Thomas of H2O is confident that its mega - fast service will have instant appeal for consumers and is pleased to be the first to offer such high speeds .
" We are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband , " he said .
The service will be delivered to individual homes via a four - inch box attached to the house .
It will also serve local businesses and council services .
Bournemouth , Northampton and Dundee have been selected because H20 has already installed its fibre service to local council buildings .
The fact that the sewer - based fibre takes advantage of existing ducting means there is no need for expensive and disruptive road digging , making the system faster and cheaper to deliver .
" While deploying traditional fibre over a two - kilometre area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
We can do it in four hours , " said Mr Thomas .
Mr Thomas said the sewers solution was a lot cheaper than the conventional route of digging up roads .
" An average town of 75,000 homes would cost someone deploying traditional fibre between £ 50 m and £ 70 m .
We can do it for 20 to 30 % of that , " said Mr Thomas .
H20 said it is in " advanced talks " with media partners and internet service providers who will offer the service to consumers .
The first of these partners is due to be announced next month .
Roll - out in the chosen town will begin in September and take 18 months to complete .
Mr Thomas hopes to add another 14 towns over the next five years .
NEW YORK , Feb 28 ( Reuters ) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N will wind down its First Franklin subprime mortgage lending unit , responding to continued deterioration in U.S. mortgage markets , business news channel CNBC reported on Thursday .
The move could result in the elimination of 400 to 500 jobs , CNBC reported .
Merrill Lynch declined comment .
Merrill Lynch bought First Franklin from Cleveland - based bank National City Corp NCC.N in December 2006 for $ 1.3 billion , just before the subprime mortgage market began to collapse .

From Politics 101 : Do n’t revive a controversy that your wife ’s campaign is trying to lay to rest .
Bill Clinton , who is often called one of the savviest politicians of his generation , may have missed that particular lesson .
Or perhaps he was just a forgetful 60 - something .
Either way , he did Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign no favors Thursday when he brought up her recent misstatements about being under sniper fire in Bosnia .
Not only did he resurrect a subject that his wife no doubt wishes everyone would forget , but he rushed to her defense with a series of inaccuracies .
He also suggested that his wife , who is running for president in part on her preparedness to handle emergencies in the middle of the night , might have forgotten details of the incident because she was 60 , forgetful and tired .
“ When they ’re 60 , ” he said of reporters who , he believes , have overdramatized the episode , “ they ’ll forget something when they ’re tired at 11 o’clock at night , too . ”
Mr. Berlusconi will make a fuller statement Tuesday .
But he promised immediate action on many of the problems vexing Italians , like the trash crisis in the south that has tarnished the nation ’s image and the sale of the near - bankrupt national airline , Alitalia .
The election  called just two years after Mr. Berlusconi lost to Mr. Prodi  was considered one of the least exciting in memory , with many Italians doubting that either candidate could accomplish any meaningful change .
But in some basic ways , the election signaled a decisive shift in a nation whose politics have been unstable because of the narrow interests of its many small parties .
Mr. Veltroni , heading the new Democratic Party , the result of a merger of the two largest center - left parties , had refused to run with far - left parties , as Mr. Prodi had done .

As a result , the ANSA news agency reported that the number of parties in the lower house of Parliament , the Chamber of Deputies , would drop to just 6 from 26 .
For the first time since World War II , there will be no one in Parliament representing the Communist Party , which has long played an important part in leftist politics here .
Mr. Veltroni , in fact , started his political career as a Communist .
Experts on the left and the right said  and in some cases lamented  that the election had shown a shift toward a more American - or British - style system of two dominant middle - ground parties .
“ It ’s a Waterloo , ” said Tuesday ’s headline in the moderate left daily Il Riformista .
Its editor , Antonio Polito , a departing senator from the now - defunct Margherita Party , said , “ The left is disappearing for the first time in history . ”
Referring to Mr. Veltroni ’s party , he added , “ The only party that managed to save itself after two disastrous Prodi years is a party that is modeling itself after the Democratic or Labor Parties ” in the United States and Britain , respectively .

Okay , so we made it past the doomsday of Y2 K … but now , another technological apocalypse is on the way .
At least , if you believe AT&T .
A company exec has started quite the buzz by predicting we ’ll reach the end of the internet by the year 2010 .
CNET
News reported the warnings from AT&T ’s vice president of legislative affairs , Jim Cicconi , made during a London - based eForum this week .
“ We are going to be butting up against the physical capacity of the internet , ” CNET reports Cicconi claiming .
The exec ’s reported comments go on to say the ever - increasing amounts of high bandwidth content , such as videos and other multimedia streams , will reach a point that ’s higher than the current internet infrastructure can handle .
And his statements get even more extreme , going as far as claiming that within three years , “ 20 typical households will generate more traffic than the entire internet today . ”
Of course , Cicconi goes on to mention how AT&T is spending billions of dollars to upgrade its systems to stay ahead of the curve .
So is this a real threat , or is it just another Y2K - esque conspiracy theory ?
Let ’s weigh it against other 2010 predictions floating around the net right now :
Religious author Roderick C. Meredith says the world could end altogether in under two years .
Better back up your data .
Others interpret biblical texts to believe a worldwide holocaust will come that same year .
In a slightly less deadly prediction , business expert Dave Chase foresees Google as becoming the world ’s biggest ad agency by 2010 .
Back in the late 80s , Apple put out a promo showing the computer of the year 2010 .
The video is worth a watch .
Audience - measuring giant Nielsen sees valet parking and metal detectors at grocery stores by 2010 .
And , slightly later , the geek classic Back to the Future 2 had a grand vision for the year 2015 .
I , for one , am still hoping it happens .
Do you buy the “ end of the internet ” theory , or any of the other predictions above ?
Or maybe you have some insight of your own ?
The floor is open for discussion .
And if your premonition includes the hoverboard , for the love of God , let me know where it ’ll be sold .
About 100 police officers have been sent to investigate the incident
Scene of the incident
Vandals have desecrated 148 Muslim graves in France 's biggest WWI cemetery , officials have said .
A pig's head was hung from one headstone and slogans insulting Islam and France 's Muslim justice minister were daubed on other graves .
President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned the attack as a " hateful act " and the " most inadmissible kind of racism " .
About 78,000 colonial subjects of France , including many Muslims from North Africa , died in the war .
The Notre Dame de Lorette war cemetery , near Arras in northern France , is on the site of some of WWI 's largest battles .
About 100 police officers have been sent to the cemetery to investigate the incident .
President Sarkozy has called for the rapid detention and punishment of those responsible .
In a similar attack in April 2007 , Nazi slogans and swastikas were painted on about 50 graves in the Muslim section of the cemetery .
Two men were sentenced to a year in prison for that act .
It was the young officials at Guantánamo who dreamed up a list of new aggressive interrogation techniques , inspired by Jack Bauer from the TV series , 24 .
But it was the politicians and lawyers in Washington who set the ball rolling .

Senator , as it has reached its apex in their tone - deaf , arrogant , and insensitive reaction to the remarks of Geraldine Ferraro ... your own advisers are slowly killing your chances to become President .
Senator , their words , and your own , are now slowly killing the chances for any Democrat to become President .
In your tepid response to this Ferraro disaster , you may sincerely think you are disenthralling an enchanted media , and righting an unfair advance bestowed on Senator Obama .
You may think the matter has closed with Representative Ferraro 's bitter , almost threatening resignation .
But in fact , Senator , you are now campaigning , as if Barack Obama were the Democrat , and you… were the Republican .
Full Transcripts below the fold ....
Finally , as promised , a Special Comment on the presidential campaign of the Junior Senator from New York .
By way of necessary preface , President and Senator Clinton -- and the Senator 's mother , and the Senator 's brother -- were of immeasurable support to me at the moments when these very commentaries were the focus of the most surprise , the most uncertainty , and the most anger .
My gratitude to them is abiding .
Also , I am not here endorsing Senator Obama 's nomination , nor suggesting it is inevitable .
Thus I have fought with myself over whether or not to say anything .
Senator , as it has reached its apex in their tone - deaf , arrogant , and insensitive reaction to the remarks of Geraldine Ferraro ... your own advisors are slowly killing your chances to become President .
Senator , their words , and your own , are now slowly killing the chances for any Democrat to become President .
In your tepid response to this Ferraro disaster , you may sincerely think you are disenthralling an enchanted media , and righting an unfair advance bestowed on Senator Obama .
You may think the matter has closed with Representative Ferraro 's bitter , almost threatening resignation .
But in fact , Senator , you are now campaigning , as if Barack Obama were the Democrat , and you… were the Republican .
As Shakespeare wrote , Senator -- that way … madness … lies .
You have missed a critical opportunity to do ... what was right .
No matter what Ms. Ferraro now claims , no one took her comments out of context .
She had made them on at least three separate occasions , then twice more on television this morning .
Just hours ago , on NBC Nightly News , she denied she had made the remarks in an interview -- only at a paid political speech .
In fact , the first time she spoke them , was ten days before the California newspaper published them ... not in a speech , but in a radio interview .
On February 26th , quoting ...
" If Barack Obama were a white man , would we be talking about this , as a potential real problem for Hillary ?
If he were a woman of any color , would he be in this position that he 's in ?
Absolutely not . "
The context was inescapable .
Two minutes earlier , a member of Senator Clinton 's Finance Committee , one of her " Hill - Raisers , " had bemoaned the change in allegiance by super - delegate John Lewis from Clinton to Obama , and the endorsement of Obama by Senator Dodd .
" I look at these guys doing it , " she had said , " and I have to tell you , it 's the guys sticking together . "
A minute after the " color " remarks , she was describing herself as having been chosen for the 1984 Democratic ticket , purely as a woman politician , purely to make history .
She was , in turn , making a blind accusation of sexism -- and dismissing Senator Obama 's candidacy as nothing more than an Equal Opportunity stunt .
The next day she repeated her comments to a reporter from the newspaper in Torrance , California .
" If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman ( of any color ) he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept . "
And when this despicable statement -- ugly in its overtones , laughable in its weak grip of facts , and moronic in the historical context -- when it floats outward from the Clinton campaign like a poison cloud , what do the advisors have their candidate do ?
Do they have Senator Clinton herself compare the remark to Al Campanis talking on Nightline ... on Jackie Robinson Day ... about how blacks lacked the necessities to become baseball executives , while she points out that Barack Obama has not gotten his 1600 delegates as part of some kind of Affirmative Action plan ?
Do they have Senator Clinton note that her own brief period in elected office , is as irrelevant to the issue of judgment as is Senator Obama's …
… while she points out that FDR had served only six years as a governor and state Senator before he became President ?
Or that Teddy Roosevelt had four - and - a- half years before the White House ?
Or that Woodrow Wilson had two years and six weeks ?
Or Richard Nixon … fourteen ... and Calvin Coolidge 25 ?
Do these advisors have Senator Clinton invoke Samantha Power -- gone by sunrise after she used the word " monster " -- and have Senator Clinton say , " this is how I police my campaign and this is what I stand for , " while she fires former Congresswoman Ferraro from any role the campaign ?
No .
Somebody tells her that simply disagreeing with and rejecting the remarks is sufficient .
And she should then call , " regrettable " , words that should make any Democrat retch .
And that she should then try to twist them , first into some pox - on - both - your - houses plea to ' stick to the issues , ' and then to let her campaign manager try to bend them beyond all recognition , into Senator Obama 's fault .
And thus these advisers give Congresswoman Ferraro nearly a week in which to send Senator Clinton 's campaign back into the vocabulary ... of David Duke .
" Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up .
" Racism works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white .
" How 's that ? "
How 's that ?
Apart from sounding exactly like Rush Limbaugh attacking the black football quarterback Donovan McNabb ?
Apart from sounding exactly like what Ms. Ferraro said about another campaign , nearly twenty years ago ?
Quote :
" President Reagan suggested Tuesday that people do n't ask Jackson tough questions because of his race .
And former representative Geraldine A. Ferraro ( D - N.Y. ) said Wednesday that because of his " radical " views , " if Jesse Jackson were not black , he would n't be in the race . "
So ... apart from sounding like insidious racism that is at least two decades old ?
Apart from rendering ridiculous , Senator Clinton 's shell - game about choosing Obama as Vice President ?
Apart from this evening 's resignation letter ?
" I am stepping down from your finance committee so I can speak for myself and you can continue to speak for yourself about what is at stake in this campaign .
" The Obama campaign is attacking me to hurt you . "
Apart from all that ?
Well .
It sounds as if those advisors want their campaign to be associated with those words , and the cheap … ignorant … vile … racism that underlies every syllable ...
And that Geraldine Ferraro has just gone free - lance .
Senator Clinton :
This is not a campaign strategy .
This is a suicide pact .
This week alone , your so - called strategists have declared that Senator Obama has not yet crossed the " commander - in- chief threshold " …
But -- he might be your choice to be Vice President , even though a quarter of the previous sixteen Vice Presidents have become commander - in - chief during the greatest kind of crisis this nation can face : a mid-term succession .
But you 'd only pick him if he crosses that threshold by the time of the convention .
But if he does cross that threshold by the time of the convention , he will only have done so sufficiently enough to become Vice President , not President .
Senator , if the serpentine logic of your so - called advisors were not bad enough , now , thanks to Geraldine Ferraro , and your campaign 's initial refusal to break with her , and your new relationship with her -- now more disturbing still with her claim that she can now " speak for herself " about her vision of Senator Obama as some kind of embodiment of a quota ...
If you were to seek Obama as a Vice President , it would be , to Ms. Ferraro , some kind of social engineering gesture , some kind of racial make - good .
Do you not see , Senator ?
To Senator Clinton 's supporters , to her admirers , to her friends for whom she is first choice , and her friends for whom she is second choice , she is still letting herself be perceived as standing next to , and standing by , racial divisiveness and blindness …
And worst yet , after what President Clinton said during the South Carolina primary , comparing the Obama and Jesse Jackson campaigns -- a disturbing , but only borderline remark , after what some in the black community have perceived as a racial undertone to the " 3 A - M " ad ... a disturbing -- but only borderline interpretation ...
And after that moment 's hesitation in her own answer on 60 Minutes about Obama 's religion -- a disturbing , but only borderline vagueness ...
After those precedents , there are those who see a pattern ... false , or true .
After those precedents , there are those who see an intent ... false , or true .
After those precedents , there are those who see the Clinton campaign 's anything - but - benign neglect of this Ferraro catastrophe -- falsely or truly -- as a desire to hear the kind of casual prejudice which still haunts this society voiced ... and to not distance the campaign from it .
To not distance you from it , Senator !
To not distance you ... from that which you as a woman , and Senator Obama as an African - American , should both know and feel with the deepest of personal pain !
Which you should both fight with all you have !
Which you should both insure , has no place in this contest !
This , Senator Clinton , is your campaign , and it is your name .
Grab the reins back from whoever has led you to this precipice , before it is too late .
Voluntarily or inadvertently , you are still awash in this filth .
Your only reaction has been to disagree , reject , and to call it regrettable .
Her only reaction has been to brand herself as the victim , resign from your committee , and insist she will continue to speak .
Unless you say something definitive , Senator , the former Congresswoman is speaking with your approval .
You must remedy this .
And you must ... reject ... and denounce ...
Geraldine Ferraro .
Good night , and good luck .

It is the tallest man-made structure in the world – and it is still growing .
When complete next year the Burj Dubai will stretch half a mile into the sky over the United Arab Emirates , taller than three Canary Wharf towers balanced on

When complete next year the Burj Dubai will be taller than three Canary Wharf towers balanced on top of each other
This £ 2 billion marvel , designed by American architect Adrian Smith , is packed with technological innovations , including double - decker lifts that can carry 42 people at a record - breaking 40 mph to the observation platforms , robotic window - cleaning platforms and a system of pipes to collect condensation from the windows .
It will provide about 15 million gallons of water per year – equivalent
to nearly 20 Olympic - sized swimming pools .

The water will be pumped into the site 's irrigation system for use on the
landscaped areas .
Because of its size – more than 6,000 miles of girders , enough to stretch a quarter of the way round the world , have gone into making its 160 floors – evacuation in a fire could be too slow .
Therefore pressurised air - conditioned refuges to allow heat or fumes to escape are situated on every 25th floor , the stairwells are fireproofed and there is a special lift for firefighting equipment .
The Burj will be the height of luxury .
Some of the space will be used for offices but the lower 37 floors will house the world 's first Armani Hotel .
There are also 700 private apartments , and residents will be able to swim in an outdoor pool on the side roof of the 78th floor .

The open source Maemo platform , which is used on Nokia 's Internet Tablet devices , will soon support Trolltech 's Qt development toolkit .
Nokia says that the GTK - based Hildon framework will continue to be used as the primary toolkit for Maemo 's user interface and core applications , but the Qt libraries will be distributed with Maemo so that third - party Qt developers can bring their applications to the platform .
Nokia is currently in the process of acquiring Trolltech and has some ambitious plans to bring Qt support to a multitude of mobile platforms .
Nokia is particularly eager to enable development of applications that can target both Maemo and S60 , a proprietary operating system used on Nokia phones .
We talked to Nokia development platform product manager Quim Gil who provided us with more details about this new addition to Maemo .
" We want to explore cross- platform possibilities between S60 and maemo and we also want to check the interest in the developer community for Qt in the tablets .
GTK + and Qt coexist in the Linux desktop , let 's try the mix in maemo .
This is also a way to attract more attention from the KDE community , a sensible move especially if the Trolltech acquisition gets completed , " Gim told us in an e-mail .
Nokia is also actively sponsoring an Ubuntu ARM port that will bring the popular Linux distribution to Nokia 's Internet Tablet devices .
The ARM Ubuntu builds , which are being developed by Ubuntu's Handheld Mojo team , can be tested in QEMU or run from an SD card in an actual Internet Tablet device .

BBC News , Jakarta
Classmates at Mr Obama 's school in Jakarta noted his early ambition Primary School 1 in Jakarta 's Menteng district is an unlikely place to look for an American presidential hopeful .
Hidden down a narrow street in the Indonesian capital , overlooked by the big houses of the city 's elite , it is easily missed , except for the bubbling noise of schoolchildren drifting over the fence .
But this is where Barack Obama - the man aiming to be America 's Democratic nominee for president - spent some of his childhood .
He 's made much of his varied upbringing during the course of his campaign , and the qualities and vision it gave him .
A new book about his time here has just been launched by an Indonesian publisher - and there 's also a lot of interest in what he might do for US - Indonesia relations should he reach the White House .
' Early ambition '
In the playground of his old school , I met up with two of his classmates - Mary and Rina .
Was there anything special about him , I asked ?
Most Indonesians do believe a change in the White House will bring about a new attitude towards America here .
" No , " said Mary .
" He was n't a special boy , just an ordinary one .
But maybe that 's the special thing ; he had a capability to blend with any kind of situation . "
One thing marked him out as different though , said Rina - his ambition , noted in the school memoir book .
" At that time , here in Indonesia , all the parents pushed their kids : ' You have to become a doctor ' or ' You have to become an engineer ' , " she told me .
" But he wrote that he'd like to be a president .
So we thought , ' Oh in your dreams ! ' "
Well , a lot has changed since those days .
Barry , as he was known then , is now campaigning to be the Democratic nominee for exactly that job .
And his progress is talked about a lot in Indonesia - on campus , on television , and of course on the internet .
' There 's obviously interest ' Enda Nasution is one of the country 's best - known bloggers .
Two months ago he started a group on the networking website Facebook called " Indonesians for Obama 08 " .
There is great interest in the US elections in Indonesia Already he has around 700 members , and a lively message board .
He told me Mr Obama 's appeal was n't based on his policies - in his opinion there 's little difference on that score between the three main presidential hopefuls .
But , he said , people are looking for a certain kind of character : " Someone we can trust ; someone that can inspire people ; that can symbolise all the things currently happening in the world . "
The US embassy here has also been tapping into this new - found interest in their elections .
In February , when the US primary race reached a crescendo on Super Tuesday , Ambassador Cameron Hume invited Indonesian students and politicians to his house to watch the results come in .
He has n't been surprised at the level of interest in Mr Obama , given that his primary school is around the corner .
" There obviously is an interest , the same way as whenever there 's an ethnic tie , people get more interested .
So if you have a candidate from Wyoming , people from Wyoming are more interested in the election .
I think that spreads a little bit here . "
Rooting for opponents
The identification is running pretty strong , judging by a mock - vote , held at the Super Tuesday event .
According to Ambassador Hume , it gave Mr Obama a win that " his campaign team probably would have been satisfied with " .
So is there anyone here who 's rooting for the other candidates ?
Well yes , of course there is , Julia Ismaya for one , an employee of an international NGO .
She likens " Obama syndrome " to a kind of MTV culture , where television picks on a particular theme , and the audience internalises it .
It may be more about identity politics than actual policy , but most Indonesians do believe a change in the White House could bring a big change in the US 's attitude to their country .
After years of a foreign policy that many Indonesians viewed as anti-Muslim , who better to have in the most powerful job in the world , they say , than someone who 's lived among Muslims , and seen their world from the inside .

What are these ?
Muslim Martin Luthers The Theologians Working Towards a Euro - Islam
Leading Muslim scholars are laying the theological foundations for a " Euro - Islam " which would reconcile their religion with the challenges of modernity .
But just how compatible is Islam with secular Western values ?
Among the most powerful trends of the last three years has been the emergence of community / social media / social - networking sites with large user bases and incredible traffic .
The traffic enjoyed by these successful virtual communities creates financial incentives for bad actors who want to hijack traffic for their own purposes .
The open participation inherent in user generated content provides numerous opportunities for the parasitic marketer .
Exploits can take the form of spam posts , sock puppetry , trust fraud , and scams that use social engineering to take advantage of the good faith users .
The exploit may also be by way of paid advertising that promote illicit or illegal activities ( porn , pills , casinos , and payday lenders ) or ads that insert malware on users ’ computers .
These anti-social and sometimes criminal activities are generally carried out despite the wishes of the site owners and community residents .
In the physical world , spam , scams , and unsavory promotions have parallels : billboards , liquor stores , and payday lenders on every street , and prostitutes and hustlers on every corner .
These are the telltale signs of urban blight in a community and , left unchecked , lead to abandoned and neglected property and a spiral of decay .
Urban blight creates flight ; anyone who can afford to leaves .
Virtual blight in an online community drives away “ respectable ” traffic and depreciates the contributions of community members , reducing or destroying the value of a brand .
Internet marketers invest substantial effort and money to make their websites successful and build a brand .
To preserve that brand from the ravages of blight , marketers need to consciously combat it on their own sites and ensure that their marketing efforts do not create or fund blight on other sites .
The Ten Commandments for online marketers
There is one Internet .
It is a shared resource .
Any marketing strategy that relies on polluting the internet by pushing unwanted noise into community space is suspect .
It is one thing to strategically place information scent that leads users to your site ; it is another to spray that scent on every tree and fire hydrant .
You shall use neither bots nor macros to create links , nor spread comments promoting your site .
Spambots can not only cause your site to be banished by search engines , they leave a huge footprint across the web and can tarnish your brand with a stink that ca n’t be washed off !
You shall not allow your advertising and affiliate dollars to go to scrapers , scammers , nor spammers .
Advertising budgets are the fuel that drives the spread of blight across the internet .
Make sure your money is not promoting blight even if you must forsake short term profits in favor of protecting your brand .
While it is easy and tempting to pour money into any channel with a positive ROI , you may be cannibalizing your brand in the process .
Even if your strategy is making money and your brand survives , you are funding parasites who devalue the communities that support your business .
Honor your visitors .
Do not sell impressions or links to companies you do not vet .
As a publisher , you are endorsing your advertisers every bit as much as if you give them an editorial link .
Caveat Emptor may be the motto of cut throat capitalism , but it is not a good strategy to protect your brand .
If you are not satisfied with the moral and ethical practices of your advertisers , do not sell them advertising .
Syndicated advertising networks offer an easy path to monetizing traffic in the short term but you risk associating yourself with the sites where you advertise .
You shall not make use of sock puppet accounts for vote stacking , spamming friend requests , nor other schemes .
Sock puppetry and false friending is so obviously a form of fraud that no one can argue it is an ethical practice .
Do not succumb to the argument that others are doing it if you want to build a sustainable business .
You shall not form cabals nor engage in elitist plots to disenfranchise people .
Karma matters .
If you treat others badly , they will eventually form a mob and come after you .
You shall not grieve other users by spoiling their fun , troll , nor post flame bait to get attention .
Acting up to gain attention only works for a short while , then you get banned , filtered , and ignored .
You shall not scrape content , plagiarize , nor assist in the theft of virtual assets .
Stealing content is stealing , simple as that .
Scraper sites are the most prolific and pernicious form of Made For Advertising ( MFA ) sites .
You shall not distribute badware , scumware , spyware , nor malicious bots .
This point is so self - evident it should n’t have to be mentioned , except that the proliferation of Malware is accelerating and the potential damage it can cause is frightening .
Criminal activities ranging from identify theft , transaction fraud , click fraud , and distributed denial of service attacks are all being carried out by botnets that contain hundreds of thousands of compromised machines .
Most of the global spam problem can be traced to these compromised computers as well .
Despite the clearly criminal nature of malware , Google recently estimated that 1.3 % of search result pages contained a link to a site that potentially could infect the user ’s computer .
Most of these exploits are distributed via Iframe injection through advertising networks .
You shall not covet your neighbor ’s traffic , nor engage in parasitic marketing .
If somebody is doing well , give them a pat on the back instead of trying to pick their pockets .
The commandments represent what Internet users already expect .
Unfortunately , many players rationalize their own breaches whenever a little cheating is profitable .
We , the Internet community , need to take a stand against blight .
Major online properties need a code of conduct to ensure that they do not contribute to the problem , and they also need best practices for controlling blight .
Investors should ask managers what they are doing to protect the value of online assets .
Everybody needs to worry when the next advance in black hat technology has the potential to turn billion dollar web properties into a slag dump .

HALIFAX – An RCMP tactical squad stormed and seized the anti-sealing vessel Farley Mowat today , in a provocative move the federal fisheries minister said would prevent " a bunch of money - sucking manipulators " from interfering with the annual hunt .
Paul Watson , head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , said the seizure of his ship and the arrests of two senior officers amounted to an " act of war " because the vessel is registered in the Netherlands .
Watson , speaking from New York , said armed officers from two coast guard vessels scrambled aboard the Mowat at around 11 a.m. ADT in the Cabot Strait – the body of water between Cape Breton and Newfoundland .
" ( They ) took command of the vessel , and .... they were screaming at people to lie down on the deck . "
The environmental crusader said a communications officer aboard the ship was relaying details of the boarding via satellite phone when the connection was suddenly lost .
Later in the day , Hearn said the ship 's captain and chief officer were arrested for allegedly violating Canada 's marine mammal regulations and the Fisheries Act .
He said those charges were related to a high - seas confrontation in the Gulf of St. Lawrence between the Farley Mowat and a coast guard icebreaker two weeks ago .
" We did the right thing , " Hearn told a news conference in Ottawa .
" I 'd rather act when nobody is hurt , rather than react when somebody got killed . "
The minister bristled at Watson 's suggestion that the seizure represents a public relations coup for his movement as the European Union contemplates a ban on the importation of all seal products .
" These are a bunch of money - sucking manipulators , " Hearn said .
" Their sole aim is to try to suck as much money out of the pockets of people who really do n't know what 's going on , " he said .
Last week , the department brought forward charges alleging the Farley Mowat 's captain , Alexander Cornelissen , and First Officer Peter Hammarstedt broke rules that prohibit anyone without a valid observation licence from coming within 900 metres of the hunt .
Cornelissen is also charged under the Fisheries Act with obstruction or hindrance of a Fishery Officer or inspector .
However , Watson maintains the Farley Mowat does n't have to submit to Canadian regulations .
Hearn rejected that claim , saying the Mowat was seized legally in Canada 's " internal waters , " without providing the specific location of the seizure .
Watson has argued that his vessel never entered Canada 's 12 - nautical - mile territorial limit , but Hearn said the Fisheries Act gave him the authority to take action beyond that line .
" This is just more mouthy talk by people who want to use this to their advantage , " Hearn said .
" Paul Watson is quarterbacking from his nice , posh hotel room in New York somewhere . "
A spokesman for the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs at The Hague , Netherlands , said his government was attempting to learn more about the incident .
" For the moment , we are still verifying the facts , and seeking the opinion of the Canadian authorities and how they justify their acts of today , " said Ahmed Dadou .
In Ottawa , Hearn noted the crew of the Mowat were " safe and unharmed " following the boarding , and their vessel would be taken to Sydney , N.S. , by early Sunday .
Those charged were expected to appear in a Sydney court .
Watson said his group has plenty of graphic footage of seals being slaughtered and he believes the pictures will be damaging to Canada 's reputation .
" I think we 've embarrassed the hell out of the Canadian government and they 're desperate , " he said .
Hearn said the seizure had nothing to do with censorship and insisted the move was not aimed at boosting the federal Conservatives ' flagging fortunes in his home province of Newfoundland .
" It is time something was done and something has been done and it has nothing to do with Newfoundland or what kind of shape we 're in .
This wo n't affect me politically one way or another , " he said .
Meanwhile , the European Commission , the executive branch of the European Union , is awaiting a second report on the seal hunt before making its recommendation to the European Parliament , likely this summer .
The annual hunt started March 28 in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence , then expanded last week to include a portion of the gulf west of Newfoundland .
The main hunt , in an area north of Newfoundland known as the Front , started today .
On March 30 , some seal hunters called for assistance from the coast guard , complaining that the Farley Mowat was getting too close to them on the ice floes about 60 kilometres north of Cape Breton .

The Fisheries Department later said its 98 - metre icebreaker Des Groseilliers responded to the scene and was " grazed " twice by the 54 - metre Farley Mowat .
But the conservation group said its ship was rammed twice by the icebreaker .
The crew aboard the Mowat said they were told not to approach an ice - covered area where seals were being slaughtered , but the crew did not comply with the order .
On April 5 , Hearn said charges had been laid , but he did not say how or when the summonses would be served .
The charges , brought forward in Nova Scotia , could result in fines of up to $ 100,000 or up to one year in prison , or both .
The captain of the Cape Breton sealing vessel who called for help said the arrests were long overdue .
" It 's time , it 's high time , it 's past time that they did something with them , " said Pat Briand of Dingwall , N.S. , the 55 - year - old skipper of the Cathy Erlene .
Watson has denied the Farley Mowat got too close to the hunt and has released a video that shows the two vessels travelling briefly in a parallel course and then colliding twice .
The Sea Shepherd Society and previous incarnations have long used militant tactics to stop hunters from killing seals , whales and other marine wildlife .
The group claims to have sunk six whaling ships since 1979 , saying no one was hurt in those actions .
During the 1980s , Watson harassed Russian whaling ships and Japanese dolphin hunters .
In the mid-80s , he was tear gassed off the Faroe Islands when he tried to stop the sport kill of pilot whales .
In 1995 , he scuffled with an angry mob of angry sealers on Iles - de - la - Madeleine when he went there to stage a protest with actor Martin Sheen .
To be sure , the Canadian Coast Guard and the Fisheries Department are no strangers to confrontation on the water .
On March 9 , 1995 , as Spain and Canada were locked in an emotional battle over the overfishing of turbot just beyond Canadian waters , the coast guard patrol vessel Cape Roger intercepted the Spanish trawler Estai , which cut its nets and fled .
After a lengthy pursuit , the crew of the Cape Roger fired four bursts from .50 - calibre machine gun across the bow of the Estai , which then stopped and was seized by RCMP and Fisheries officers .
Note to readers :
If you come here to leave a comment trying to influence the US election , ah , go away .
I warned weeks ago that mindlessly partisan posts would be deleted .
You know who you are .
The social media world is polluted , corrupted , invaded , twisted and polarized enough without that swill slopping over our gunwales .
None of us know the outcome of November 3rd nor the extent of the ensuing chaos .
There ’s likely no good outcome .
The focus of this blog is not the next American president , but the impact on the economy , taxes , central banks , rates , housing , jobs , assets and financial markets .
If you think in black - and - white , you ’re part of the problem .
Take a hike .
Come back in January .
Got it ?
Good .
Now , about tonight .
The debate in Cleveland .
Many think it will be the political spectacle of a generation .
Despite that , Mr. Market has been chugging along after a recent correction from record levels .
In the face of all the crap 2020 has bestowed upon us – millions out of work , a recession and lots of crippled industries – investors who are ( a ) balanced and ( b ) have ignored everything , retained that 15 % gain they enjoyed last year .
And now with 2021 looming , with a vaccine inching closer and that damn election soon to be in the rear view , no need to change course – regardless of what happens between now and Christmas ( if they let us have it ) .
“ This is the most crucial debate ever , ” analyst Ed Pennock wrote yesterday .
“ Unlikely there ’s a clear winner .
Certainly could be a clear loser .
Markets like certainty . ”
Exactly .
It will come .
What you think of the orange monster or the drooling guy is irrelevant .
That big , hairy ( and manly ) delete finger is ready .
Make my day .
Arnie ’s pain : ‘ You really stung me ’
Days ago we eviscerated a dude we called Arnie who wrote asking if he and his mat - leave wife ( three month - old in arms ) should blow their $ 80,000 in savings on a $ 800,000 semi in the distant burbs .
You may recall they earn a collective two hundred grand and now rent in the city for $ 2,500 .
Why buy in the midst of a real estate boom , a recession and a global pandemic , we gently asked ?
Are you just all hopped up on baby hormones and house lust ?
Owning would suck away liquid wealth , increase housing costs by over 70 % , create $ 745,000 in debt and you ’d still only own half a house a long commute away from work .
Why do it ?
In fairness , here is his subsequent lament :
“ I saw you featured my email on your blog today .
I must say I laughed when you did this to others , but it really stung when you did it to me .
“ We do n’t have just 80 k in assets .
We have a bit more , but this is what we ’re prepared to spend on a down payment , because we want a reserve fund and would like to try and be balanced .
“ We do n’t have a balanced portfolio yet , but we ’re immigrants and moved to this country just 3 years ago .
And yes , FOMO and kid are the reasons we want to buy .
When you put it that way , it sucks .
“ Anyway , I ’d like to ask you to be nicer to people who email you , but your incisive comments are the reason we ’re drawn to reading your blog .
By the way , you did n’t answer my question .
Do you think prices of 800 k houses will be lower than 650 k in a few years ?
Let me know .
“ Like I mentioned , it looks like the government is prepared to sell the country in order to keep RE prices up .
Every single financial analyst who predicted the crash is right about the fundamentals , but wrong about the lengths to which the system will go to decouple values from fundamentals .
I have n’t decided whether I ’m going to buy or not , but I was hoping for perspective on how low the crash may go , and how long it will stay down . ”
Arnie ’s big mistake : trying to justify risky personal actions based on macroeconomics .
The question is not where house prices or government policy are going , but if an action is correct based on personal circumstances .
How is that not a simple and clear criterion ?
If you need a home ( a baby does n’t cut it ) and can afford one ( increasing living costs by 70 % is plain unwise ) without draining your net worth ( sorry , Arnie , the RESP and a nestegg come first ) then go ahead and buy .
But not now .
Ever been to Huntsville ?
Take warm undies .
Blog dog Joe has come across a weird situation .
Actually it ’s Joe ’s brother - in - law which has been left shaking his head , wondering what the blazes is goin ’ on down there in the GTA .
Hi Garth .
My brother - in - law in Huntsville and he had his 3 year renter leave when the renter bought his own house .
He put an advertisement on Kijiji for a 2 bedroom apartment to rent in Huntsville and received 344 applications for this .
It took awhile to go through everyone as he wanted the best applicant .
It was quite the shock to receive so many for this place which is about two hours North of Toronto .
So I responded , asking J where all these apps were coming from .
People in the area , maybe , whose igloos had melted over the summer or wanted to move into some kind of habitable shelter before the six months of darkness and roaming bears began ?
That would make sense .
“ No , he said .
“ None of the applications were local .
The Huntsville population is tiny and the Kijiji advertisement went provincial .
It was just a surprise to have that many applications for this one apartment . ”
And this is the topic for today ’s comment section : what the heck ?
Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) Vehicles
Hit the Streets in California , Texas and Georgia
Mar. 27 /CSRwire / - ATLANTA , GA - March 27 , 2008 - UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) today announced the deployment of 167 Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) delivery vehicles in Texas , Georgia and California .
The CNG vehicles , part of UPS 's global alternative fuel fleet , will help reduce the company 's carbon footprint and its dependence on fossil fuels .
Of the 167 new CNG trucks , 25 have been deployed in Dallas ; 42 in Atlanta , and the remaining 100 in five California cities : 30 to Sacramento , 14 to Los Angeles , five to Ontario , 10 to San Ramon and 41 to Fresno .
They join more than 800 CNG vehicles already in use by UPS in the United States .
Previous CNG vehicles in UPS 's fleet were converted from gasoline and diesel vehicles in the 1980s to run on alternative fuels .
The new vehicles are originally manufactured for alternative fuel use .
The largest private " green fleet " in the transportation industry just got bigger .
UPS has expanded its fleet of eco-friendly vehicles with 167 additional CNG ( compressed natural gas ) delivery vehicles .
To date UPS 's alternative fuel fleet has traveled 143 million miles .
" UPS has deployed alternative fuel vehicles for more than 70 years and this CNG deployment is one more step towards the ' greening ' of the UPS fleet , " said Robert Hall , UPS 's director of vehicle engineering .
" Continuing to add CNG delivery trucks to our fleet is a sustainable choice because natural gas is a cost effective , clean - burning and readily available fuel . "
The CNG truck bodies are identical externally to the signature - brown trucks that now comprise the UPS fleet although they will be marked as CNG vehicles .
The trucks are expected to reduce emissions by 20 percent and improve fuel economy by 10 percent compared to the cleanest diesel engines available today .
UPS operates the transportation industry 's largest private fleet of alternative fuel vehicles .
This deployment brings the UPS " green fleet " total to 1,629 trucks .
UPS has deployed CNG , LNG ( Liquefied Natural Gas ) , propane , electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the United States , Canada , Mexico , Germany , France , Brazil and the United Kingdom .
The company also is working with the Environmental Protection Agency on a hydraulic hybrid delivery vehicle .
UPS began deploying alternative fuel vehicles in the 1930s with a fleet of electric trucks that operated in New York City .
The company 's " green fleet " has traveled 143 million miles since 2000 .
" Deploying eco-friendly delivery vehicles is one of the many ways UPS demonstrates its commitment to sustainable business practices , " added Hall .
" The company plans to continue to expand its ' green fleet ' and to focus deployments in areas with air quality challenges . "

Swallow that Silly Middle - class Pride
Just Hope to God You Can Get a Double - Wide
As the majority of Americans are finding themselves helpless and adrift in the rising waters of economic chaos , they may not be aware that their fall from the middle class is only connected to the present economic crisis peripherally , since they are both due to a failed economic policy .
But there is an important difference ; the current crisis may change and things could improve , but without fundamental changes in the American economic system , the decline of the middle class will continue unabated .
Anybody not stressed by that prospect is blissfully ignorant or not affected by economic realities .
Along with a few others , I recently predicted dire economic events [ See Jan '08 OpEdNews articles on the economy by Rob Kall , Ed Martin , et. al. ]
Quick actions by the Fed may have forestalled the events we anticipated , and I hope it is more than a placebo .
One thing will continue , however , and that is the decline of the middle class in America , because there are forces and conditions at work that ensure we will find our ‘ proper niche ’ in the global economy , which , trust me , is a place we do not want to go .
Whatever spin is put out by the government , we are seeing a breathtakingly rapid degradation of our standard of living .
This goes hand in hand with fewer good jobs , inflation , decline of the dollar and trade imbalance , for starters .
Writers on OpEdNews take no pleasure in bringing to light America ’s multitude of political , economic , social and environmental challenges , or in exposing wrongs and failures in our government ’s stewardship of the nation .
I keep hearing terms like , “ The dumbing down of America , ” ( one thing you ca n’t blame on Bush unless he is averaged in ) ; most agree we have had a decline of skills , intellect , literacy , morals , national purpose , work ethic , and on and on , ad infinitum .
I 've variously thought that worship of wealth , the need to win above all else , or failure of leadership across the board could be blamed for America 's decline .
How did we become a third world country while nobody was looking ?
And what American does not bear some responsibility ?
Only those with no power and no voice .
One ’s perspective on this devolution tends to depend on the eye of the beholder .
Some look for someone to blame , others are in denial ; some even may see the truth and try to fix things .
Bluntly , we think what we ’re told to think by the movers and shakers that own us in terms of debt , livelihood and social status .
Church , The Bank , City Hall , the School Board , the CEO , the Board of Directors , the Commission , the Congress , the President .
It ’s no accident that this is the same list of leaders who have failed us .
It is speculative , but makes sense to say that at least economically , the middle class is in for a change in life style if not in its standard of living .
Keeping up with the Joneses , a middle class dream , may involve following the Joneses to the nearest trailer park .

Windows XP Home Gets 2 Year Stay of Execution Thanks to Budget Laptops
Originally set to get the axe at the end of June , XP Home got a call from the brass at Microsoft , delaying its demise for at least another 2 - 3 years .
Not surprisingly , the reason was the increasing popularity of budget laptops like the Asus Eee PC and Intel ’s Classmate PC .
Microsoft has vowed to keep XP on the market until one year after the next version of Windows is released , so it is conceivable that it could live on beyond 2011 .

As the decades pass , some songs increase in popularity when they reach new listeners via concerts , advertising , or movie soundtracks .
Others are n’t readily available commercially , and thus become nearly forgotten .
This list is of outstanding songs many casual listeners will not be familiar with , and placed # 1 on the Billboard US Hot 100 chart .
Please feel free to post how many of the selections you have heard along with your comments .
( An explanation : I based this list on an American chart only because my knowledge of the music history of other countries is not adequate enough to do otherwise . )
Songs are arranged by date , most recent first .
10 Close to You October 6 , 1990 # 1 for 1 week
London - born Maxi Priest ( Max Elliot ) hit the scene in the late 1980 ’s and was a success with his smooth blend of R&B , dance , and reggae music .
This song , off his fourth album Bonafide , stands out as a genuine “ love - making ” song .
Granted , not up to a Barry
White level , though all but the most puritan will likely want to “ get it on ” .
Max is still creating good music , including “ That Girl ” , ( although extra vocals by reggae artist Shaggy hurt the song , IMO ) .
He will be taking over the lead singing duties for the group UB40 ( one of my favorites ) ; coincidentally , UB40 was previously the only UK reggae artist to have a US # 1 hit .
Trivia :
The priest character in the comedy “ South Park ” , Father Maxi , is named after this artist .
9 Wishing Well May 7 , 1988 # 1 for 1 week
Terence Trent D’arby blasted onto radio with his sizzling debut Introducing the Hardline in 1987 .
With a powerful , unique voice , Terence prompted more than a few critics to make comparisons to Sam Cooke and Smokey Robinson .
Unfortunately , his arrogance and pretentiousness would set back a promising career .
His follow - up album was self - indulgent and in cohesive , and though he attempted to return to the mainstream with later albums , he found once you alienate your fans , it can be difficult to win them back .
His latest albums are available only through his website , under his new name Sananda Maitreya , which he chose after experiencing a series of dreams .
Trivia : A soldier in the US Army , Terence went AWOL ( he was performing in clubs while stationed in Germany ) and was court - martialed and discharged in 1983 .
8 96 Tears October 29 , 1966 # 1 for 1 week
Perhaps too well - known a song to be listed here , I choose to invoke list - writer ’s prerogative to include one of my favorite songs .
Question Mark ( or ? ) and the Mysterians made their ‘ mark ’ on music with an early punk rock ode to a lover .
Legend says that lead singer ?
( Rudy Martinez ) wrote the song initially as a poem titled “ Too many teardrops ” .
When presented to the band , one member suggested the song be called “ 69 Tears ” ( wink , wink ) , though the band eventually agreed on a less suggestive title .
The Wikipedia entry says the legend is false , but several fan sites I found state the tale as fact .
? was and is an outrageous personality , having made claims about living on Mars and seeing visions that he will be performing this song until the year 10,000 !
Trivia : In January 2007 , ? ’s Michigan home burnt down destroying all his memorabilia and also taking the lives of six pets .
Benefits have been held but ?
is still without a proper home .
7 Eve of Destruction September 25 , 1965 # 1 for 1 week
A great song with a great back story .
Barry McGuire , broke after quitting folk group
The New Christy Minstrels earlier in the year , was recruited by top producer Lou Adler to record some new tracks .
In the studio and searching for something original , Barry pulled from his pocket a crumpled piece of paper with lyrics that band mate Phil Sloan ( and possibly Barry ; his official site is unclear on this ) had wrote .
He smoothed out the lyrics for himself , wrote the notes on paper from some carryout dinner bags for the band , and then started recording .
Getting late , they recorded one take , ( with Barry losing his place at one point ) , and decided to redo the vocals later .
The next day , a music promoter would inadvertently take “ Eve ” to the birthday party of the daughter of a Los Angeles radio station executive .
The kids loved the song and the promoter told Adler .
Unable to find his lead singer , he made a master of what he had , to send to the station .
Only four days after being recorded , Barry McGuire would have a song playing on LA ’s top rock station .
Trivia : “ Eve ” would be used as a protest song during the Vietnam War era , though Barry had not envisioned it as such .
The song ’s popularity would lead to hate mail and an FBI file for him .
He still performs it today , updating the lyrics for today ’s events .
6 Deep Purple November 16 , 1963 # 1 for 1 week
Brother and sister Nino Tempo and April Stevens did a cover version of the popular song that was initially conceived as a piano composition in 1933 .
The piece ’s popularity lead to lyrics in 1939 , which then lead to hit versions by artists such as big band group The Larry Clinton Orchestra and doo - wop group The Dominoes .
In the second half of this version , April speaks the lyrics softly prior to Nino singing them ; apparently he forgot the words and was being prompted by April .
Of course , the producer left her helping in , despite a mild protest by Nino .
A gentle , sweet song about an old flame they just do n’t make anymore .
Trivia : Another brother and sister act , Donny and Marie Osmond would cover the song in 1976 , hitting the top 20 .
IMHO , this might be the most lightweight singing I ’ve ever heard !
5 Sukiyaki June 15 , 1963 # 1 for 3 weeks
Here ’s a song you have heard many times … sort of .
A hit in his native Japan in 1961 , Kyu Sakamoto sang “ Ue o muite aruk ? ” , a song about a painful break - up .
It would reach the UK in 1963 , through a instrumental version by Kenny Ball and the Jazzmen .
Their record label Pye Records gave the song an easier to pronounce title , and this name would stick when Kyu ’s version would make it to the UK and US later that year .
Many artists would cover the song either through the music only or by making up their own lyrics .
The most notable was by A Taste of Honey in 1981 ; the lyrics written by their singer Janice Marie Johnson ( “ It ’s all because of you , I ’m feeling sad and blue … ” ) would become a standard of sorts for future versions .
The Japanese lyrics are entirely different ; “ I look up when I walk , so tears wo n’t fall ” .
As usually is the case , the original is the best .
Kyu ’s voice stands along side Perry Como and Andy Williams as the best of the era .
Trivia : Sadly , Kyu Sakamato was among 520 people who perished in the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 in 1985 .
4 Telstar December 22 , 1962 # 1 for 3 weeks
A trippy mix of space - age effects and distortions using an electronic instrument called the clavioline .
Unique and imaginative ( and unable to write music or play an instrument ! ) producer Joe Meek wrote this song and named it after a recently launched AT&T communications satellite .
He hired club / house band The Tornadoes to record it , and then added more effects afterwards .
The song was an immediate hit ; however , due to a plagiarism lawsuit by French composer Jean Ledrut ( eventually ruled in Meek ’s favor ) , Meek would see no royalties in his lifetime .
Meek was a flamboyant personality dealing with paranoia , a obsession with the occult , and his homosexuality .
There have been many songs , a play , and a major movie later this year with Kevin Spacey ( not as Meek ) about his life .
Trivia : Meek was also obsessed with Buddy Holly , and would eventually kill himself and his landlady eight years to the day of Holly ’s death .
3 Quarter to Three June 26 , 1961 # 1 for 2 weeks
From a small record label in Norfolk , Virginia came a big dance hit by Gary U.S. Bonds .
This is a raucous , high energy dance track that fits right in with current tracks by OutKast and The Black Eyed Peas .
Born Gary Anderson , he would be renamed by his producer as a gimmick ; they would send out demos labeled “ Buy U.S. Bonds ” , ( government bonds were a popular investment at the time ) .
It worked , now Gary U.S. Bonds is recognized as a beloved performer on the nostalgia concert circuit .
He will be touring the eastern US this summer .
Trivia : Bruce Springsteen is a huge fan and has performed “ Quarter to Three ” at many of his concerts .
He also produced a successful comeback album for Bonds in 1981 .
2 Rock and Roll Waltz February 18 , 1956 # 1 for 1 week
I am unsure whether this song was meant to be an attempt to acknowledge the rock and roll revolution , or to mock it .
Either way , the second - best selling single of 1956 , had Kay Starr ’s lovely , deep voice going for it .
She is not often remembered because much of her career she had been at Capitol Records , behind big - name talent like Jo Stafford and Peggy Lee .
It was a move to RCA that lead to this hit .
Kay has been recording as recently as 2001 , at age 78 ! , on a Tony Bennett album .
Trivia :
Kay lost her voice in 1945 due to pneumonia and nodes on her vocal cords .
Rather than undergo surgery , she chose to not speak for six months !
This changed her voice considerably , but certainly not for the worst .
1 The Thing December 2 , 1950 # 1 for 4 weeks
It is amazing how much musical tastes change .
A song like this would never work today , but at the time it was immensely popular , and was recorded by several artists at the same time as this Phil Harris version .
It ’s corny , sure , but I bet you ’ll be tapping bump - ba - bump by the end of the song !
Trivia : Phil Harris was a popular all - around entertainer and would voice “ Baloo ” in the Disney feature The Jungle Book .

Elton John is well qualified in surviving against the odds , and last night he took to the stage and sang his heart out for someone else who refuses to quit : Hillary Clinton .
The performance at New York 's Radio City music hall was the first he had given for the Clintons since he appeared at the White House in 1998 at a state dinner for Tony Blair .
" I 've always been a Hillary supporter , " he told the crowd , who had paid between $ 125 and the fundraising limit of $ 2,300 per ticket .
" There is no one more qualified to lead America . "
Interspersed between renditions of Your Song , Border Song , Daniel and Rocket Man , John had time to tell his audience how interested he was in the US political process , " because it affects the whole world " .
He lashed out at what he identified as America 's misogyny , saying : " I 'm amazed by the misogynistic attitudes of some of the people in this country .
And I say to hell with them ... I love you Hillary , I 'll be there for you . "
The turnout suggested there is life in the Clinton campaign yet : the show raised $ 2.5 m , compared to the $ 1.5 m the campaign earned from her last musical soiree in October , when Elvis Costello marked her 60th birthday at New York 's Beacon Theatre .
When she spoke herself , Clinton was unable to resist an obvious reference to the title of one of her star supporter 's classic hits .
" What I want you to know , " she said , " is I 'm still standing , and I believe this country is worth fighting for . "
Aharon Shabtai
Silvia Cattori :
In December 2007 , learning that your name was among 40 Israeli writers invited at the " Salon du livre " of Paris where Israel is the " guest of honour " , you declared that it is not possible to participate in an event where Israel , which commits daily crimes against civilians , is invited .
Apparently , 39 Israeli writers do not see any problem in participating !?
Aharon Shabta ï [ 1 ] :
This event will be opened by the French president Sarkozy and the Israeli president Shimon Perès .
Given this situation , going to the " Salon du livre " of Paris as a writer , with the Israeli delegation , means that you are going dressed with the colour of the Israeli flag .
Every day , Israel commits war crimes and imposes collective punishments on the Palestinians .
There is no reason to celebrate anything .
Israel violates all international laws .
Not only the Geneva Convention .
The Hague International Court of justice condemned the illegal wall that Israel has built on confiscated Palestinian land .
The book event , or any other kind of exhibition in which the Israeli State is invited , is not a way to promote peace in the Middle East , and not a way to bring justice to the Palestinians , but only propaganda to give Israel an image of being a liberal and democratic society .
A State which maintains an occupation and commits daily crimes against civilians does not deserve to be invited to whichever cultural week .
We can not accept to be part of that .
Israel is not a democratic State but an apartheid State .
We cannot support that State at all .
Silvia Cattori : So , by inviting the Israeli State to celebrate its 60 years of existence , France and the organizers of the Salon are making a big mistake ?
Aharon Shabtaï :
It is not a mistake !
It is a policy .
I think that , for Nicolas Sarkozy , it is a way to take part in the Israeli occupation .
There is collaboration between the European governments and Israel .
The Israeli invitation is part of it .
Without the help of the United States , and now the help of France , Israel could not continue such a policy against the Palestinians .
This help gives Israel the green light to go on attacking and killing the Palestinians , especially in Gaza .
It is very sad to see that France , Germany , European countries - which have a history of persecution against the Jews - are taking part in the persecution of the Palestinian and Muslim peoples by Israel .
Silvia Cattori :
What do you answer to those who say that we must separate culture from politics ?!
Aharon Shabtaï : Why to separate ?
In the tradition of Europe , going back to the Greeks , writers like Voltaire , Rousseau , and Thomas Mann , always fought against oppression and for liberty .
Liberal intellectuals and writers have always involved themselves in political criticism .
Silvia Cattori :
So you condemn those who will participate in the Salon , like Amos Oz , Avraham B. Yehoshua , Aharon Appelfeld , David Grossman , Zeruya Shalev , Etgar Keret , Orly Castel - Bloom , and others ?
Aharon Shabtaï : Yes of course !
I condemn them because , in that way , they promote the Israeli propaganda and collaborate with the Israeli occupiers .
Silvia Cattori : Did you call them to join the boycott [ 2 ] ?
Aharon Shabtaï : Writers like Amos Oz and David Grossmann , and others , do not want to boycott Israel !
I do not expect anything from them .
They are the ambassadors of Israel .
They usually collaborate with the Israeli government ; they are part of the Israeli propaganda .
So it is very natural for them to go to any place where Israel is officially invited .
They are helping the Israeli government .
Silvia Cattori :
Do you consider these Israeli writers as collaborators ?
Aharon Shabtaï :
Yes , because these invitations are generally organised by a government who support the military occupation of the Palestinian people .
I think that any intellectual , any writer has to refuse to participate in any meeting in which the anniversary of Israel is celebrated .
Instead of that , they have to help the Palestinians to get their rights , their land and their water back .
What we have to do , is to fight the Israel ’s discriminatory acts and persecution ; to have the same attitude the writers had during the struggle against the South African apartheid regime ; the attitude of the radical and liberal writers like Brecht , Aragon , Breton when , during the Nazi period , they organized a Congress and tried to fight against the discrimination and persecution of the Jews .
Silvia Cattori :
Is it true that the Israeli government uses the Israelis working in the field of art and literature as part of its public relations network , for its information warfare , as a way to show an attractive face of Israel ?
Aharon Shabtaï : Yes , Israel ’s regime uses them as public relations ; like when , in the Soviet Union , the Soviet writers were mobilized by the regime .
So , the Israeli writers are now going to Paris like collaborators of an ugly regime , and to be part of the regime .
In such a situation , when such crimes are committed every day by Israel against the Palestinians , anybody who does not cut any link with the Israeli government - this is a matter of fact - is collaborating and doing propaganda for Israel .
Silvia Cattori :
In your view , all honest and human people should boycott not only Paris and Turin exhibitions , but all " Israel at 60 " celebrations ?
So , the only way for Israeli writers would be to have the courage to lose some privileges , to respond to the Palestinians who desperately call for a boycott and to apply to Israel the same treatment that was applied to South Africa ?
Aharon Shabtaï : Yes exactly .
I think that we must work for our common future with the Palestinians , and not to support the militarism of Israel .
Continuing occupation and the war is a very big danger for the future of the Jews , the Israelis and our children .
We can help to stop this occupation .
Silvia Cattori : One Israeli Arab writer , Sayed Kashua , has apparently accepted to go to the " Salon du livre " in Paris and Turin with the Israeli delegation !
Aharon Shabtaï :
He is on the official list by Israel , like the 39 other writers .
He is a good person .
But , as an Israeli Arab , he is not in a comfortable position .
It must be dangerous for him to boycott .
He must be afraid .
He might lose his work .
The life of the Israeli Arabs , living in Israel , is so bad ; it is very difficult for them to survive .
As all the Israeli Arabs , he is considered by Israel as a second class citizen .
This is not my situation .
I belong to the class that dominates , I am Jew , I can boycott without any danger for myself , but an Arab has to be very careful .
Silvia Cattori : Outside of Israel also , the intellectuals , who call for the boycott against Israel , are not in an easy position !
Aharon Shabtaï : You , the Europeans , you boycott the occupied people in Palestine because they voted democratically for the Hamas government ; and now you are boycotting the people of Gaza and collaborating with Israel against the Palestinian people and their government !
Gaza is a ghetto , a concentration camp !
At the same time you , Europeans , are celebrating Israel without any consideration of the plight of nearly four million of Palestinians who are living in a situation similar to that of the Blacks under the apartheid regime of white South Africa .
It is difficult to find the right words to express such an absurdity .
The plight of the Palestinians is even much worse than the plight of the Blacks in South Africa .
The Palestinians are starved , are bombed every day , and are killed on a large scale .
The situation in Gaza , under Israeli aggressive military operations , is horrific .
When the Sarkozy government invites Israel , it knows that this will encourage Israel to go on with the occupation and its crimes against the Palestinians .
I do not think that the Europeans , with their values , can invite a State like Israel and take part in its 60 years celebrations .
Paris and Turin events are purely another occasion for Israel to make propaganda and gain more support for its military occupation .
When Kosovo fought against Serbia , Europe supported Kosovo , and made war against Serbia .
Serbia was the right owner of Kosovo but , in spite of that , the world fought against Serbia and bombed it .
Here , it is just the opposite .
Israel is sitting on an occupied territory .
And you , Europeans , you are going on to help the Israeli occupiers and not the Palestinians who are suffering under the occupation ?
Why this double standard ?
Silvia Cattori :
It was so far impossible , even within the solidarity movement , to treat Israel with the same severity as the apartheid regime of South Africa .
When the Swiss intellectual , Tariq Ramadan [ 3 ] , simply declared that if we are coherent and respect the dignity of the human being , we must boycott this event , he was vilified and accused of stirring up " anti-Semitism " .
In the case of Israel , the boycott is often considered by people of Jewish religion , and by representatives of the left parties , as an " anti-Semite " act !
Aharon Shabtaï : The Jews do not want to see that nearly four million of Palestinians are living in concentration camps , in prison camps , like in Gaza .
People in Europe do not know exactly what the reality here is .
It is very stupid to use the word " anti-Semite " and to call people , who call for the boycott of Israel , as being " anti-Semitic " .
I was born here , I have my children here , and I am also asking for the boycott of Israel , I have the same idea .
Recently , Benny Ziffer , the editor of the literary pages of Haaretz newspaper , called for the boycott of the " Salon " too .
These claims of " anti-Semitism " are propaganda claims .
Until recently , Israel succeeded in Europeans being in favour of the occupation .
But , after the war against Lebanon , and Gaza , European people cannot continue to support Israel .
The call for the boycott has nothing to do with any racism .
Silvia Cattori :
When , in British universities , it is possible to refuse to invite Israeli writers or scientists , in Continental Europe , the institutional left never gives any answer to the call of the Palestinians for a boycott .
Aharon Shabtaï : I do not know what left means when their representatives do not cut any relation with Israel .
I think that many people are afraid of being accused of being " anti-Semitic " .
Now , the history of the Holocaust is completely falsified .
There is a Holocaust industry , privatised by the Israeli propaganda ; it is something disgusting .
Silvia Cattori :
Do you receive support for your position ?
Aharon Shabtaï : Yes I receive many letters from Europe .
I know that people are concerned ; they have nothing against the Jews but they are critic of Israel ’s brutal policy .
This is something that is not mentioned by the media .
People have supported Israel for so many years !
But now , from their reactions , we can see that the sentiments of grassroots people are mostly against the domination and militarism of Israel .
But , in the media you cannot find it .
As with the Iraq war , the media are on the side of the State which makes war .
The media are pro-Israel .

" TAKING THE RED PILL "
THE REAL MATRIX , PART 1
By Steven Yates
December 7 , 2004
NewsWithViews.com
The Matrix , easily the most thought - provoking film in a generation , tells the story of a computer hacker going by the alias Neo ( played by Keanu Reeves ) who discovers that the world he has taken for granted his entire life is an illusion .
The ï¿ ½Matrixï¿½ is a virtual - reality simulation created by a powerful artificial intelligence .
Since birth
Neo has been wired directly into an immense computer system that can project a panorama of sensory information directly into his brain and central nervous system .
This creates the illusion of his living in a world where by day he is Thomas A. Anderson , a programmer for a software giant .
One of the working premises of the film is that the majority of human beings are born , live out their lives , and die inhabiting cocoon - like structures , plugged into this system , never suspecting the truth .
Their life - experiences are fabricated , while their life - energies sustain the ruling entity .
Neo has long suspected that something is amiss without being able to put his finger on it .
It was this something that drew him into hacking and into the world of computers generally .
His presence became known to Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) , leader of a band of rebels fighting to free the human race from bondage to the artificial intelligence .
Of course , Neoï¿½s nocturnal computer explorations have also become known to the ï¿½agents , ï¿½ living programs who service the artificial intelligence .
The first half - hour or so of the film is a race to see which side can get to him first .
One of the rebels , Trinity ( Carrie - Anne Moss ) , hacks into his computer and lures him to a Gothic nightclub .
There she confronts him with his unease :
ï¿ ½I know why you ï¿½re here , Neo .
I know what you ï¿½ve been doing .
I know why you hardly sleep , why you live alone , and why night after night you sit at your computer .
You ï¿ ½re looking for him .
I know , because I was once looking for the same thing .
And when he found me , he told me I wasnï¿½t really looking for him .
I was looking for an answer .
It ï¿½s the question that drives us , Neo .
It ï¿½s the question that brought you here .
You know the question just as I did .ï¿½
Neo : ï¿ ½What is the Matrix ?ï¿½
Trinity : ï¿½The answer is out there , Neo .
It ï¿½s looking for you .
And it will find you , if you want it to .ï¿½
The pivotal scene occurs when she introduces Neo to Morpheus .
With a thunderstorm in the background , some gripping dialogue ensues :
Morpheus : I imagine that right now you ï¿½re feeling a little like Alice , tumbling down the rabbit - holeï ¿ ½I can see it in your eyes .
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up .
Ironically , this is not far from the truthï ¿
½Let me tell you why you are here .
You ï¿ ½re here because you know something .
What you know , you can ï¿½t explain .
But you feel it .
You ï¿½ve felt it your entire life .
That there ï¿½s something wrong with the world .
You donï¿½t know what it is , but it ï¿½s there , like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad .
It is this feeling that has brought you to me .
Do you know what I ï¿½m talking about ?
Neo : The Matrix ?
Morpheus :
Do you want to know what it is ?
Neo : ( nods )
Morpheus : The Matrix is everywhere .
It is all around us , even now , in this very room .
You can see it when you look out your window , or when you turn on your television .
You can feel it when you go to work , or when you go to church , or when you pay your taxes .
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth .
Neo :
What truth ?
Morpheus :
That you are a slave , Neo .
Like everyone else , you were born into bondage , born inside a prison that you cannot smell , taste , or touch .
A prison for your mind .
Unfortunately , no one can be told what the Matrix is .
You have to see it for yourself .
( Produces a box containing two colored pills , one blue and one red . )
This is your last chance .
After this , there is no turning back .
You take the blue pill , the story ends , you awake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe .
You take the red pill , you stay in Wonderland , and I show you how deep the rabbit - hole goes .
( Pause .
Neo reaches for the red pill . )
Remember : all I ï¿½m offering is the truth , nothing more .
( Neo swallows the red pill with a glass of water . )
After that , things happen pretty quickly .
Neo is jerked free of the artificial intelligence and finds himself in the ï¿½desert of the real , ï¿½ with Morpheus , Trinity and the others on board the Nebuchadnezzar who are struggling to free the human race from control by the artificial intelligence , while simultaneously battling superhuman ï¿½agentsï¿½ and monstrous mechanical ï¿½sentinels ï¿½ sent to destroy them .
Science fiction , right ?
Unquestionably , many viewers watched The Matrix convinced that all they were seeing was a science fiction action filmï¿ ½entertainment , without further significance .
I believe it ï¿½s more .
The Matrixï¿ ½which has begun to generate a secondary literature in academic disciplines like philosophy and cultural studies ï¿½may be seen an allegory for our present situation after the past hundred - plus years .
The allegory is about power and concealment .
The ï¿½real matrixï¿½ is then a world most of middle America takes for granted ï¿½a world where ï¿ ½they hate us because we are free , ï¿½ and where the public schools educate .
A world where we can trust the federal government and believe Dan Rather .
A world where the former obeys its founding document , the U.S. Constitution .
In other words , a fantasy world .
Let us conduct a thought experiment .
Let us remove the obviously evil artificial intelligence and its minions ï¿½ï¿½agentsï¿½ and ï¿½sentinels ï¿½ï¿ ½and substitute a power system controlled by a few hundred extremely wealthy and well - placed individuals ï¿ ½a super - elite , I will call it .
I use this term to distinguish it from visible , national elites .
This super - elite operates at an international level , outside all national loyalties .
Its only loyalties are to money and power .
It exercises control by controlling not just much of the Western world ï¿½s finances but much of the information released to the public .
It controls the mainstream mass media ( television networks and newspapers mostly owned by six or so megaconglomerates ) and most education through top - down policies permeating the prevailing form of education in this land : government ( ï¿½publicï¿½ ) schools .
So - called higher education is part of this system .
The super - elite bent academic disciplines such as history and psychology in the direction it wanted them to go by generously supplying foundation and grant money to compliant graduate students who then become compliant professors and administrators .
Through the endowment system it gained control over Ivy League universities .
The latter , via their enormous prestige and control of flagship organizations within academic disciplines ( such as the American Historical Association or the American Psychological Association ) , set the course for those disciplines that others can be expected to follow automatically .
Members of the super - elite that controls this power system were never elected to anything , but elected officials in national elites answer to them .
Those without the tacit approval of the super - elite have no chance of coming within a thousand miles of the Oval Office .
The masses of people , meanwhile , will have been ï¿½educated ï¿½ to adjust to society , which in this context means following the crowd and automatically withholding support from anyone who ï¿½canï ¿½t get elected .ï¿½
Combine these two , and you have a reason why no Libertarian Party or Constitution Party candidate has a chance of becoming President of the United States or even reaching high office at the state level as long as this power system remains in place .
The media elites continue to promote a system which plays Democrats against Republicans although both parties are controlled at the top .
There exists , in other words , a strict gatekeeping system .
Only those with certain values and attributes , and a certain mindset , need apply .
Letï¿½s now go beyond the thought - experiment stage .
Does this super - elite really exist , or is this just more armchair ï¿½conspiracy theory ï¿½ ?
It is not a theory .
It is now quite well documented .
The information is available to anyone willing to seek it out .
To paraphrase what Trinity told Neo in their initial conversation , the answers are out there , and will find you if you want them to .
Or , you can find them , if you go looking .

Today I 'd like to talk about free monads .
The free monad of a functor is a monad that is uniquely determined by the functor ( up to isomorphism , etc ) , given by :
data Free f a = Roll ( f ( Free f a ) ) | Return a -- newtype Free f a =
Free { unfree :: Either a ( f ( Free f a ) ) ) }
Usually the above is written up using a newtype around a sum ( Either ) so you can write it using nice point - free style , but I think this makes for clearer introduction this way .
The idea is that you take the functor and recursively fold it in upon a choice of either itself or a naked variable .
instance Functor f => Functor ( Free f ) where fmap f ( Roll x ) = Roll $ fmap ( fmap f ) x fmap f ( Return x ) = Return ( f x )
Now , we would n't call it the free ' monad ' without reason .
Return is the obvious candidate for ' return ' , but bind is a little trickier :
instance Functor f => Monad ( Free f ) where return = Return Return m >>= k = k m -- given by : return m >>= k = k m Roll m >>= k = Roll $ fmap ( >>= k ) m
( >>= ) substitutes ' subtrees ' for all of the naked variables in our monad .
This is the gist of the monads of ( co ) trees section of Uustalu and Vene 's The Dual of Substitution is Redecoration .
We can define a form of catamorphism for the free monad :
foldF :: Functor f => ( f a -> a ) ->
Free f a -> a foldF phi ( Roll x ) = phi $ fmap ( fold F phi ) x foldF _ ( Return x ) = x
The problem is you want to be able to perform different folds that return different types , so lets quantify over the variable in the monad .
newtype Forall f = Forall { unforall :: forall a. f a } cataF :: Functor f => ( f a -> a ) ->
Forall ( Free f ) -> a cataF phi = foldF phi .
unforall
Lets motivate this with an example .
Take the identity functor , and give it a funny name :
data Succ a = Succ a instance Functor Succ where fmap f ( Succ a ) = Succ ( f a )
We can steal a nice typeclass from Laemmel and Rypacek :
instance ( Show a , Show ( f ( Free f a ) ) ) =>
Show ( Free f a ) where show ( Roll x ) = " ( Roll ( " ++ show x ++ " ) ) " show ( Return x ) = " ( Return ( " ++ show x ++ " ) ) "
And with it we can see that the members of the monad " Free Succ " are terms of the form :
Return x Roll ( Succ ( Return x ) ) Roll ( Succ ( Roll ( Succ ( Return x ) ) ) ) ...
Which if we look through it with goggles that quantify over x and ignore the Return / Roll noise looks like the Peano numerals !
type Peano = Forall ( Free Succ )
Then working in the monad " Free Succ " , the bind function ( >>= ) hunts down the value of the ' a ' term and substitutes the
output of the function .
For example :
Roll ( Succ ( Roll ( Succ ( ) ) ) ) >>= const Roll ( Succ ( ) ) == Roll ( Succ ( Roll ( Succ ( Roll ( Succ ( ) ) ) ) )
We can easily convert natural numbers to Peano form , exploiting this :
toNat :: Int -> Free Succ ( ) to Nat n | n > 0 = toNat ( n - 1 ) >>
Succ ( ) toNat 0 = return ( )
And we can translate back from Peano form , by first replacing the ( ) with a 0 , and then using the non-polymorphic
fold operation from before .
toInt :: Free Succ a ->
Int toInt = foldF phi . fmap ( const 0 ) where phi ( Succ n ) = n + 1
The need to set a constant base case is common enough that we may want to box that up into a function :
cata ' :: ( f a -> a ) -> a ->
Forall ( Free f ) -> a cata ' phi z = phi $ fmap ( const z ) .
unforall
With that example in hand you might be tempted to try the same trick with a different type : ( , )
First we note that ( , ) is a Bifunctor :
class Bifunctor f where bimap :: ( a -> c ) -> ( b -> d ) -> f a b -> f c d first :: ( a -> b ) -> f a c -> f b c first f = bimap f id second :: ( a -> b ) -> f c a -> f c b second f = bimap id f
The definition for ( , ) is quite straightforward .
instance Bifunctor ( , ) where bimap f g ~ ( x , y ) = ( f x , g y ) -- the reader comonad !
instance Functor ( ( , ) a ) where fmap f ( e , a ) = ( e , f a )
Ideally we would like to be able to say
-- instance Bifunctor f => Functor ( f a ) where fmap = second
but this can lead to ambiguous cases in the type checker , does it look for a Bifunctor or something else ?
So , we 'll just think that very loudly whenever we define a bifunctor .
So , lets see if Free ( ( , ) a ) x can rederive the list functor .
You can get pretty close :
Return x Roll ( a , Return x ) Roll ( a , Roll ( a , Return x ) ) ...
Looks a lot like it , but its a different functor .
The free monad " Free ( Cons a ) " varies the type of the term
carried around in nil ( aka Return ) ( the type of the result of applying a catamorphism ) .
Quantifying over that gets you closer :
newtype List a = List ( Forall ( Free ( ( , ) a ) ) )
We had to make it a newtype in order to be able to make it an instance of monad and functor in its own right .
Now , to remap the ' first ' term in the bifunctor , we add a new tool to our belt :
bimapfree :: Bifunctor f => ( a -> b ) ->
Free ( f a ) c ->
Free ( f b ) c bimapfree f ( Return x ) = Return x bimapfree f ( Roll x ) = Roll $ bimap f ( bimapfree f ) x
instance Functor
List where fmap f ( List ( Forall x ) ) = List $ Forall ( bimapfree f x )
length :: List a ->
Int length ( List ( Forall x ) ) = cata ' phi 0 x where phi ( _ , b ) = 1 + b sum :: List Int ->
Int sum ( List ( Forall x ) ) = cata ' phi 0 x where phi ( a , b ) = a + b
Now , if you 've been paying attention for the last couple of posts , you may have noticed a connection between the free monad ' Free f a ' and the Fegaras / Sheard ' Rec f a ' :
data Rec f a = Roll ( f ( Rec f a ) ) | Place a
They are the same construction !
That said , when you have ' a ' occurring in negative position in the functor ( aka you have an exponential functor ) , then you find your hands tied in certain fundamental ways .
First and foremost , the free monad fails to become a monad ( well , in the category Hask , anyways ) !
Secondly you lose the ability to define hylomorphisms because the result of an anamorphism can't be turned into an input for a catamorphism .
More later .
[ Edit : corrected the definition of cataF based on an observation by Daniel James ]
A great plastic business card should communicate the overall representation of your business — not simple , knowing that the card measures only 2 ″ by 3.5 ″ .
How can you likely get a communication crossed in such a little space ?
You ca n’t assume your business card to say the entire story about your business .
What you should assume it to do is display an authorized image that people will recognize .
The wording , color , and texture of your business card have much to do with its attractiveness and its capacity to communicate your company image .
Use your common sense when creating your business card .
If your company markets children ’s games and toys , you might try applying bright , primary colours and the words printed in child ’s script .
While , if you run a financial consulting business , then you need your business card to carry reliability and professionalism , so stick to natural looks such as black print on a grey , white or beige background .
Of course , professional designers demand businesspeople should not try to endeavour to create a business card on their own , but many cash - strapped company owners have no other option .
The best route of action : Study at all the business cards you collect and copy the cards that you want .
You may have extra leeway if you are in an artistic business , such as party preparing or distributing , but in general , keep the succeeding points in mind :
Use your company ’s logo as the base .
Make it the biggest portion of the card .
Make it simple .
Do not devour too much message on the card .
Do add the imperatives — your name , title , address , phone , company name and fax numbers , and website addresses and email .
Make sure the fonts are readable .
Stick to one or two colours
Once you have got business cards , make the utmost of them :
Always present people extra than one card ( so they can give it to others ) .
Introduce your business card in all conformity .
Carry cards with you at all times , out them in a card case , so they are neat and clean .
Your business cards do not have to be dull .
If your business allows for a little artistic flair , here are little designs to try :
Use 4 - inch - by - 7 - inch squares that fold up just like a mini brochure ; cards produced of plastic or cards with pictures on them .
Though they are more conventional than the standard business cards , cards in modern shapes get more attention .
You can try using a teddy bear pattern for a day - care assistance service , for instance , or a birthday cake shape for a party planner or organizer service .
Paper with texture can append to a card ’s interest , as can painted paper .
Overall , stay with brighter shades that improve readability .
Thermography is a process that produces raised , shiny print that adds interest to a business card .
Foil stamping and embossing are two other printing means that can provide your card more visual interest .

But the ocean organisms may not remove more carbon dioxide from the air .
The microscopic marine organisms called coccolithophores , one of nature ’s most prolific consumers of atmospheric carbon dioxide , may continue to absorb carbon at today 's rates — even as greenhouse - gas concentrations continue to rise .
Coccolithophores are phytoplankton that live in the upper layers of the world 's oceans .
The creatures use calcium carbonate , the material that makes up chalk and seashells , to build tiny plates on their exterior .
The tiny phytoplankton fashion their protective shells from calcium carbonate .
M. Debora Iglesias - Rodriguez
Although building these plates produces carbon dioxide , coccolithophores also consume the gas while undergoing photosynthesis .
On balance , the phytoplankton absorb more carbon dioxide than they produce .
Previous research has suggested that changing ocean chemistry may prod the plankton to become more efficient carbon sinks , eliminating more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
But a study appearing today in Science suggests they may be no help at all1 .
" It is unlikely that coccolithophores are going to be mitigating or exacerbating the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , " says author M. Debora Iglesias - Rodriguez of the University of Southampton , UK .
Testing trends
To simulate the effect of rising atmospheric carbon - dioxide levels , Iglesias - Rodriguez and her colleagues bubbled air enriched with carbon dioxide through cultures of Emiliania huxleyi , a coccolithophore species found throughout the world ’s oceans .
When the team increased the carbon - dioxide concentration to the levels projected for the year 2100 , they found that E. huxleyi made twice as much plate material and thus produced more carbon dioxide .
But this increase was balanced by a parallel increase in photosynthesis .
All told , Iglesias - Rodriguez says , the results suggest that coccolithophores may not alter carbon dioxide levels , even as the ocean absorbs increasing amounts of the gas .
While coccolithophores may be unaffected in the short term , eventually the ocean may grow too acidic from rising carbon dioxide levels .
Large quantities of the calcium carbonate the coccolithophores make will dissolve , with unknown effects on the organisms .
Although the team found that carbon dioxide boosted plate production or ' calcification ' , other experiments with coccolithophores have shown the opposite trend — a reduction in calcium carbonate production2 .
“ This is the first time where we actually see increased calcification in response to high CO 2 , ” says Victoria Fabry , a biologist at California State University , San Marcos .
" The results here are not consistent , and we need to find out why they 're not . "
Fabry notes that the work was on only one of roughly 250 species of coccolithophores , and others might respond differently .
Record of change
Still , Iglesias - Rodriguez says she is encouraged by her team 's field measurements , which examined layers of E. huxleyi that had settled at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean .
The sediment contained a record of coccolithophore growth since the dawn of the industrial revolution .
From 1780 to 2004 , the average weight of calcium carbonate in the phytoplankton increased by more than 50 % , indicating atmospheric changes are having an effect .

In December , the team plans to travel to Antarctica to conduct more experiments using coccolithophores in the seawater samples .
Such experiments could help further clarify how they respond to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide under real - world conditions , as laboratory tests often vary from experiment to experiment .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar tumbled to a 12 - 1/ 2 year low against the Japanese yen on Monday , and also saw record lows against the euro and the Swiss franc , as emergency liquidity - boosting measures by the Federal Reserve over the weekend failed to ease worries about the U.S. financial system .

The greenback sold off in reaction to the Fed cutting its discount rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent on Sunday and after the opening up of the Fed ’s discount window lending to major investment banks , a tool not used since the Great Depression .
The Fed ’s move accompanied the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase for just $ 2 a share , less than one - tenth of the bank ’s share price on Friday .
The U.S. dollar slid as much as 3.0 percent to below 96.00 yen , its lowest since 1995 , bringing year - to - date losses to more than 13 percent .
“ The Fed ’s announcement to triple the maximum maturity of discount window loans to 90 days and its $ 30 billion in funding of Bear Stearns less liquid assets not only indicated the grave situation posed to the counter party risk involved , but also highlights the increased ineffectiveness of the Fed ’s historic liquidity injections yet to date , ” said Ashraf Laidi , chief FX strategist , CMC Markets U.S. in a research note to clients .
The dollar fell as low as 95.77 yen according to Reuters data , and saw historic lows 0.9637
Swiss francs after breaking below parity last week .
The euro rose as high as $ 1.5904 , having already added around 4.0 percent in the first two weeks of March , roughly doubling its year - to - date gains .
It last traded at $ 1.5745 .
Matthew Strauss , a currency strategist at RBC Capital in Toronto , said that despite the high levels in dollar - yen and rumors of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan , there were no clear indications the Japanese government is ready to take action to prevent the currency from appreciating further .
Implied volatility , a key component of option pricing , in dollar / yen surged to its highest levels in around a decade both on the one - week and one - month horizon .
In another report on Monday , the U.S. Treasury Department said net overall capital flows in the country fell to its lowest level in four months in January .
The inflows were not sufficient to cover the month ’s U.S. trade deficit .
“ Today ’s TICs report takes a back seat to tomorrow ’s FOMC ’s decision , with market expectations regarding the size of the anticipated cut all over the map , ” Michael Woolfolk , a senior currency strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon , said in a note .
Short - term U.S.
Treasury yields fell to five - year lows as investors expect the Fed could cut overnight rates by up to a full percentage point at its policy meeting on Tuesday .
INTERVENTION ?
The rapid U.S. dollar fall fanned talk of possible coordinated dollar - buying intervention from major central banks other than the Bank of Japan .
“ From the ECB point of view , these are moves which are not easy to ignore , ” Dresdner Kleinwort currency strategist Michael Klawitter said in Frankfurt .
The euro saw some volatility when Market News International , citing a source , said the European Central Bank ’s Governing Council will likely express concern about the euro ’s rapid surge against the dollar in a coordinated “ verbal intervention ” over the next several days and weeks .
But the sources noted that “ verbal intervention ” does n’t mean actual central bank intervention in foreign exchange to stem the euro ’s rise against a weak dollar and the euro ’s moves were short - lived .
Central banks in Europe , Japan and the U.S. last jointly intervened in September 2000 , propping up the euro after the currency hit an all - time low below $ 0.85 , a loss of nearly 30 percent of its value from its January 1999 launch .

Legionnaires were recruited from German POW camps
Now , 17 years early , the BBC's Document programme has been given special access to this secret file .
It reveals how thousands of Indian soldiers who had joined Britain in the fight against fascism swapped their oaths to the British king for others to Adolf Hitler - an astonishing tale of loyalty , despair and betrayal that threatened to rock British rule in India , known as the Raj .
The story the German officers told their interrogators began in Berlin on 3 April 1941 .
This was the date that the left - wing Indian revolutionary leader , Subhas Chandra Bose , arrived in the German capital .
Bose , who had been arrested 11 times by the British in India , had fled the Raj with one mission in mind .
That was to seek Hitler 's help in pushing the British out of India .
He wanted 500 volunteers who would be trained in Germany and then parachuted into India .
Everyone raised their hands .
Thousands of us volunteered
Lieutenant Barwant Singh
By the end of 1941 , Hitler 's regime officially recognised his provisional " Free India Government " in exile , and even agreed to help Chandra Bose raise an army to fight for his cause .
It was to be called " The Free India Legion " .
Bose hoped to raise a force of about 100,000 men which , when armed and kitted out by the Germans , could be used to invade British India .
He decided to raise them by going on recruiting visits to Prisoner - of - War camps in Germany which , at that time , were home to tens of thousands of Indian soldiers captured by Rommel in North Africa .
Volunteers
Finally , by August 1942 , Bose 's recruitment drive got fully into swing .
Mass ceremonies were held in which dozens of Indian POWs joined in mass oaths of allegiance to Adolf Hitler .
Chandra
Bose did not live to see Indian independence
I managed to track down one of Bose 's former recruits , Lieutenant Barwant Singh , who can still remember the Indian revolutionary arriving at his prisoner of war camp .
" He was introduced to us as a leader from our country who wanted to talk to us , " he said .
" He wanted 500 volunteers who would be trained in Germany and then parachuted into India .
Everyone raised their hands .
Thousands of us volunteered . "
Demoralised
In all 3,000 Indian prisoners of war signed up for the Free India Legion .
But instead of being delighted , Bose was worried .
A left - wing admirer of Russia , he was devastated when Hitler 's tanks rolled across the Soviet border .
Matters were made even worse by the fact that after Stalingrad it became clear that the now - retreating German army would be in no position to offer Bose help in driving the British from faraway India .
When the Indian revolutionary met Hitler in May 1942 his suspicions were confirmed , and he came to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones .
So , in February 1943 , Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan .
Rudolf Hartog remembers parting with his Indian friends
Back in Germany the men he had recruited were left leaderless and demoralised .
After much dissent and even a mutiny , the German High Command despatched them first to Holland and then south - west France , where they were told to help fortify the coast for an expected allied landing .
After D - Day , the Free India Legion , which had now been drafted into Himmler 's Waffen SS , were in headlong retreat through France , along with regular German units .
It was during this time that they gained a wild and loathsome reputation amongst the civilian population .
The former French Resistance fighter , Henri Gendreaux , remembers the Legion passing through his home town of Ruffec : " I do remember several cases of rape .
A lady and her two daughters were raped and in another case they even shot dead a little two - year - old girl . "
Finally , instead of driving the British from India , the Free India Legion were themselves driven from France and then Germany .
Their German military translator at the time was Private Rudolf Hartog , who is now 80 .
" The last day we were together an armoured tank appeared .
I thought , my goodness , what can I do ?
I 'm finished , " he said .
" But he only wanted to collect the Indians .
We embraced each other and cried .
You see that was the end . "
Mutinies
A year later the Indian legionnaires were sent back to India , where all were released after short jail sentences .
But when the British put three of their senior officers on trial near Delhi there were mutinies in the army and protests on the streets .
With the British now aware that the Indian army could no longer be relied upon by the Raj to do its bidding , independence followed soon after .
Not that Subhas Chandra Bose was to see the day he had fought so hard for .
He died in 1945 .
Since then little has been heard of Lieutenant Barwant Singh and his fellow legionnaires .
At the end of the war the BBC was forbidden from broadcasting their story and this remarkable saga was locked away in the archives , until now .
Not that Lieutenant Singh has ever forgotten those dramatic days .
" In front of my eyes I can see how we all looked , how we would all sing and how we all talked about what eventually would happen to us all , " he said .
A Queensland police officer caught with more than 8000 child porn images on his home computer has avoided spending any time in jail .
Thomas James Anthony Wilson , 25 , pleaded guilty in Brisbane 's District Court today to possessing the lewd material , including pictures of boys as young as 10 engaging in sex acts .
He was sentenced to 18 months ' jail , but the term was wholly suspended after his lawyer successfully argued Wilson had downloaded the images by mistake .
The former policeman , who has since lost his job , was one of 1717 suspects identified as part of a 2003 child porn investigation by US Customs and FBI agents .
Police traced his credit card to a child porn website titled “ Sunshine Boys ” , where Wilson had paid a $ 35 access fee .
A March 28 , 2006 raid on his Shorncliffe home on Brisbane ’s northside uncovered a computer loaded with pornography .
In all , 8742 images were identified as depicting children aged between 10 and 18 posing nude , masturbating and engaging in sex acts .
Wilson 's defence barrister Craig Eberhardt told the court his client had not purposefully sought out child abuse images when he downloaded pornography files from the internet .
He suggested Wilson may have viewed some of it as a way to deal with his own sexuality as a young man .
" ( He is ) not a pedophile , he does not have pedophilic tendencies , " Mr Eberhardt said , citing medical evidence .
" His culpability comes from his failure to get rid of it once he knew it was there . "
Judge Tony Rafter SC said a wholly suspended sentence was appropriate because Wilson posed no risk to children and was unlikely to reoffend .
But he said the actions of the disgraced policeman had nonetheless helped to feed an " evil and exploitative industry " .
" You should have been accutely aware of the seriousness of the offence because you were a serving police officer at the time , " Judge Rafter chastised .
" I accept that you did not actively seek child pornography and these images were accessed somewhat accidentally .
" I am also mindful that as a former police officer , a period of imprisonment would be harsher upon you . "
Wilson left court supported by family .

Very good .
And it is still going on .
Montel just lost his show after FOX did not renew it after he went on air to talk about Heath Ledger , and he instead talked about " 5 dead Heath Ledgers in Iraq " and basically went off on them .
He was not invited back after a hurried " We must go to a commercial " which cut off his speech .
Google it - its on youtube etc ...

Since no elected official ever does what they say they will do while campaigning , I suggest voting for who the person is , how they live their life , what they have done up until now .
That is , IMHO , the best indicator of what they will actually do once in office .

Your formula led me to John Edwards .
I will write him in .
But in listening to Republicans on NPR today , they are are having to do the same thing in comparing McCain , Huckabee and Romney .
It seems to me that whether you are Dem or Republican , you end up holding your nose in the voting booth .
It is really , really a stupid state of affairs .

The stories of the Uighurs in Guantánamo  Muslims from the oppressed Xinjiang province of China , formerly known as East Turkistan  have long demonstrated chronic injustice on the part of the U.S. authorities to those who know of them , although they have only sporadically registered on the media ’s radar .
Numbering 22 men in total , three were picked up randomly in Afghanistan , another was caught crossing the Pakistani border disguised in a burqa , while the other 18 were seized together by opportunistic Pakistani villagers after fleeing Afghanistan in the wake of the U.S. - led invasion in October 2001 , and sold to U.S. forces for a bounty , as was common at the time .
A leaflet dropped by U.S. planes offered enterprising villagers and soldiers " millions of dollars for helping the anti-Taliban force catch al - Qaeda and Taliban murderers . "
These 18 men , who had fled their homeland because of persecution , in search of a new life , or in the hope of gaining some sort of training to enable them to fight back against their oppressors , had been living together in a small , run-down hamlet in Afghanistan ’s Tora Bora mountains , mending the settlement ’s ruined buildings , and occasionally training on their only weapon , an aging AK - 47 .
After the U.S. - led invasion , they were targeted in a U.S. bombing raid , in which several men died .
The survivors then made their way across the mountains to the Pakistani border , where they were first welcomed by the villagers , then betrayed by them .
In U.S. custody , they attracted attention because of their supposed insights into the workings of the Chinese government , but it was apparent from early on that they had not been involved with either the Taliban or al - Qaeda , and that there was no reason to hold them .
Unfortunately for the Uighurs , however , the declaration of their innocence only prefaced further problems , as they joined one of Guantánamo ’s least enviable groups : cleared prisoners who , because of international treaties , cannot be returned to their home countries for fear that they will be subjected to torture , or worse .
The U.S. government had obligingly declared those opposed to Chinese rule in Xinjiang province as " terrorists , " in order to secure support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and had even allowed  or invited 
Chinese interrogators to question the men in Guantánamo , but when it came to returning them to China they refused to do so .
Attempts to persuade other countries to accept the Uighurs  and other cleared prisoners who faced similar problems with repatriation  were both long and largely futile .
Despite the fact that some of these men had been regarded as wrongly detained while they were in U.S. - run prisons in Afghanistan , and many had been cleared after military tribunals in Guantánamo in 2004 , it was not until May 2006 that one country 
Albania , one of Europe ’s poorest nations  could be prevailed upon to accept five of the men , who were joined , in December 2006 , by another three cleared prisoners from Algeria , Egypt , and the former Soviet Union .
Living in a UN refugee camp in Tirana has not been without its problems  there is no Uighur community in Albania , no prospect of work , and no opportunity for the men to have contact with their families  but it is at least better than being in Guantánamo , where their compatriots , who have , for the most part , also been cleared for release ( the exact details are , like much else at Guantánamo , difficult to gauge with absolute confidence ) , remain in a limbo that seems , literally , to be without end .
Compounding their suffering , the Uighurs , like the majority of the dozens of other cleared prisoners , are held not in comfort in Camp 4 ( Guantánamo ’s only block with communal dorms ) but in Camp 6 , a maximum security prison in which they are held in complete isolation , in metal cells without windows , for 22 to 23 hours a day .
One of these men is Abdulghappar , who is now 35 years old .
In 2004 , he explained to his military tribunal that he had traveled to Afghanistan to " get some training to fight back against the Chinese government , " and added that he had nothing against the United States .
He said that his own people " and my own family are being tortured under the Chinese government , " and when asked , " Was it your intention when you were training to fight against the U.S. or its allies ? " came up with an answer that summed up the feelings of all his imprisoned compatriots : " I have one point : a billion Chinese enemies , that is enough for me .
Why would I get more enemies ? "
Abdulghappar recently wrote a letter to his lawyers , which was declassified by the military censors who review all correspondence between lawyers and their clients .
It was then passed to the Associated Press , who quoted parts of the letter in an article last week , which was then picked up by other media outlets .
In the hope of providing Abdulghappar with more of his own voice , however , I asked his lawyers for a copy of the letter , which I reproduce in its entirety below .
As it is a translation , I have taken the liberty of editing the language to convey his message more fully .
Abdulghappar ’s Letter From Guantánamo
How are you , Mr. J. Wells Dixon and Ms. Seema Saifee ?
I hope that this letter reaches you before you come over , and I hope that it will be a little beneficial for our Turkistani brothers ’ situation here .
We , the Turkistani brothers , left our homeland in order to escape from the brutal suppression and unfair treatment from the Chinese government towards our people .
The Uighur youth back home were either incarcerated because of false accusations or prosecuted and executed because of bogus allegations .
It was extremely difficult for any Uighur to see a future for themselves within our homeland , and both young and middle - aged Uighurs started to leave East Turkistan and try to find survival abroad , if anyone could find a way to get out .
We , the Uighurs in Guantánamo , are also like those Uighurs .
We left our homeland for the same cause and sought solace in our neighboring countries .
As you know , for some specific reasons we ended up in Afghanistan .
When we arrived in Afghanistan , the U.S. army invaded .
We had to depart for Pakistan , since we could not stay in Afghanistan .
As we did not know anyone who could help us there , we had no other choice but to leave .
The Pakistani people then arrested us and turned us over to the Pakistani government .
Subsequently , the Pakistani government sold us to the U.S. Army for bounties .
The U.S. Army then brought us to Guantánamo .
Since the very beginning of the interrogations , we have been saying this .
Our circumstances are very clear to the U.S. government , the U.S. Army and related agencies .
Thus , the East Turkistani people and we , the Uighurs in Guantánamo , have never had any revulsion against the U.S. at any time , and this would never be possible , because our homeland is being occupied and we need the help of others .
We were very pleased at the beginning when the Pakistanis turned us over to American custody .
We sincerely hoped that America would be sympathetic to us and help us .
Unfortunately , the facts were different .
Although in 2004 and 2005 we were told that we were innocent , we have been incarcerated in jail for the past six years until the present day .
We fail to know why we are still in jail here .
We still hope that the U.S. government will free us soon and send us to a safe place .
Being away from family , away from our homeland , and also away from the outside world and losing any contact with anyone is not suitable for a human being , as , also , is being forbidden from experiencing natural sunlight and natural air , and being surrounded by a metal box on all sides .
I was very healthy in the past .
However , since I was brought to Camp 6 , I got rheumatism .
My joints started to hurt all the time and are getting worse .
My kidneys started to hurt ten days ago .
My countryman Abdulrazaq used to have rheumatism for a while , and since he came to Camp 6 it got worse .
Sometime in early August , the U.S. Army told Abdulrazaq that he was cleared to be released , and also issued the release form to him in writing .
As a result , Abdulrazaq requested to move to a camp that had better conditions , for health reasons .
When his request was ignored he embarked on a hunger strike , which has lasted for over a month now .
Currently , he is on punishment and his situation is even worse .
He is shackled to the restraint chair and force - fed twice a day by the guards , who wear glass shields on their faces .
This has taken place for the past 20 days .
For someone who has not eaten for a long time , such treatment is not humane .
Abdulrazaq would never want to go on hunger strike .
However , the circumstances here forced him to do so , as he had no other choice .
If the oppression was not unbearable , who would want to throw himself on a burning fire ?
In the U.S. Constitution , is it a crime for someone to ask to protect his health and to ask for his rights ?
If it does count as a crime , then what is the difference between the U.S. Constitution and the Communist constitution ?
What is the difference between this and Hitler ’s policies during the Second World War ?
I have heard that an Egyptian man broke his back and became handicapped while he was being handled by a team in Camp 1 or 2 , and then he was sent home as a crippled person for the rest of his life [ Sami el - Leithi , released in October 2005 ] .
Another Libyan broke his arm also .
I worry that Abdulrazaq will face a similar or worse situation while being force - fed twice a day for a long time , and I am also concerned for his psychological condition as it is extremely difficult for him to keep his mental state normal under such circumstances .
Recently , I started to wonder , " Why are we staying in this jail for so long ? "
I wonder if we will be released after we damage our internal and external organs and our arms and legs .
Or is it necessary for a few Turkistanis to die , as happened in the past here in this jail , in order to gain others ’ attention and their concern towards our matter ?
Such thoughts are in my mind all the time .
The reason I am writing this letter to you is that I sincerely hope that you and others related to law and enforcement can solve this issue quickly and help us in a practical manner .

Portable applications are great because they do n’t need to be installed , they do n’t mess with the registry and you can carry it along with you in a pen drive .
Portable applications are n’t only for using in portable devices .
They can be used on a PC too and the best thing about it is , as I ’ve mentioned , you do n’t need to install it .
Just copy it to your hard disk and run .
Several applications are already available in a portable format , but not all .
So I ’m going to show you how to turn any application into a portable one .
Let ’s do it with Microsoft Office 2003 .
We will use a software called Thinstall ( Update : Thinstall is now VMWare ThinApp ) .
Thinstall is an Application Virtualization Platform that enables complex software to be transformed into self - contained EXE files which can run instantly with zero installation from any data source .
It creates a virtual operating system , a type of sandbox , around each “ Thinstalled ” application with it ’s own virtual registry and file system .
Everything is good about Thinstall except it ’s price which is an outrageous $ 4,995 .
What were they thinking when they priced that ! ) .
A fully functional 30 day trial version is available for download on request ( even that can be a little difficult to obtain .
If you have problems getting it , contact me ) .
We will use that .
Thinstall requires you to have a clean PC , one that has been freshly installed with Windows .
Also the application that you are converting into a portable one should n’t be already installed in the machine .
But do n’t worry , it works equally well with an old Windows system .
I had MS Office 2003 on my system and had it removed prior to this process and it worked without any problem .
I ’m not sure though , whether it would work with all applications .
In that case , you can carry the following operations on a virtual PC .
1. Install Thinstall and run Setup Capture ( the application ’s main executable ) .
Click Start .
2. Select drive C and the drive where you plan to install the application ( in this case , MS Office ) .
If you want to install MS Office in drive C itself , then select only drive C .
3. Click Pre-Install Scan and allow the program to complete scanning of the selected drives .
4 . Once it finishes scanning , install MS Office on your PC like you normally would .
5 . After you have finished installing Office , click Post - Install Scan and again wait till it completes the second scan .
6 . You will be now asked to select the executables that you wish to make portable .
Select all the boxes from the list and click continue .
7 . Finally you will asked to specify a path where you wish to store the files .
8 . Now open the directory where the files were saved and run build .
bat .
Thinstall will now create the portable files required and save them inside a folder named bin inside the same directory .
Inside bin you will find the self contained exe files of MS Office .
Copy this directory into your USB drive .
Now you can run MS
Office directly from the thumb drive .
I even made a portable version of Photoshop CS2 .
Create as many portable applications you like !

WHEN Shai Agassi , long the heir apparent at SAP , was told in March 2007 that he would not become chief executive for at least another two years , he quit .
And when the German software giant then tried to change his mind by offering to make him boss right away , he realised he was “ much more excited ” about the new chance that his unexpected freedom would grant him .
In January Mr Agassi 's new start - up , Better Place , announced its first deal , in partnership with Renault , a carmaker , and the government of Israel : to “ get an entire country off its addiction to gasoline ” by switching to electric cars .
Though Mr Agassi is the most senior executive so far to quit a mainstream information - technology firm for clean tech , he is far from alone .
Mr Agassi ( pictured right , above ) joins Elon Musk ( pictured left ) , a co-founder of PayPal who is now chairman of Tesla Motors , an electric - car start - up , and Vinod Khosla ( pictured centre ) , a legendary venture capitalist who has switched his focus from dotcommery to greenery , among many others .
“ There is an unbelievable migration of talent from traditional technology to clean technology , ” says Adam Grosser , a partner at Foundation Capital , a big Silicon Valley venture firm .
“ They have had their social conscience energised , and they believe there is a lot of money to be made .
So you get to exercise your capitalist desires while feeling self - righteous at the same time . ”
Many of these techies are being recruited by the same Silicon Valley venture firms that were behind successive generations of tech companies , from PC - makers to software companies to two waves of internet firms .
Along with Foundation Capital , several of the leading venture firms , including Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures , are now betting big on green .
The multi-billion - dollar question is whether the skills that make somebody a successful executive , entrepreneur or investor in digital technology also work with green technology .
What does a software guru bring to biofuels ?
Can you build an electric car in a garage ?
The answers may have huge implications for the planet .
Mr Khosla , who made his fortune as a co-founder of Sun Microsystems , a computer - maker , has no doubt that the Silicon Valley model can succeed in this new field .
Partly , that is because he believes that dramatic change can best be achieved by entrepreneurial start - ups , which are not lumbered with the incremental outlook of what , in the early days of the internet , were called “ big dumb companies ” .
With market risk declining fast , as even the American government mandates big increases in renewable energy and energy efficiency , much of the job is coming down to backing the right technology .
Mr Khosla believes that venture capitalists are good at understanding and managing technology risks , in whatever industry they are in .
Traditional energy companies understand and take on exploration risk , say , but do not feel comfortable investing in a new fuel technology with a similar level of risk , he says .
“ People in venture and IT are used to operating in a context when you do n't know if a technology will work , and we start building before the design is finalised and fix it as we go along , ” he says .
They are also used to a high failure rate , which they balance against the prospect of rich rewards when things go well .
“ What really differentiates the Silicon Valley community is its ability to work with entrepreneurs in all sectors and shape early - stage businesses , ” says Bill Ford of General Atlantic , a private - equity firm that is investing heavily in greenery .
“ Over my career in Silicon Valley , I have learnt how to create and grow technology - based companies , ” says David Cope , chief executive of Purfresh , a company that focuses on purifying water and food without using nasty chemicals .
He previously worked for a string of tech companies , from IBM to BizGenics , a software firm .
The internet is so passé
Mr Agassi says that what he brings from SAP is an ability to think systematically about solving problems .
“ I learnt how to understand a big problem , break it into small pieces , solve every one of these pieces and to reintegrate them back into a system , ” he says , noting that previous attempts to introduce electric cars have failed because of a lack of systemic thinking .
His solution brings together four pieces : Renault , which will build the cars ; Better Place , which will provide the infrastructure that allows consumers to recharge the cars easily ; investors to finance the infrastructure ; and a government ready to offer a large tax break to anyone ready to buy a zero-emissions car — Israel has guaranteed its tax break until 2019 .
In some cases , the leap from computing to greenery may not be all that big .
Most geeks already have a science background ( though Mr Musk abandoned his physics doctorate after two days ) .
Building solar panels has much in common with building microchips .
“ It is all about miniaturisation and the use of silicon , ” says Mr Ford .
If he is right to expect a “ Moore 's Law for solar ” , the effectiveness of the technology will increase at a predictable rate .
One of the early successes in the green boom is SunPower , a solar - energy firm spun out of Cypress Semiconductor , which now has a stockmarket value of nearly $ 6 billion .
Similarly , energy firms operate huge distribution networks — another area in which geeks feel at home .
“ When I joined from Perot Systems in 2004 , the last - mile technology for energy utilities had not been invented , and I saw a huge opportunity to help utilities connect more efficiently with their customers , ” says Scott Lang , the chief executive of Silver Spring Networks .
His firm applies internet technology to utilities ' networks to improve energy efficiency and manage demand .
“ This is classic IT , ” he says .
He reckons that nearly half of the demand for new generation capacity around the world over the next 15 years could be met instead through greater efficiency .
One danger for tech executives who go green is that “ they may expect things to happen too quickly , ” says Mr Lang .
“ They are used to overnight change , but this is going to take time . ”
Another , at least for some green start - ups , is the amount of capital that has to be laid out at an early stage .
“ The amounts of money on the line are radically different from traditional technology start - ups , ” says Mitch Mandich , a 25 - year veteran of Silicon Valley technology firms , including Apple , who runs Range Fuels , which is building America 's first cellulosic - ethanol plant in Georgia .
( The idea is that turning plant material such as switchgrass , wood or agricultural waste into biofuel will overcome the drawbacks of corn - based ethanol , which is inefficient and drives up food prices . )
He has had to learn to raise money from New York investment banks and hedge funds , as well as from his venture - capital backers .
Clean - tech start - ups very quickly leave the $ 5 m - 10 m range , he says , and go to $ 50 m and $ 100 m fundraising rounds .
“ The stakes get very high much earlier . ”
For this reason , Foundation Capital is focusing on firms that improve energy use .
Attempts to design clean fuels are “ not capital efficient ” , says Mr Grosser , noting that “ building plants costs hundreds of millions , and the margins may be low . ”
Mr Khosla , an investor in Range Fuels and other clean - fuel firms , disagrees .
He thinks the huge market opportunity in “ replacing coal and oil ” justifies the huge risks .
Then there is the need to focus on government policy .
When it comes to green investing , public - policy risk may matter at least as much as technology risk .
Even though the three main remaining candidates for the White House all say they will introduce a mandatory federal cap - and - trade scheme to limit America 's carbon - dioxide emissions , the details have yet to be agreed on and the votes cast .
“ Managing public - policy risk is not something traditional technology executives have had to do , so there will be a steep learning curve , ” says Diana Glassman , an environmental - business banker at Credit Suisse .
Still , they are off to a promising start .
Mr Khosla is fast building a reputation as a wily Washington wheeler - dealer .
Range Fuels has won a $ 76 m grant for its Georgia plant from the Department of Energy .
And having bonded successfully with Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert in Israel , Mr Agassi confidently predicts another deal between Better Place and a national government “ within 100 days ” .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Bailing out Bear Stearns Cos. wo n't address the falling home prices and tide of foreclosures that will continue to plague the economy , some observers said Monday .
Consumers remain in an environment where nothing substantial has been done to prevent foreclosures , said Jim Carr , chief operating officer of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
The Bear Stearns deal highlights the need for faster action on legislation to enable the widespread modification of bad loans , consumer advocates say , and the importance of improving related asset quality .
" It 's almost stunning to witness the shoring up of a major financial institution , but not addressing the problem that the quality of housing assets is deteriorating with each minute we wait , " Carr said .
The Federal Reserve is backing J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s JPM , - 0.84 % bargain - basement buy of Bear , which was the second - largest underwriter of mortgage - backed securities -- a move that some say is " bailing out " Bear .
See full story .
Kurt Eggert , a law professor at Chapman University 's School of Law in Orange , Calif. , and a former member of the Fed 's consumer advisory council , said the Bear deal shows the " growing disconnect between the Bush administration 's willingness to help Wall Street and its willingness to aid the homeowners facing foreclosure . "
A plan to reduce foreclosures should be the top priority , he said , as defaults and foreclosures have been at the root of the subprime crisis .
" Of all the investment houses , Bear Stearns was the one most deserving of going under because of the subprime crisis , both for its ownership of a subprime lender and its work packaging those loans , " Eggert said .
" However , the Feds are doing more to help Bear Stearns than the borrowers facing foreclosure because of Bear Stearns actions . "
Addressing one financial institution at a time is not a solution to the economy 's woes , and there needs to be more focus on addressing the quality of assets that institutions are holding , NCRC 's Carr said .
" There has to be a plan that addresses the loans that are increasingly upside down , " Carr said .
" Every day that we wait more and more people 's home loans become upside down because housing prices continue to fall . "
Home prices fell 8.9 % in 2007 , the largest decline in the Case - Shiller home price index in at least 20 years , according to a recent reading of the index .
Foreclosure filings were up 60 % in February from the prior year , but down 4 % from January , according to online marketplace RealtyTrac , which forecast increasing foreclosure activity .
Danilo Pelletiere , research director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition , said there has not been enough attention and action on helping low - income homeowners in trouble .
" The folks that are very likely to need to be bailed out are those that were brought into homeownership and invested all their wealth , " Pelletiere said .
" There 's a strong push not to have the bailout focus on those people . "
Far - reaching proposals needed
Some homeowner assistance programs are already in action , such as FHASecure , which is limited by eligibility requirements , and Hope Now , a voluntary alliance .
But those programs have had a limited impact , and far - reaching legislation is needed to prevent the " foreclosure epidemic " underway , said Allen Fishbein , director of credit and housing policy with the Consumer Federation of America .
He supports foreclosure prevention legislation that is under consideration in Congress , including a proposal that would enable bankruptcy judges to revise mortgage contracts , helping homeowners make their payments .
" Bankruptcy reform is direct and does not involve any bailout at all , " Fishbein said .
" There are some lawmakers who think that normal market forces are going to correct this problem .
Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their homes while Congress has fiddled deciding whether to enact a government solution . "
Some say those who have made their mortgage payments should n't end up subsidizing those who have n't .
" Under the circumstances , the most appropriate federal response would be to propose policies aimed at restoring personal responsibility and financial independence , " according to a Heritage Foundation statement .
In his Saturday radio address , President Bush said the government can help " responsible homeowners weather this rough patch , " but that some actions could have unintended consequences and hurt some homeowners .
" For example , one proposal would give bankruptcy courts the authority to reduce mortgage debts by judicial decree , " Bush said .
" This would make it harder to afford a home in the future , because banks would charge higher interest rates to cover this risk . "
The president also opposes proposals that would " artificially prop up home prices , " reasoning that delaying a correction would prolong problems .
" We are focused on helping a targeted group of homeowners -- those who have made responsible buying decisions and could avoid foreclosure with a little help , " Bush said .
Borrowers at risk
Looking to " stem the significant rise in mortgage foreclosures , " Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , has offered a plan to enable the Federal Housing Administration to insure and guarantee refinanced mortgages that have been significantly written down by mortgage holders and lenders .
That plan would help refinance 1 million to 2 million loans for at - risk borrowers , according to Frank .

A plan from NCRC calls for a three - year program called " HELP Now " that would see the Treasury Department buying loans , including those held in securitized pools , at a steep discount .
Loan pools purchased by the federal government would be sold back to the private market after being discounted and modified with lower principals and interest rates .
Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , said a number of proposals that are geared toward helping homeowners facing foreclosure will actually benefit banks and other holders of bad mortgage debt -- institutions that could " earn tens of billions of dollars at taxpayer expense . "
He added that owning can be much more expensive than renting .
" It 's really infuriating for me that we pushed low - and moderate - income people to buy overpriced houses with really bad mortgages , " he said .
" And even now , after it 's proven so disastrous , you have politicians that still can't take two minutes and think for a second that maybe it's not a good idea for everyone to be homeowner regardless of what price they 're buying at . "
AUSTIN , TEXAS ( Fortune ) --
We 've all been there : the dull business conference .
A half - empty room of half - asleep attendees answer their e-mail on laptops and BlackBerries , while some hapless speaker lumbers through a PowerPoint speech .
That scenario is about to change , thanks to the growing ubiquity of social media .
Consider author Sarah Lacy 's disastrous interview of Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Festival here .
Lacy , a Business Week columnist and author of a forthcoming book on Zuckerberg and other Web 2.0 titans , drew the crowd 's wrath by asking Zuckerberg too many questions about his age and his company 's outrageous $ 15 billion valuation and not enough questions about issues more fundamental to how Facebook operates - things like trust , privacy , and accessibility to software developers .
On top of that , Lacy interrupted Zuckerberg , seemed to flirt with him , and then grew hostile as the crowd turned against her .
And did it ever turn .
Many in the audience started posting their thoughts on Twitter , a service that broadcasts instant messages , and the ire built .
The crowd began hooting and jeering , and finally , when she opened the mike to questions , the first person asked Zuckerberg : " Other than rough interviews , what are some of the biggest challenges Facebook faces ? "
Lacy turned to Zuckerberg , asked , " Has this been a rough interview ? " and the audience member said , " I was n't asking you , I was asking Mark . "
The crowd went wild .
A bitter Lacy said she saw in the debacle " the downside of Web 2.0 , " but many others see it as a signature moment - for what it says about the coming wave of new media , for what it says about the way attendees can take over conferences , and even for the signals it sends about the still rising tide of people power that Web 2.0 has unleashed .
There were many similar episodes at this year 's SXSW , a conference packed with folks empowered by their own mini-media empires on Flickr , Facebook , YouTube , Blip.tv , Twitter , Utterz and a host of other tech sites .
Several attendees told of being in smaller panel discussions in which people either twittering or commenting in chat rooms run by social networker Meebo turned the conversation into a new direction .
In one , " a revolution in the chat room tore apart the panel , " according to Forrester analyst Jeremiah Owyang .
One person finally stood and requested permission to ask a question .
" They said ' No ' , " Owyang recalled , " and he said , ' The whole room is behind me .
I 'm going to ask it anyway ' . "
When the panel , on " Social Media Metrics , " started to drag , according to Dave Evans of Digital Voodoo , a social media consulting firm in Austin , " you could see the laptops flip up and see the twitters happening . "
The panelists saw they were not giving the information that the audience wanted , and refocused the presentation , Evans said .
" It was a really interesting collision between the Twitter back - channel and the live , public - facing channel , " Evans said .
" We always say that the crowd is taking control in a marketing buzzword kind of way , " Owyang said , " but now it 's actually happening . "
This movement - call it Conference 2.0 - has been building for some time .
Signs have been popping up in various places :
* The " un-conference " model , in which people show up for a conference and the participants pick the agenda and run it in an " open space " model .
The most prominent of these has been tech publisher Tim O'Reilly 's Foo Camp , in which a select crowd spends a weekend camping out in O'Reilly 's offices in Sebastopol , Calif . ; and barcamp , a more grassroots effort that sprang up in response to Foo Camp .
Scores of barcamps have been held around the world in the last year and a half .
* The " lobbycon " phenomenon , in which people do n't pay to go to conferences , they just show up and network in the lobbies .
This is particularly big at Web 2.0 and other Silicon Valley events .
Why pay top dollar to hear a sponsored session when everyone you want to see will be hanging out in the public areas for free ?
* The " panel picker , " an online forum that SXSW uses in which people suggest panels and then the community votes on what they want to see .
The winners get to present .
At this year 's festival , about 130 of the 150 panels were chosen this way .
* Parties 2.0 - a big draw at SXSW is the parties , but now that attendance is pushing 8,000 , some of the bashes feature insane lines .
When the Google party was too packed to get in , tech bloggers Robert Scoble ( who does Web broadcasts for Fast Company ) and Scott Beale of San Francisco Web hosting firm Laughing Squid first twittered that the line was ridiculous , and then twittered that they 'd start their own party at another bar .
They called it the Alta Vista party and in half an hour had about 100 people .
" The entire un- conference movement started from the frustration with terrible interviews and terrible panels , " said Chris Heuer , a social media consultant in San Francisco who has run his own un-conferences , such as Web 2.1 , which he runs for free during the high - priced and exclusive Web 2.0 conference .
" People finally feel empowered to take control . "
Heuer recalls attending an AlwaysOn conference at Stanford University a few years ago in which the organizers had chat rooms projected onto a screen behind the speakers .
" The value in the chat room was greater than what was being said on the stage , " Heuer said .
" People now have a voice , enabled by technology , to participate and be heard , and they 're going to use it , " Heuer said .
" This has only just begun .
It 's only the first inkling of how people are going to seize the power from institutions .
People in power need to find ways to get the audience to participate . "
Dave McClure , who runs conferences including the Web 2.0 Expo and Graphing Social Patterns for O'Reilly Media , said the change is healthy .
" I do n't feel threatened by it at all , " he said .
" If you 're watching what 's going on in Twitter , you get a lot more feedback , and you can run a much more interesting session .
People might want to be more on their toes understanding what the audience wants . "
For his part , Zuckerberg had said from the stage how proud he was that Facebook had helped people in Colombia organize in massive demonstrations against their country 's civil strife .
He clearly heard the message , though , from his own acolytes in the SXSW ballroom .
After his keynote debacle , he announced he'd have an informal question and answer session the next afternoon .
About 200 people packed a bar where Facebook had been hosting a " developers ' garage , " and Zuckerberg fielded questions on everything from his personal life , to when he 'll open up things like Facebook 's friend lists to outside application builders .
" Yesterday 's Q&A just was n't enough fun , " he said , somewhat in jest .
He has refused to fault Lacy 's questioning , instead taking heat himself : " We just did n't open it up to questions early enough .
People at this conference are more interested in the policy and the platform . "
One attendee told him , " We give you props for doing that . "
The people were heard .

Thousands of pet cats in Beijing are being abandoned by their owners and sent to die in secretive government pounds as China mounts an aggressive drive to clean up the capital in preparation for the Olympic Games .
Hundreds of cats a day are being rounded and crammed into cages so small they cannot even turn around .
Then they are trucked to what animal welfare groups describe as death camps on the edges of the city .
The cull comes in the wake of a government campaign warning of the diseases cats carry and ordering residents to help clear the streets of them .

Doomed : Terrified cats crammed tightly into cages are hauled off to a meat market in Guangzhou
Cat owners , terrified by the disease warning , are dumping their pets in the streets to be picked up by special collection teams .
Paranoia is so intense that six stray cats - including two pregnant females - were beaten to death with sticks by teachers at a Beijing kindergarten , who feared they might pass illnesses to the children .
China 's leaders are convinced that animals pose a serious urban health risk and may have contributed to the outbreak of SARS - a deadly respiratory virus - in 2003 .
But the crackdown on cats is seen by animal campaigners as just one of a number of extreme measures being taken by communist leaders to ensure that its capital appears clean , green and welcoming during the Olympics .

Secretive :
The compound at Da Niu Fang which is patrolled by security guards
Polluting factories in and around the city are being ordered to shut down or relocate during the Games to ease Beijing 's choking smog and drivers are allowed out on to the roads only three times a week .
Fares on the city 's underground network have been cut to just two yuan ( 14p ) for any journey - a six - fold reduction on some routes - to keep people off buses , and beggars and street sleepers are being moved to out - of - town camps or given train fares back to their home provinces .
Meanwhile , taxi drivers have been made to attend lessons in how to greet passengers politely in English and a city - wide courtesy campaign has been launched to teach Beijing 's notoriously dour and grumpy citizens how to smile and be pleasant to foreigners .
The cull of Beijing 's estimated 500,000 cat population is certain to provoke international outrage as it comes just over a year after the Chinese were criticised for rounding up and killing stray dogs across the country .

Refuge : Campaigner Hu Yuan , 80 , with some of the 250 cats she has taken in at her Beijing home
Animal welfare groups in China are already protesting , but their members fear punishment from the authorities .
Officials say people can adopt animals from the 12 cat pounds set up around the city , but welfare groups say they are almost impossible to get inside and believe few cats survive .
One cat lovers ' group negotiated the release of 30 pets from one of the compounds in Shahe , north - west Beijing , but said they were in such a pitiful condition that half of them died within days of their release .
" These cats are being left to die .
It is very inhumane , " said the group 's founder Yan Qi , who runs a sanctuary for cats .
A rescued pet showing clear signs of disease
" People do n't want to keep cats in Beijing any more so they abandon them or send them to the compounds .
" When we went inside , we saw about 70 cats being kept in cages stacked one on top of the other in two tiny rooms .
" Disease spreads quickly among them and they die slowly in agony and distress .
The government wo n't even do the cats the kindness of giving them lethal injections when they become sick .
They just wait for them to die .
" It is the abandoned pets that suffer the most and die the soonest .
They relied so much on their owners that they can't cope with the new environment .
" Most refuse to eat or drink and get sick more quickly than the feral cats . "
Ms Yan 's group has now been denied access to the pounds .
" We do not believe any of the cats that go in there survive , " she said .
" They are like death camps . "
Ms Yan said there was another reason for people abandoning their cats - the 200 yuan ( £ 14 ) fee they face if they want to have their pets neutered and tagged .
" We have tried to negotiate with the government to stop the round - ups and to introduce cut - price neutering services so that people can afford to keep their pets but they wo n't listen to us , " she said .
" They are not thinking about the cats .
They just want to get results in the quickest way possible , by clearing as many cats from the city as they can . "
Retired doctor Hu Yuan , 80 , runs one of the few remaining refuges for abandoned pets in her ramshackle home in the ancient Long Tou Jing area of Beijing .
She shares her tiny home with 250 abandoned cats and has taken in 70 over the past 12 months alone .
She pays for neutering and food from her pension and donations .
She said : " If I do n't take them in , the government will kill them .
" People believe what the government tells them and that is why they are abandoning more and more family pets . "
She said the problem could be traced back to former president Jiang Zemin for the crackdown .
" He did n't like dogs so he decided to have dogs killed .
But there was a bad reaction from the foreign media and they were pressured to stop .
" Now they have stopped killing dogs but the new victims are cats .
It is all connected to the Olympics . "
Cats are regularly dumped on her doorstep late at night by owners frightened by the government campaign .
" The situation is very bad now , " said Ms Hu .
" When women get pregnant , the doctor will ask them if they have a cat in the house .
" If they reply Yes , they tell them , ' You must get rid of it , it will be bad for the baby ' .
" I keep all the cats in my house and 100 of them sleep in my bedroom at night .
I am too frightened to let them out .
If they go outside , they will be taken away and killed .
" The government is not telling people the truth .
Look at me .
I live with them 24 hours a day , seven days a week and I am very healthy . "
The round - up has been particularly intense in areas around Olympic venues and in streets and alleys surrounding five - star hotels where guests will stay during the summer games .
Despite the health warnings , the round - up of cats has led to a surge in the number of restaurants in the capital serving cat meat , according to Ms Hu .
She said hundreds of cats were also being sent to Guangzhou in southern China , an area infamous for restaurants that serve meat from cats and dogs and exotic animals such as snakes and tigers .
It was in July last year that district officials were instructed to begin an intense round - up of cats as part of Beijing 's pre-Olympics clean - up .
Now notices have been put up urging residents to hand in cats .
Welfare groups estimate that tens of thousands have been collected in the past few months .
The Mail on Sunday went to the cat pound in Shahe on the north - western fringes of Beijing but we were repeatedly refused admission .
" No one can come in without official papers , " staff shouted from behind padlocked steel gates .
At another , larger compound in Da Niu Fang village , the sound of cats wailing could be clearly heard coming from a cluster of tin-roofed sheds , but workers denied they were holding any cats .
" There are no cats here , go away .
No one is allowed inside unless you have official permission , " a security guard said .
The killing of the six stray cats at the kindergarten - where staff at a Beijing cigarette factory leave their children - is the most striking illustration of the city - wide fear of cats .
A teacher at the nursery said : " We did it out of love for the children .
We were worried the cats might harm them .
These six cats had been hanging around the kindergarten looking for food .
" So three male teachers put out plates of tuna in cages for bait , trapped the cats and then beat them to death with sticks .
" We were very worried the children might try to stroke them and that the cats might scratch them or pass on diseases .
We had to get rid of the cats and this was the only way to do it . "
Christie Yang of the charity Animals Asia , which liaises with the Beijing animal welfare groups , said : " We are seriously concerned .
" We understand that with the Olympic Games the Beijing government is eager to show the world the city in a good light .
" But capturing and dealing with cats in such an inhumane way will seriously tarnish the image of Beijing and the Games . "

Alex Lenkei is not the first patient to reject an anaesthetic in favour of hypnosis before undergoing surgery – but he may be the first to have hypnotised himself .
At Worthing Hospital , Sussex , the 61 - year - old registered hypnotist sedated himself with techniques he has used since the age of 16 .
The surgery , carried out last Wednesday , involved taking a sliver of bone from the base of his right thumb and fusing the joint in a bid to improve his arthritis .

Yesterday Mr Lenkei said : " It went amazingly well .
It took between 30 seconds to a minute for me to place myself under hypnosis and I felt a very deep relaxation .
At one stage a hammer and chisel was used as well as a surgical saw , but I felt no pain .
I was aware of everything . "
His surgeon , David Llew - ellyn - Clark , said he was happy with the result .
" Some people are very anxious about anaesthetic so I am always looking for alternatives .
I was confident Mr Lenkei is a skilled hypnotist and I am delighted . "
Studies suggest that not using standard anaesthetics can speed recovery and cut time spent in hospital .

The handsome young waiter 's eyes followed Sarah as she walked across the restaurant , and she felt her heart beating faster as he leaned over to place a napkin in her lap .
" At 54 , I was unused to the attention of young men , especially a handsome one in his 20s , " she says .
" Our eyes connected as I told myself not to be silly - he could n't possibly be interested in me .
But I was wrong . "
Sarah Jarvis is 59 and has four grown - up children and four grandchildren .
Attractive , slim and smartly dressed , she has been divorced from her lawyer husband for 15 years , and had resigned herself to a series of uninspiring dates with overweight , balding men of her own age at home in Chester .
But here , on holiday with a girlfriend in the Turkish resort of Dalaman , was the promise of something very different .
For Sarah was about to become one of the many thousands of British women courted by the legions of young foreign men in such tourist hotspots as Turkey , Egypt , Jamaica , the Gambia and Kenya .
This summer , thousands of these middle - aged , single women will pour off the planes , to be met by countless fit , athletic - looking dark - skinned young men who will casually approach them , saying : " What a beautiful lady you are .
Can I help you find your hotel ? "
The chance of a harmless sexual fling , or something more sinister ?
Writer Jeannette Belliveau , a self - confessed former " sex tourist " and author of a book called Romance On The Road , says the problem is becoming endemic and that these women are deluding themselves about the dangers such flings present .
" The ultimate risk is death , " she says , bluntly .
" In the past two years three Western women have been killed for their money by their foreign ' toy boys ' . "
Some of these women tourists never went home after their holiday .
Barbara Scott - Jones , 61 , from Leeds fell in love with Jamaica and was building a home on the island when she was found dead earlier this year .

Labourer Omar Reid has been charged with her murder .
Police believe Barbara had been having an affair with the 30 - year - old and had just ended , or was trying to end , the affair when she was killed .
The number of older women who form long - term relationships with holiday gigolos is growing year on year .
Statistically , a third of all cross-cultural " marriages " end in divorce .
Fifty - three - year - old Jeannette , from Surrey , divorced in her early 30s .
A few years later , despairing of the lack of dates in the UK , she began to travel the world and had numerous sexual encounters with young , foreign men .
Today , she is married to Lamont Harvey , a historian ten years her junior .
" The trouble is that for divorced or widowed women in their 40s , 50s and 60s , their male peers in the UK are either very unattractive or are looking to date much younger women .
" In countries such as the Gambia and Kenya , there is both a surplus of men and the fact that women there tend to marry men at least ten years older than themselves , which is the culture .
So for 18 - year - old and 20 - plus men , there is no one to date .
" Poverty is rife .
Then , over the past ten years , planeloads of mature single British women have started arriving , their handbags full of cash .
They 're fit , good - looking men and it did n't take them long to realise that there are rich pickings here . "
Sarah now realises how deluded she was during her Turkish fling .
She began sleeping with Mohammed , a waiter , almost as soon as they met .
" The sex was amazing , " she says .
" Either Mohammed was a very good actor - which is more than possible - or he genuinely enjoyed going to bed with me .

" Imagine what it was like for me , a fifty - something women who felt abandoned , unloved and on the shelf , thinking no man would ever find me attractive again .
Here was a beautiful young man with the most incredible , fit body , begging me to go to bed with him .
" Even though alarm bells were ringing , I thought : ' Why not ?
What if I never get this opportunity again ?'
" He asked me to go for a walk with him when we were in the restaurant .
My friend said ' You can't be serious ' , but I said : ' Why not ? '
And off we went .
He kissed me and before I knew what was happening I was inviting him up to my hotel room . "
At 54 , Sarah had gone through the menopause and , deciding there was no risk of pregnancy , did not use a condom .
" I can now see that this was extremely foolish , as I later discovered Mohammed had slept with hundreds of women , " she says .
" I could have picked up a sexually transmitted disease , not to mention the threat of Aids . "
As they lay together , Mohammed told her he was 22 .
" For the rest of my holiday we spent most of the time in bed .
It must have been awful for my friend , but I did n't care .
I was on cloud nine .
" He would look into my eyes and cry , saying : ' I want to grow old with you , and I want to take care of you for the rest of my life . '
" When I left him at the airport he was in tears , making me promise to write every day and come back soon .
" As soon as I got home I phoned him .
He mentioned that he needed some new shoes , and could I send a small amount of cash ?
Still besotted and with the memory of so much happiness , I sent him money .
" Gradually , the requests began to multiply .
Could I send him the money for a DVD player , as he did not have one ?
Whenever alarm bells began to ring and I sounded a bit short with him , he made me promise to fly out and see him .
" Within that year , I flew back to Turkey four times , spending a fortune not only on plane tickets , but on gifts for him . "
Meanwhile , back in the UK , her children were highly dubious of mum's new ' boyfriend ' .
" I did n't dare tell them how young he was , and played down the fact that he was a waiter , " she says .
" I said he was in his 30s and ran his own business .
They were saying : ' Look , Mum , this guy is clearly a conman . '
I told them not to interfere , that I knew what I was doing . "
As they lay together in Sarah 's hotel bedroom Mohammed poured out all his financial woes : he was responsible for his elderly parents and was the only bread - winner in the family .
" He made me feel guilty if I questioned his constant need for money , " she says .
For the next three years , Sarah flew to Turkey five times a year .
Not only did she give Mohammed thousands of pounds , she also flew him on holiday to Istanbul and the coastal resort of Marmaris .
" Sometimes we'd be walking down the street , hand in hand , and other British tourists would look at us askance , " says Sarah .
" But I was very defiant - they did n't realise that this was a real relationship , that we were in love . "
Sex tourism by British women is not a new phenomenon .
As far back as the 1890s , there are recorded incidents of single British women becoming involved with dark - skinned Italian and French men on their cultural ' tours ' of Europe .
During the British Raj , it was not unknown for English matrons to fall prey to the darkeyed charms of young Indian men .
But in the past two decades , the phenomenon has escalated .
Author Jeannette says that since the 1990s , hundreds of thousands of western women have had affairs with much younger foreign men .
" These are respectable middleclass women .
Not all of them are unwitting victims to these sexual conmen , " she says .
" I have spoken to many women who fly to the Gambia or Jamaica specifically for the purpose of recreational sex . "
Indeed , some British women are utterly shameless about it .
Nicky Jardine , 50 , who has two adult daughters and runs her own headhunting business in Guildford , Surrey , goes on holidays with the intention of having sex with young foreigners .
" I see nothing wrong in being a sex tourist , " she says .
" My working life is very stressful .
Holidays are a time when I can have fun .
I have dated men here , but men my age want younger women , and they are also boring .
Compare them to a fit , tanned 20 - year - old Egyptian ! "
Nicky first had sex on a holiday four years ago .
She says : " I went on my own to Egypt .
I did n't go looking for sex , but on the first day I became aware I was being eyed up by a very handsome young Egyptian who worked in the hotel complex .
" I told myself not to be silly , but then he approached me and told me I was beautiful . "
Nicky invited him to her room .
" It was amazing , " she says .
" Maybe he 'd targeted lots of British women before - who cares ?
I was n't looking for a long - term romance .
" Of course , you have to realise that these people might be living in poverty .
You could be robbed , or even kidnapped .
But I felt quite safe when I was with him . "
Now she is settled into a pattern of wild holiday flings totally at odds with her respectable image .
Indeed , many would argue that her insouciance about such promiscuity is rather demeaning .
Last year , Nicky enjoyed a Caribbean cruise .
" A young crew member made advances , " she smiles .
" We had the most amazing times in my cabin .
I 'd taken my mum with me , and she knew what was going on .
In fact , she said : ' I wish I was 50 again ! ' "
" I totally understand why more and more British single women like me are going on holiday looking for sex .
It 's the easiest thing in the world to pick up a young , handsome guy who will tell you are beautiful and make passionate love to you .
All it takes is a bit of cash for presents , and I have plenty of that .
" I always practise safe sex , so no one gets hurt .
But I would tell women to be careful .
Always use a condom and do n't go off with these men .
They are strangers , after all . "
Five years on and Sarah Jarvis no longer looks back on her holiday romance with rose - tinted glasses .
" I must have spent more than £ 20,000 on Mohammed , " she says .
" On my final trip last year , I rang his mobile as usual when I arrived at the airport .
There was no reply .
" I drove to the hotel where he worked as a waiter , and stormed into his tiny room .
He was in bed with an elderly , white woman - like me .
He rang me , sobbing , saying it was all a mistake and he loved me .
" Later I marched up to the woman in the hotel dining room and asked her , very calmly , what she thought she was doing .
She looked at me in surprise .
' But he 's my boyfriend , ' she said .
' We are in love , and I have been flying backwards and forwards from the UK to see him .
" I told her I had , too .
She said she had promised Mohammed she would leave her husband and marry him .
I said she was a fool . "
Sarah then told Mohammed that his lies had been exposed and ended the relationship .
" Speaking to some of the hotel staff , I found out Mohammed had at least 40 white girlfriends , " she says .
" It must have been a real juggling act making sure we did n't all arrive at the same time .
Goodness knows how much money he was making out of us all .
" I know people will think : ' How could you be so stupid ? '
But you have to realise just how seductive it is , if you feel fat , old and ugly , to have a beautiful young man saying he cannot live without you and making love to you as if you were a stunning creature . "
But Sarah adds : " More than anything , I want to send out a warning to all the British women planning a holiday romance this summer : do n't do it !
" It will cost you thousands of pounds , and you will end up feeling ridiculous and despised .
These are practised conmen - they do n't think you are beautiful ; they laugh at you behind your backs . "
Jeannette agrees .
" Wise up , " she says .
" At the very least you will be fleeced out of hundreds , maybe thousands of pounds .
In Kenya and Africa generally , Aids is endemic and you are putting yourself at serious risk .
" Some of these guys are so poor they have nothing to lose , and they may turn violent .
If you go off alone with them and change your mind , they may well rape you anyway .
" I know I have been guilty of sex tourism in the past , but there is no way I would take those risks now , knowing what I know . "

By 2020 the terms " interface " and " user " will be obsolete as computers merge ever closer with humans .
It is one prediction in a Microsoft - backed report drawn from the discussions of 45 academics from the fields of computing , science , sociology and psychology .
It predicts fundamental changes in the field of so - called Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) .
By 2020 humans will increasingly interrogate machines , the report said .
In turn computers will be able to anticipate what we want from them , which will require new rules about our relationship with machines .
Table map
The report , entitled Being Human : Human - Computer Interaction in the year 2020 , looks at how the development of technologies over the next decade can better reflect human values .
" It is about how we anticipate the uses of technology rather than being reactive .
Currently the human is not considered part of the process , " said Bill Buxton , from Microsoft Research .
At the launch of the report some of the authors showed off the types of technologies that could bring the human back into the equation .
At Goldsmiths College , Professor Bill Gaver and his team have developed a Drift table , a piece of furniture which allows people to view aerial photography of their local neighbourhood and beyond .
" It is n't really designed for anything , " explained Prof Gaver .
" People can use it for entertainment or learning .
One of the people that was given the table used to check out houses in Southampton following a piece on the news about house prices going up in the area .
" Someone else used it to look at the towns they lived in as a child or to visit towns where friends lived , " he said .
The table has no buttons and the small display in the middle moves as a result of pressure being put on the table .
" From central London it would take a day to navigate the table to the coast , " said Prof Gaver .
Other prototype technologies aimed at putting human needs at the centre of the equation include the Whereabouts Clock .
The interface - designed at Microsoft 's research labs in Cambridge - allows people to see where other members of their family are at any given time .
The categories of " home " , " work " and " school " are deliberately vague in order to maintain privacy , explained Abigail Sellen , from Microsoft Research .
Other communication devices for the home that Microsoft is working on include Epigraph , an interface that allows family members to " post " pictures and messages to each other via their mobile phones .
Smart devices
The keyboard , mouse and monitor will increasingly be replaced by more intuitive forms of interaction and display , including tablet computers , speech recognition systems and fingertip - operated surfaces .
Without proper consideration and control it is possible that we - both individually and collectively - may no longer be in control of ourselves or the world around us
Being Human - Microsoft HCI report Boundaries between humans and computers will become blurred over the next decade as devices are embedded in objects , our clothing or , in the case of medical monitoring , in our bodies .
Although paper will still be a reality in 2020 , digital paper will also flourish allowing us to create , for example , social network magazines that update in real time .
Digital storage of even more aspects of our lives , from mobile phone calls to CCTV footage , could be a reality by 2020 and , in combination with an omnipresent network will mean privacy will be a key focus of the HCI community .
Our " digital footprint " - the sharing of more and more aspects of our lives through digital photography , podcasting , blogging and video - is set to get bigger and this will raise key questions about how much information we should store about ourselves .
Losing control
The ever - present network will channel mass market information directly to us while disseminating our own intimate information .
The report dubs this the era of so - called hyper - connectivity and predicts it will mean a growth in " techno - dependency " .
This ever more intimate relationship between humans and computers will be a double - edged sword , it suggests .
Researchers predict an ever - increasing link between man and machine
The report compares the widespread introduction of the calculator - widely blamed for a fall in the standard of mental arithmetic - with what may happen as computers become more intelligent and take on new responsibilities .
" Without proper consideration and control it is possible that we - both individually and collectively - may no longer be in control of ourselves or the world around us , " the report warns .
As well as the need for language to reflect the newly expanded human / computer environment so too the concept of teaching computer science will need to be adapted .
" Not just teaching children about how computers and applications work , but about their wider impact , " reads the report .
Among its recommendations for the future direction of HCI , the report suggests there needs to be greater engagement with government and policy makers .
There also needs to be consideration for how technological developments will go forward in the developing world .
One of the report authors , Gary Marsden from the University of Cape Town in South Africa , showed off a prototype digital noticeboard .
Dubbed Big Board , the display , which is free to use , allows users to download information to their mobile phones about a range of topics including politics , health and even university lectures .
Mobile use in Africa is the fastest growing of anywhere in the world .
The display unit is currently being trialled in community centres , clinics and educational establishments in South Africa .

In words that he has come to regret , Barack Obama opined as to why he was having a hard time winning over many blue - collar voters : " They get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . "
It was a throwaway line to a private audience at a San Francisco fund - raiser .
And it was made public on a liberal Internet blog , not by right - wing commentators .
But Mr. Obama 's opponents seized on the quote .

The Canada Border Services Agency has ruled in a October - December 2007 list ( released this month ) that the American re-releases of the hentai anime series Cool Devices and Words Worth ( pictured at right ) qualify as obscene under subsection 163 ( 8 ) of Canada 's Criminal Code .
Thus , these titles may not be legally brought into the country .
Critical Mass Video , the adult label of Right Stuf Entertainment , brought out the Cool Devices : The DVD Collection with all 11 episodes of the series last September .
It was previously available on VHS from NuTech Digital .
Words Worth was also originally licensed by NuTech ; Media Blasters ' adult - oriented Kitty Media division released the entire series on a single DVD on July 17 .

Gas fingers in glass beads confirm fluid - theory prediction .
Snowflake : injected gas makes a fractal - shaped intrusion in a plate of glass beads .
Courtesy of the researchers
Researchers have confirmed a previously unobserved property of fluids by watching the fractal expansion of a pocket of gas into a thin layer of glass beads .
The experiment adds detail to the understanding of a phenomenon called ‘ viscous fingering ’ , which has been studied for more than 50 years .
When two fluids with different viscosities are mixed together , the more freely flowing fluid expands in finger - shaped intrusions into the other fluid .
This has been observed in many different systems , including between fine grains such as sand1 .
One prediction of models of viscous fingering is that , in fluids with no surface tension , the interface of the fluids should be riddled with points .
Although there has been some effort to look for this in fluids2 , no one has yet been successful ; adding surfactant can help to reduce surface tension in liquids , but not eliminate it .
The remaining surface tension — the interaction between fluid molecules — and thermal motion tends to smooth out any rough edges .
Fractal patterns
To investigate a situation with surface tension as near zero as possible , Xiang Cheng of the University of Chicago set up an experiment with small glass spheres less than half a millimetre in diameter , like course , uniform sand .
Granular systems like this involve very little surface tension , because there is little attraction between grains —
Cheng and his colleagues estimate the surface tension in their glass bead system to be roughly a million times less than in water or ethyl alcohol .
Cheng sandwiched the beads between two transparent circular plates and pushed nitrogen gas into the mass of beads through a small hole in the centre of one of the plates .
At high pressures , the nitrogen quickly blew all the beads to the edges of the plates .
But if the gas was pushed in very slowly , with just enough pressure to shuffle grains along , it expanded in finger - shaped intrusions into the mass of beads ; the dimensions of these intrusions match those seen in fluids .
But , unlike the behaviour of fluids , the boundaries between the gas and the beads were studded with points .
The resulting ' snowflake ' shape has fractal qualities — small parts of the shape look very similar to the shape as a whole .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ People knew in theory that when the surface tension goes to zero , you would see this behaviour , ” says Cheng .
“ This is the first time we can see that shape in a real experiment . ”
The results are published this week in Nature Physics3 .
Although the mass of beads behaved like a fluid in some ways , it also showed some properties that seem unique to a granular system .
The faster a finger formed , the bigger it got , for example .
In fluids , the opposite is true – a finger that is moving fast is much thinner .

The body of the popular Italian saint , Padre Pio , has gone on display in a glass coffin in southern Italy .
Padre Pio was said to have had stigmata , or bleeding wounds of Jesus , on his hands and feet .
His body was exhumed in March on the 40th anniversary of his death .
He was canonised by Pope John Paul II in 2002 .
More than a million people are expected this year to see his body , which is said to be well - preserved .
But there is reportedly no sign of the stigmata .
The head of the Vatican office dealing with sainthood , Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins , led a special open - air Mass in San Giovanni Rotondo , in Puglia .
" This body is here , but Padre Pio is not only a corpse .
Looking at his remains we remember all the good that he has done , " the cardinal said .
Afterwards , Cardinal Saraiva Martins led a group of Church officials into the crypt of Church of St Mary of Grace for a private viewing of the body .
Placed in a glass coffin , Padre Pio was dressed in a brown robe and his was covered in a life - like silicone mask .
Huge following Already , more than 700,000 people have registered to view his body , and more are expected to make the pilgrimage to the Capuchin friary in San Giovanni Rotondo where it is displayed .
Among the pilgrims attending the mass on Thursday was 80 - year - old Assunta Antico , who is confined to a wheelchair .
" I had a stroke two years ago .
I 'm paralysed and I want to walk again , " she told the Reuters news agency .
How Padre Pio became an icon
In pictures : Viewing the saint Padre Pio had a large following both before and after his death .
Some of his devotees say he could foretell the future , as well as know people 's sins before they had confessed .
Some viewed him as a fraud , however , and for many years the Vatican itself was sceptical and banned him from celebrating Mass in public .
One Italian historian wrote last year that he may have used carbolic acid to produce his wounds .
Before his death , the Roman Catholic Church said it was convinced the monk 's claims were not false .
The monks who exhumed his body in March said it was in " surprisingly good condition " , despite no special measures having been taken to preserve it when he was buried in 1968 .
" We could clearly make out the beard .
The top part of the skull is partly skeletal but the chin is perfect and the rest of the body is well preserved .
The knees , hands and nails all clearly visible , " said Archbishop Domenico D'Ambrosio , who led the service to exhume the body .

The government has ordered a wide - ranging investigation into wireless computer networks amid concerns over the potential health risks they pose for millions of schoolchildren and office workers .
The Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) will spend two years conducting lab tests and monitoring exposure levels to the wireless signals in classrooms , homes and offices , before compiling a health risk report on the technology .
Fears over the potential risks of wireless networks have led some school governors to order their withdrawal from classrooms .
Last month , Philip Parkin , the general secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers , said usage of the networks should be suspended in schools until a full inquiry into the health effects had been conducted .
Health agency officials said there was no scientific evidence to suggest the networks pose a danger to health , and expected the studies to record exposure levels " thousands of times below guideline safety limits " .
Pat Troop , chief executive of the HPA , said that while there was no health reason for schools and others to discontinue use of wireless networks , " there has not been extensive research into what people 's exposures are to this new technology , and that is why we are initiating this new programme of research and analysis " .
The investigation will begin with computer models and laboratory simulations to measure the strength of the signals emitted by computers and their wireless base stations .
Dummies fitted with microwave radiation monitors will be used to record exposures at the head level and in other parts of the body .
The investigation will then shift to homes , offices and schools .
Officials are particularly keen to measure exposure levels in classrooms , where tens of computers may be hooked up to a wireless network at the same time .
Safety guidelines drawn up by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation set an exposure limit of two watts a kilo for the head .
Previous measurements of the signals suggest power levels are typically 20 times weaker than that at 0.1 watts a kilo .
Michael Clark , science spokesman for the HPA , said : " Like mobile phone usage , Wi-Fi has undergone a rapid expansion and we feel there should be a proper scientific database on what the actual exposure levels are , so we can have a proper debate about it . "
Mr Parkin welcomed the investigation but said the HPA must also look into so - called " non-thermal effects " of the wireless signals .
Safety guidelines are set to ensure signals are too weak to heat up body tissues , but some researchers fear the waves may cause damage to cells in other ways .
" If they do n't do a thorough investigation , people will see it as a whitewash , " Mr Parkin said .
" What we want is a thorough investigation that can either confirm there is something to worry about , or completely assuage any fears people might have about Wi-Fi . "
Lawrie Challis , chairman of the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme ( MTHR ) , which is responsible for investigating the health effects of mobile phones , also welcomed the study .
" All the evidence is that the exposures are going to be very small , but nevertheless there have n't been enough measurements made , particularly in places like schools , and it 'll be reassuring to know that 's the case . "
A recent report from the MTHR found hints that using a mobile phone regularly for a decade or more may increase the risk of two forms of brain tumour .
" If the exposure from Wi -Fi turns out to be less than that from mobiles , then you would n't expect any health effects to be worse .
But first you need to look at what the exposures are , and then if there are surprises with Wi - Fi , you need to think what health studies need to be done . "
For many years before the Wright Brothers , people dreamed of flying with magic potions .
There was nothing irrational about the raw desire to fly .
There was nothing tainted about the wish to look down on a cloud from above .
Only the " magic potions " part was irrational .
Suppose you were to put me into an fMRI scanner , and take a movie of my brain 's activity levels , while I watched a space shuttle launch .
( Wanting to visit space is not " realistic " , but it is an essentially lawful dream — one that can be fulfilled in a lawful universe . )
The fMRI might — maybe , maybe not — resemble the fMRI of a devout Christian watching a nativity scene .
Should an experimenter obtain this result , there 's a lot of people out there , both Christians and some atheists , who would gloat : " Ha , ha , space travel is your religion ! "
But that 's drawing the wrong category boundary .
It 's like saying that , because some people once tried to fly by irrational means , no one should ever enjoy looking out of an airplane window on the clouds below .
If a rocket launch is what it takes to give me a feeling of aesthetic transcendence , I do not see this as a substitute for religion .
That is theomorphism — the viewpoint from gloating religionists who assume that everyone who is n't religious has a hole in their mind that wants filling .
Now , to be fair to the religionists , this is not just a gloating assumption .
There are atheists who have religion - shaped holes in their minds .
I have seen attempts to substitute atheism or even transhumanism for religion .
And the result is invariably awful .
Utterly awful .
Absolutely abjectly awful .
I call such efforts , " hymns to the nonexistence of God " .
When someone sets out to write an atheistic hymn — " Hail , oh unintelligent universe , " blah , blah , blah — the result will , without exception , suck .
Why ?
Because they 're being imitative .
Because they have no motivation for writing the hymn except a vague feeling that since churches have hymns , they ought to have one too .
And , on a purely artistic level , that puts them far beneath genuine religious art that is not an imitation of anything , but an original expression of emotion .
Religious hymns were ( often ) written by people who felt strongly and wrote honestly and put serious effort into the prosody and imagery of their work — that 's what gives their work the grace that it possesses , of artistic integrity .
So are atheists doomed to hymnlessness ?
There is an acid test of attempts at post - theism .
The acid test is : " If religion had never existed among the human species — if we had never made the original mistake — would this song , this art , this ritual , this way of thinking , still make sense ? "
If humanity had never made the original mistake , there would be no hymns to the nonexistence of God .
But there would still be marriages , so the notion of an atheistic marriage ceremony makes perfect sense — as long as you do n't suddenly launch into a lecture on how God does n't exist .
Because , in a world where religion never had existed , nobody would interrupt a wedding to talk about the implausibility of a distant hypothetical concept .
They 'd talk about love , children , commitment , honesty , devotion , but who the heck would mention God ?
And , in a human world where religion never had existed , there would still be people who got tears in their eyes watching a space shuttle launch .
Which is why , even if experiment shows that watching a shuttle launch makes " religion " - associated areas of my brain light up , associated with feelings of transcendence , I do not see that as a substitute for religion ; I expect the same brain areas would light up , for the same reason , if I lived in a world where religion had never been invented .
A good " atheistic hymn " is simply a song about anything worth singing about that does n't happen to be religious .
Also , reversed stupidity is not intelligence .
The world 's greatest idiot may say the Sun is shining , but that does n't make it dark out .
The point is not to create a life that resembles religion as little as possible in every surface aspect — this is the same kind of thinking that inspires hymns to the nonexistence of God .
If humanity had never made the original mistake , no one would be trying to avoid things that vaguely resembled religion .
Believe accurately , then feel accordingly :
If space launches actually exist , and watching a rocket rise makes you want to sing , then write the song , dammit .
If I get tears in my eyes at a space shuttle launch , it does n't mean I 'm trying to fill a hole left by religion — it means that my emotional energies , my caring , are bound into the real world .
If God did speak plainly , and answer prayers reliably , God would just become one more boringly real thing , no more worth believing in than the postman .
If God were real , it would destroy the inner uncertainty that brings forth outward fervor in compensation .
And if everyone else believed God were real , it would destroy the specialness of being one of the elect .
If you invest your emotional energy in space travel , you do n't have those vulnerabilities .
I can see the Space Shuttle rise without losing the awe .
Everyone else can believe that Space Shuttles are real , and it does n't make them any less special .
I have n't painted myself into the corner .
The choice between God and humanity is not just a choice of drugs .
Above all , humanity actually exists .
Even as the Fed battled in almost unprecedented fashion to stem a widening credit and housing slump , some Fed members fretted over the possibility of a " prolonged and severe " business downturn .
It was in that environment that they voted -- with two dissents -- to cut this important interest rate by three - quarters of a percentage point , to 2.25 percent .
That action capped the most aggressive Fed intervention in a quarter - century .
Some Fed policymakers thought that such a widening recession could not be ruled out given the further restriction of credit availability and " ongoing weakness in the housing market , " according to the meeting minutes that were made public Tuesday .
Two Fed 's members -- Charles Plosser , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , and Richard Fisher , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas - - opposed such a big rate reduction , however .
They favored a smaller cut because of concerns about a potential inflation flare - up .
It was a crack in the mostly unified front that the fed often has projected to the public .
The minutes of the closed - door March meeting underscored the economic cross-currents pulling at Fed policymakers .
" With the uncertainties in the outlook for both economic activity and inflation elevated , members noted that appropriately calibrating the stance of ( interest - rate ) policy was difficult , " the minutes stated .
On the one hand , the Fed has been urgently moving to prevent the trio of economic woes -- housing , credit and financial -- from plunging the country into a deep recession .

Cape Canaveral ’s Titan launch pad gantry was demolished on Sunday .
The tower was built in the 1990 ’s to support the US Air Force Titan 4 rocket program .
The site has been used for NASA missions as well , including the launch of the Cassini - Huygens Saturn mission in 1997 .
Launch Complex 40 is being demolished and then refurbished to make way for the new SpaceX Falcon rocket launch facility .
Now the gantry is rubble , the clean up operation can begin …
At 9 am on Sunday , April 27th , 200 pounds of high explosives brought the Complex 40 mobile service tower crashing down .
The tower was responsible for housing and preparing the highly successful Titan rockets for launch .
Mainly used for military payloads , the Titan 4 series also sent the NASA Cassini probe on its way to Saturn on October 15th , 1997 .
A Titan 4 rocket was also used to send the ill - fated Mars Observer mission to the Red Planet on September 25th , 1992 .
Mission controllers lost contact with Observer when it was three days away from orbital insertion .
The gantry weighed nearly 6500 tonnes and was installed with an advanced satellite processing clean room .
The tower supported a total of 17 launches , deploying sophisticated surveillance and communication satellites for the US government .
Two of these launches were devoted to the NASA interplanetary missions .
The last Titan 4 was launched three years ago , handing heavy launch duties over to the modern Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rocket systems .
In its glory days Titan 4 was the largest rocket available carrying the heaviest payloads into space .
View the complete series of images taken of the demolition of the Complex 40 tower »
Now that the tower has been removed , Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) can begin to set up the commercial launch site as the East Coast base of operations for its Falcon 9 rocket system which is currently under development .
But why ca n’t the tower be renovated for SpaceX launches ?
The Falcon 9 rocket system will be assembled horizontally and rolled to the launch pad shortly before launch ; the gantry is therefore superfluous to the company ’s needs at Complex 40 .
However , not all the infrastructure of the site will be removed .
The launch pad ’s concrete deck and flame duct , water deluge system , electrical systems , lightning towers and instrumentation in the bay under the pad will be reused .
The existing office space will also be renovated for SpaceX use .
Since last October , SpaceX employees have been working at the site , removing any equipment not compatible with the Falcon system .
The site will be up and running in time to begin supplying the International Space Station when NASA ’s Space Shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 .
Complex 40 will live on , minus gantry , for NASA contracted launches and other commercial satellite orbital insertions by SpaceX .

If you spend any time on Pinterest or Instagram food searches , and who that hangs out here does not , I bet at least once in the last couple years , your Explore tab led you to the photogenic , decadent world of chocoflans .
If not , let this post fix your suggestions right now .
Chocoflans , sometimes called impossible flan ( pastel imposible ) , are one part flan ( a sweetened egg custard with caramel or dulce de leche ) and one part plush chocolate cake .
They ’re considered a bit magical , not only because they combine two of the most wonderful desserts in the world , but because of what happens in the oven .
Even though it goes into the oven with the cake batter in first and the flan in second , as it bakes , the batters flip .
Once you invert it out of the baking pan , you end up with the flan on top and the cake underneath .
I ’ve read that this is because the cake , as it rises in the oven , becomes lighter than the flan layer , so the flan sinks and I , a non-scientist , based on little more than liking the sound of it , have concluded that it makes total sense .

Obama Campaign Rep Can't Name Accomplishments
Last night , Obama supporter Texas State Senator Kirk Watson was asked to name Obama 's legislative accomplishments .
He failed to name a single one .
You never know how far you can go until you ’ve left everything behind .
And as Eric Drew waited alone in the cold rain on a dock of the Seattle waterfront , he had come to the bitter edge .
Icy water lapped against the planks as he leaned on a cane , barely able to stand .
Though only 36 years old , this former high school quarterback and magazine model now resembled a war victim .
His once - dark , wavy hair was completely gone , his blue eyes were sunken .
On his back he carried a small sack filled with plastic bags of antibiotics , antivirals , and antifungals .
A hose ran from the bag straight through a catheter in his chest .
If he caught even the slightest cold , he could be dead .
It was February 2004 , and Drew was dying of acute lymphoblastic leukemia , a savage cancer of the blood and bone marrow .
In a healthy person bone marrow acts as a sort of factory of stem cells , the vital cells that mature and divide to form other essential blood cells throughout the body .
The leukemia , however , was making Drew ’s factory go haywire .
Instead of producing healthy lymphocytes , white blood cells that fight infections , his bone marrow was unleashing abnormal lymphocytes into his bloodstream .
Even worse , the bad cells were multiplying so rapidly that they were overtaking his healthy cells — making him harrowingly prone to deadly infections .
Chemotherapy and radiation had completely compromised his kidneys and destroyed his immune system , requiring a constant infusion of potassium , magnesium , vancomycin , Cipro , and other medications to help keep him alive .
He had spent the past year in and out of hospitals from Stanford to Seattle .
He had endured seizures and infections and got so bloated with fluids that his limbs blew up like some hideous cartoon .
Most recently , he had undergone a bone marrow transplant that , he was told , was his final hope .
But his illness was not what brought him to the water­front that night .
As he lay in his hospital bed , Drew had been getting harassing phone calls from irate banks and credit card companies demanding payment for purchases he had never made .
Taking him for dead , someone had stolen his identity , he discovered , and was racking up thousands of dollars in bills .
Now , after getting a tip - off , he had come to the docks to meet an anonymous informant who claimed to have the skinny on the thief .
While Drew ’s family and doctors pleaded with him to rest , Drew could n’t let it go .
As he had learned , there was only one way to save himself .
He had to fight .
When you ’re on your way to do good , you do n’t think everything will turn bad .
As Drew drove to the American Red Cross to donate blood on December 3 , 2002 , in San Jose , California , he had every reason to feel on top of the world .
Drew was living a charmed life .
He had been a director of business development for a software company .
He had a gorgeous girlfriend , a 21 - year - old college student named Nicole Floor .
He had just been approved for a million - dollar loan on a beautiful house in his lifelong hometown of Los Gatos , a hilly community near San Jose .
Gregarious and popular , Drew had tended bar at the hottest club while in college at San Diego State University .
For a while he had topped all his friends ’ buddy lists by managing a chain of go - go clubs .
Since hitting his thirties , however , he had begun taking steps to find more meaning in his life .
Adopted as an infant , he had recently been seeking out his birth family and had connected with his half siblings across the country .
To give back to his community , he had been donating blood once a month .
As he arrived at the Red Cross this Tuesday , however , Drew was n’t feeling as healthy as normal .
He had been unusually fatigued for the past couple of months .
“ Gosh , Eric , ” the nurse said , “ you look kind of pale .
Your red cell count , which is usually 45 to 50 , is down to 30 .
That ’s borderline anemic .
It does n’t look alarming , but you should go see a doctor . ”
Drew took her advice but did n’t think much of it until his receptionist buzzed him a few days later .
“ The doctor ’s trying to get hold of you , ” she said .
“ He says your blood test is back . ”
Why the urgency ?
Drew wondered as he dialed his doctor .
“ There ’s something concerning me here , ” the doctor explained , “ and I need you to see a blood specialist on Monday . ”
What particularly troubled Drew was the fact that his doctor had hustled an appointment for him during the hematologist ’s lunch break .
As Drew pulled into the parking lot for his appointment , his stomach twisted .
The sign at the San Jose Medical Center read “ Cancer Center . ”
As the doctor walked in , Drew nearly leaped from his seat .
“ Doc , ” he said , “ what ’s going on ? ”
“ It ’s too early to tell , ” the doctor said .
“ You traveled to Africa recently , right ? ”
Drew nodded .
“ It could be the late onset of malaria .
Let ’s test the bone marrow and find out . ”
Drew could not sleep for the two days it took to get the results .
He drove back to the cancer center with his mother , Cindy , for emotional support .
This time when the doctor came into the examination room , he was crying .
“ This is the hardest part of my job , ” he said as he put his hand on Drew ’s knee and told him he had cancer .
“ Your bone marrow is 100 percent cancerous .
I do n’t know how you ’re standing up .
You need to go to the Stanford Cancer Center .
If you do n’t check in tomorrow , you wo n’t live five days . ”
“ I have some very bad news . ”
Drew could hardly believe the words appearing on his computer screen as he typed .
After seeing the doctor , he had gone home to Los Gatos and begun e-mailing his friends and family .
“ I have been diagnosed with a very severe , rare , and deadly form of leukemia , which generally kills within a few weeks , ” he wrote .
“ The odds are not good for me to survive .... ”
As his cursor blinked , there was no way he could describe the depth of sadness he felt .
He was a young guy moving ahead in every aspect of his life , and then the carpet got ripped out from under him .
He felt as if his entire identity was being stripped away .
For Drew , a type A quarterback , the situation was flat - out unacceptable .
He made Nicole a promise when she came to visit him that night .
“ I ’m going to beat this , ” he said .
Drew had overcome adversity his whole life .
Born out of wedlock during a Texas hurricane , he was put up for adoption at birth .
As a kid in Los Gatos , he fended for himself , hunting rattlesnakes and quail for fun and food .
He drew inspiration from his high school football coach , Charlie Wedemeyer , who was paralyzed from Lou Gehrig ’s disease and bound to a wheelchair and respirator .
Wedemeyer never gave up .
Before every game , Drew and his teammates would say , “ Let ’s do this for Charlie . ”
As his cancer treatment began on December 16 , Drew brought that same conviction with him .
“ You ’re the Stanford Cancer Center , ” he told his doctors .
“ I trust you .
Hit me with what you got .
Do n’t worry , I wo n’t let this kill me . ”
But he quickly learned how difficult the experience would be .
Drew possessed the Philadelphia chromosome , a mutation that would make his cancer even more difficult to fight .
Fearing that his veins would collapse , the doctors injected the chemotherapy cocktail directly into his spine and heart .
The experience was brutal .
Drew felt as if his skin was burning and his head was going to explode .
The cancer , meanwhile , was already ravaging his body .
Drew was not just fighting a disease , he was fighting a system .
He had to be his own advocate .
Just before his treatment , he heard from his half sister , Alexa Gregory Martin , who worked as a physician ’s assistant in Seattle , that his radiation would almost certainly leave him sterile .
Yet no doctor had suggested that he bank his sperm .
Against their advice , he delayed his treatment while he banked sperm .
He was convinced that one day he would see the birth of his own kids .
As the illness and treatment progressed and winter turned to spring , Drew would have precipitous highs and lows .
One night Nicole ’s phone rang , and it was Drew , sounding in good spirits .
“ Do you want to drive up ? ” he said .
“ Let ’s watch a movie . ”
Nicole slipped into her pajamas and grabbed her overnight bag .
Maybe this would n’t have to end , she thought ; maybe they would go back to normal after all .
When she arrived at the Stanford medical center an hour later , however , her dreams were quickly dashed .
Sirens were going off in the hallway , and an urgent voice came over the intercom : “ Code blue 39A ! ” Wait , Nicole thought , that ’s Eric ’s room .
Nicole walked in to a nightmare .
Drew was surrounded by a half dozen hospital workers .
They were giving him chest compressions .
His body was shaking uncontrollably .
Nicole was in shock , unable to speak or cry or move .
“ You have to leave , ” one of the workers told her .
A bad reaction to an antifungal drug had caused his heart rate to fall abruptly , but they were able to stabilize him .
The experience , and the thought of weeks of harrowing treatments to follow , took their toll .
When Nicole went into the ICU later that night to see Drew , he was crying .

“ I just do n’t want you to go through this , ” he said .
“ You have everything going for you .
You do n’t have to be in this situation .
I want you to know you can leave whenever you want . ”
“ I can ’t , ” Nicole replied .
“ I ’m too invested in this .
No matter what , I ’ll be here .
I ’ll support you . ”
Though the chemo and radiation had prolonged his life , by the summer of 2003 Drew knew the treatments alone were not going to save him .
For that , he needed a bone marrow transplant .
Bone marrow contains immature stem cells that can grow into three types of cells : red blood cells , to transport oxygen ; white blood cells , for fighting infections ; and platelets , to facilitate clotting when needed .
In a transplant , healthy stem cells are harvested from a donor and infused intravenously into the recipient .
The healthy new cells then find their way to the bone marrow , where , if all goes well , they engraft and provide a new immune system .
For Drew ’s specific disease , the typical long - term survival rate for a transplant ranges from 40 percent to 70 percent — but for someone who is Philadelphia positive , as Drew was , the survival rate is lower , 10 percent to 50 percent .
Success depends on how well the donor ’s and recipient ’s chromosomes match ; the better the match , the greater the odds of survival .
According to the National Marrow Donor Program , depending on race , between 60 percent and 87 percent of potential recipients find at least one match , and a total of more than 260 patients receive transplants every month .
Finding a match , however , would be an uphill battle for Drew .
The optimal match — a full sibling — was not an option for him , since he had none .
And a unique protein in his blood narrowed the pool even more .
He needed all the help he could get .
Drawing on his years of entrepreneurial skills and quarterback leadership , Drew spent the summer organizing a bone marrow drive .
He sent e-mails around the world to everyone he knew and began getting checks from as far away as South Korea .
Friends were organizing prayer chains from Jerusalem to Africa .
Drew , though not holistically minded in the past , went full steam :
He started doing yoga and taking megadose multivitamins .
He went into the woods with a Mongolian shaman who burned a goat carcass on his behalf .
Drew even took to the street , sitting on a busy corner in a chair and handing out flyers .
He soon had 1,000 volunteers working to help him and had raised an astonishing $ 250,000 , which he used to start the Eric Drew Foundation to help others .
The emotional support was not just incredible , he felt , but lifesaving , a lesson for anyone fighting a disease .
Do n’t just lie back , he wanted to tell people .
Get out there and do something , whatever you can .
One day , after all his hard work , he was with a band of volunteers when he saw that he had a telephone message from the bone marrow search coordinator at Stanford .
Drew gathered everyone around to hear what he was sure was good news .
“ Hi , Mr. Drew , ” the message said .
“ I just wanted to confirm that we have exhausted our search capability and there ’s nothing else we can do .
I ’ll have a hospice nurse call you .
Sorry , and good luck . ”
How do you say good - bye to your life , to the people and things that form your identity ?
It was an impossible question that Drew had to answer as he sat in his apartment boxing his possessions away in September 2003 .
Good - bye books .
Good - bye college photos .
Good - bye friends .
In a sad twist of fate , he also had to say good - bye to Sammy , his chocolate - brown Chesapeake Bay retriever , who had to be put to sleep after being diagnosed with cancer .
With no bone marrow donor found , Drew ’s odds of recovery had plummeted from slim to the cusp of none .
Most people would have just taken Stanford ’s advice at that point , contacted a hospice , and called it a day .
But Drew was not ready to die yet .
As fate would have it , his half sister , Alexa , had been working at the transplant center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , and she told him about another option : an experimental procedure known as haploidentical transplantation .
The procedure involved taking someone with only half the matching chromosomes and using him as a donor .
To prepare for the transplant , Drew would have to undergo more debilitating chemo , and even then the odds were frightening — the chance of engraftment is lower , and there ’s more risk of dying from complications .
But it was a chance he was willing to take .
And another of his half siblings , an importer in Chicago named Michael Gicewicz , volunteered to be the bone marrow donor .
Drew resumed chemo treatments , slipping in and out of consciousness .
One day he woke up to find his entire body had begun shaking uncontrollably , and he could not move .
Drew came out of the episode to find his mother at his side .
“ I ca n’t do this anymore , ” he told her , crying .
It was too much , too painful .
But with the transplant just a couple of weeks away , she urged him to hang on .
Two days before the transplant , the hospital called Drew to tell him that his half brother , Michael , had mononucleosis and that it would be months before he could be up to the surgery required for his donation .
Devastated , Drew dialed Alexa to tell her the news .
She did n’t skip a beat .
“ I ’ll be your donor , Eric , ” she said .
Two days before Christmas , Drew received Alexa ’s stem cells through a catheter in his chest .
It would be three months before he would know if the stem cells had grafted , and he knew the odds were low .
But he had no idea how low he could get .
During his treatment in Seattle , he began getting strange calls from credit card companies thanking him for his application .
Drew shrugged it off as best he could until the collection agents started arriving at his door .
There were a half dozen accounts opened in his name , with almost $ 10,000 in charges .
“ Please stop this ! ”
Drew told one of the banks on the phone .
“ I ’m in a hospital dying ! ”
But there was no stopping this thief .
Here Drew was , on the verge of death , and someone was stripping away his last shred of humanity .
He felt that his identity was being taken on every level .
The disease was robbing him of his life .
Some criminal was stealing his identity .
And the medical system had swiped his individuality .
He was n’t even Eric Drew anymore ; at the hospital , they just called him Patient Room 232 .
Late one January night , as snow came down outside his window , Drew ’s anger boiled over .
He began throwing things , breaking glasses until he was exhausted .
There was no more energy left .
He was sick of being angry , sick of blaming the system and the hospital workers and anyone else in his line of sight .
I can point fingers everywhere , he thought , but where will it get me ?
To my grave .
This is not how I ’ll go .
I wo n’t be a victim anymore .
I ’m going to fight back .
During his treatment in Seattle , he began getting strange calls from credit card companies thanking him for his application .
Drew shrugged it off as best he could until the collection agents started arriving at his door .
Having worked in banking , Drew knew how to take action .
He ordered up a credit report and found the address where his imposter was receiving his mail .
Against his loved ones ’ wishes and his doctor ’s orders , Drew had his mom drive him to the address , in a poor part of town .
Weak from chemo , he pounded on the front door , not even knowing what he ’d do if someone answered .
No one did .
Drew had the mail rerouted to his own address and , with the bills in hand , uncovered the trail of the identity thief ’s purchases .
Drawing on his marketing skills , Drew sought the help of a local TV news station , which broadcast his story on the air .
They filmed Drew in a wheelchair outside his hospital , pleading for information .
Sure enough , the calls came in — many of them from crackpots .
Still , Drew had to follow each lead .
One of them was from an anonymous tipster who claimed to have photos of the person who fit the profile .
When Drew told his family he was going to meet this character on the Seattle docks , they thought he was crazy .
But as much as Nicole feared for his well - being , she could see that , in a strange way , the identity theft was bringing Drew back to life .
She saw a glimpse of the old Eric , the one who was n’t sick , the proactive go - getter who would n’t take no for an answer .
“ OK , ” Nicole told him , “ but if you do n’t call me in an hour , I ’m going to call the police . ”
The tipster , it turned out , was a dead end — just a well - meaning citizen with the wrong information .
Drew was ready to pack it in when the local TV station contacted a Lowe ’s store , spurring the retailer to check its surveillance videos .
With the help of Drew ’s records , they pinpointed a purchase to a specific time and date , and the TV station put the grainy footage on the news for everyone in town to see .
As Drew lay in bed watching the video , he could n’t believe his eyes .
There was the fake Eric Drew , a middle - aged African American man in hospital scrubs .
His name was Richard Gibson , a lab technician at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance who had tested Drew ’s blood .
Drew was indignant .
This guy had taken him for dead and took him to the cleaners .
He was told by attorneys that he could have sued the hospital for millions , but now he just wanted justice .
Four days later he got it .
On March 2 , 2004 , Gibson turned himself in and became the first person in the country to be convicted for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , which protects patient privacy .
Gibson was later sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to pay more than $ 9,000 in restitution .
Drew had fought to get back his good name and won .
Now he was ready to reclaim his life .
Drew did not have long to celebrate his victory over Gibson .
By the end of March , the necessary three months had passed since his bone marrow transplant — and it was time to get the results .
It was n’t good news .
Alexa ’s stem cells , Drew learned , had failed to fully engraft .
“ There ’s nothing else we can do , ” his doctors told him .
“ We can arrange for hospice care . ”
By now , Drew was numb — how much more could his emotions be stretched ?
Despite the grim prognosis , the Hutchinson center offered to do a second transplant using his half brother Michael ’s bone marrow .
He was planning to do it , but the strain was making itself felt .
He took a trip to California to reconnect with Nicole , who had just graduated from college .
As he sat with her in her apartment in Chico , she teased him .
“ You have n’t given me a graduation present , ” she said .
“ OK , ” he said , reaching into his pocket .
“ Here it is . ”
He handed her an engagement ring .
Nicole was surprised , and afraid — afraid to take it seriously , because that would mean she had opened her heart and soul to him .
She had been through the death of her mother from cancer and could n’t bear to lose someone again .
She loved him ; she just did n’t want him taken from her .
When she said yes to his proposal , she did it as much to give him hope .
She had also given him something else : a lead on a cure .
A year earlier , after some sleuthing on ClinicalTrials.gov , the government site that keeps tabs on experimental cancer treatments , Nicole had stumbled on an article about an alternative source of stem cells : umbilical cord blood .
Initially they had written this treatment off and chosen to move ahead with the marrow transplant .
But now they were willing to take a second look and sought out the advice of a specialist , Tibor Kovacsovics , an associate professor of medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute .
Because of the political controversies over embryonic stem cells , information about cord blood stem cells had been unclear .
But this was a noncontroversial source , Drew learned .
Donations came from around the world , either from people giving cord blood to public banks or through private services that bank families ’ blood .
Since the mid-1990s , facilities such as the University of Minnesota ’s had been performing cord blood transplants because of an implicit benefit .
“ Umbilical cord blood contains an enriched population of bone marrow stem cells , ” says Daniel Weisdorf , director of the Adult Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the university .
“ There are large numbers of bone marrow–like stem cells with huge growth potential . ”
But there was a hitch .
Researchers found that the tiny amount of stem cells harvested from one cord blood source was not enough to serve a full - grown adult .
So beginning in 2000 , the University of Minnesota began a new approach : using stem cells from two umbilical cord blood sources , which increased the chances of engraftment in adults to 90 percent .
Drew ’s doctors in Seattle had nothing to say when he asked them about the procedure ; it was n’t something they performed .
Drew was incensed that he would not have even known about this option if Nicole had not gone online , but by now he understood that the fight for survival begins and ends with the patient .
So he called Minnesota and made the plan .
There would be risks , of course .
Once again Drew ’s immune system would have to be eradicated — this time with six times the radiation and more chemo .
There was a 50 percent chance that he would n’t survive that alone .
In all , his odds of survival were about 25 percent , but this was his last hope .
Drew took Nicole on the long drive to the University of Minnesota and checked into the hospital .
He had a treadmill brought into his room and walked on it for a few days .
But his strength did n’t last long .
Doctors began wiping out his immune system again with a blast of 1,320 centigrays of gamma radiation 20 minutes twice a day for four days .
On July 23 , 2004 , Drew was infused with the stem cells from two sources — a newborn girl in Italy and a baby in Ohio .
Hopefully , one would take .
But that was just the beginning .
Between the cumulative effects of the radiation and chemo and his body ’s reaction to the new stem cells , the physical effects were gruesome .
His skin began peeling off like strips of bacon .
His body was on fire .
His temperature hit 106.8 at one point , and he had to be packed in ice .
Blood was coming out of his eyes and ears .
Inside his body , his intestinal lining was falling apart .
He had severe diarrhea filled with blood .
“ It ’s OK , you can die , ” said Drew 's mother .
“ No , I ’m not ready , ” he said .
“ I ’m going to keep fighting . ”
To survive , Drew demanded near - lethal doses of morphine .
And he called on every reserve he had — yoga , controlled breathing .
When he did n’t have the strength to walk on his treadmill , they came to take it away , but he refused to let them .
“ No , ” he said , “ I ’ll get back on it . ”
Drew focused on his dreams of being healthy and alive .
Before long his sense of reality began to shift , so that he felt more in touch with his sleeping state than with being awake .
He slipped into psychoses and hallucinations .
A few times , he ripped the cords from his body and tried to escape the hospital .
When he looked up at the caretakers around his bed , they appeared to him as angels .
At one point his mom , Cindy , could n’t take seeing him in so much pain .
She wanted him to know that he did n’t have to do this for her or for anyone else .
“ If you ’re hanging on for me or my husband or whomever , it ’s OK , ” she said , “ but you do n’t have to do this for us . ”
And , painfully , she added , “ It ’s OK , you can die . ”
Drew took her hand .
“ No , I ’m not ready , ” he said .
“ I ’m going to keep fighting . ”
But all he could really do was wait to see whether the stem cells would take hold .
By November 2004 , although his condition was still critical , Drew decided to go home for Thanksgiving .
Six months later he went for a bone marrow biopsy from his hematologist .
This was the moment of truth .
When the call came with the results , he could barely hold on to the phone .
He was in his parents ’ house with Nicole .
“ Just to let you know , ” the doctor said , “ you ’re 100 percent in remission . ”
The engraftment had worked .
A wave of relief washed over Drew as he hugged his family .
There was more , the doctor said .
Drew was n’t just a new man .
“ Your blood is 100 percent female , ” he said .
Eric Drew , now a 37 - year - old man , had the blood of an Italian girl .
It was like something out of a Tom Clancy thriller .
If he cut his finger while committing a crime , investigators would think that the criminal was a girl .
Drew had fought for his life and won .
Like millions of people every year , he had had numerous reasons along the way to give up — but he refused .
In retrospect , his mother thinks the experience of the identity theft may have saved her son .
“ He would thank Richard Gibson for taking his identity , ” she says .
“ It gave him something to fight for and reenergized him after that . ”
Alexa also credits Drew ’s tenacity for his recovery .
“ He ’s a pain in the ass sometimes , ” she says , “ but I think his personality probably saved his life . ”
In 2006 , Drew cleared his credit that had been damaged by the identity theft and reached another key turning point , too : two years without a recurrence of his leukemia , a milestone , the doctors say , because the chances of recurrence drop radically after 24 months .
Today Drew walks with crutches ( he is mostly in a wheelchair ) and has joint pain related to his transplant .
But he is carrying on with his life .
He travels the country speaking about the benefits of cord blood transplants .
He filed a lawsuit in December 2006 against the credit reporting agencies and several credit card companies , which resulted in a recent settlement with one agency that included concessions making it easier for patients to fight identity theft while they are hospitalized .
He is also planning his wedding with Nicole , which will take place on the shores of Lake Tahoe this August .
“ It ’s a fairy - tale ending that started out as a nightmare , ” Nicole says .
And , ultimately , Drew hopes , it ’s a lesson that anyone who faces a life - threatening challenge can take to heart .
“ It ’s about personal accountability and taking responsibility , ” he says .
“ We are not victims .
We ’re not being blown around like dust in the wind .
We have control over our destiny . ”
BASRA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - U.S. forces were drawn deeper into Iraq ’s four - day - old crackdown on Shi’ite militants on Friday , launching air strikes in Basra for the first time and battling militants in Baghdad in heavy clashes .
The fighting has exposed a rift within the majority Shi’ite community and put pressure on Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , whose forces have failed to drive fighters loyal to cleric Moqtada al - Sadr off the streets .
Authorities shut down Baghdad with a strict curfew , but that did not halt rocket attacks and clashes in the capital .
U.S. helicopters repeatedly fired into Baghdad ’s Sadr City slum and other Shi’ite areas where fighters are holed up .
“ There have been engagements going on in and around Sadr City .
We ’ve engaged the enemy with artillery , we ’ve engaged the enemy with aircraft , we ’ve engaged the enemy with direct fire , ” said Major Mark Cheadle , a spokesman for U.S. forces in Baghdad .
In Iraq ’s second - biggest city Basra where he launched the crackdown on Tuesday , Maliki extended a 72 hours deadline he had given militants to surrender , saying they had until April 8 to turn in their weapons for cash .
But Sadr ’s Mehdi Army fighters remained defiant .
“ We will fight on and never give up our weapons , ” Mehdi Army deputy military commander in Basra Abu Hassan al - Daraji told Reuters by telephone .
“ We will not turn over a single bullet . ”
Defense Minister Abdel Qader Jassim said his forces in Basra had been caught off - guard by their foes .
“ We supposed that this operation would be a normal operation , but we were surprised by this resistance and have been obliged to change our plans and our tactics , ” he told a news conference in Basra .
In a sign of the worsening situation , reporters were brought to the briefing in military vehicles and kept inside for hours afterwards as fighting raged nearby .
Parliament called an emergency meeting , but just 54 members of the 275 - seat body attended the session inside the fortified “ Green Zone ” government and diplomatic compound , which was bombarded by rockets as they gathered .
One missile hit the Green Zone office of Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi , killing a security guard .
The U.S. embassy ordered staff in the zone to stay under cover where possible and wear body armor and helmets when in the open .
The government says it is fighting “ outlaws ” , but Sadr ’s followers say political parties in Maliki ’s Shi’ite - led government are using military force to marginalize their rivals ahead of local elections due by October .
GUNMEN HOLD STREETS
Reuters television footage from Basra showed masked gunmen from Sadr ’s Mehdi Army still in control of the streets , openly carrying rocket launchers and machine guns .
The Iraqi ground commander in Basra , Major - General Ali Zaidan , told Reuters his forces had killed 120 “ enemy ” fighters and wounded around 450 since the campaign began on Tuesday .
A British military spokesman said U.S. warplanes opened fire in Basra for the first time , dropping bombs under guidance of U.S. or British controllers operating with Iraqis on the ground .

British ground troops who patrolled Basra until December have so far remained on a base outside the city .
The fighting has trapped Basra residents in their homes , raising fears of a humanitarian crisis .
The United Nations said it was standing by with blood bags , trauma kits , 200 metric tons of emergency food and 39 million water purification tablets .
The clashes have all but wrecked a truce Sadr declared last year , which Washington had said helped curb violence .
Sadr , who helped install Maliki in power after an election in 2005 but later broke with him , has called for talks .
But Maliki has vowed to battle on with no negotiations .

President Jalal Talabani called for a summit of political party leaders to resolve the standoff .
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , in Damascus to attend an Arab summit , said : “ It was a long overdue confrontation in my view and the government has taken a decision to defeat them and it is irreversible . ”
U.S. President George W. Bush said the clashes were a sign that Maliki ’s government was willing to confront “ criminal elements or people who think they can live outside the law . ”
A Reuters witness said Mehdi Army gunmen had seized control of the southern city of Nassiriya .
A hospital source said 15 people had been killed and 50 wounded in clashes in the town .
Mehdi Army fighters have also held territory or fought with authorities in Kut , Hilla , Amara , Kerbala , Diwaniya and other towns throughout the Shi’ite south over the past several days .
In Baghdad there have been clashes in at least 13 mainly Shi’ite neighborhoods , especially Sadr City , the vast slum named for the cleric ’s slain father and his main power base .
Maliki ’s office said the prime minister had issued orders to his commanders to pursue fighters in the capital with “ no mercy ” , to hold no negotiations with “ criminal groups ” , and treat anyone who violates the curfew as an outlaw .
In one strike before dawn , a U.S. helicopter fired a hellfire missile at gunmen firing from the roof of a building , killing four of them , Cheadle said .
A Reuters photographer there filmed windows blown out of cars and walls pocked with shrapnel .
Later in the day cars were engulfed in flames after an apparent air strike on a Sadr City parking lot .
Police said another U.S. air strike in Kadhimiya , a Sadr stronghold in northern Baghdad , killed five people , and air strikes in Sadr City later in the afternoon killed 12 .
U.S. forces said they killed 27 fighters in the capital on Thursday and 13 more on Friday .
Over the last 7 years , the current administration has meddled with the affairs of the Environmental Protection Agency to such a degree , that the badgering and tampering is having a detrimental effect on the morale of agency staffers .
And the latest news that EPA officials have ceased their efforts to follow a Supreme Court order to propose regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from automobile tailpipes is , yet another , in a long list of examples where the Bush administration has overstepped its legal boundaries and asserted its political will in matters where it should n’t .
Even though EPA administrator Stephen L. Johnson agreed with the court ’s findings and proposed motor vehicle regulation to the Department of Transportation back in December , the agency has not evaluated dangers nor proposed any regulations – and is not expected to .
The Morale Problem
The recent cover story by Margaret Kriz the National Journal paints a rather dramatic picture of the downward spiraling morale at the EPA and the agency ’s decrease in overall effectiveness as a result .
Legal experts say that even more than under Bush ’s two previous administrators , Christine Todd Whitman and Mike Leavitt , Johnson ’s EPA is regularly pushed around by politically powerful advisers at the White House and in other departments .
The article states that agency morale is almost as bad as it was in the early 1980s after President Reagan appointed pro-industry Anne Gorsuch Burford to head it .
Georgetown Law Professor Danield Esty , said that the current administration has pulled the EPA
“ [ O ] ff to the extreme end of the right - wing perspective on the environment , reflecting not even a consensus within the Republican Party but the views of some who are particularly hostile to the agency ’s historic mission . ”
The Money Problem
At a time when the nation ’s top environmental regulators face increasingly complex pollution problems , President Bush is pushing for dramatic cuts in EPA ’s budget .
The White House ’s proposed fiscal 2009 budget would provide just $ 7.1 billion — fewer actual dollars than EPA has received in any fiscal year since 1997 .
Riding It Out
In the meantime , disgruntled EPA professionals are longing for the day when the next administration takes over their agency and they can go to work knowing that their science will receive the attention it deserves and the funding it requires .
A scathing editorial in Nature wrote that
“ In a rational world , Johnson would resign in favour of someone who could at least feign an interest in the environment .
Alas , it seems that he will probably stay on until January 2009 , refusing waivers , fighting lawsuits and further depressing employees ’ morale . ”

The CNCERT recently released an analysis report on China 's cyber security surveillance data in the first half of 2020 .
Acco ...
The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ( TRAC ) of Syracuse University has issued a new report , Audits of Largest Corporations Slide to All Time Low :
The FY 2007 audit rate for the nation 's largest corporations has plunged to its lowest level in the last 20 years , less than half what it was in FY 1988 ...
The historic collapse in audits for the corporations with $ 250 million or more in assets was especially notable during the last two years when the rate dropped from 43 % in FY 2005 , to 34 % in FY 2006 and then to an all - time low of 26 % in FY 2007 .
[ Click on chart to enlarge . ]
But along with the declining number of audits for the largest corporations , the IRS data point to a second significant finding : the thoroughness of these essential audits has been dropping .
One example of this broad problem can be seen by the fact that the typical amount of time auditors spend on each of the large corporate audits is down by 20 % over the last five years .
Senators plan ' embarrassing ' votes in efforts to derail candidates John Byrne

All three top contenders for America 's highest office are senators .
But that wo n't stop the Senate from trying to derail their colleagues ' chances .
According to an article in the paid - restricted Roll Call Monday , top senators in both parties plan to make efforts to derail the candidacy of either party by introducing " divisive " bills in an election year .
Democrats , still smarting from President Bush 's gambit to use Sen .
John Kerry ( D - MA ) 's vote on Iraq troop funding , plan countermeasures of their own in an effort to torpedo the candidacy of presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
" Senate Democrats are looking at holding votes related to the environment , health care or even the war that could force McCain to take politically toxic positions , miss key votes or reconcile previously held stands , " Roll Call 's Erin Billings writes Monday .
" Republican Senators also are hoping to do the same to the Democratic contenders , particularly on issues related to national security , taxes and spending , where they believe McCain has the upper hand against either Democratic rival . "
" And that s probably just the beginning , " she adds .
" Democrats think they can put McCain at odds with his own party on issues such as stem - cell research , global warming and perhaps even immigration in the months ahead .
They hope that on certain issues , they can force McCain to choose between aligning with conservatives or flexing his independent streak , both of which Democrats argue could be problematic for the GOP White House hopeful . "
Democrats have already tried to embarrass McCain by putting up a vote on waterboarding .
By putting a measure on the docket that would have banned the practice for intelligence collection , they successfully got McCain to vote against prohibiting a practice he had previously decried .
Some of the strategy already is in play .
Last month , for instance , Democrats accused McCain of flip - flopping his position on torture after the Arizona Republican voted against an intelligence authorizing measure they argued would have outlawed a practice known as waterboarding .
Democrats tried to make the charge that McCain had changed his stand on the issue since he previously had voiced his opposition to waterboarding .
 For someone who was a maverick , and wore that as a badge of honor , theres a lot of fertile ground there ,  a senior Senate Democratic aide told the paper .
 Hes going to have to reconcile his new self with his old self . 
Republicans , meanwhile , hope to paint Obama as a " tax and spender " by introducing controversial amendments .
While in the minority , Senate procedure allows the party more leeway for introducing measures than in the House .
According to one senior GOP aide , the Republican leadership hopes to drive a wedge between the Democratic nominee and members of his own party in the chamber .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. private security firm Blackwater ’s deal to protect American diplomats in Baghdad will be extended for a year while the FBI investigates a 2007 incident in which the company ’s guards are accused of killing 17 Iraqis , the State Department said on Friday .

“ I have requested and received approval to have task order six -- which Blackwater has to provide personal protective services in Baghdad -- renewed ... for one year , ” the head of diplomatic security , Gregory Starr , told reporters .
The September 2005 shooting incident in Baghdad enraged the Iraqi government and triggered an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation into what happened and whether any crimes might have been committed .
A measure issued by the U.S. - led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2004 prevents foreign security contractors from being prosecuted in local courts .
It is unclear whether they could be prosecuted under U.S. law .
After the incident , the State Department changed several elements of the contract , including tightening up rules of engagement , putting cameras on all convoys and having a diplomatic security officer ride along with the detail .
Starr said Blackwater was operating with the agreement of the Iraqi government and he did not know when the FBI ’s investigation of the incident would be completed .
Asked whether the Blackwater Baghdad deal could be scrapped if the FBI investigation found wrongdoing , Starr said : “ We can terminate contracts at the convenience of the government if we have to . ”
“ I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going to find in their investigation .
I think really , it is complex .
I think that the U.S. government needs protective services , ” he said .
“ Essentially I think they do a very good job .
The September 16th incident was a tragedy .
It has to be investigated carefully , ” he added .
“ I am concerned ( about the Iraqi response ) and yet at the same time there have only been about three incidents , three escalation of force incidents , since September 16 , ” he said .
Man arrested for running onto Heathrow runway
( Update : Authorities determine man 's backpack did n't contain explosives )
A man was arrested after running onto the runway at London 's busy Heathrow airport on Thursday , triggering a major security alert , police said .
" I can confirm that at approximately 2:05 p.m. ( 10:05 a.m. EDT ) a man was seen airside at Heathrow airport on the northern runway .
He 's been arrested by police and he 's currently in custody , " a police spokesman said .
He declined to say whether the incident was considered terrorism - related .
" A bag has been recovered and obviously it will be examined , " he said .
BBC television pictures showed several emergency cars with flashing lights parked on the airport runway .
A spokesman for airport operator BAA , owned by Spanish company Ferrovial , said he was aware of an incident and was checking details .
" A controlled explosion on the bag has reportedly been carried out , " Sky News reports .
" Sky correspondent Mark White said the security scare comes ahead of the opening of a new terminal at Heathrow . "
The controlled explosion revealed that the there were no explosives in the man 's bags , multiple news networks reported .
White added , " Security is tight , especially with what is happening tomorrow morning with the opening of Terminal 5 .
Her Majesty the Queen will be in attendance to open it and it will be a big day for BAA . "
" A man ran towards an Emirates flight , " a police spokeswoman told AFP , as television pictures showed police vehicles scrambling to deal with the situation .
" He has been removed .
We believe he was acting alone . "
BBC cited an eyewitness saying the man scaled the airport 's perimeter fence , ran onto the runway and was eventually surrounded by police and police dogs .
There was no immediate sign that the incident was terrorism related .
Britain has been under an increased security since the July 7 , 2005 suicide bombings which killed 52 people on the London underground .
It is the second major security breach at the airport in the space of three weeks .
On February 25 , four activists from environmental campaigners Greenpeace staged a protest on top of a parked jet against the planned construction of a new runway .
Thursday 's incident came a day before Queen Elizabeth II is due to open the new Terminal Five at Heathrow , designed to increase the airport 's capacity to some 100 million passengers a year .
Located to the west of London , Heathrow is one of the world 's biggest airports , handling over 68 million passengers a year .
Protesters have recently stepped up a campaign against a third runway at the airport , which they say will damage the environment and add to misery for local residents .

In their latest filings with the Federal Communications Commission , AT&T and
Comcast argue that new breakthroughs in " P4P " network
management lessen or eliminate the need for the agency to enact stronger net
neutrality rules .
Comcast 's statement , filed with the FCC on April 9th , hails
an announcement
by P2P developer Pando Networks that its experiments with P4P technology on a wide variety
of U.S. broadband networks have boosted delivery speeds by up to 235 percent .
This news , Comcast vice president Kathryn A. Zachem wrote to the Commission , " provides further proof that policymakers have been right to rely on marketplace forces , rather than government regulation , to govern the evolution of Internet services . "
Are P2P users " elitist " ?
P4P stands for Proactive network Provider Participation for P2P , a system of support for peer to peer protocols that allows tracking devices to communicate with network management systems about P2P flow .
The objective , as four University of Washington and Yale scholars recently concluded in a paper on P4P , is to encourage " a more effective cooperative traffic control between applications and network providers . "
In short , the technology helps file - sharers pick each other in ways that contribute to a more efficient network .
Ars spoke with Verizon senior technologist and Distributed Computing Industry Association 's ( DCIA ) P4P Working Group co-chair Doug Pasko in March , who reported 200 to 600 percent boosts in download speed in their experiments with Pando .
Pando's April 9 release says that since late February it has now performed experiments in broadband video delivery to over one million people via networks that include AT&T , Bell Canada , Cablevision , Comcast , Telefonica , Time Warner , and Verizon — all with positive results .
On April 7 , AT&T filed comments with the FCC's net neutrality docket that included the U. of Washington / Yale study and a PowerPoint presentation on network management .
Three top AT&T reps also met with legal advisers to Commissioners Deborah Taylor Tate , Jonathan Adelstein , and Michael Copps .
The presentation observes that broadband networks are inherently shared and that " P2P is not necessarily an efficient technology in its present form . "
In addition , the AT&T trio warned that an FCC policy of " strict nondiscrimination " would only serve " the interests of elitist users , " presumably P2P file sharers .
The presentation backs this claim with a chart that asserts that AT&T end - user bandwidth has been increasing by about 35 percent a year from 2001 through 2007 .
In addition : " heavy bandwidth applications such as streaming media ( Web & Multimedia ) and Peer - to - peer are driving approximately 80 percent of total bandwidth on AT&T's broadband network . "
The chart does not break down what percentage of that 80 percent can be attributed to P2P use .
P2P is upsetting
The AT&T presentation concludes that increased bandwidth wo n't help alleviate this problem , " because the need to managed shared networks does n't go away as bandwidth increases . "
The filing claims that in the end there 's no escaping the fact that certain P2P technologies have " upset network architecture assumptions — increasing the challenge and complexity of network management . "
AT&T 's solution ?
The telco points to the DCIA P4P group 's efforts as one solution .
In the meantime , " resolve disputes as to what constitutes a reasonable network management practice on a case - by - case basis . "
Pando's press release includes a comment by Comcast CTO Tony Werner praising " the applicability of P4P to cable ISP infrastructures . "
Comcast 's FCC comments promise a collaboration with Pando " to ensure that all of us can continue to deliver ever - improving services to consumers . "
AT&T and Comcast 's remarks also indicate that P4P technology has already become politicized as the FCC prepares for its second hearing on network management practices , scheduled to take place at Stanford University on April 17 .
The Commission has n't released a list of panelists yet , but it has disclosed the titles of the two panel discussions , one on " Network Management and Consumer Expectations , " the other on " Consumer Access to Emerging Internet Technologies and Applications . "
“ The 2008 - 2009 election marks the first presidential transition in the post - 9/11 era , and is of concern to many national security observers , ” a new report ( pdf ) from the Congressional Research Service says .
“ While changes in administration during U.S. involvement in national security related activities are not unique to the 2008 - 2009 election , many observers suggest that the current security climate and recent acts of terrorism by individuals wishing to influence national elections and change foreign policies portend a time of increased risk to the current presidential transition period . ”
“ This report discusses historical national - security related presidential transition activities , provides a representative sampling of national security issues the next administration may encounter , and offers considerations and options relevant to each of the five phases of the presidential transition period . ”
See “ 2008 - 2009 Presidential Transition : National Security Considerations and Options , ” April 21 , 2008 .
Meanwhile , “ A growing community of interest , including Members of Congress , senior officials in the executive branch , and think - tank analysts , is calling for a reexamination of how well the U.S. government , including both the executive branch and Congress , is organized to apply all instruments of national power to national security activities , ” according to another new CRS report ( pdf ) .
“ The organizations and procedures used today to formulate strategy , support presidential decision - making , plan and execute missions , and budget for those activities are based on a framework established just after World War II . ”
“ The ‘ outdated bureaucratic superstructure ’ of the 20th century is an inadequate basis for protecting the nation from 21st century security challenges , critics contend , and the system itself , or alternatively , some of its key components , requires revision . ”
The new CRS report is intended “ to help frame the emerging debates by taking note of the leading advocates for change , highlighting identified shortcomings in key elements of the current system , and describing categories of emerging proposals for change . ”

John J. Mack stood before his board and shareholders at Morgan Stanley ’s 2007 annual meeting and struck an aggressive tone .
Coming off a year of record profits fueled by using the firm ’s capital to take some highly lucrative risks  particularly by diving deeply into subprime mortgages , leveraged loans and complex derivatives 
Mr. Mack had much to celebrate .
“ Do we take a lot of risk ?
Yes , ” he said forcefully , in response to a shareholder who questioned him about Morgan Stanley ’s reliance on risky trades and increased debt to finance these positions .
“ I think this firm has the capacity to take a lot more risk than it has in the past . ”
Next month , at Morgan Stanley ’s annual meeting , Mr. Mack is unlikely to be so bold .
Having presided over close to $ 11 billion in write - offs and a wholesale revamping of Morgan Stanley ’s risk management process , Mr. Mack faces an investor community that is raising questions about his ability to continue leading Morgan Stanley as he has .
The CtW Investment Group , a shareholder activist group representing union - sponsored pension funds with about $ 1.4 trillion , is weighing a campaign aimed at persuading Morgan Stanley investors to withhold their vote for Mr. Mack as chairman .
The hope is to persuade Morgan Stanley ’s board to appoint an independent chairman .
An announcement of the effort could come as early as Wednesday .
__A.D. 105 : __The eunuch Tsai Lun shows his " invention " of paper to the Han emperor of China .
Recent archaeological evidence shows that people in northwestern China were making paper in the two centuries before its formal introduction at court .
But Tsai ( or Cai ) is notable for refining the process , experimenting with new materials and founding the Chinese paper industry .
The first Chinese paper was apparently made from a mash of sodden hemp waste , beaten to a pulp and stretched over a cloth sieve in a bamboo frame .
Tsai made his pulp from bamboo fibers and the inner bark of the mulberry tree .
He also worked with bark from other trees , as well as scraps of hemp , linen rags and even fishnets .
The emperor , Ho Ti ( or He Di ) , promoted Tsai , who became wealthy .
But the inventor of paper ( on paper , at least ) eventually got involved in palace intrigue and ended his life by drinking poison .
Chinese emperors made paper a tool for imperial administration and the diffusion of knowledge .
It was a lighter alternative to heavy pages made of bamboo , and far less expensive than pages made from silk .
Further Chinese advances in papermaking included a quick - release mold to improve the speed of production , the use of starch as sizing ( filler or glaze ) and a combination yellow dye and insect repellent .
Papermaking was a secret process until it spread to Korea in the sixth century , thence to Japan in the seventh .
The technology spread to Tibet and Central Asia .
Then Arabs captured some Chinese papermakers in 751 , and the formerly secret process reached the Middle East .
Arab scholars preferred linen paper to the sheepskin or calfskin parchment that was then in use .
Paper continued its westward spread , and the first paper mill in Europe was built in 1150 .

Another record low for Bay Area home sales Sales slump : Foreclosures push median prices down as transactions hit new low
- - Photo : Courtesy Richard Lee Photo : Courtesy Richard Lee Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Another record low for Bay Area home sales 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
A flood of foreclosure sales dampened the housing market in March , the traditional start of the spring selling season , and Bay Area home sales clocked another record low , according to a real estate report released Thursday .
One - quarter of all homes sold in the nine - county area last month were foreclosures .
Banks typically sell such homes at a discount , which further depresses prices , particularly in the immediate neighborhoods .
" It 's the weakest kickoff to the spring home - buying season that we 've seen in 20 years , " said Andrew LePage , an analyst with DataQuick Information Systems , a real estate information service in La Jolla ( San Diego County ) .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
A total of 3,226 existing homes changed hands in the region in March , down 40.6 percent from 5,429 in the same month last year , DataQuick said .
The median price for resale homes tumbled 20.4 percent to $ 549,000 from $ 690,000 a year ago .
DataQuick said this was the slowest March in the Bay Area since it began tracking statistics in 1988 , and the seventh consecutive month of record lows .
The more foreclosures that sold in a county , the faster its prices plummeted .
For instance , 44.7 percent of the March sales in Contra Costa County were foreclosures and the median price there fell by about a third to $ 409,000 from $ 614,500 a year ago , according to DataQuick .
" Typically , foreclosure resales tend to sell for about 15 percent less than everything else , " LePage said .
" Houses in areas dominated by foreclosure resales seemed to suffer a penalty of 5 to 10 percent on price . "
Bargains for buyers
Richard Lee , a Realtor with Windermere Select Properties in Dublin , told the story of one listing that exemplifies how home values are spiraling down .
On Aug. 15 , he placed a San Leandro two - bedroom , one - bathroom home on the market .
Initially he listed it at $ 499,950 , which he said was exactly in line with what comparable homes in the neighborhood had sold for in midsummer .
But the house did not draw any offers .
As the weeks and months have gone by , he has continued to drop the price .
The home received some offers around $ 300,000 but because it was a short sale ( selling for less than is owed on the mortgage ) , the bank had the final say and it did not accept those offers .
As of Tuesday , the price was down to $ 229,950 , more than a 50 percent reduction .
But there is a silver lining to the tumbling values :
More people can afford a home in the Bay Area .
Gabrielle and Brad Bussey , who work in band booking and landscape maintenance , respectively , never thought they could afford the area 's steep prices .
But last month the couple bought a bank - owned foreclosed home in Oakland 's Melrose Heights neighborhood for 39 percent less than its previous sale price .
The former owners paid $ 557,000 for the three - bedroom in June 2005 , according to Dave Lawrence , a real estate broker in Fremont who represented the Busseys .
After foreclosure , the bank put it on the market in September for $ 456,000 and then dropped the price several times , finally hitting $ 339,000 - which is what the couple paid .
" We got married in 2005 , and it was time to buy a house , " Gabrielle Bussey said .
" At that point the median price was around $ 500,000 and definitely above what we could afford .
A few months later it went to $ 600,000 and then ( soon ) I read that it was $ 700,000 .
I thought , this is grotesque , I resent it , I would n't pay that much money even if I could afford it . "
As has consistently been the case , several counties - notably those close to job centers and in affluent areas - were in better shape than hard - hit places such as Contra Costa and Solano counties .
In San Francisco , the median resale price inched up 0.4 percent to $ 826,000 - the only county where the median grew .
Not coincidentally , San Francisco also had the lowest percentage of foreclosed homes sold , with only 2.4 percent of homes sold in March having gone through foreclosure .
Despite the increase of foreclosure sales , plenty more are waiting in the wings .
LePage said three - quarters of the homes that went through a foreclosure in Contra Costa and Solano counties in 2007 have not yet been sold .
" That keeps your inventory pretty heavy , and those are very motivated sellers , " he said .
Most experts predict that even more homes will go through foreclosure in 2008 .
Priced to move
Dori Anderson , a Realtor with Cypress Lakes Realty in the Contra Costa County community of Bethel Island , specializes in foreclosures .
She has 76 such properties now on the market and another 190 that will be listed soon .
Anderson said lenders have begun discounting even more heavily in recent months .
" Banks are getting more realistic and ... pricing to move , " she said .
Getting a mortgage remains a big stumbling block to the market recovering .
Although Congress raised the limits for jumbo loans this year , those changes are not reflected in the March results .
Mortgages for more than the $ 417,000 jumbo limit accounted for only 29.8 percent of sales in March , compared with 62.2 percent a year ago .
If jumbos had been more widely available , the median home price would have been closer to $ 597,000 , DataQuick said .
Mortgage brokers and borrowers have reported that the higher limits - up to $ 729,750 in high - cost regions such as the Bay Area - have not resulted in lower interest rates .
Lenders have significantly tightened their underwriting criteria , so prospective borrowers must have stellar incomes , credit scores and down payments .
" The spigot has to open up significantly on the loan side " for the market to recover , LePage said .
Mona Koussa , a Realtor with Windermere Welcome Home in San Ramon , agreed that foreclosure sales hurt values .
" It 's tremendous downward pressure " on price , she said .
" It 's very frustrating if a seller is trying to do a regular sale that 's not in this subprime mess to have to compete with a property that did get caught in the subprime mess ( and foreclosed upon ) .
I tell folks ( in high - foreclosure areas ) , if you do n't have to sell , take it off the market , rent it out and wait a couple of years until the market swings back up again . "

When there are no new results to report in the race for the Democratic nomination , some media outlets seem to get a little punchy with their political coverage .
Or should I say , a paucity of party primaries perhaps pushes publications to pen puerile pages .
Nowhere was this playful tone more apparent than in the assonance featured in a recent New York Times story about the resignation of Clinton 's chief strategist Mark Penn : " Ouster Opens Opportunity for Obama . "
Of course , the Times is n't the only publication to fall for the allure of the alliteration .
NBC's First Read blog featured a piece about public campaign financing entitled " Obama to Opt Out ? , " and the Manila Standard Today ran an article that seems to have been written solely to fulfill the words in its headline : " Obama , Osama , O Mama ! "
Hillary Clinton is not immune from this silliness , having been the subject of stories from CBS 's " Clinton 's Candid Campaign Conversations " to the New York Daily News 's " Clinton campaign denies cash crunch " and " Clinton 's chief aide canned by Colombia . "
Speaking of Colombia , it seems to Gelf that some publications should make more of an effort to distinguish the Latin American country from its Ivy League homonym .
Among the various news outlets to claim the Mark Penn is no longer with the Clinton campaign due to his dalliances with other institutions of higher education ( get it ?
Penn and Columbia ? ) are Mother Jones , the Huffington Post , the Boston Herald , and The Nation .
You are embarrassing yourselves .
With your “ Yes We Can ” music video , your “ Fired Up , Ready to Go ” song , your endless chatter about how he ’s the first one to inspire you , to make you really feel something -- it ’s as if you ’re tacking photos of Barack Obama to your locker , secretly slipping him little notes that read , “ Do you like me ?
Check yes or no . ”
Some of you even cry at his speeches .
If I were Obama , and you voted for me , I would so never call you again .
Obamaphilia has gotten creepy .
I could n’t figure out if the two canvassers who came to my door Sunday had taken Ecstasy or were just fantasizing about an Obama presidency , but I feared they were going to hug me .
Scarlett Johansson called me twice , asking me to vote for him .
She ’d never even called me once about anything else .
Not even to see “ The Island . ”
What the Cult of Obama does n’t realize is that he ’s a politician .
Not a brave one taking risky positions like Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich , but a mainstream one .
He has not been firing up the Senate with stirring Cross - of - Gold - type speeches to end the war .
He ’s a politician so soft and safe , Oprah likes him .
There ’s talk about his charisma and good looks , but I know a nerd when I see one .
The dude is Urkel with a better tailor .
All of this is clear to me , and yet I have fallen victim .
I was at an Obama rally in Las Vegas last month , hanging at the rope line afterward in the cold night desert air , just to see him up close , to make sure he was real .
I ’d never heard a politician talk so bluntly , calling U.S. immigration policy “ scapegoating ” and “ demagoguery . ”
I ’d never had even a history teacher argue that our nation ’s history is a series of brave people changing others ’ minds when things were on the verge of collapse .
I want the man to hope all over me .

Still , I ca n’t help but feel incredibly embarrassed about my feelings .
In the “ Yes We Can ” music video that will .i.am made of Obama ’s Jan. 8 speech , I spotted Eric Christian Olsen , a very smart actor I know .
( His line is “ Yes we can . ” )
I called to see if he had gone all bobby - soxer for Obama , or if he was just shrewdly taking a part in a project that upped his Q rating .
Turns out Olsen not only contributed money , he volunteered in Iowa and California and made hundreds of calls .
He also sent out a mass e-mail to his friends that contained these lines : “ Nothing is more fundamentally powerful than how I felt when I met him .
I stood , my hand embraced in his , and ... I felt something ... something that I can only describe as an overpowering sense of Hope . ”
That ’s the gayest e-mail I ’ve ever read , and I get notes from guys who ’ve seen me on E !
When I started to make fun of Olsen , he said : “ I get that it ’s a movement .
But it ’s not like a movement for Nickelback .
For the first time , we should feel justified in our passion .
You do n’t have to feel embarrassed about it , buddy . ”
It was a convincing argument until he told me he cried during an Obama speech .
That did not help me feel less lame .
So to de-Romeo-ize , I called someone immune to Obama ’s hottie dreaminess : a white suburban feminist baby boomer .
To get two things done at once , I called my mother .

My mom , a passionate Hillary Clinton supporter , immediately attacked Obamamania .
“ Some part of me wants to say , ‘ People wake up .
He has no plans . ’
I get frustrated listening to his speeches after awhile , ” she said .
She also said that the new vacation house in Key West is really great and her vertigo has n’t been acting up .
I started to feel a little more grounded again .
Did I want to be some dreamer hippie loser , or a person who understands that change emerges from hard work and conflict ?
“ People are projecting an awful lot onto him , ” Mom said .
“ Almost like what was that movie with , oh , the movie , oh God .
That English actor , he practically said nothing .
Oh shoot .
He was the butler and everybody loved him and what he was thinking and feeling .
Do you know the movie I ’m talking about ?
You do n’t . ”
Hers , of course , is the demographic most likely to vote .
But she ’s right .
Obama is Peter Sellers in “ Being There . ”
As a therapist , she ’s seen the danger of ungrounded expectations .
“ You feel young again .
You feel like everything is possible .
He helps you feel that way and you want to feel that way ; it ’s a great marriage .
Unfortunately , the divorce will happen very quickly . ”
Mom is the kind of realistic tough - talker who is n’t afraid to make divorce analogies to a child of divorce .
“ We want what he represents , ” she said .
“ A young , idealistic person who really believes it .
And he believes it .
He believes he can change the world .
I just do n’t think he can . ”
Advertisement
Thing is , I ’ve watched too many movies and read too many novels ; I ca n’t root against a person who believes he can change the world .
The best we Obamaphiles can do is to refrain from embarrassing ourselves .
And I do believe that we can resist making more “ We Are the World " - type videos .
We can resist crying jags .
We can resist , in every dinner argument and every e-mail , the word “ inspiration . ”
Yes , we can .

NORAD , responsible for intercepting errant aircraft over the U.S. , has a standard operating procedure for scrambling planes for interception which takes less than 15 minutes
They did this successfully ( on time ) 129 times in 2000 and and 67 times between September 2000 and June 2001 .
Yet , on September 11th , they failed to do their job 4 times in a single day :
NORAD , once notified of the off - course aircraft , failed to scramble jets from the nearest bases
Once airborne , interceptors failed to reach their targets because they flew at small fractions of their top speeds
Fighters that were airborne and within interception range of the deviating aircraft were not redeployed to pursue them

It 's been a crazy few months at Tesla Motors , what with all those heads rolling and transmissions failing , but the company says it absolutely , positively will begin building the all - electric Roadster on March 17 .
Tesla still has n't gotten the transmission sorted out , so the first run will use an " interim " unit that , although robust enough to do the job , cuts the car 's zero - to - 60 time from 4.0 seconds to 5.7 .
That 's a 42 percent drop - nothing to sneeze at when you 're forking over $ 98,000 for a high - performance sports car .
Just how many cars will feature the temporary fix remains to be seen , but Tesla says its engineers have finally solved the transmission problem and later models will deliver on the 4 - second promise .
Tesla calls it DriveTrain 1.5 .
So what 's that mean for people who get cars with the Band - Aid ?
Tesla is promising to retrofit earlier cars at no cost once it 's sure DriveTrain 1.5 works .
Those who get a Roadster early will find themselves getting a substantial boost in performance some time down the line .
The first two transmissions Tesla tried proved unreliable , and apparently the tranny in the car Motor Trend praised in its road test is only good for a few thousand miles .
Tesla has decided to abandon the complex two - speed gearbox originally slated for the car .
Instead , it has developed a one - speed transmission and improved power electronics module that sends more current to the motor , allowing it to produce more peak power .
The company says the new design is lighter , more efficient and offers improved thermal performance and quarter - mile acceleration .
It 's not an easy fix .
The motor must be modified to improve its cooling capacity , and AutoblogGreen reports that Tesla is ditching the air - cooled motor in favor of a liquid - cooled one .
Road testing of DriveTrain 1.5 could begin as early as next week .
Coincidentally , that 's when the first production Tesla Roadster , dubbed P1 , will be delivered to Elon Musk , the company 's chairman .
The company has cleared all the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation hurdles and says it will start building cars in England on March 17 .
Production will start slowly and ramp up through the summer once DriveTrain 1.5 is ready to go .

38 points by aneel99 on Apr 3 , 2008 | hide | past | favorite | 39 comments
Hi all , I 'm new to programming and started developing software using Python around 6 months back .
I also know a bit of C# , C , JavaScript , HTML and CSS .
Not an expert in any thing , still learning .
Also , I 'm not very good at Regular Expressions -- this was a new - year resolution ;)
Now I 've come across a dilemma and find myself completely stumped .
I cannot figure what Python web - framework I should choose to start developing web - based software using Python .
I 've looked at the websites of Django , Pylon , CherryPy and WebPy - - and I could n't decide ;( Considering my naive skills I intend to choose a lightweight framework and a framework with which I can easily use JavaScript for client - side scripting ( my biggest fear ) .
I think I 'm in a company of some very smart people here so I will really appreciate if you can help me in choosing an appropriate framework -- considering my skill - set .
Thanks in advance , fellas .

Subject : Maybe Harvey was having an affair at the office
But you can tell by his expression at the end that as soon as his wife learned how to make a good cup of coffee that the affair came to an end .
And that 's all that matters .

The message : " Honey , you 'll always be a totally inadequate piece of crap wife until you learn to make a decent cup of coffee . "
Despite the happy ending , I still feel this guy is fooling around with the " girls at the office " .
Have always regarded Folger 's as something to drink out of sheer desperation when you run out of regular coffee and can't make it to the store .
Pretty harsh , dreadful stuff .

Subject : Bad coffee
This ad has a lot of hidden messages .
" As good as fresh perked . "
Does anyone still use percolaters ?
That kind of coffee was always overcooked and bad .
Instant coffee was originally developed by the Army for use in C rations .
If this lady really wants to turn on her husband , she should invest in a French press .

Subject : Dump it on his lap !
This is my favorite Folgers ad .
It does follow the typical Folgers routine ( wife makes bad cup of coffee , husband gets pissed , wife makes Folgers coffee , husband is happy ) but there is so much more drama here , even a hinted office affair !
If I were his wife I would have dumped that scalding pot of coffee on his lap .

Subject : Folgers -
It will save your marriage I believe the first ten seconds of this ad are possibly one my favourite moment out of the entire archive .
The breakfast bliss of Harvey and his wife are shattered when he inexplicably rips into her coffee making ability , makes a veiled threat that he 's going to start looking for other women , and then in one of history 's great passive - agressive turns delares " well , see you later " and exits dramatically stage left .
Of course this outburst is entirely the fault of the wife 's poor culinary skills , but once her non-phased friend turns her on to instant coffee ( as opposed to , say , some counciling ) the only rift in their otherwise rock - solid union is closed and the loving couple enjoy a romantic evening in their now completely dark living room .
Of course we all know it 's only a matter of minutes until Harvey blows up at another trivial matter , but it does n't matter by then .
Folgers has made it 's point :
If you do n't buy their coffee , your husband will start sleeping around at the office .
An axiom that remains true today .

Why phone software sucks ?
Splitting hardware vendors and software vendors
system calls to start a call
system calls to send an SMS message
call - backs called on incoming calls or SMSs
capture an image from the camera
detect orientation
and so on ...
What about Android ?
If you are a software developer and you care about user interface design and usability and smart features that make our life better , I bet you think that most mobile phone software sucks .
My Nokia phone for example is not able to complete words when I write SMS messages .
It is also not able to sort the list of names to which I can send an SMS in order of frequency I sent them SMSs .
It is also not possible to check the call duration of the last N calls .
When I edit messages with T9 , of all the words mapped to the same keystrokes , it is not able to guess that if I write a lot of times the word " Tine " , and very rarely " time " , the next time it should present me " Tine " as first guess .
Not only it lacks a lot of obvious features , , the development environment is a Windows - only SDK , it 's buggy as Hell and it hangs when switching between GSM and 3G connection and so on .
Usually in the software market it works this way : there is a problem to solve like to create a good IRC client .
A lot of people will write IRC clients , the best clients will end winning in the market , so we will have few winners used by many users .
The next generation of IRC clients will start basing the work on the ideas of this few cool software adding more interesting features , trying to design a better UI , and so on , and again the few best will win. , you can write the software only if you are the hardware vendor ... and guess what , there are few hardware vendors and are huge companies , not exactly the places where new fresh ideas will born .
Individuals , small teams of developers , are not in the market , , it is much more a matter of designing it well .
What 's needed in my opinion is to create a market similar to today 's PC market .
Hardware is separated from software .
Imagine the following scenario : five years from now when you buy a phone you get the new Nokia - 1000 that is simply not usable as it is , it comes with a cable you will use to load the software you like .
Of course you are free to buy the phone with a pre-loaded software if you are not a geek ... so that developers can write the whole software needed .
The phone already comes with some kind of low - level firmware that is able to make low level stuff without the developers need rewriting it every time , like : Probably it makes sense that this firmware also exports some kind of SDL - alike library to control the display , the audio , read keystrokes from the keyboard and so on , and even an ( optional ) toolkit with widgets already implemented that the developers may not use if they want to implement their own toolkit .
It is just another big player ?
If so it will not mean freedom for small teams to develop phone software from scratch .
It is not clear to me if phone customers will be able to upload a new android - based firmware in an already purchased phone , to split the hardware and software markets of mobile phones .
Ellis said the exercise was a dramatization of a story in which a young man asks Socrates to become his teacher .
Socrates responds by plunging the student 's head underwater and telling him he will learn once his desire for knowledge is as great as his desire to breathe .
The weeklong cavalcade that will accompany Army Gen. David H. Petraeus ’ return to Washington on Tuesday will look much like his pivotal visit last September : formal testimony , talk show appearances , and lots of charts and graphs .
But this time , the Iraq commander ’s presentation to Congress collides head - on with a raging presidential campaign and two Democratic candidates demanding almost the opposite of his advice .
The change could prove jarring .
For more than a year , Petraeus had the benefit of a commander in chief who was heavily invested in the same manpower - intensive strategy Petraeus has promoted .
But he returns to Washington at a time when the country ’s political leadership may soon veer sharply from the course he is advocating .
His main recommendations have been known for weeks :
Draw down through July the troop buildup that was part of the surge , he will say , then wait a while to make sure Iraq does n’t fall apart .

It is high political drama for a battlefield commander to march to Capitol Hill during the most closely watched presidential campaign in a generation .
As if that were not enough , both of the antiwar Democrats who seek to be his new boss -- Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois -- sit on committees that will hear from Petraeus on his first day of testimony .
“ The most interesting part of this is not going to be how Obama and Clinton behave , but how Petraeus behaves , ” said Kurt M. Campbell , a military analyst who has advised Democratic presidential candidates .
“ Remember : Petraeus ’ future now lies much more with what happens with Clinton and Obama .
He ’s going to go all - out to try to appear he ’s not alienating Democratic friends . ”
The third major presidential candidate , Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , also serves on a committee Petraeus will face .
McCain supports Petraeus ’ strategy .
In a blizzard of appearances last year , the cerebral Petraeus enjoyed a shower of public approval as he worked to quell calls for rapid troop reductions and cement the administration ’s war strategy .

Petraeus aides acknowledged that this time their commander is stepping into an even fiercer political storm than during his first report .
As they did in September , the aides have been running the general through exercises called “ murder boards ” to prepare him for the toughest questions Congress might throw at him .
And Petraeus is experienced in making his case .
Over the last year he has assiduously courted other military officers , academics and congressional delegations , proving remarkably successful at converting his skeptics .
But in Washington , during a campaign season , the partisan lines for and against the war have hardened .
Some analysts sympathetic to Petraeus believe that by scaling back his ambitions -- acknowledging that Iraq is unlikely to become a “ Jeffersonian democracy ” any time in the next decade , for instance -- Petraeus may convince Democratic contenders that achievable goals warrant a continuing presence in the country .
“ The right near - to - midterm objective is an end to widespread violence -- get a nationwide cease - fire , ” said Stephen D. Biddle , a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who has advised Petraeus ’ staff .
“ That is plausible ; that is achievable .
. . .
And it sounds a lot more realistic to people than the kinds of things the president has said . ”
Advertisement
Not all of the questioning from the presidential candidates is expected to be hostile .
McCain , the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , will align himself with Petraeus ’ strategy to keep troop levels at 140,000 through the summer , aides said .
“ He believes , like the theater commander does , that to draw down beyond that at this point would be dangerous and threaten some of the gains that we made , ” said McCain campaign strategist Mark Salter .
But it is the potential clash with the Democrats that will be most closely watched by political and military Washington .
Inside the Pentagon , a contingent of senior officers -- including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- has long pushed for a faster drawdown of forces to relieve stress on the Army and to meet needs elsewhere , particularly in Afghanistan .
Advertisement
Some senior officers have privately complained about Petraeus ’ direct access to President Bush , noting that under law the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the primary military advisor to the president .
Late last year , there was even a move among some senior military officers within the Pentagon to reshape Petraeus ’ role during this month ’s congressional hearings , relegating his voice to just one of many heard by lawmakers .
Pentagon officers wanted to emphasize potentially competing views , particularly from Petraeus ’ immediate superior at the time , Navy Adm . William J. Fallon , commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East .
Fallon was forced to resign last month over differences with the White House .
He has privately advocated a speedier drawdown in Iraq .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , will testify Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
But Fallon ’s resignation -- and the White House ’s decision to structure the week ’s events almost identically to the September appearance -- has returned the focus to Petraeus himself .
Advertisement
The White House has rejected congressional calls for Fallon to appear .
Fallon will remain a Navy admiral for several months , and Democrats would like his views to be more widely known .
Citing Fallon ’s resignation and the administration ’s subsequent refusal to allow him to testify , Democrats accuse Bush of stifling officers who disagree with administration views on Iraq .
But Petraeus ’ appearance this week also could place the Democratic presidential candidates in a position much like Bush ’s : Testifying before them will be a battlefield general with whom they disagree .
Clinton is on the armed services panel , Obama on foreign relations .
“ If you want a commander - in - chief test , here it comes :
How do they handle the commander when he comes back to report on a controversial situation ? ” said Frederick W. Kagan , a military analyst who helped devise the administration ’s troop buildup plan .
“ How do they handle a respected and amazingly successful general when he comes back and tells them something they do n’t want to hear ? ”
Advertisement
Aides to Clinton and Obama have sought to play down the importance of the candidates ’ coming encounter with Petraeus .
A Clinton spokesman couched the appearance as just one of multiple committee hearings and trips to Iraq that have helped her develop expertise on the military and the region .
Obama , said an aide of his , intends to “ ask the questions that the administration has failed to answer ” about the Iraqi government ’s shortcomings .
“ I do n’t know if this one moment will have grand historical significance , but it is important to have this debate , ” said the aide , an Obama national security advisor who was not authorized by the campaign to speak publicly on the subject .
Democrats are wary of seeming too focused on presidential politics at the expense of serious matters .
Advertisement
Senators examine committee witnesses in order of seniority .
McCain , in the first committee hearing of the day , will have an early and lengthy opportunity to question Petraeus .
The Democratic chairmen -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware for foreign relations and Carl Levin of Michigan for armed services -- have been asked whether they intend to allow the less senior Clinton and Obama to move up in the order .
They said they would rely on normal seniority .
“ Carl and I are like broken records in our caucus on this :
The last thing we should be doing is viewing this through a political prism , ” Biden said Friday .
“ McCain is the ranking guy , so he ’s going to get to speak first , and I think it ’s good to hear what McCain has to say .
I love the idea of McCain having to explain what ’s going on here and why this is working so well . ”

Bush losing the support of families with military ties
Families with ties to the military , long a reliable source of support for wartime presidents , disapprove of President Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq , with a majority concluding the invasion was not worth it , a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
The views of the military community , including active - duty service members , veterans and family members , mirror those of the overall adult population , a sign that the strong military endorsement that the Bush administration often pointed to has dwindled in the war 's fifth year .
Nearly 6 in 10 military families disapprove of Bush 's job performance and the way he has run the war , rating him only slightly better than the general population does .
And among those families with soldiers , sailors and Marines who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan , 60 percent say the war in Iraq is not worth the cost , the same result as all adults surveyed .
The survey , conducted under the supervision of Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , interviewed 1,467 adults nationwide last Friday through Monday .
Wholegrain cereal is best , but anything is better than an empty stomach
In a five year study of more than 2,000 youngsters , those who skipped breakfast weighed on average 5lbs ( 2.3 kg ) more than those who ate first thing .
This was despite the fact that the breakfast - eaters consumed more calories in the course of the day .
But the study in Pediatrics found they were likely to be much more active .
The University of Minnesota research adds weight to a growing body of evidence that those who eat breakfast - whether young or old - are leaner than those who do not .
" It may seem counter - intuitive , " said Mark Pereira , who led the research .
" But while they ate more calories , they did more to burn those off , and that may be because those who ate breakfast did not feel so lethargic .
" While it 's best to go for a healthy option - a wholegrain cereal for instance - the evidence does seem to suggest that eating anything is better than eating nothing at all . "
Mixed messages
Around 25 % of the group studied regularly missed breakfast , and the problem was particularly pronounced among young women .
The real problem is the profusion of messages about obesity - we need to make clear that eating regular meals is vital - and that a proper breakfast is very important .
Tam Fry
National Obesity Forum
" It 's not just a girl problem , but it is certainly more of an issue among this group , " said Mr Pereira .
" They skip breakfast because they worry about weight gain - and it's ironic that the ones who are n't worried and eat in the mornings are the ones who keep their weight down . "
Tam Fry , chairman of the Child Growth Foundation at the National Obesity Forum , said the findings of the study showed just how important it was to relay a clear and consistent message to young people .
" The real problem is the profusion of messages about obesity .
We need to make clear that eating regular meals is vital - and that a proper breakfast is very important .
" If you eat well first thing , you 'll feel brighter , you 'll have more get up and go - and that will mean you 'll expend more energy . "
Teenagers are not the only ones who may benefit from sitting down to a proper breakfast .
In a study of nearly 7,000 middle - aged people in Norfolk , a team from Cambridge University found that those who ate the most in the morning put on the least amount of weight .
When they 're in use , hard drives vibrate , and that means they can get noisy — unless they have the right shock absorbers .
In an oldie - but - goodie article , the folks at the Silent PC Review rigged up a hard drive bay with thick elastic bands they picked up at the local crafts store .
The resulting setup suspends the drives in space with the elastic , which absorbs vibrations and gives the drives plenty of breathing room .
Writer Mike Chin says :
As a simple test , when I touch the drive while it was running , I can feel a fair amount of vibration .
But when I touch touch the case right next to the hard drive — or any part of the case , there is NO vibration from the drive .
None at all .
When I showed one of my suspended drive systems to my favorite local dealer , it was the complete absence of vibration in the case that amazed them the most .
They could not tell when the PC was turned on by the usual vibration of the case .
They found it eerie .

You can also use a small piece of rubber in between the drive and its case to quiet things down .

Police have been conducting an examination of the beach A woman 's head , hidden inside a plastic bag , has been found by children playing on a beach in Angus .
A human hand was also discovered about 50 yards away from the head on Seagate beachfront in Arbroath .
Two young sisters made the " grim discovery " at 1030 BST .
They ran home and their mother called the police .
A Tayside Police spokeswoman said the force was attempting to identify the woman .
It is not known if the body parts were washed up or dumped .
As many as 40 officers were involved in searching the stony beach for evidence .
The body parts were removed from the scene at about 1800 BST .
' Tragic mystery '
The officer leading the investigation said the forensic examinations to follow would be " fairly painstaking " .
Det Ch Insp Graham McMillan said recent heavy rains in the area made it difficult to tell how long , if at all , the head had been in the water .
But he said inquiries would be thorough , with investigations continuing into the night .
He said : " We will shortly be conducting a more detailed examination of the body part which will be a fairly painstaking process . "
Det Ch Insp McMillan said the children who found the remains were " fairly upset " and were being cared for by their parents at home .
He added that there was no missing person locally that would " fit the criteria we are looking for " .
Police cordoned off the beach for further investigations
The beach is popular with dog walkers and local children , who are on their Easter break .
A local female fish worker said : " When I came to work I saw police standing about and then I heard that a head had been found .
" I watched police examine something on the beach further away and then they came closer and began looking at something else . "
Patricia Millar , 54 , chairwoman of the Royal Burgh of Arbroath community council , said : " This is the kind of thing you hear about in big cities .
I never expected it to happen here .
" My sympathies go out to the two children who made the discovery .
" It must have been terrible to see such a gruesome thing at such a tender age . "
Holiday town Angus MSP Andrew Welsh said he was in " shock " at what had happened , especially because children were involved .
" The sooner this tragic mystery is cleared up , the better , " he said .
" This would be a shock in any area of Scotland but especially in Arbroath , which is a family , holiday town .
" It may well be that future body parts are found and all youngsters should be kept away from the beach . "

What are these ?
Question :
How many electronic devices do you have around the house that you do n’t use anymore ?
Do n’t worry , I ’ll wait .
Yes , probably more then you can count .
Or remember .
What do you plan to do with them ?
Keep it in “ that ” drawer ?
Put them in the basement ?
Good for you , at least it ’s not going in the trash , where nearly 3 million tons of gadgets ended up in 2003 , the most recent year the EPA has statistics for .
You may have considered getting it recycled , as even mainstream players like Office Depot offer in store tech recycling .
But you ’ve got to pay for it .
This alone will likely be a barrier for many to make that step .
And then there ’s the possibility that E - cycling may be little more then just shipping the garbage to another country , where people get exposed to highly concentrated dose of toxins .
What to do , then ?
What if there ’s the niggling feeling it ’s worth something ?
How about giving your gear a second rotation .
Come again ?
Second Rotation , out of Waltham , Massachusetts will buy your gear , from cell phones to GPS devices to gaming consoles and on .
It ’s clear they ’re not just skimming for the cream of the crop .
Have you ever heard of Bird cell phones ?
Yes that ’s a brand , not an avian communication device .
All you do is answer some questions about the condition , then they instantly give you a quote .
If you agree , they give you a form to mail the item , free .
You do n’t even have to leave the house .
Then , a short in person inspection , and you get money .
Done .
Do n’t agree with their inspection ?
Get it back , free .
What happens then ?
Through an astounding array of data aggregators and online channels , these devices get sold back out there , to those who would appreciate and gladly possess what you no longer wish to .
And what of the ones that do n’t get sold ?
Excellent question .
As of press time , I could n’t find an answer to that .
I invite you to contact them and find that out .
Overall , it sounds as though they ’ve successfully created an engaging , simple , efficient way for electronics to forgo the trip to the dump , and continue to have utility throughout their lifespan .
There are a number of other niche players in this market .
See below for more .

View host Hasselbeck : Rush Limbaugh ' blocks hope ' David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Friday March 7 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh is used to getting slammed by folks on the left for his often over - the - top commentary , but this week he also managed to infuriate perhaps his only fellow right - leaning pundit with a forum on daytime network TV .
" Let 's say it is Obama and Hillary Let 's put Hillary at the top 
That 's a position she 's familiar with , " Limbaugh said on his radio show Wednesday , as noted by CNN 's Political Ticker .
" Therefore , you 've got a woman and a black for the first time ever on the Democrat ticket .
Ahem .
They do n't have a prayer . "
View co-host Whoopi Goldberg rhetorically asked , " Now , is n't this still America ?
Is n't this the place where we say anybody could be president if you are a United States citizen ?
Should we say they do n't have a prayer quite yet ? "
Republican counterpoint Elisabeth Hasselbeck agreed with her liberal co-host , calling Limbaugh a " blocker . "
" That 's what I call someone who blocks progress , blocks hope , blocks someone from getting something that they most likely deserve , " Hasselbeck explained .
" I think he 's wrong . "
Then Barbara Walters noted that " a lot of conservatives love him . "
" I don't , " Hasselbeck replied .
" I'm a conservative and I do n't love him . "
Comedian Joy Behar then decided to get personal by mocking Limbaugh 's history of prescription drug abuse .
" Is n't Oxycontin a downer drug ? " she asked .
A clearly agitated Hasselbeck continued to pile on Limbaugh , " I think that 's giving him an out .
I do n't think it 's about the drugs .
I do n't think it 's about his past .
It 's about his intention and his heart and I think it 's cruel . "
The fifth View host , Sherri Evonne Shepherd , added that there was an " undercurrent of racism " in Limbaugh 's remarks .
Left unsaid by all the View hosts was that Limbaugh had also attacked them the day before , when they had discussed prior comments made by him .
" Do you want to hear the babes on The View discuss this ? "
Limbaugh said on his show Wednesday .
" Do you want to hear what they have to say ?
I literally marvel , I really do , at the obtuseness , the dim - wittedness , the no ' there ' there - ism of some of these women . "
Limbaugh even laid into Hasselbeck for daring to criticize a fellow conservative .
" And then this poor old Elisabeth Hasselbeck is the conservative on this program and is going out of her way -- it's pathetic , " Limbaugh added .
" This program has the potential to be doing more damage to women than Oprah is doing .
Good Lord , it 's insulting .
There have to be executives at ABC that understand the literal ignorance that 's being broadcast on their network signals each and every day .
I guess they know their audience . "
This video is from ABC's The View , broadcast March 6 , 2008 .

Do you know what OSHA MSDS means ?
You should if you ’re an employer who wants to have a safe work environment that follows federal guidelines .
MSDS — short for Material Safety Data Sheets — are important for any workplace that has any hazardous chemicals .
If you have chemicals on the job , then it ’s important that you know more than just what the acronym MSDS is short for .
Read on to learn more about OSHA MSDS and why they are so important to have .
What Is OSHA ?
Before we get too far , let ’s make sure you understand the acronym OSHA .
OSHA is short for Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
OSHA was created in 1970 through the Occupational Safety and Health Act .
This law was created in response to thousands of injuries , illnesses , and deaths that workers experienced on the job annually .
As part of the Department of Labor , OSHA ’s mission is to provide standards , training , and resources to help employers and employees create safe , healthy work environments .
What Is OSHA MSDS ?
As part of its mission , OSHA required manufacturers and distributors of hazardous chemicals or substances to provide an MSDS on each of their products .
OSHA MSDS stands for OSHA Material Safety Data Sheets , and they exist to provide employees with information on any chemical they ’re working with .
OSHA requires this from chemical manufacturers and distributors because all of their products are found in some kind of work environment — whether that ’s a warehouse with laborers or a home with maids .
It ’s important to note some of the history surrounding MSDS .
When OSHA first required the creation of MSDS , there was no standard format for these documents .
This led to confusion , and in 2012 OSHA revised its rules on MSDS .
Referred to as just SDS – or Safety Data Sheets – these documents now follow a standard 16 section format .
On a side note , you may be wondering what is the difference between MSDS and SDS .
Outside of the formatting standard , they are extremely similar and are sometimes used interchangeably .
Why Do You Need MSDS ?
You and your employees need MSDS for the chemicals you work with for two important reasons .
First , employers are expected by OSHA to make MSDS available to all employees .
Second , and maybe more importantly , MSDS are needed because they provide valuable safety information to employees .
This includes information on what the chemical is , what kinds of hazards exist , how to safely handle the chemical , and how to provide proper first - aid if an accident does happen .
This knowledge is valuable in protecting employees and preventing potential injuries , illnesses , or worse .
How Can You Find MSDS ?
If you want to run a safe and responsible work environment , then you need to have MSDS on hand .
If you do n’t already have these documents , they are n’t hard to find .
MSDS sheets are available in online databases .
Some websites like msdsdigital.com can even provide you with an online binder to make it easy to organize all these safety documents you need .
What Is the Difference Between MSDS and SDS ?
Now You Know
While it may have seemed confusing at first , OSHA MSDS should now be straight forward for you .
These Material Safety Data Sheets are an important way of keeping your employees informed and safe when it comes to the chemicals they will be using .

What is a human - animal embryo ?
True hybrid embryos are the result of fertilising an egg with the sperm of another closely related species ; for example , a mule is the hybrid offspring of a donkey and a horse .
Chimeric embryos are made by injecting cells or genetic material from one species into the embryo of another .
Scientists at Stanford University in California plan to use this technique to create a mouse with 10 % human brain cells .
The third type are human transgenic embryos , made by injecting a segment of animal DNA into a human egg .
The fourth type of hybrid , the kind being developed in British universities , is called cytoplasmic .
It is created by transferring the nuclei of human cells , such as skin cells , into animal eggs from which almost all the genetic information has been removed .
The resulting embryo would contain only a tiny amount of animal DNA – around 0.1 % – and the rest would be human .
The embryo would be grown in a lab to a size of around 200 cells .
Why create human - animal embryos ?
Scientists developing these embryos say they will provide a plentiful source of stem cells – immature cells that can develop into many different types of tissue – for use in medical research .
Researchers believe that , by producing stem cells carrying the genetic defects of diseases , they will be able to work out how a cell 's molecular machinery goes awry and perhaps find new cures for diseases .
The research has been hampered by the severe shortage of " spare " human eggs donated by couples undergoing fertility treatment .
By using animal eggs , which are far more readily available , British research teams hope to make more rapid progress .
Their experiments have shown that the stem cells harvested from hybrid and chimeric embryos behave identically to human ones .
Who are the scientists ?
A team led by Professor Stephen Minger , director of the stem cell biology laboratory at King 's College London , has been offered a licence by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) to use human - bovine embryos to study degenerative neurological diseases such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
Dr Lyle Armstrong , of the North - east England Stem Cell Institute , Newcastle University , has a licence to use cow eggs to research replacement tissues for use in treating conditions such as diabetes and spinal paralysis .
His team has successfully created such embryos : one developed for three days until it had 32 cells .
The research has not yet been published , but the team plans to submit the work for peer - review in the next few months .
A third team , led by Professor Ian Wilmut , the Edinburgh - based creator of the first cloned mammal , Dolly the sheep , wants to create human - rabbit embryos to develop treatments for motor neurone disease , although the team has yet to apply for a licence .
What are the objections ?
There were 300 responses to the government consultation , with 277 opposed to the research , many of them from pro-life groups opposed to any intrusive study of embryos .
Many Catholics object to the idea of mixing human and animal DNA within the same entity and to the notion of creating what they regard as a life for the purposes of research – a life that will then be destroyed .
Cardinal Keith O'Brien denounced the research as experiments of " Frankenstein proportion " .
But some scientists are also sceptical .
Professor Sir John Gurdon , a Cambridge University researcher who has injected human DNA into frogs ' eggs , told the Guardian : " Scientifically ...
I 'm not persuaded it will work .
If you put cells from one species into the egg of another , the egg may divide , but you could get a lot of genetic abnormality that wo n't lead to good - quality stem cells . "
What does the law say ?
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 does not clearly set out the parameters of human - animal embryo research .
The HFEA approved such research after it decided that the embryos being created were in effect human and thus fell under the remit of the current law .
However , if the HFEA were to decide hybrid embryos were not human , the research would fall outside the law and escape regulation .
The human fertilisation and embryology bill will define the parameters of embryo research .
It proposes that hybrid embryos could not legally be implanted into a woman 's womb , or an animal's .
What is the situation in other countries ?
Chinese scientists were reportedly the first to successfully create human - animal embryos .
In 2003 a team at the Shanghai Second Medical University fused human cells with rabbit eggs .
The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory dish before being destroyed to harvest their stem cells .
Later that same year , a US scientist , Panayiotis Zavos , announced he had created " human-cow " embryos that lived for around a fortnight and could theoretically have been implanted into a woman 's womb .
In 2004 researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota produced pigs with hybrid pig - human blood cells .
In 2005 Parkinson 's disease researchers at the Salk Institute in San Diego reported they had created mice with 0.01 % human cells by injecting about 100,000 human embryonic stem cells per mouse .
Last year a
Yale researcher , Eugene Redmond , led a project injecting millions of human neural stem cells into the brains of monkeys afflicted with Parkinson 's disease .
Many countries have banned this human - animal embryo research , including Australia , Canada , France , Germany and Italy .

OK : payrolls down 22,000 in January , 63,000 in February .
Hard to see things improving any time soon , thanks to dramatically worsening conditions in the credit markets .
So it ’s a very good guess that we will eventually be told that the second recession of the Bush administration began in December 2007 or January 2008 .
Now he is campaigning to overthrow the military government .
In 2002 the Government took over his Rangoon training centre because " they were afraid of it " , Pannya Vamsa said .
" They [ the regime ] liked me ; I never liked them , " he said of his previous co-operation .
" When governments ask what to do , I say you have to choose between good and evil .
" The Burmese Government is wrong in every field - religiously , socially and commercially .
They cannot handle the [ country ] , there is not enough to eat , and they make divisions . "
The International Burmese Monks Association was formed on October 27 last year after the arrest and detention of thousands of monks by the army in the wake of the peaceful uprising .
" In Burma , the present situation , the monks say , ' We can not do anything .
The military government is torturing and killing , and we cannot live peacefully .
Help us tell the world leaders , political and religious , what is happening , " ' he said .
There are an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 monks and nuns in Burma , the same as the number of soldiers .
" We think about 100 monks were killed and thousands of monks and nuns were arrested [ last September ] , " Pannya Vamsa said .
After the uprising the regime closed the monasteries in and around Rangoon , detained senior monks and sent the novices back to their villages .
" In Rangoon now about 10 per cent of the monks are left , " Pannya Vamsa said .
" In Mandalay [ the second largest city ] there are about 40 per cent . "
Monks who tried to return were investigated , their faces checked against the photographs of the marches to see if they were involved in the protests , he said .
Pannya Vamsa dismissed the junta 's referendum in May to approve a new constitution as " probably a trick " and predicted there would be another uprising .
" They torture so much , people can not stand it .
There is no limitation ; they nearly explode .
They have tolerated it for so many years .
It is not just wishful thinking .
Feelings first , actions later . "
He said the uprising in September had resulted in one big change : people worldwide were once again aware of and cared about what was happening in Burma .

Belgium is in crisis , apparently , though I have to say it does n't really look it .
At least , no more than it usually does .
The theoretically handsome Place Flagey in Brussels , which was a building site three years ago , is still a building site , only more so and much muddier .
The trains are running normally , but Bruxelles Midi station is as beaten - up and pissed - upon as ever .
The frites remain excellent , of course , as does the chocolate .
And in the street the people curse the taxman , as they have always done , and the price of petrol , which is new .
The papers and the politicians , though , are predicting apocalypse .
Believe them , and the country is in the worst trouble of its admittedly brief history , or at the very least since the dark days of the last war .
Because Belgium , remarkably , has spent the past 156 days without a government .
And while this is plainly not yet in itself a catastrophe , there is a very real fear that the fragile and complicated arrangement of string and sticky tape that holds this impossible country together may finally be beginning to come unstuck .
Belgium , it is whispered ( and none too quietly ) , could soon be no more .
Should we feel remotely concerned by this ?
If you dislike unfeasibly potent beer , naff statues of permanently peeing boys , mayonnaise with your chips , and Tintin , maybe you will not .
If , on the other hand , you feel a vague sentimental attachment to the idea of a country whose very existence , in the absence of anything resembling a national language , a national culture or much more than a century - and - a half of national history , depends on the virtues of goodwill , understanding and compromise , then you should .
Belgium 's citizens , in any event , look pretty much resigned to it : recent surveys show that in the north as many as 63 % think the break - up of their 177 - year - old country , a place their prime minister - in - waiting himself has called " an accident of history " , is now more or less inevitable .
" The place has had it , " says René Vanderweiden , a fiftysomething telecoms engineer queueing in the penetrating Brussels drizzle for a No 93 tram .
" Maybe not now , maybe not in 10 years ' time .
But within my lifetime , I 'd guess .
The Flemings [ Belgium 's Dutch - speaking majority ] want out of it , and they 're no longer afraid of saying so .
There 's a scorn , and an impatience , that was n't there before . "
Sheltering from the rain in a stylish cafe in the Galeries St Hubert , Joelle Rutten , who works in a bookshop , blames the politicians .
" We obviously do n't need them , " she says .
" Look at us - we 're all going to work , paying our taxes , nothing has changed .
They 're utterly out of touch with ordinary people , anyway , arguing about things that mean nothing to most of us .
It 's a scandal !
They have no idea what they 're doing at all . "
Sadly , though , the politicians - or some of them , at least - seem to have a very clear idea of what they are doing .
In a neat and functional town hall office in the neat and functional Brussels suburb of Halle , Mark Demesmaeker , deputy mayor , remarks cheerfully that he " can no longer see the value - added of Belgium , actually .
There are six million of us Flemings , we work hard , we make money , and we 're perfectly capable of standing on our own two feet .
Indeed , we would be one of the wealthier small countries of Europe .
For us , Belgium is simply counterproductive .
We 'd be better off without it . "
It takes a while to get one 's head around just how complicated Belgium is : this really is not your model nation state .
Vanderweiden is a Walloon , from near Liège in the region of Wallonia , which forms , roughly speaking , the southern half of the country .
He speaks French .
Rutten is Brussels born , and speaks primarily French but , she claims , " not bad " Dutch .
And Demesmaeker is a Fleming , from the region of Flanders , the northern half of the country .
He speaks Dutch .
The Flemings make up roughly 60 % of the population ; the Walloons 40 % .
The two communities lead essentially parallel lives ; outside the royal family , the national football team , the foreign office , the justice system and the army , no national institution - not a single political party , a TV station , a charity or even a university - serves them both .
Consequently , running Belgium currently requires one federal government , three regional ones ( because bilingual Brussels also counts as a region ) , and another three on top of those , one for each language group ( French , Dutch and , just to make matters interesting , a small German - speaking community ) .
Thankfully , the Flanders regional government and the Dutch - language community government are one and the same , so the lucky Belgians are today ruled by a mere six different administrations .
Add to that the fact that Wallonia was historically far richer that Flanders , but , with the decline of its heavy industry , is now considerably poorer ; that unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders , and that twice as many Walloons as Flemings are employed by the state ; that a sizeable chunk of Wallonia 's income comes from the taxpayers of Flanders and is spent ( to be polite ) in a rather relaxed , Latin kind of way ; and - the icing on the cake , this - that Wallonia traditionally votes left while Flanders traditionally votes ( quite far ) right , and perhaps the real surprise is that Belgium has managed to survive as long as it has .
As one of the country 's more famous sons , the painter René Magritte , might have said : " Ceci n'est pas une nation . "
Although typically , like his other famous compatriots Georges Simenon and Jacques Brel , most people tend to think Magritte was French .
Anyway .
The country 's present crisis was precipitated by elections in June .
These saw the Flemish Christian Democrats and Liberals emerge as the big winners , with the Christian Democrat leader , Yves Leterme , anointed prime minister designate and charged with forming a government .
Unfortunately , the Flemings had campaigned on a platform of far - reaching further autonomy for Flanders ; Belgium 's regions already control their own housing , education , culture and transport , but the Flemings wanted responsibility for taxation , social security , economic policy , justice and immigration as well .
Not surprisingly , none of the Walloons - not even the French - speaking Christian Democrats , in theory Leterme 's natural allies - is prepared to go along with this , recognising full well the disastrous consequences for already - impoverished Wallonia of splitting the country 's social services and sky - high national debt .
The most emblematic of the Flemings ' demands , however , concerns what has become rather cryptically known in Belgium as " the BHV question " .
The BHV question is on everyone 's lips .
" BHV is crucial , " politicians will say to you , in deadly earnest .
" There can be no agreement on a new government without agreement on BHV . "
Many ordinary Belgians , to be fair , feel there might possibly be a few more important questions to be answered , such as when exactly the politicians are going to stop arguing about BHV and get on with running the country , but all recognise that this is a stumbling block .
Here , somehow , lies perhaps the toughest test yet of Belgium 's collective capacity to continue as a country .
And like everything in Belgium , it is absurdly complex .
BHV stands for Brussels - Halle - Vilvoorde , the country 's biggest electoral constituency .
At present , BHV is a sort of island within Flanders .
It is made up of bilingual Brussels ( B ) and Halle and Vilvoorde ( HV ) , which are Flemish .
However , the fortunate French - speaking constituents of H and V are currently entitled to vote for French - language political parties in Brussels ( there being only Dutch - language parties to vote for in the rest of Flanders ) .
The Flemings want H and V to be split off from B - thanks to rising property prices in Brussels , they feel H and V are getting a bit too French .
This would effectively deprive some 150,000 French speakers of the right to vote for French - speaking politicians .
It may sound technical , but in Belgium it is a very big deal indeed .
At any rate , on the damp and chilly streets of Halle , barely a quarter of an hour 's train ride from the capital , feelings are certainly running high .
Here , as deputy mayor Demesmaeker politely explains , the local council has a Flemish language manifesto stating that Halle is a Dutch - language town , and intends to remain so .
" We merely ask everyone to respect that , " he says .
" We ask people to integrate .
We ask the shopkeepers to advertise only in Dutch , we demand that the street signs are only in Dutch , we expect everyone who comes to the town hall to address us in Dutch , and we ourselves will communicate only in Dutch .
And we have an official who checks up on it all .
It 's perfectly normal , I think . "
Some may see here the seeds of something rather nastier than a quest for linguistic integrity .
But in any case , continues Demesmaeker , who is also an MP in the Flemish parliament , the root of the problem is that Halle 's 10 % - " and growing fast " - of French speakers show " very little willingness to learn Dutch .
They come here , they see Halle as some kind of extension of Brussels , they walk into the shops and they say , ' Bonjour . '
Many make no attempt .
Do n't get me wrong : I have nothing against Walloons .
I go often to the Ardennes forests , in the far south , and there they are charming , completely different .
But here . . .
Well , there 's a certain arrogance , I think .
French was for so long the dominant language and culture here , you see .
And the Dutch - speaking inhabitants of Halle , well . . . there are tensions .
They do n't like too many people speaking French here .
They do n't like some of the classes in our schools being half - full of French children . "
Many of Demesmaeker 's constituents seem to agree with him .
" This is Flanders here , and we deserve as much respect as anyone else for our language and for our culture , " says the owner of a shoeshop on the pedestrianised main street , Basiliekstraat .
She does not want her name in the paper , because " these things are sensitive , especially for a shopkeeper - a client is a client . "
But , she adds vehemently , " if we go to Wallonia , we expect to have to speak French .
It 's only right .
And it 's only right that when Belgian French - speakers come here , they should speak Dutch .
It 's common courtesy .
But most either can't , or do n't bother . "
Outside the Ici Paris boutique , oblivious to the irony , Marie , who also does not want her surname mentioned , acknowledges it would be " a bit sad " if Belgium were to collapse over such a question .
But , she feels , " there are laws in Belgium that were created for a very good reason .
This is not a bilingual region , and it should n't become one " .
In the cheese shop , I exercise some rusty Dutch , and the woman behind the counter thanks me profusely for trying .
Most , she says , do not .
Reinforced by such passionate sentiments , and no doubt irritated by the lack of any progress on their constitutional demands , Belgium 's Flemish politicians last week took the historic step of voting through the split - up of BHV in parliamentary committee .
Outraged , the Walloon MPs stormed out of the chamber in protest .
In living memory , this was the first time that Belgium 's unspoken pact had been broken : the politicians of one language community had forced a vote , against the wishes of those of another .
It may not signal the end of Belgium , but the consensus among politicians appears to be that it does not bode well for the country 's future .
In an elegant antique - filled office overlooking a park in the centre of Brussels , Charles Piqué , the capital 's affable , Socialist , French - speaking minister - president , concedes that the vote had " a very , very strong symbolic value .
It is not decisive , I do n't think , not yet .
But it marks another step in the ongoing process of Flemish intimidation .
We have learned in this country , over the years , to compromise more and more to avoid these kind of situations .
But this shows their determination , that they are prepared to increase tensions between the communities to such an extent .
And BHV is only the start - it 's just the beginning of the Flemish demands .
They will now put the whole lot on the table : the full transfer of responsibilities , the further defederalisation of this country .
What happens next is critical . "
It would be a sorry end for a country whose birth was , to a large extent , our doing .
In 1831 , when the Catholic Flemings and Walloons split off from the Netherlands , Britain was interested in keeping the Dutch in their place , maintaining a buffer between France and Germany , and ensuring that all the Channel ports did not fall into the hands of one or other of them .
We backed the fledgling state , placed Queen Victoria 's uncle on its throne as Leopold I , and pledged military support .
Germany 's violation of Belgium 's neutrality was , indeed , why Britain entered the first world war .
The place has not done too badly : it did not exactly cover itself in glory in its colonisation of the Congo , but it was an early industrial power , and , in the 1950s , it did very well to grab the headquarters of the European Union .
But is it really necessary ?
That , increasingly , is becoming the question , if not quite yet for ordinary Belgians , then certainly for their political leaders and the media .
The " Czechoslovakia option " of a more or less amicable divorce , with Brussels becoming a kind of international city state , is being openly discussed .
So too , extraordinarily , is the notion that Wallonia might become part of France , which a poll this weekend showed the French would be perfectly happy to countenance .
Joelle Rutten , the bookshop worker , steadfastly refuses to believe that Belgium is on the brink : " We 've grown up in this country ; it 's a nice country , a friendly country .
It would be stupid , completely idiotic , to split it all up just because a few thick - headed politicians are so out of touch with reality that they can't see sense . "
But for Demesmaeker and his Flemish friends , there now has to be , at the very least , major constitutional reform :
" We could just about live with a confederation - two independent states that voluntarily decide what they can profitably do together .
That would be sensible , and it's a very different proposition from what we have now , " he says .
" It 's not that we 're not prepared to help Wallonia ; nobody wants a weak neighbour .
But it would have to be on our terms : there would have to be transparency , efficiency , less waste .
What we are not prepared to do is carry on as things are .
This is a very , very deep crisis . "
Unfortunately , says Piqué , for the Walloons and for Brussels , " an arrangement like that would be very , very difficult .
In a federal state , based on cooperation and solidarity , everything is possible .
In a confederation , where there 's no real central government to resolve disputes , everything becomes much more problematic .
And if the Flemish get exactly what they want out of all this , and make no concessions , and the Walloons start to feel humiliated and realise they 've been left with nothing , then there will inevitably be a radicalisation .
Future historians could well look back and say : ' This moment , right now , was this country 's turning point . ' "
The demise of Belgium , Piqué says , would be " a victory for selfishness " .
Also , it would be short - sighted , costly and sad .
Call me sentimental , but on balance I agree .
Outside , obviously , it is still pouring .
But the tram comes , on time , and nobody on it looks any unhappier than they might reasonably be expected to look in Brussels in November in the rain .
They may not be missing their politicians , the Belgians .
But it is beginning to look like they might , in the not too distant future , be missing their country .

MUCH as George W. Bush ’s presidency was ineluctably shaped by Sept. 11 , 2001 , so the outbreak of the French Revolution was symbolized by the events of one fateful day , July 14 , 1789 .
And though 18th - century France may seem impossibly distant to contemporary Americans , future historians examining Mr. Bush ’s presidency within the longer sweep of political and intellectual history may find the French Revolution useful in understanding his curious brand of 21st - century conservatism .
Soon after the storming of the Bastille , pro-Revolutionary elements came together to form an association that would become known as the Jacobin Club , an umbrella group of politicians , journalists and citizens dedicated to advancing the principles of the Revolution .
The Jacobins shared a defining ideological feature .
They divided the world between pro- and anti-Revolutionaries — the defenders of liberty versus its enemies .
The French Revolution , as they understood it , was the great event that would determine whether liberty was to prevail on the planet or whether the world would fall back into tyranny and despotism .
The stakes could not be higher , and on these matters there could be no nuance or hesitation .
One was either for the Revolution or for tyranny .
US media , Clinton assail Obama for “ bitter ” truth
By Patrick Martin
14 April 2008
The American media and the political rivals of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened fire on the Illinois senator this weekend after he committed the unpardonable offense of speaking the truth , or at least a part of it , about the bitterness among working class Americans over the steady erosion of their living standards and jobs .
Obama ’s comments at a closed - door fundraising event in San Francisco were reported Friday on the Huffington Post political blog .
He was asked by supporters why he was trailing Senator Hillary Clinton in polls in Pennsylvania , where a state - wide primary takes place on April 22 .
“ Our challenge is to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there ’s not evidence of that in their daily lives , ” Obama said .
“ You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania , and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest , the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing ’s replaced them .
And they fell through the Clinton administration , and the Bush administration , and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not .
And it ’s not surprising then they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . ”
Obama had just completed a six - day bus trip across Pennsylvania , which included dozens of town hall meetings in small towns , rather than the rallies in huge arenas that have been a feature of his campaign in other states .
As a result , he engaged in face - to - face discussion with hundreds of working class voters , who told him stories of plant closings , lack of opportunity for their children , and countless broken promises from Democratic and Republican politicians alike .
Apparently , the Democratic senator is guilty of a double offense against the norms of contemporary American electoral politics :
He allowed real - life experiences of social deprivation to affect him , and then spoke frankly in front of an audience , albeit a privileged one at a private fundraiser , of the economic realities of American society .
He compounded this political sin with the suggestion that religion , gun rights , economic protectionism and anti-immigrant agitation were used to divert working people from the economic oppression they face .
The response from the American media , once his remarks were published , was immediate and hostile .
Obama was guilty of a “ blunder , ” he had “ offended ” rural America , he faced “ a full - blown political disaster . ”
A commentary on the influential web site politico.com said , “ this is a potential turning point for Obama ’s campaign , ” one that could result in the loss of the Democratic nomination to New York Senator Hillary Clinton .
It is instructive to compare this reaction to the treatment of the speech on race relations that Obama delivered last month in response to controversial comments made by the ex-pastor of his Chicago church , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
The bulk of the media treated Obama ’s address favorably — an indication that in the America of 2008 , class divisions are a much more sensitive issue than race .
Nothing that Obama said was a surprise to the media pundits or his political rivals .
If anything , he understated the level of bitterness in rural and small - town America , since he left out one of the most important factors in fueling popular anger — the war in Iraq , which has taken a disproportionate toll in these communities , where a far higher percentage of young people volunteer for the military than in urban or suburban areas .
Republican political strategists have relied for years on appeals to religious sentiments —
“ God , gays and guns , ” in the parlance of political consultants — to win support among voters whose jobs and living standards have been devastated by the decline of American industry and the unrestrained “ free market ” policies of successive Republican and Democratic administrations .
Thomas Frank wrote a best - selling book four years ago ( What ’s the Matter with Kansas ? ) , which examined this process in his home state , and his conclusions about the use of coded appeals to religion to induce voters to ignore their own economic interests have become conventional wisdom in ruling class political and media circles .
While Frank ’s book had certain insights into American culture and politics , he ignored the most fundamental factor enabling the Republican appeals to prejudice and backwardness to produce electoral successes — the drastic shift by the Democratic Party to the right and its abandonment of any policies to alleviate economic inequality or improve living conditions for working people .
Spokesmen for the campaign of the presumptive Republican presidential candidate , Senator John McCain , denounced Obama for “ dismissing ” the “ values ” and “ American traditions ” that “ have contributed to the identity and greatness of this country . ”
The response of the Clinton campaign to Obama ’s remarks was no less reactionary .
Her spokesman accused Obama of “ offending small town America , ” adding , “ Americans are tired of a president who looks down on them — they want a president who will stand up for them for a change .
The Americans who live in small towns are optimistic , hardworking and resilient . ”
At a rally in North Carolina , Clinton campaign workers handed out stickers bearing the motto , “ I ’m not bitter . ”
The candidate herself declared , “ I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small town America .
Senator Obama ’s remarks were elitist and out of touch .
They are not reflective of the values and beliefs of Americans . ”
The charge of “ elitism ” is remarkable coming from Mrs. Clinton , who last week released tax returns showing that she and the former president had raked in $ 109 million in income over the past seven years , putting them squarely in the top .01 percent of American society .
Clinton went on to identify herself with religion and patriotic values .
“ I was raised with Midwestern values and an unshakable faith in America and its policies , ” she said .
( The 60 - year - old candidate grew up in the 1950s , the years of the McCarthy witch - hunt , Cold War conformism and the domination of racial oppression in the American South . )
“ I grew up in a church - going family , ” she continued , “ a family that believed in the importance of living out and expressing our faith .
The people of faith I know do n’t ‘ cling ’ to religion because they ’re bitter .
People embrace faith not because they are materially poor , but because they are spiritually rich . ”
Obama ’s initial reaction to the barrage of criticism was to reiterate his views at a town hall meeting in Indiana , where , as a Washington Post reporter described it , “ he repeated the offending word [ “ bitter ” ] three times . ”
He ridiculed Clinton for denying that working - class people in Pennsylvania are resentful over the state of the economy , and he called both McCain and Clinton “ out of touch ” for their apparent lack of understanding of the growing anger against the political establishment .
“ People are fed up , ” Obama said .
“ They ’re angry and they ’re frustrated and they ’re bitter , and they want to see a change in Washington . ”
By the following day , however , Obama had begun to change his tune and back away from this too - blunt assessment of the popular mood in America — and above all from any implied criticism of the role of religion .
“ I did n’t say it as well as I could have , ” he told a campaign rally in Muncie , Indiana .
In an interview with the Raleigh News & Observer , he said , “ Obviously , if I worded things in a way that made people offended , I deeply regret that . ”
By Sunday , he was in full contrition mode , prostrating himself before those who accused him of offending the religiously devout , although he continued to assert his original statement that there is widespread alienation in rural and small town America .
It remains to be seen whether the political furor of the last few days has a lasting effect on the outcome of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , or the November election contest .
But the episode has been a revealing exposure of both the media and the political establishment .
The near - unanimous consensus that Obama has committed a huge blunder by referring to working class bitterness and resentment has two sources : the enormous social distance of the millionaire pundits and politicians from the real lives of working people , and the fear that under conditions of convulsions in the financial markets and the onset of a deep recession , any discussion of the underlying social antagonisms in America has potentially explosive consequences .
&演算子 はProcオブジェクトをブロックへ変換し、ブロックをProcオブジェクトへ変換します。この場合、&はシンボル :+
をブロックへ変換しようとします。ブロックへの変換にはRuby組み込みの型変換が利用されます。ブロックへの型変換ではまず、Procオブジェクトが与えられているかをチェックします。ブロックが与えられていなければ、引数として与えられたオブジェクトをProcへと変換すべく to_procメソッドが呼び出されます。このとき、シンボル :+ に to_proc メソッドが定義されていれば、それが呼び出されます。Ruby 1.9では、Symbol#to_roc が定義されています。このto_procメソッドは、Procオブジェクトを返します。
つまり、 &:+ は { |x , y| x + y } になるということです 。
での目玉機能といえばスレッド機構の変更やFiber ( source ) だが、これ以外にも標準ライブラリに加えられた便利な機能がある。Object#tap ( source ) については既に紹介した通りだ。tapメソッドはメソッドコールのチェインの途中に処理を割り込ませられる便利な機能だ。tapメソッドがそうであったように、メソッドのアイデアも、少し前からRubyコミュニティでは知られていた。to_proc相当の機能は、Ruby 1.9より前のバージョンでも利用できたのだ。Ruby 1.9 はこの機能をそのままSymbolクラスへと統合した。このおかげで、#to_procを使うのにライブラリは必要なくなった。Reg Braithwaite による手短なSymbol#to_procの紹介記事では ( 1..100 ) .inject (&:+) のようなコードが動くようになったと説明 ( source ) されている 。
この振る舞いのおかげで次のようなコードを書けるようになる。
plus = :+.to_proc
puts plus.call ( 1,2 ) # ' 3'が表示され る
Symbolクラスにto_procメソッドがあるということは、このやり方があらゆるシンボルに通用するということだ。
to_s = :to_s.to_proc
to_s.call ( 42 ) # 文字 列 " 42 " が返ってくる
to_procの実装はシンプルだ。Dave Thomas ( PragDave ) はその動 作( source ) をこう説明している 。
def to_proc
proc { |obj , * args| obj.send ( self , * args ) }
end
to_procメソッドはProcを生成します。生成されたProcは、オブジェクトを引数にして呼び出されると、渡されたオブジェクトに対してsendメソッドを呼び出します。sendメソッドの第1引数のシンボルは、to_procのレシーバの自分自身です。ですから、たとえば names.map(&:upcase )の場合、namesに格納されている字列をイテレートするわけですが、その際にはnamesの各要素に対してupcaseメソッドを呼び出すブロックがコールバックされます。
この機能のおかげでコードがとても簡潔になるのだが、ひとつ疑問が残る。つまり、これでコードは読みやすくなるのだろうか？これに対する答えはたぶん to_proc が Ruby 1.9の標準となったことで変わっていくだろう。なぜなら、いまやSymbolにはかならずto_procメソッドがあるからだ。以前であれば、Symbol#to_procを実現しようとすれば、自分でコードを書くか、Symbolを再オープンしてto_procメソッドを追加するライブラリを使うしかなった。さらに、こうしたコードを理解するにはSymbol#to_procというイディオムを知っていなければならなかった。これについてはRuby 1.9で公式にサポートされたことで、今後はドキュメントでも言及されていくようになるだろう。
それでもやはり疑問は残る。確かに、
( 1..100 ) . map ( &: to_s )
は
( 1..100 ) . map{|x | x.to_s }
よりも短く書ける( この例では5文字短かい)。しかし、これは複雑さを増すに見合ったものだろうか？
それともやりすぎだろうか？
Ruby 1.9 のProcには他にも追加された機能がある。Porc#curry がそうだ(といってもsvnリポジトリのごく最近のリビジョン(
r15459以降)でなければ使えないが)。ruby-core メーリングリストの議論によれば、Proc#curry の機能( source ) とは次のようなものだ。
全然難しいことはなくて、
proc {|x , y , z| x + y + z }.curry
は、次のようなprocを返すのと同じです
proc { |x| proc {|y| proc { |z| x + y + z } } }
カリー化（currying）とは、計算機科学分野の技法の一つ。複数の引数をとる関数を、引数が「もとの関数の最初の引数」で戻り値が「もとの関数の残りの引数を取り結果を返す関数」であるような関数にすること。
つまりカリー化とは、n個の引数を取るProcを1つの引数だけで呼ぶことができるということだ。この場合は(当たり前だが)処理の結果を返すことはできない――処理を実行するために必要な引数が与えられていないからだ。よって、処理結果の代わりに、(n
-1)個の引数をとる新しいProcが返される。これが繰り返されて、Procのコードを処理するのに必要なだけの引数が揃ったら、Procは処理を実行してその結果を返す。
ruby - core メーリングリストの議論スレッドから利用例を紹介しよう。
plus_five = proc { |x , y , z| x + y + z }.curry.call( 2).call( 3 )
plus_five [ 10 ] #=> 15
補足 : plus_five は Procであり、 [ ] 演算子は Procで はProcを実行するようにオーバーライドされている。
注意 : Proc#curry が Ruby 1.9 に追加されたのはつい最近である。試してみるには、最新のsvnリビジョン(
r15459以降)を利用しなければならない。

FBI mortgage probe widens
Posted
Mar 18 - The FBI 's criminal probe of the mortgage lending industry has grown to 17 firms .
In response to the sad passing of Gary Gygax last week , I was looking over one of his masterworks , the Tomb of Horrors .
This is a D&D adventure created in 1978 for the purposes of testing the wit and fortitude of adventuring parties at game tournaments .
" Testing " is used here in the same sense as the sentence " We 'll be testing the dog for rabies . "
Let 's just say the subject is not expected to survive the procedure .
The Tomb of Horrors was a collection of deathtraps that ranged from the inexplicable to the unavoidable , and few players came away from the experience unharrowed .
Their characters generally ended up as nothing but pink slurry , or greenish - gray slurry in the case of half - orcs .
Those few doughty characters and doughy players who survived the experience did so by the application of techniques like driving livestock ahead of them into the tomb to set off the traps , which strikes me as a bit less than heroic .
I 'm not an expert on fantasy literature , but I do n't remember a scene in Lord of the Rings where Gandalf prods 50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait .

But you know , that 's not a bad idea !
In your standard D&D game , the main preparation characters make for delving into a structure with a name like The Crypt of Unending Soul - Devouring and Hefty Beatings is to pick up iron rations and a 10 - foot pole .
In real life , archaeologists spend months excavating a tomb just to keep from further damaging already - shattered pottery .
You'd think that when your goal is not just tenure , but survival , you 'd take at least as much care .
Here 's what I think a more realistic approach to dungeon exploration would look like .
February 14 , Year 803 by Gnome - Reckoning
We have been held up at the border for two weeks now , waiting for our dungeon - exploration permits from the Department of Interior Looting .
Crossing the right palms with a few pieces of gold and a Potion of Virile Performance has sped the process up quite a bit , and we leave for the Dungeon of Repugnance in the morning .
February 20
After several days of travel we have reached the Dungeon , losing only one camel and three graduate students in the trek .
One student was eaten by an owlbear , one was spirited away by pixies , and a third decided to get a job as a barista .
We are hopeful that soon the priceless treasures of Appreh the Endless will soon be ours to mark carefully with index cards and put in storage .
May 16
We have nearly finished our initial survey of the outer flagstones of the dungeon entrance .
Already we have made wonderful discoveries !
Initial tests indicate that the stones may have come from an open pit quarry near the Elonges River , nearly two miles from here !
Also , we were attacked by a Phantom Fungus and lost two more graduate students .
July 28
I 'm very excited !
The cataloging of the entryway has been completed , and a graduate student , Bill , will be entering the dungeon itself for the first time today !
He requested a goat to herd into the dungeon ahead of him , but I pointed out that goats are valuable .
July 29
Both good and bad news .
The good news is that we have discovered an actual Frummosh - dynasty - spiked , poisoned pit trap in the dungeon !
The bad news is that Bill 's bodily fluids have tainted the find .
I will be adding a stern reprimand to his posthumous evaluation .
November 23
We finally discovered treasure yesterday , a small ruby set into the eye of a fascinating Glarbnark - era troll statue .
I tried to impress upon the crew the importance of silence on the matter , but the news got out at alarming speed , and this morning we were awoken by Imperial Enforcers explaining that the dungeon was now under governmental protection and we were to hand over the ruby and leave immediately .
A disappointment to be sure , but at least I 'll make it home in time to present my paper at the 483rd Annual Flagstone and Cobble Symposium .
It 's sure to be quite an adventure .

More ' Filthy ' Games to Drive Fox News Crazy
For starters , this seems like an awfully good time for Democrats and Republicans to unite behind the repeal of the Mann Act , a barbarous relic of 19th century sexual hysteria most generally used for persecuting various sorts of scary minorities .
And we already know how I feel about our nation 's prostitution statutes .
Jack Balkin suggests that it might also be time to take a long hard look at the surveillance state :
These events offer a window into a much larger phenomenon , the National Surveillance State , in which the state increasingly identifies and solves problems of governance through the collection , collation and analysis of information .
Governments have always used information , but today 's techniques are made more powerful and more prevalent by lower costs of computing and data storage .
This story also shows the important role played by private businesses in constructing and implementing the National Surveillance State .
The Times report suggests that the banks in question volunteered more than the letter of the law might have required , because the transactions in questions were wire payments rather than coin or currency .
The banks erred on the side of caution , seeking to assist the state in its efforts .
Moreover , they already had their own pattern recognition systems designed to identify suspicious behavior .
( Many people are probably familiar with the programs devised by credit card companies which analyze consumer transactions to calculate the probabilities that a card is being used fraudulently . )
If computing power increases enough , there is no reason why governments might not lower the threshold for reporting of suspicious transactions , or , indeed , require that every transaction over 100 dollars be reported .
All this information could later be sifted through by data mining programs , in order to spot patterns of suspicious activity .
The only limit is the technology and the manpower that law enforcement is willing to devote to analysis of financial transactions .
The Spitzer story shows both the promise and the threat of these developments .
On the one hand , reporting financial transactions makes the job of law enforcement easier , and it uncovers crimes ( and terrorist plots ) that might never be discovered otherwise .
Mandatory disclosure ( or in this case , voluntary disclosure by banks ) of private individual 's financial transactions , and sharing of data between intelligence services , federal , state and local law enforcement helps the state identify patterns of criminal activity , prevent crimes before they occur , and punish them after the fact .
These techniques and technologies allow governments to do the jobs entrusted to them more powerfully and more efficiently than ever before .
On the other hand , these developments carry all of the potential risks of a powerful National Surveillance State : Governments can make mistakes in assessing levels of criminality and dangerousness ; and their data mining models may characterize innocent activity as suspicious .
Without sufficient oversight and checking functions , government actors may misuse the additional knowledge they gain , for example , by instigating abusive prosecutions , or creating discriminatory systems for access to public and private services ( like banks , airports , government entitlements and so on ) .
And the more powerful government becomes in knowing what its citizens are doing , the easier it becomes for government to control people 's behavior .
Terrorism aside -- and my understanding is that terrorists are very rarely caught using a money trail -- most of the " crimes " we catch by spying on people 's bank accounts should n't be illegal , so I can't say I 'm thrilled to hear that the government is now 200 % more efficient at putting the " perpetrators " in the pokey .
Particularly when they have to spy on me to catch them .
I do n't think it 's any of the government 's damn business if I want to carry around $ 10,000 in cash -- and if you need broad powers to monitor the financial transactions of ordinary Americans in order to catch drug dealers , then I suggest that it 's time to rethink the laws that necessitate the creation of these financial " crimes " .
On the other hand , I 'm not distressed to hear that the Feds were spying on Eliot Spitzer .
No , not because I do n't like the man , but because I think maybe we should spy on our politicians , all the time .
No probable cause , you say ?
I fling back at you Mark Twain 's observation that America only has one distinct criminal class : Congress .
Perhaps every member of Congress should be subject to warrantless wiretaps -- except that the spies should be the American public , streaming over the web .
If they need a national security exemption , of course , I think they should be able to get it one from an appropriate judicial authority .
I 'll even agree to a generous 24 - hour delay to allow them to make their case .
Exclusive " We are n't democratic . "
That 's how Wikipedia founder Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales described his famously - collaborative online encyclopedia in a recent puff piece from The New York Times Magazine .
" The core community appreciates when someone is knowledgeable , " he said , " and thinks some people are idiots and should n't be writing . "
This is true .
Despite its popular reputation as a Web 2.0 wonderland , Wikipedia is not a democracy .
But the totalitarian attitudes of the site 's ruling clique go much further than Jimbo cares to acknowledge .
In early September , the Wikipedia inner circle banned edits from 1,000 homes and one massive online retailer in an attempt to suppress the voice of one man .
His name is Judd Bagley , and when the ban came down , he had n't edited Wikipedia in over a year .
He was merely writing about the site , from his own domain .
The Wikipedia elite blacklisted Judd Bagley because he accused them of using their powers to hijack reality .
Talk of Wikipedia admins trying to seize " the truth " may sound familiar .
Famously , comedian Stephen Colbert has poked more than a few holes in the site 's commitment to democratic consensus , making fun of its efforts to clamp down on edits deemed less than factual .
And the web is still abuzz over the secret mailing list used by top administrators to silence inconvenient voices .
But what happens when , say , the Wikipedia elite decides to take a topic as weighty as the health of US financial markets under its control without informing the public of its decision ?
How far will Wikipedia 's arbiters of truth go ?
Come with us down the rabbit hole .
One thousand innocent bystanders
One sleepy evening this October , Cory Hogan stumbled onto Wikipedia while trawling the web for information on US Vice President Dick Cheney .
He read the site 's extensive screed on the curmudgeonly veep , and before he knew it , he was inclined to contribute his own thoughts to the discussion .
But when he clicked on the " edit this page " tab , he was told he was n't allowed .
A rather menacing message filled his web browser , announcing that Wikipedia edits were forbidden from his IP address .
His address , the message said , was a favorite " open proxy " of Judd Bagley and Overstock.com .
Wikipedia bans Traverse Mountain , Utah
Cory Hogan shares his IP range with about 1,000 other homes in Traverse Mountain , Utah , a neighborhood twenty miles south of Salt Lake City , and one of those homes belongs to Judd Bagley .
The two men live within two blocks of each other , and they 're members of the same church .
When that message turned up on Wikipedia , Hogan 's first thought was that Bagley was some sort of shady political henchman for the Vice President of the United States .
But the truth is far stranger .
That Traverse Mountain IP address is not an open proxy .
It would seem that the address was banned because Judd Bagley has accused Wikipedia 's uber - administrators of skewing the contents of four online articles .
Yes , just four .
But those four articles may sway the fate of billions of dollars spilling through America 's stock markets .
" It should be pretty simple , " David M naïvely stated , " just look in the Agent_ProductLines table , right ? "
" Uhhh , " David 's coworker , James , replied in a slightly condescending tone , " no . "
David was starting to get used to such responses .
Nothing in his new job was " pretty simple " to simple to do .
" Okaaay ... so how exactly can we tell if a particular Agent is allowed to a given Product Line "
James groaned .
" Well as you know , the original database developer , was n't really a fan of normalization , the relational model , or just plain simple common sense .
In this case , he did not want to ' waste space ' by creating a table just to store the Agent - Product Line relation . "
David sighed .
He knew exactly what was coming up : some stupid comma , tilde , asterisk delimited string on the Agency table .
" Oh it gets worse , " James replied , " see , take a look at this column , the NVARCHAR ( 2000 ) one called strProductLines ? "
David took a look .
He was confronted with something far worse than a delimited string ...
012-3100000100110000001000000103000001001100000-1011010101---0010011000000100000001000001001---00000500000010600010011000000100000001000001001100000010
" What the - - "
" Here , " James said , cutting him off , " let me show you how it works . "
He grabbed a pen and a pad of paper , and started to draw a little table ...
ID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... Value 0 1 1 - 3 1 0 0 ...
" Wait , " David said , " you 're telling me , the index of each character corresponds to the product line ?
And a one means that they can sell a product line ? "
" Yes , " James replied , " but it 's a bit more than that .
' 0 ' means they can't sell , ' 1 ' means they can , ' -' means there is no such product with that ID , and ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' , ' 4 ' - all through ' 9 ' , all mean different things .
Like , ' 3 ' means that the agent has received training on the product line , but has not been approved to sell , and so on . "
David buried his face in his hands for a brief moment .
" So how exactly can can I build this ' Find Agency by Product Line ' feature ? "
" Well , " James winked , " it should be pretty simple . "

UPDATE : Give to the DCCC , the congressional body in charge of electing and re-electing Dems to the House .
They ’re the group that Hillary is threatening to boycott if Pelosi does n’t hand her the election .
Let ’s show Hillary and her rich donors that they ’re no longer relevant in a party where millions of small donors now rule the day .

UPDATE 5:31 PM : This statement was issued by the Obama campaign :
“ This letter is inappropriate and we hope the Clinton campaign will reject the insinuation contained in it .
Regardless of the outcome of the nomination fight , Senator Obama will continue to urge his supporters to assist Speaker Pelosi in her efforts to maintain and build a working majority in the House of Representatives , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
Speaks for itself .
___________________________________________
Every time I think I do n’t want to write another post about the failed candidacy of Hillary Clinton , some new outrage arises .
Last week , Hillary ’s big donors were trying to buy a new election in Michigan .
This week , they ’re trying to extort Speaker Pelosi .
Keep in mind that Hillary ’s campaign finished February in the red .
You ’d think that would be a major concern for her funders .
I know a lot of reporters , like the ones at the Wall Street Journal , could n’t do the math from the FEC reports , but here ’s a quick breakdown : Clinton reported $ 33.1 million cash on hand at the end of February .
Of that total , $ 21.7 can only be spent in the general election leaving her with $ 11.4 million .
She has debts of $ 8.7 million , so the campaign is down to $ 2.7 million .
Subtract the $ 5 million loan Clinton owes herself , she ’s in the red .
( The WSJ reported the debt to vendors was only $ 3.7 million , which is wrong , but they have n’t corrected it . )
That ’s a problem for a candidate whose inevitability was built , in part , on her fundraising ability .
But , what are Hillary ’s top fundraisers doing ?
They sent a clearly menacing letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi with veiled references to how much dough they give to Democrats .
Greg Sargent has a copy of the letter at TPM Elections :
We have been strong supporters of the DCCC .
We therefore urge you to clarify your position on super - delegates and reflect in your comments a more open view to the optional independent actions of each of the delegates at the National Convention in August .
We appreciate your activities in support of the Democratic Party and your leadership role in the Party and hope you will be responsive to some of your major enthusiastic supporters .
What does that language mean ?
It is n’t limited to superdelegates , that ’s for sure .
The letter says “ each of the delegates . ”
That is significant .
Keep in mind that the super rich contributors are upset with Pelosi for saying last week :
“ If the votes of the superdelegates overturn what ’s happened in the elections , it would be harmful to the Democratic party ”
Now , of course , Pelosi is right .
That would be harmful to the Democratic Party .
But , Hillary and her rich supporters care about Hillary , not the Democratic Party .
And , this is n’t just about superdelegates .
Clinton ’s donors are directing Pelosi to go public and endorse Hillary ’s comments from a few days ago , when Hillary said that the elected delegates , the ones YOU voted for already , do n’t have to support Obama even though YOU voted for him .
In their world , those delegates can just vote for Hillary anyway .
That ’s what this letter is about .
It ’s about extorting Pelosi to hand Hillary the election by stealing Obama ’s delegates .
It ’s about Hillary doing something that a month ago she promised she was n’t going to do – try to steal Obama ’s delegates .
( To be clear , I do n’t think there is any way Clinton could win over any of Obama ’s delegates .
I have no doubt his delegates will stick with him .
But , the Clinton campaign has reached the point of desperation that they are willing to try .
Actually , Clinton should be more worried about her delegates ditching her for the candidate who is going to win the nomination — and be the next President . )
What Hillary is quite literally doing is threatening to destroy the party if she is n’t handed the nomination .
This is crazy .
The leaders of the Democratic Party need to end this disaster now .
16 % of the American adult population is digitally illiterate .

Abstract
This paper describes a radical new vision of the World Wide Web and browsers that deeply embed collaboration and editing .
Table of Contents
Introduction
What if community and editing were a central and transparent part of the web and browsers ?
What if the web was extremely integrated for usability , with instant messaging , site creation , the web server , and more all integrated into one whole ?
What would this web look like if despite being integrated it was massively decentralized on a peer - to - peer network , able to exist and run without businesses or governments ?
The answer is a web where people , collaboration , and usability are first class citizens .
This paper is a thought experiment launched from these questions , a vision of how the web will be drastically different when it supports seamless community as a major component of the browser .
The goal is to expand and consider ideas and technologies that push the boundary of what is technically possible .
Engineering constraints and pragmatism are extremely important but can sometimes limit designers from imagining new ways of structuring software .
Rather than focus on the technical how this paper focuses on the what in order to stimulate thought beyond current engineering capabilities , providing future possibilities that research and coding efforts can steer toward .
This paper describes a new web browser , named Paper Airplane , and a new World Wide Web , called The Two Way Web .
This new system has two components : native support for collaboration and massive decentralization of the new web 's technical plumbing .
Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web are an extension of WikiWiki's , special web sites in which anyone can add and edit content within the browser .
Paper Airplane generalizes
Wikis across the entire web , bringing them into the browser and transforming what the web could be .
Why can't the browser natively support powerful editing , collaboration , and messaging tools so that every web site can choose to be as transparent and grassroots as traditional Wikis are ?
Further , the browser itself becomes a platform for hosting this new web ; every web browser is also a web server that collaborates with other browsers in a peer - to - peer network , creating a rich system of nodes that provides decentralized and transparent services such as storage , search , naming , and more .
Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web do not exist ; they are a series of user - interface mockups and a vision for what a new version of the web could look like .
This paper explains the vision by presenting the major portions of this new network and providing a UI walkthrough .
Prior Work
Unifying editing and community into the browser is not new ; it is an integral piece of Tim Berners Lee 's vision for the web .
The first web browser , WorldWideWeb for the NeXT machine , included an editor and annotation tools .
Other prior work on editing and the web includes Ward Cunningham 's WikiWiki ; the Netscape Communicator suite of tools , which included an editor , email client , news client , and browser ; and Dave Winer 's work with Edit this Page , Manila , and XML - RPC .
The blogging community has also been exploring similar ideas in the context of blogging .
Collaborative hypertext is also not new ; Douglas Engelbart included it in his NLS / Augment presentation and system , while Ted Nelson describes a vision for a collaborative web of documents and editing in his Xanadu vision .
Work has also occurred on turning a P2P network of nodes into a decentralized storage system for ease of publishing ; some example systems are MojoNation , MNet , and FreeNet .
The history of unified collaboration tools is also long , including such software as Lotus Notes and Groove .
Paper Airplane & The Two Way Web
The vision of Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web is composed of the following major pieces : Instant Site Creation , the P2P Mesh , the Editor , Instant Messaging , the Smart Browser , and the Two Way Web Directory .
First is a web browser that supports Instant Site Creation by including everything necessary to create and serve web sites ; there is no separation between browser and server .
Every browser is automatically a server and can handle requests for web sites , and includes wizards for creating sites .
The Instant Site Creation tools also support the full spectrum of public and private , allowing everything from completely private work groups to completely editable public sites .
Once the site is set up and users are viewing pages , they can use The Editor to create and edit pages .
The Editor is a full - featured word processor built into the browser , an Internet - focused light office suite .
Unlike existing packages such as Microsoft Word , this new editor is focused on web - based collaboration rather than printing pretty documents .
Further , this Internet - centric editor has one click editing and saving ; no more FTP or uploading files .
Editing and saving documents is now similar to WikiWikis , but far more powerful and brought into the browser .
Instant Messaging is integrated into every web site , including the editor .
Every web site now supports instant messaging , so that as you browse a site you can communicate with that site 's members .
You can edit documents in the editor while communicating with others who are also editing that document , collaboratively creating a page using synchronous edit tools .
Further , instant messaging for a site hooks into how public or private you decide to make your web community during the Instant Site Creation process , empowering site creators to choose how they want instant messaging to work .
The Smart Browser is a new concept for the browser 's relationship with a site .
The browser now includes many things that used to be on the server , standardizing and making many common tasks much simpler across the web .
For example , the browser includes single sign - on , so that users can sign into the browser itself on startup and then authenticate against other sites automatically .
The Smart Browser vision also includes many tools for working with and viewing web sites in much more sophisticated ways , including searching , tagging pages , viewing pages by tags , tracking site changes , automatic indexing , and more .
The Two Way Web Directory is a Yahoo - like portal that is decentralized and which makes it easy for users to find and search the Two Way Web .
During site creation using the Instant Site Creation tools inside the browser , users can choose up to three tags to describe their site , such as Politics and Campaign Finance Reform , for example .
This information is stored in the P2P Mesh in such a way that a Yahoo - like index can be shown to end - users in the browser , generated from all of the tags .
This directory also supports Google - style searching .
No one company or entity controls this virtual Yahoo ; it appears to the end - user as a centralized , easy to use website but is in fact a fantasy , a creation put together by the Paper Airplane browser while communicating in the P2P Mesh .
The browser hooks into a peer - to - peer network of all other Paper Airplane browsers that are running named the P2P Mesh .
The Two Way Web is actually a virtual illusion created from all running Paper Airplane browsers , a co-creation of many browsers autonomously creating a P2P Mesh .
These browsers work cooperatively to do routing , distributed naming , automatic provisioning of storage and replication , etc .
When a user wants to create or save a website using the Paper Airplane browser , they do not have to worry about storage or uploading files ; Paper Airplane works with the cooperative P2P Mesh to automatically get the user started without having to know how to set up a web server , save files , or configure DNS .
Walkthrough
This walkthrough describes the five major pieces of Paper Airplane : Instant Site Creation , The Editor , Instant Messaging , The Smart Browser , and the Two Way Web Directory .
Instant Site Creation
At first glance Paper Airplane looks like a normal browser , but with one extra piece , a special toolbar that is the jumping off point for accessing an extensive suite of tools for the creation of advanced online communities , collaboration , and editing :
The first major step in empowering users to collaborate is to make it drop dead simple to create online web sites .
To do this , users simply click on the New Site Button in the Edit toolbar :
Clicking the New Site Button leads a user to the New Site Wizard .
This wizard guides users through everything necessary to create advanced online collaborative web sites .
In several simple steps a user can choose a domain name and ending from an expanded , new domain name system called DisDNS ; enter tags that will be used to autocategorize their site later in the Two Way Web Directory ; and choose how public or private they would like to make their site .
You may be familiar with domain endings from the older World Wide Web , such as .com and .org .
This system is fraught with problems : it is beauracratic ; the endings that are available are tightly restricted ; creating and registering domain names is expensive and time - consuming ; and the system itself is controlled by an un-accountable international organization .
Paper Airplane leaves this system in place for older web sites , but replaces it for the new Two Way Web .
This new domain name system , known as the Distributed Domain Name System ( DisDNS ) , brings a host of new , easy to use capabilities to users .
First , it now includes hundreds of endings , such as .love , .environment , .politics , and more .
For example , users can create Two Way Web Sites such as www.nike.laborpolicy and www.microsoft.antitrust, or could share their online poetry community with the world at www.poetry.community.
Users can type these new domain endings right into the Paper Airplane browser to reach their Two Way Web Sites , just like normal sites .
Users are guided in choosing a domain name and ending in the New Site Wizard :
This step of the wizard even makes it possible for users to create entirely new Top Level Domain endings !
Once a domain name is chosen , a user then chooses several tags for categorizing their site .
These tags are totally up to the user and will be used later to create a spontaneous folksonomy directory of new Two Way Web Sites that other individuals can use to find sites that match their interests :
The New Site Wizard also allows a user to select how public or private they would like to make a web site .
Collaboration should support many different modalities of public and private , from completly open and anarchistic Wiki - like sites to absolutely closed private Intranet - style sites .
Paper Airplane achieves this by defining several simple roles that users can have and how users are given these roles .
Two Way Web Sites have three roles : Managers , Members , and Non-Members .
Managers can add and remove people , and can edit and delete pages , while Members can create and edit pages , but can not delete them or manage other members .
What Non-Members can and can't do depend on how open or closed you decide to make your site .
The New Site Wizard allows site creators to define how members are given roles and how much power non-members have in the site :
Four different kinds of sites are possible using this wizard :
Super Public , which is basicly akin to a completely open , Wiki - like site where everyone is automatically a Manager and can therefore do anything they like to the site
Public Sites , where anyone can become a Manager after registering ; this is almost as open as Super Public but creates a small amount of friction .
Public Restricted , where anyone can view the site but existing Managers must approve their joining in order for them to become Managers and Members themselves .
Private Sites , in which no one can even view the site , much less edit it , unless they were pre-invited by existing Managers .
When a user is finished with this Wizard , the Paper Airplane browser creates the Two Way Web Site on the user 's local machine and in the P2P Mesh and registers the new domain name in the DisDNS system .
Users do not have to find a server provider , storage , or fish out their credit cards to pay and register a domain name , since the peer network itself resolves and finds domain names ( more on this in the section titled P2P Mesh ) .
Finally , the user is presented with the first , new , unedited page of their Two Way Web Site that provides getting started options :
At this point , a user can now engage The Editor to start editing and creating their site .
The Editor
Every web page you visit in a Two Way Web Site can be edited by pressing the Edit Page icon , if the site is public or if you are a member :
Once pressed , the browser shifts into an editor , where this page can be edited in place without shifting into a different program or spawning a new window :
This editor is a full featured office suite that is focused on creating collaborative web pages rather than printing pretty documents , as existing office suites like Microsoft Word are .
First , the editor is WYSIWYG , so creating and editing pages is easy for mainstream users .
Second , saving a page is as easy as pressing the Save Page button in the toolbar :
Pressing this button causes the page to transparently save into the remote web site ; the user does not have to hassle with uploading any files , FTP , etc .
The browser itself determines the best way to save the page , such as into the P2P Mesh .
Just as Macromedia Fireworks is a hybrid editor , which combines vector and bitmap editing in one application , the Paper Airplane Editor is a hybrid editor , merging together both standard " typewriter " editors such as Microsoft Word and page layout editors such as Adobe Layout .
Users can access the toolbar at the top of the browser to drop text boxes , images , and tables into a document , and then manipulate them like a traditional word processing application such as Microsoft Word .
They can also work with items in the page as objects using the Select button and move them around arbitrarily , like a page layout application :
When the page is first displayed the cursor is placed at the upper left corner of the editing document , like a typewriter ; beginning users can simply start typing and using the editor in more traditional ways .
The power of this approach is that new users can get started quickly , while power users can quickly jump back and forth between the two modalities , using word processor and page layout semantics where each makes sense .
As a user adds items to their document , such as text blocks or images , the left - hand sidebar updates showing what can be changed to format this object , such as fonts , colors , borders , etc .
This means that users no longer have to search through endless dialog boxes to figure out common formatting operations ; everything is immediately accessible and changeable to the user , again much more like Macromedia Fireworks than traditional word processing applications .
The UI becomes much more flat , with the tools and properties that are necessary to get any job done always present , leading to much faster productivity and usability :
Using the editing toolbar , users also have access to an extensive suite of tools .
Notes can be dropped into a document ; notes are like mini-forums , and can record specific questions about content in a web page .
Notes can be edited and replied to without shifting into the full edit mode to support lighter weight collaboration than full page editing :
Users can reply and jump through all of the notes in a page .
The Draw , Quickshapes , and Symbols buttons drop down to show common tools needed for diagramming and brainstorming , such as lines , diamonds , etc . so that these symbols can be placed into a document for discussion , ala Visio , but without having to leave the browser :
The Signature button allows a user to select either the entire page or a portion of it to digitally sign it , drawing on the user 's authentication information that is needed for single sign on , as described in the section The Smart Browser :
This makes it possible for users to assert that particular portions of a document or the entire page was created by them .
The selected portion is digitally signed and saved transparently with the page , and the browser displays whether the signature is valid automatically while others are viewing a page .
The Editor also comes with common templates , such as ones for resumes , business letters , etc. , but these templates are special : they are Smart Templates .
These templates look just like common Microsoft Office templates , with fields to guide the user in entering common information such as their name , job position sought , etc. while editing and creating a document .
However , when a page is edited with a Smart Template we record the semantic information of each field when we save the web page .
For example , if we are dealing with a resume template , with fields for the person 's name , work experience , etc. as the user fills this information out we are recording what type of information this is , which is then saved as a simple XML overlay with the HTML , similar to Microsoft 's InfoPath application .
The Two Way Web then becomes not only a collaborative and P2P web , but it is also a semantic one in that many of the pages will have enough bootstrap information to create custom search engines and aggregators to find specific kinds of content , such as resume search engines .
The Editor also includes tools for users to create their own Smart Templates .
A smart template for a purchase order .
Notice that this smart template includes two kinds of fields ; the light blue fields are those that can be changed by the editing user and which record semantic information when saved , while the light gray fields are autocalculated by the smart template itself , such as a total price for this purchase order or a date field .
Just like a Wiki the editor also includes autolinking .
Every page you create has a title :
This title is unique to each page and can be changed during page editing .
While editing a page , if you enter the special characters [ [ around any title , followed by a page name , then ] ] again , the editor will automatically hyperlink that text to a page with that name or add a " Create " button at the end if it does not exist yet .
The Paper Airplane browser and editor also support tabs , similar to FireFox .
The browser can have several tabs open showing different web sites and pages , with some of them being in edit mode .
The user can jump between tabs to quickly compile information while editing , for example , or can be co-editing several pages at once either alone or with others ( see the Instant Messaging section for details on real - time collaborative editing ) .
Autolinking and the tabs work seamlessly together as well .
As page names are autolinked in the editor while you are typing , the user can choose to open the auto - linked page into a new browser tab to browse this new page or begin editing it as well .
This combination of tags and autolinking make working in the editor feel very stream of consciousness and organic .
The Editor also brings to Wikis something long missing : autosave .
At regular intervals the editor saves the user 's contents as drafts that can be later retrieved if the browser crashes or the user accidentally navigates away .
Never lose your creative work again .
When a page is saved or created , it is stored into the P2P Mesh .
The P2P Mesh
Paper Airplane uses a P2P
Mesh to achieve much of its functionality in a transparent manner so end users do not have to struggle with common administrative tasks .
Peer - to - peer means that ordinary end - users machines are used to co-create the network .
Napster did this with sharing music files , while Skype does it with finding and routing Internet voice telephone calls using normal end - user machines .
The upshot is that very affordable networks can be created in a decentralized , automatic manner .
Paper Airplane uses a P2P Mesh to achieve the following functions : routing around network blockages , such as NATs and firewalls ; a domain name system named DisDNS for storing DNS names and resolving them ; a presence and communication fabric for instant messaging ; and virtualized storage using available P2P nodes for saving and replicating web sites .
The nodes in this P2P network are the Paper Airplane browsers themselves .
Instant Messaging
As users are browsing a site , they will see other users that are also members of this site in their sidebar .
This IM client is a simple , AOL Instant Messenger type client where users can communicate one - on - one or form simple group conferences to communicate as they browse the site .
The IM sidebar respects the type of site it is attached to , such as whether it is Super - Public or Private .
If a site is Super - Public then everyone on the site is shown , while a Private site reveals private members only .
A Restricted Public site would only show those who have joined the site , reducing presence clutter in the sidebar and allowing members to focus on each other to work productively .
While editing a document , if another user would also like to edit this document a popup will appear saying that another user is requesting to edit this document .
If you agree , the editor changes into a collaborative editor , with the IM client located in the sidebar along with the same formatting palletes that were discussed in the section The Editor .
Every user is assigned a color , and as you edit , add , and remove content and objects the background color of these sections is different , similar to SubEthaEdit .
Every user also gets a differently colored cursor so they can see what the other is editing .
The combination of shared editing with real time communication is extremely powerful , especially since the tools for single and collaborative editing are almost identical .
The end result is that users can do private and communal editing without learning a new skill set .
The Smart Browser
Tools for navigation in browsers progressed rapidly in the early days of the web , until they finally froze at their current state in about 1995 and have remained relatively unchanged .
This is sad as the brower could standardize and embed many tools for much more sophisticated ways of dealing with web site s , especially around collaboration .
It 's time for innovation .
Paper Airplane takes this to the next level with the concept of the Smart Brower , where the browser embeds standard navigation controls across the Two Way Web Sites it creates .
This section discusses how the Smart Browser makes end - user 's lives easier .
First , Paper Airplane embeds single signon .
When a user first starts Paper Airplane they authenticate themselves against the browser , using a signon dialog to unlock a public / private keypair that is stored on the local machine .
This public / private keypair is linked to a handle , similar to an AOL screen name , that is globally unique .
It does not establish that they are a specific person but rather that they have a particular handle .
Then , as they navigate to each Two Way Web Site , the browser authenticates them in the background using these keypairs against the remote site .
Single signon goes hand in hand with a standard way to join and unjoin Two Way Web Sites .
At any site , if the site creator made it open , a user can press the Join button to become a member of this site :
When this is pressed , in the background the browser sends the user 's public key to the remote site to be used later for single sign on activities , editing , and site roles .
The next standardized interface in the smart browser is a standard way to track site changes , which is a panel that appears in the left - hand sidebar when selected :
This panel is created by using an RSS stream from the remote site , and can track recent site edits using the Paper Airplane Editor , or if the remote site is a blog recent updates to a blog or corporate site , for example .
When users go to a new site they wo n't have to wonder what has changed ; the Recent Changes panel makes it easy for them .
Members of sites can also easily manage roles with the Members sidebar :
Every page also has a control so that users can tag it with a given topic , such as " important " , “ todo " , or “ linux ” , for example :
Then , by pressing the Navigator section in the sidebar they can view all of the pages in a web site sorted by Tag , by Name , and more .
This Navigator makes it possible for users to quickly jump to new adhoc categories created by other users , sorted into bottom - up categories using the tagging control .
The Navigator also includes other powerful ways to view a web site : Recently Edited , which shows recently edited pages ; and My Recent Pages , which shows your own recently edited or viewed pages so that you can quickly jump back to them .
The end result is that structure is brought to collaborative sites in a bottom - up , organic manner rather than through top - down controls that quickly become out of date .
The Navigator also exposes a sorting type called By Index , which takes a bit of explaining but which is very powerful .
As pages are created and edited , an automatic index is created in the background .
When a user views a site in the Navigator By Index , they will see an automatic index similar to the index in the back of a book or the one in Microsoft Help defining all the words , topics , and relations gleaned from the site itself .
Most importantly , if your site members have used Smart Templates to create pages that have simple semantic information in them , then we now have higher - level metadata to hook our index on to .
The index can be an extremely powerful way for users to look into " the back of the book " in a sense and jump right to the page and section they need to read or edit .
Having an index to view a site is one of the payoffs for using Smart Templates when editing and creating your collaborative site .
The Two Way Web Directory
Creating a new decentralized , collaborative web is useless if users do n't have an easy way to find and navigate to content that interests them .
The challenge , however , is how to provide a centralized place for users to search and find content without creating a single point of failure or control in the network .
The Two Way Web Directory solves this in several ways .
The Two Way Web Directory is actually a virtual portal built into the browser which pulls its data from the P2P Mesh and the tagging metadata entered during site creation in the New Site Wizard .
This site looks and feels something like a centralized Yahoo , but is in fact completely peer - to - peer .
The user - interface for the Two Way Web Directory has two major ways of allowing users to find and navigate to sites .
The first is through search , so that users can enter terms into a Google - like search box and find sites that match their interests .
The search engine actually initiates a search into the P2P Mesh , using the various kinds of metadata and content that were entered into Two Way Web Sites as described above , such as site tags , page tags , automatic indexation , etc .
The automatic indexation plays a dual role of making it possible for every site to be quickly searched , since they are already all indexed .
The other major user - interface is for an automatic Yahoo - like directory to be created using site tags , a folksonomy :
These site tags are organized alphabetically and by popularity , using a Flickr - like UI .
The P2P Mesh itself also stores information so that Related Tags can be gleaned , allowing users to jump from one site tag to another to find other sites that match their interests .
Conclusion
This paper began with a series of questions :
What if transparent collaboration were a part of web browsers and the web itself ?
What would an extremely integrated network look like , with instant messaging , site creation , and more all integrated into one whole ?
Finally , what would this network look like if despite the integration it was extremely decentralized ?
Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web are one answer to these questions , empowering end users with a powerful suite of collaboration technologies : Instant Site Creation provides one - click production of online sites ;
The Editor is a powerful tool to get work done with others and an answer to what an Internet - centric office suite could look like ; the P2P Mesh makes it possible to transparently provide site creation , storage , naming , and saving with zero end - user hassle ; the Instant Messaging sidebar allows real - time communication with site members while browsing and during co-operative editing ; the Smart Browser technologies standardize navigation tools necessary to make these collaborative sites accessible and organized in a bottom - up , organic process ; and finally , the Two Way Web Directory provides users with a virtual centralized location to search and find sites that match their interests .
Even better , all these components work together to create a system that is more powerful than the sum of its parts .
Once a vision like Paper Airplane is enunciated , however , it is important to not try to build it .
Instead , bits and pieces of it should be taken and drastically simplified , with a strong focus on pragmatism and integration into existing systems .
Ted Nelson 's Xanadu is a cautionary tale of what can happen when someone attempts to build a grand vision ; grand visions are meant to stimulate thinking in new directions , not to be built .
Though this paper is focused on creating a vision that pushes our current technological capabilities , it is useful to ask whether the system could be built today as described .
Significant engineering and social challenges exist in creating the full Paper Airplane and Two Way Web ; peer - to - peer technology is certainly not up to the job of building the kind of P2P Mesh described , and fundamental reliability , security , and performance issues might prevent it from ever being created .
The current web is also quite entrenched , and current trends are towards smaller and lighter web browsers that integrate less features rather than more monolithic , integrated ones .
Some of the metadata features , such as site and page tagging and the Smart Templates , might be susceptible to spamming and gaming .
However , a great deal of very pragmatic systems can fall out of Paper Airplane .
This vision can be sliced and diced into more realistic forms in many different ways that are all quite interesting .
Some possibilities :
Instead of integrating these technologies into the browser , they can be brought into existing server - side Wiki systems using DHTML / Ajax technologies , with the P2P components dropped in favor of conventional client / server systems .
For example , the Navigator and Instant Messenger sidebars can be created with advanced HTML and served - up along side a next - generation Wiki that has a much more powerful editor , similar to the advanced editor described in this paper .
Portions of the Smart Browser can be broken into seperate , small FireFox plugins developed by different people , with simple server - side APIs and standards for how these browser - side Smart Browser widget work with the remote site .
For example , if a Search Smart Browser component is integrated into the browser , remote web sites could implement a simple RESTian or XML - RPC API to be searched in a consistent way by this particular Smart Browser component .
The Paper Airplane Browser component could be maintained , but could be modified to work with centralized hosting services run by Google or Yahoo rather than P2P systems , for example .
In this case users and businesses get a powerful collaboration - focused next - generation web browser , but all the functions that were handled by the P2P system instead happen in the centralized computing cluster maintained by a business .
New APIs to link the browser to the server could be created , or could use WebDAV and Dynamic DNS for the New Site Wizard , automatic domain naming , and editing to maintain portability and fairness when moving between different storage providers .
Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web can act as an end - user research goal for the pure P2P research that is occuring as part of projects like the IRIS ( Infrastructure for Resilient Internet Systems ) NSF program , a very strong end - user product to ground theoretical P2P ideas and provide an easy to understand , visible justification .
Aspects of the P2P network could remain , but might simply augment and enhance the end - user 's experience rather than work to replace the existing web .
For example , if the browser has an Instant Messenger client it could use a spontaneous P2P network between all Paper Airplane Browsers for presence and routing , so that existing client / server web sites do n't have to be changed to support a new standard .
A P2P Mesh can also be an effective way to do DNS - like naming , for example , or act as a kind of secondary cache for automatically BitTorrenting files above a certain size on the existing web , for example .
Simple prototypes of the Two Way Web peer network and the Paper Airplane browser have been created .
An open source implementation of the Two Way Web has been created as a prototype framework named P2P Sockets .
P2P Sockets is also an experiment in creating a P2P network that exposes an API that is familiar to existing programmers , namely the BSD Socket interface .
It also includes higher level ports of software such as web servers , the Java Servlet and JSP APIs , XML - RPC clients and servers , etc. to a P2P network , as well as a simple distributed implementation of the Domain Name System .
A simple browser prototype has also been created to mimic some of the functionality of the Paper Airplane browser .
This prototype is a Mozilla plugin that allows people to easily create collaborative P2P web sites , without setting up servers or spending money .
It does this by integrating a web server into the browser itself , including tools to create collaborative online communities that are stored on the machine .
The sites are stored locally on a user 's machine , and a peer - to - peer network using the P2P Sockets framework is created between all of the Paper Airplane nodes that are running in order to resolve site names and reach normally unreachable peers due to firewalls or NAT devices .
MELBOURNE ( Reuters ) -
An author for the Lonely Planet travel guidebook series has claimed that he plagiarised and made up large sections of his books , an Australian newspaper reported on Sunday .
Author Thomas Kohnstamm told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper he had worked on more than a dozen books for Lonely Planet , including their titles on Brazil , Colombia , the Caribbean , South America , Venezuela and Chile .
The Lonely Planet guidebooks sell more than six million copies a year .
The Sunday Telegraph said Kohnstamm also claims in his new book “ Do Travel Writers Go To Hell ? ” that he accepted free travel , contravening company policy .
He said in one case he had not even visited the country he wrote about .
“ They did n’t pay me enough to go to Colombia .
I wrote the book in San Francisco .
I got the information from a chick I was dating -- an intern at the Colombian consulate , ” the newspaper quoted Kohnstamm as saying .
Lonely Planet said it had reviewed Kohnstamm ’s guidebooks but had not found any inaccuracies in them , the Sunday Telegraph said .

L’important à mes yeux est donc le plaisir procurer par la cigarette electronique : un bon volume de fumée ( ça c’est mon dada ) , une autonomie satisfaisante , un goût agréable …
Il est dommage de voir certaines personnes acheter des modèles bas de gamme qui fonctionnent plus ou moins bien , et qui concluent que la e-cigarette n’est qu’un gadget qui ne marche pas .

Note :
Ce petit guide d'achat est actualisé et mis à jour 3 fois par an afin de suivre l'évolution technologique des différents modèles de cigarette électronique ( dernière MAJ effectuée le jeudi 1er mars 2018 ) .
Voici un petit best - of vidéo avec tous les testeurs du blog ( Auré , Glad , Tim , Pipou , Hed , Dominique , Lolo , Olivier et moi-même ) :
Entre les modèles exclusifs , les génériques , les génériques améliorés , les clones , les copies et les contrefaçons , faire le bon choix n’est pas toujours facile .
Pour bien réussir son entrée dans le monde de laet pour en finir avec le tabac , il est primordial d’et qui procure une entière satisfaction ( volume de fumée , goût , autonomie ) .
En effet , une panne pourrait bêtement entraîner une rechute .
D’une façon générale , il est préférable de s'orienter vers des marques reconnues ( Ecig - Privée , Vap ' Ego , Vapoteuse , Le Petit Vapoteur , etc ... ) et d'éviter les modèles d’origines douteuses .
Regardez également les garanties et le service après-vente ..
Les plus petits ( appelés aussi " minis " ) sont rarement les plus efficaces .
Les modèles jetables que l'on peut trouver dans certains bureaux de tabac sont économiques mais ne vous donneront qu'un très petit aperçu du réel potentiel d'un véritable ecig et offrent des performances très limitées .
C’est donc bien souvent sur le net que l’on trouve les modèles derniers cris qui offrent le maximum de satisfaction .( par ex : les " Tank " , " Ego - like " et les " mods " ) car elles font plus de fumée , possèdent des recharges plus grosses et ont une autonomie plus importante .
De plus , leurs looks un peu éloignés d’une vraie clope permet de ne pas " provoquer " lors d’une utilisation dans les lieux publics .
Enfin , l’arrivée de la technologie du " " apporte un vrai plus en terme de rendu et reste relativement simple d'utilisation pour ceux qui connaissent déjà un peu l'univers de la vape .

Russians cast their votes in parliamentary elections on Sunday , with an overwhelming victory widely expected for Vladimir Putin ’s United Russia Party  and yet we already knew what we were supposed to think of the whole process , with Western governments and media outlets ( or do I repeat myself ? ) having already decided the whole thing was a farce well before a single vote was cast .
How did they know this ?
Well , because Putin is supposedly the reincarnation of Joseph Stalin  in spite of the fact that he has n’t jailed a single person on account of their political opinions , and the Russian gulag has long since disappeared into history .
Yet the accusations against Putin have grown louder , even as Russia grows more prosperous and ordinary Russians are more supportive of their president  and therein lies a tale .
Not since the run-up to war with Iraq has Western media coverage of a country been so completely and unreasonably one - sided : take , for example , this CBS News report .
It features an interview with one Robert Amsterdam , described as " an expert on Russian politics , " who gives his view that the election is just a pro forma exercise in which the outcome is predetermined .
What they somehow neglect to tell you is that Amsterdam , far from being a disinterested " expert , " is in reality a partisan of the jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky  he ’s Khodorkovsky ’s lawyer .
Amsterdam has spent much of the past few years making the case for his client , who is up on charges of embezzlement , fraud , and murder , and whose vast holdings were essentially a gift from the notoriously corrupt regime of Boris Yeltsin , the perpetually drunk Russian leader who died in 2006 .
The crux of Khodorkovsky ’s case against his prosecutors is that they represent an authoritarian state out to get him , and , in the process , re-Sovietize Russian political life as well as the economy .
I wo n’t waste any more words on the infamous oligarch , whose fortune is the result of crony capitalism at its worst rather than laissez - faire , and whose career is best characterized as a cross between Tony Soprano and Wesley Mouch .
You can read all about it here .
Amsterdam is an " expert , " all right  at obfuscating the facts .
He decries a change in the election rules requiring parties represented in parliament to get 7 percent of the vote , up from 5 percent .
Yet the Russian system is far more democratic than , say , the American system , where a party that gets 7 percent  or even 10 or 20 percent  is by no means guaranteed a single seat in Congress .
That is , if they even manage to get on the ballot .
Parties other than the state - sanctioned and state - subsidized Democrats and Republicans face almost impossible hurdles to achieve ballot status  and , even if they do , these " third " parties operate at a tremendous disadvantage not only legally , but in terms of being taken seriously by the " mainstream " media .
Is this any better than in Russia ?
One could make a convincing case that it is far worse .
The CBS report shows footage of an opposition demonstration supposedly being " broken up " by the Russian cops .
What our intrepid reporters fail to mention , however , is that the demonstrators were given a permit to hold a rally , but instead insisted on marching through the streets  a course that , in , say , security - conscious Washington , D.C. , would earn them a few nightstick blows on the head and at least one day in jail .
A breakaway march was led by members of the neo- fascist National Bolshevik Party ( NBP ) , whose crazed leader , Eduard Limonov , addressed the crowd alongside more " respectable " opposition figures such as chess champion Gary Kasparov .
Both were arrested when they followed the violence - prone NBP on a mad run through the streets .
Kasparov is lionized in the West , yet in Russia he is considered a marginal figure , partially on account of his association with the " Other Russia " grouping , which is essentially controlled by the lunatic NBP .
The reality is that Putin is wildly popular , which Amsterdam is forced to admit even as he spins this against the contention of an alleged " crackdown " on the opposition by claiming that the election is all about " legitimacy . "
Putin , it seems , is determined to cement his unchallenged authority by racking up a huge majority .
According to Deutsche Welle , the plan is for Putin  constitutionally constrained against running for a third term as president  to reappear in some other office , where he will run the show from behind the scenes .
The Western powers  who hate and revile the revival of Russia ’s fortunes  are determined to delegitimize not only Putin , but the Putin - era prosperity and stability that is the source of the Russian president ’s enormous popularity .
Under the Yeltsin regime , the oligarchs were free to loot and otherwise abuse the Russian economy , with former Communists who used their political connections to amass obscene wealth draining the nation ’s lifeblood like a flock of vampires on the hunt .
The jailbird Khodorkovsky is one , and another is the infamous Boris Berezovsky , who has declared his intention to overthrow the Russian government  by force if necessary  and who is financing much of the opposition , both in country and in exile .
Berezovsky  wanted in Russia on charges of theft , extortion , and murder  was the patron of Alexander Litvinenko , the former KGB agent turned anti-Putin activist supposedly poisoned by the Russian secret service using an exotic and scary radioactive substance .
This case caused a sensation in Britain , where Litvinenko succumbed , yet questions remain about the real cause of his death .
I ’ve covered it in this space , in depth , here , here , here , and here .
Suffice to say that the semi-official story  Litvinenko was killed by the neo-Stalinists in the Kremlin , much like Trotsky was found with an icepick in his head  is in considerable doubt , as evidence emerges that he may have been part of a smuggling ring that secreted radioactive polonium into Britain .
Now more evidence that the mainstream media narrative of Litvinenko - the - martyr is very far from the truth is coming out , with Britain ’s Daily Mail revealing for the first time what everyone in Russia has been saying since the case broke :
" The former Russian spy poisoned in a London hotel was an MI6 agent , the Daily Mail can reveal .
Alexander Litvinenko was receiving a retainer of around £ 2,000 a month from the British security services at the time he was murdered . "
Citing " diplomatic and intelligence sources , " the paper goes on to aver that this was the real reason for Litvinenko ’s alleged assassination .
By leaking what we all knew to be true in any event , the spooks behind the departed spy have managed to divert attention away from the more likely death - by - self - contamination scenario  in which the polonium poisoning is due to a botched smuggling operation  and back in the direction of a plot directed or implicitly sanctioned by Putin .
Very slick  as the entire anti-Putin propaganda campaign has been from the beginning .
The real purpose behind the anti-Putin campaign  which , at its most frenetic , is designed to convince us that the Russians are coming once again , posing the dire prospect of a reborn Soviet threat  is to topple a leader who challenges American hegemony in the world .
The Russian president wo n’t go along with the American plan to " transform " the Middle East into a " democratic " pile of rubble , nor will he countenance " regime change " on his periphery , helped along by generous dollops of U.S. tax dollars and the enmity of George Soros .
If Kosovo is to be independent , he avers , well then , why not Abkhazia , or Ossetia , or any of the other Russia - friendly breakaway republics with close ties to the Motherland ?
Putin is no saint , but neither is he the devil depicted in the Western media , which regularly presents such representatives of the exiled Russian oligarchs as Mr. Amsterdam and Boris Berezovsky as credible critics and misses no opportunity to portray Putin as a " dictator . "
The Russian media is neither state - owned nor is it more concentrated in terms of ownership than our own : it is about as friendly to the opposition as America ’s mainstream media is to , say , Ron Paul .
Opposition parties , including the Communist Party of Russia , exist and are free to organize , stand for election , publish materials , and conduct campaigns , including the distribution of propaganda .
What they are not allowed to do any longer is accept subsidies from foreign governments and other overseas entities , such as the National Endowment for Democracy , USAID ( a U.S. - government - funded propaganda agency ) , and any one of a number of Berezovsky - supported - and - funded front groups , including Western - based " support groups " for Chechen terrorists .
This " restriction " on foreign funding  which is also the law in the U.S.  has the U.S. - government - supported opposition in a tizzy , because it has hit them where they really live  in their pocketbooks .
No longer on the take , these " dissidents " on the make are furiously denouncing Putin ’s government as a " dictatorship . "
Yet Russia has n’t been this free since the overthrow of the Kerensky government and the Communist coup of 1917 , and it has n’t been this prosperous ever .
Luxuriating in oil and national gas reserves that may be among the biggest in the world , the Russians are coming out of their long post - Soviet funk  and reasserting their place on the world stage .
That is Putin ’s real " crime . "
He is making Washington very nervous , as the would - be hegemonists of the West eye the emerging Russo - Iranian alliance and chafe as Putin arms the Syrians with missile defenses against the increasing likelihood of an Israeli ( or American ) attack .
And it is n’t just his actions but his words that sting .
In a widely quoted speech at a recent Munich Security Conference , the Russian president took on the Americans quite openly :
" It [ the U.S. - dominated unipolar world ] is a world in which there is one master , one sovereign .
And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system , but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within .
" And this certainly has nothing in common with democracy .
Because , as you know , democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority .
" Incidentally , Russia  we  are constantly being taught about democracy .
But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves . "
I especially appreciate that bit about how the hubris of our rulers " destroys itself from within "  this is precisely what the domestic critics of the rising American Empire have been saying for years , and it ’s gratifying to see that America ’s true friends abroad see this , too .
To anyone who admires the U.S. and is not the captive of a crude " anti-Americanism "  a woefully overworked catch phrase that has been shamelessly utilized by our government and its overseas amen corner to smear anyone who opposes American imperialism  it is no doubt sad , indeed , to witness the sight of the freest country on earth succumbing to its own worst instincts .
Putin is n’t insulting us : he ’s reminding us of who we are  or , rather , who we used to be .
Unfortunately , the interventionists in the media , and the War Party that has hijacked American foreign policy , are not inclined to listen , either to Putin or those here at home who agree that America is getting too big for its britches .
What are we doing getting in Putin ’s face , insulting him and his people by insisting that the OSCE send " observers " to make sure Russia ’s election is sufficiently " democratic " ?
What would we have thought if Putin had sent observers to , say , Florida , where the drama of the " hanging chads " and the intricacies of the Electoral College denied the White House to the candidate who got the most votes ?
It ’s outrageous  especially when we ’re giving full military , political , and diplomatic support to real dictators like Egypt ’s Hosni Mubarak , who is now in the process of setting up a hereditary " presidency " and has taken to locking up bloggers for violating political and cultural " norms . "
And what about Gen. Pervez Musharraf , who is beating the crap out of his opponents in the streets of Islamabad , arresting the Supreme Court , and installing himself as " president " of Pakistan in a procedure that is a cruel mockery of democracy ?
The difference is that these dictators meet the " pro-American " test , which consists of kowtowing to Washington when it comes to the conduct of foreign affairs , and particularly when it comes to providing full access to American economic and military interests .
In the case of Russia , the Americans and especially the British are still smarting over the expulsion of Western companies from the lucrative Russian oil and natural gas fields , which is going to benefit the people of Russia rather than overseas investors and the usual gang of ruthless Russian oligarchs , who are little more than gangsters in business suits .
Russia for the Russians  the slogan has energized the pro-Putin parties and given the Russian president more power and prestige than any Moscow - based ruler since Peter the Great .
It ’s also a sentiment Western elites can’t and wo n’t abide , since they consider Russia to have been properly defeated in the Cold War and therefore fair game for economic colonization .
Their reaction to Putin ’s pushback has been an aggressive campaign to encircle Russia , starting with the ill - fated " Rose Revolution " in Georgia , followed by the various Western - engineered attempts at " regime change " represented by the so - called " color revolutions , " from Ukraine to Kyrgyzstan , nearly all of which have since been rolled back .
The neoconservatives were early agitators for a more aggressive stance toward Russia : it was Richard Perle , you ’ll recall , who led a neocon hue and cry over Putin ’s alleged misdeeds , calling for Russia to be thrown out of the G - 8 .
This was soon followed up by a full - scale denunciation of Putin by none other than Dick Cheney , who railed that the Russian president was ushering in a new Cold War by engaging in economic " blackmail " and " intimidation " against its neighbors .
This attack was occasioned by the freeing up of Russian energy prices , which had long been kept artificially low by government decree : apparently , this move toward a free market in energy was considered a hostile act by Cheney and his fellow " big government conservatives . "
As for Kasparov , the wannabe dissident who should ’ve stuck to chess has links to the neoconservative Center for Security Policy , whose chieftain and founder , Frank Gaffney , is among the more frothy - mouthed warmongers in Washington .
Another anti-Putin group with suspiciously heavy concentrations of neocons on the letterhead is the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya , which supports the terrorist gang that pulled off the Beslan horror and bombed Russian cities .
( If you ’re a confirmed Putin - hater , however , you ’ll already know that it was n’t the Chechens who kidnapped those school kids at Beslan and planted those bombs , it was Putin who did it .
Litvinenko wrote an entire book that blames the Federal Security Bureau , successor to the KGB , much like the 9/11 Troothers blame " Bushitler " for the 9/11 terrorist attacks  the Russian Troothers , such as Litvinenko and Berezovsky , claim terrorist acts carried out by Chechen rebels were an " inside job . " )
The really dangerous aspect of the looming renewal of tensions with Russia is that Democrats , too , are eager to get in on the Russophobic act .
It is n’t just Cheney , Perle , Gaffney , and the Weekly Standard railing against " Putinism , " it ’s the ostensible liberals , including Hillary Clinton , who are taking a hard line toward Russia .
With the Clinton Restoration , we can expect to see more U.S. troops in Kosovo facing down the Russian - supported Serbs , who  thanks to the Clintons  have almost been ethnically cleansed out of existence in the former Yugoslav province .
The neocon palaver about " democracy " is especially attractive to liberals of the Clintonian school , who bewail Putin ’s alleged " authoritarian " tendencies and yet have no trouble with Hillary ’s own stated hostility to the free flow of ideas and news on the Internet .
When it comes to foreign policy , these same " liberal " types have no qualms about voting for a neocon- inspired war in the Middle East and would just as soon nuke the Iranians in " defense " of Israel .
With Putin standing behind the Iranian drive to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the return of the Clintons will mean the return of the Cold War with Russia  and perhaps a distinct reheating of the conflict in the Balkans , where the last great Clintonian intervention murdered some 5,000 Serbs and rained bombs on some of the oldest cities in Europe .
Russia is not our enemy , and there is no reason to make an adversary of Putin .
He is clearly an admirer of the American system and , in his drive to modernize , is clearly emulating the Western example , albeit in his own distinctly Slavic manner .
Putin , in short , is no anti-American , like Hugo Chavez , although some well - meaning but shortsighted libertarians would liken the two .
Yet the alleged " Sovietization " of Russia is nothing of the sort .
Putin ’s " personality cult " is no more cultish than that of the Clintons or Obama .
Our culture of celebrity virtually ensures that a cult of personality arises around any successful politician , because , after all , American electoral politics is all about personalities , not policies .
Chavez is a commie who cavorts with Fidel Castro and proclaims the " Bolivarian " road to socialism , with his opposition centered in the middle class and anti-authoritarian students .
Putin ’s chief opposition , on the other hand , is the Russian Communist Party , which rails against his halting moves toward the market and joins with Kasparov and the NBP - led " Other Russia " coalition in characterizing Putin as a dictator .
Our national interest lies not in making enemies of the Russian people and the present Russian government .
Putin is n’t a Jeffersonian democrat , but neither is he a Stalinist .
He ’s simply a nationalist who is steering his country though a difficult time .
In his absence Russia would revert to the domination of gangsters and ex-commie " entrepreneurs " whose ill - gotten gains are currently feeding the Russian opposition abroad .
All too often , our Western media allows itself to be used by these dubious characters , in unfairly portraying as " authoritarian " and " neo- Soviet " a Russia that is slowly but surely climbing out of the graveyard of socialism .
The reality is much more complex .
Is Russia democratic ?
Yes , but the nature of the regime is irrelevant to the question of what our policy toward Moscow ought to be .
Even if Russia should really begin to backslide into authoritarianism , as Western commentators like to put it , we will not benefit from trying to engineer regime change or otherwise interfering in Russia ’s internal affairs  and neither , in the long run , will the Russian people .
Even given all Putin ’s faults , however , the Russia of today represents a tremendous advance over the dark days of the Bolshevik horror : seen in perspective  that is , since 1917  Putin ’s Russia is a vast improvement , both for the people of Russia and our own national interest .
Our intervention can only hurt the future of the Russian people and encourage a nationalist backlash we will live to regret .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I gave a speech at the University of Berkeley recently : check it out here .
“ We need to ask ourselves this question : ‘ Where do we put our faith and trust ?
In the words of scientists who do n’t know everything , who were not there ?
Or in the Word of God — the God who does know everything — and who was there ? ' ” — Ken Ham , “ Were You There ? ”
I ’ve been reading this stomach - turning story about young - earth creationists taking groups of children on tours of real museums , using the exhibits and displays of real science in the service of lies .
This is n’t the first time this has happened .
Enemies of science like Ken Ham have raised child - brainwashing to a fine art , drilling their young devotees in the art of mindlessly reciting creationist talking points :
Evangelist Ken Ham smiled at the 2,300 elementary students packed into pews , their faces rapt .
With dinosaur puppets and silly cartoons , he was training them to reject much of geology , paleontology and evolutionary biology as a sinister tangle of lies .
“ Boys and girls , ” Ham said .
If a teacher so much as mentions evolution , or the Big Bang , or an era when dinosaurs ruled the Earth , “ you put your hand up and you say , ‘ Excuse me , were you there ? ’
Can you remember that ? ”
I have nothing but sympathy for the children whose minds are being poisoned by this evil ignorance .
Sadly , many of them will grow up into adults who will carry these tactics forward to the next generation .
I routinely get e-mail from creationists using the same “ Were you there ? ” ploy , apparently thinking it ’s a stumper question .
The distinction which creationists seek to create between present and past events is an artificial one that does not exist in reality .
Events that happened in the past and were not directly observed can be scientifically verified .
We do it the same way we scientifically verify a claim about a present event : derive testable predictions and go check whether the evidence supports them .
Here ’s a simple example which I routinely use when creationists ask me this .
A man claims he is innocent of murder .
There were no witnesses to the crime .
However , at the crime scene , we find fingerprints on the murder weapon which match that man ’s fingers , genetic traces under the victim ’s fingernails which match his DNA , bite marks on the body which match his teeth , and bloody bootprints which match his shoes .
Is the question of this man ’s guilt or innocence beyond scientific verification , just because the crime was not directly observed ?
The same principle applies with evolution .
We do not directly witness the past , but we can reconstruct the course of events by examining the traces they leave behind .
We date rock layers using radiometric dating and other methods ; embedded in those layers , we find fossils which display varying characteristics .
We can relate those fossils to earlier or later fossils , as well as species living today , and observe how they have changed over time .
From the hypothesis of descent with modification , we derive further predictions ( such as the existence of vestigial structures , or shared molecular errors forming nested hierarchies ) which we can test in living things .
There is no basis for this bizarre belief that the only way to know how something happened is to directly observe it .
If anything , empirical evidence of the past is more reliable than eyewitness testimony .
It is amply documented that human beings routinely exaggerate , misremember , confabulate , and lie .
Physical evidence of the past is not distorted by deception , by the limits of human imagination , or by the tricks that memory plays .
The creationist argument fatally undermines itself .
Creationists like Ham say that , since no human was there when the Earth was created , we can’t really know what happened and must rely on the words of God , who supposedly was there .
But how do we know God was there ?
After all , we were n’t there !
Creationists who say the Bible is infallible were n’t there to see it written , so how do they know who wrote it ?
How do they know it was written by someone with any knowledge of the events it relates ?
What the creationist argument comes down to is that we should believe one set of claims about the past rather than another , based on nothing but their unsupported say - so .
This assertion is really just the aura of infallibility in a different form .
April 2008
( This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School . )
About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the phrase that became our motto :
Make something people want .
We 've learned a lot since then , but if I were choosing now that 's still the one I 'd pick .
Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the business model , at least at first .
Not because making money is unimportant , but because it 's so much easier than building something great .
A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas together , you get something surprising .
Make something people want .
Do n't worry too much about making money .
What you 've got is a description of a charity .
When you get an unexpected result like this , it could either be a bug or a new discovery .
Either businesses are n't supposed to be like charities , and we 've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one or both of the principles we began with is false .
Or we have a new idea .
I suspect it 's the latter , because as soon as this thought occurred to me , a whole bunch of other things fell into place .
Examples
For example , Craigslist .
It 's not a charity , but they run it like one .
And they 're astoundingly successful .
When you scan down the list of most popular web sites , the number of employees at Craigslist looks like a misprint .
Their revenues are n't as high as they could be , but most startups would be happy to trade places with them .
In Patrick O'Brian 's novels , his captains always try to get upwind of their opponents .
If you 're upwind , you decide when and if to engage the other ship .
Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous revenues .
They 'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more , but not the sort you face when you 're tacking upwind , trying to force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times as much on sales as on development . [ 1 ]
I 'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist .
They 're a product of unusual circumstances .
But they 're a good model for the early phases .
Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning .
They did n't have ads for over a year .
At year 1 , Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit .
If a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web , Google at year 1 is the limit of what they 'd have produced .
Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a good idea to have a web - based email service with good spam filtering .
I was n't thinking of it as a company .
I just wanted to keep people from getting spammed .
But as I thought more about this project , I realized it would probably have to be a company .
It would cost something to run , and it would be a pain to fund with grants and donations .
That was a surprising realization .
Companies often claim to be benevolent , but it was surprising to realize there were purely benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work .
I did n't want to start another company , so I did n't do it .
But if someone had , they 'd probably be quite rich now .
There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big email services had terrible filters .
If someone had launched a new , spam - free mail service , users would have flocked to it .
Notice the pattern here ?
From either direction we get to the same spot .
If you start from successful startups , you find they often behaved like nonprofits .
And if you start from ideas for nonprofits , you find they 'd often make good startups .
Power
How wide is this territory ?
Would all good nonprofits be good companies ?
Possibly not .
What makes Google so valuable is that their users have money .
If you make people with money love you , you can probably get some of it .
But could you also base a successful startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who do n't have money ?
Could you , for example , grow a successful startup out of curing an unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria ?
I 'm not sure , but I suspect that if you pushed this idea , you 'd be surprised how far it would go .
For example , people who apply to Y Combinator do n't generally have much money , and yet we can profit by helping them , because with our help they could make money .
Maybe the situation is similar with malaria .
Maybe an organization that helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting growth .
I 'm not proposing this is a serious idea .
I do n't know anything about malaria .
But I 've been kicking ideas around long enough to know when I come across a powerful one .
One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what point you 'd bet against it .
The thought of betting against benevolence is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically impossible .
You 're just asking to be made a fool of , because these are such powerful forces . [ 2 ]
For example , initially I thought maybe this principle only applied to Internet startups .
Obviously it worked for Google , but what about Microsoft ?
Surely Microsoft is n't benevolent ?
But when I think back to the beginning , they were .
Compared to IBM they were like Robin Hood .
When IBM introduced the PC , they thought they were going to make money selling hardware at high prices .
But by gaining control of the PC standard , Microsoft opened up the market to any manufacturer .
Hardware prices plummeted , and lots of people got to have computers who could n't otherwise have afforded them .
It 's the sort of thing you 'd expect Google to do .
Microsoft is n't so benevolent now .
Now when one thinks of what Microsoft does to users , all the verbs that come to mind begin with F. [ 3 ]
And yet it does n't seem to pay .
Their stock price has been flat for years .
Back when they were Robin Hood , their stock price rose like Google's .
Could there be a connection ?
You can see how there would be .
When you 're small , you can't bully customers , so you have to charm them .
Whereas when you 're big you can maltreat them at will , and you tend to , because it 's easier than satisfying them .
You grow big by being nice , but you can stay big by being mean .
You get away with it till the underlying conditions change , and then all your victims escape .
So " Do n't be evil " may be the most valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google , because it may turn out to be an elixir of corporate youth .
I 'm sure they find it constraining , but think how valuable it will be if it saves them from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and IBM .
The curious thing is , this elixir is freely available to any other company .
Anyone can adopt " Do n't be evil . "
The catch is that people will hold you to it .
So I do n't think you 're going to see record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery .
Morale
There 's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works .
But how does it work ?
One advantage of investing in a large number of startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work .
From what we 've seen , being good seems to help startups in three ways : it improves their morale , it makes other people want to help them , and above all , it helps them be decisive .
Morale is tremendously important to a startup — so important that morale alone is almost enough to determine success .
Startups are often described as emotional roller - coasters .
One minute you 're going to take over the world , and the next you 're doomed .
The problem with feeling you 're doomed is not just that it makes you unhappy , but that it makes you stop working .
So the downhills of the roller - coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than the uphills .
If feeling you 're going to succeed makes you work harder , that probably improves your chances of succeeding , but if feeling you 're going to fail makes you stop working , that practically guarantees you 'll fail .
Here 's where benevolence comes in .
If you feel you 're really helping people , you 'll keep working even when it seems like your startup is doomed .
Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence .
The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them .
So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day , you 've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi .
You 've made something you need to take care of .
Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really low lows and survived .
At one point they ran out of money and everyone left .
Evan Williams came in to work the next day , and there was no one but him .
What kept him going ?
Partly that users needed him .
He was hosting thousands of people 's blogs .
He could n't just let the site die .
There are many advantages of launching quickly , but the most important may be that once you have users , the tamagotchi effect kicks in .
Once you have users to take care of , you 're forced to figure out what will make them happy , and that 's actually very valuable information .
The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can also help you with investors .
One of the founders of Chatterous told me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service was something the world needed , so they were going to keep working on it no matter what , even if they had to move back to Canada and live in their parents ' basements .
Once they realized this , they stopped caring so much what investors thought about them .
They still met with them , but they were n't going to die if they did n't get their money .
And you know what ?
The investors got a lot more interested .
They could sense that the Chatterouses were going to do this startup with or without them .
If you 're really committed and your startup is cheap to run , you become very hard to kill .
And practically all startups , even the most successful , come close to death at some point .
So if doing good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder to kill , that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by not choosing a more selfish project .
Help
Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want to help you .
This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans .
One of the startups we 've funded , Octopart , is currently locked in a classic battle of good versus evil .
They 're a search site for industrial components .
A lot of people need to search for components , and before Octopart there was no good way to do it .
That , it turned out , was no coincidence .
Octopart built the right way to search for components .
Users like it and they 've been growing rapidly .
And yet for most of Octopart 's life , the biggest distributor , Digi - Key , has been trying to force them take their prices off the site .
Octopart is sending them customers for free , and yet Digi - Key is trying to make that traffic stop .
Why ?
Because their current business model depends on overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices .
They do n't want search to work .
The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world .
They dropped out of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this .
They just wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research .
Imagine how much time you could save the world 's engineers if they could do searches online .
So when I hear that a big , evil company is trying to stop them in order to keep search broken , it makes me really want to help them .
It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts than I do with most of the other startups we 've funded .
It just made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are .
Why ?
Because they 're good guys and they 're trying to help the world .
If you 're benevolent , people will rally around you : investors , customers , other companies , and potential employees .
In the long term the most important may be the potential employees .
I think everyone knows now that good hackers are much better than mediocre ones .
If you can attract the best hackers to work for you , as Google has , you have a big advantage .
And the very best hackers tend to be idealistic .
They 're not desperate for a job .
They can work wherever they want .
So most want to work on things that will make the world better .
Compass
But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as a compass .
One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you have so many choices .
There are just two or three of you , and a thousand things you could do .
How do you decide ?
Here 's the answer :
Do whatever 's best for your users .
You can hold onto this like a rope in a hurricane , and it will save you if anything can .
Follow it and it will take you through everything you need to do .
It 's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated , like how to convince investors to give you money .
If you 're a good salesman , you could try to just talk them into it .
But the more reliable route is to convince them through your users : if you make something users love enough to tell their friends , you grow exponentially , and that will convince any investor .
Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions in complex situations because it 's stateless .
It 's like telling the truth .
The trouble with lying is that you have to remember everything you 've said in the past to make sure you do n't contradict yourself .
If you tell the truth you do n't have to remember anything , and that 's a really useful property in domains where things happen fast .
For example , Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups , 57 of which are still alive .
( The rest have died or merged or been acquired . )
When you 're trying to advise 57 startups , it turns out you have to have a stateless algorithm .
You can't have ulterior motives when you have 57 things going on at once , because you can't remember them .
So our rule is just to do whatever 's best for the founders .
Not because we 're particularly benevolent , but because it 's the only algorithm that works on that scale .
When you write something telling people to be good , you seem to be claiming to be good yourself .
So I want to say explicitly that I am not a particularly good person .
When I was a kid I was firmly in the camp of bad .
The way adults used the word good , it seemed to be synonymous with quiet , so I grew up very suspicious of it .
You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation and everyone says " He 's such a great guy ? "
People never say that about me .
The best I get is " he means well . "
I am not claiming to be good .
At best I speak good as a second language .
So I 'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way .
I 'm suggesting it because it works .
It will work not just as a statement of " values , " but as a guide to strategy , and even a design spec for software .
Do n't just not be evil .
Be good .
Notes
[ 1 ] Fifty years ago it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay dividends .
Now many tech companies do n't .
The markets seem to have figured out how to value potential dividends .
Maybe that is n't the last step in this evolution .
Maybe markets will eventually get comfortable with potential earnings .
( VCs already are , and at least some of them consistently make money . )
I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the " new economy " during the Bubble .
Believe me , I was not drinking that kool - aid at the time .
But I 'm convinced there were some good ideas buried in Bubble thinking .
For example , it 's ok to focus on growth instead of profits — but only if the growth is genuine .
You can't be buying users ; that 's a pyramid scheme .
But a company with rapid , genuine growth is valuable , and eventually markets learn how to value valuable things .
[ 2 ] The idea of starting a company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued , because the kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal do n't usually do a very good job .
It 's one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start some vaguely benevolent business .
The problem with most of them is that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly executed .
The trustafarians ' ancestors did n't get rich by preserving their traditional culture ; maybe people in Bolivia do n't want to either .
And starting an organic farm , though it's at least straightforwardly benevolent , does n't help people on the scale that Google does .
Most explicitly benevolent projects do n't hold themselves sufficiently accountable .
They act as if having good intentions were enough to guarantee good effects .
[ 3 ] Users dislike their new operating system so much that they 're starting petitions to save the old one .
And the old one was nothing special .
The hackers within Microsoft must know in their hearts that if the company really cared about users they 'd just advise them to switch to OSX .

Although Intel 's mighty proud of the Core 2 Duo , it looks like the chip was n't all home - grown -- a lawsuit filed today by the University of Wisconsin claims that the processor infringes on patented technology developed by one of its professors .
Back in 1998 , CS department chair Gurindar Sohi presented some of his developments relating to instruction level parallelism to Intel and offered to license them , but got nowhere -- yet the same tech is in the Core 2 Duo , according to the lawsuit .
For its part , Intel says it 's been talking to the Badgers for over a year now , and that it has n't evaluated the complaint -- which it might want to do in short order , since UW 's asking for the court to halt shipments of the Core 2 Duo in addition to monetary damages and legal fees .

Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) speaks during a campaign stop at the Gamesa Wind Corporation in Fairless Hills , Pennsylvania , March 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Keith Bedford
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sen. Barack Obama won the Mississippi contest to choose a Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday , his second victory since a pair of big - state losses kept him from knocking rival Hillary Clinton out of the race , U.S. media projected .
The Mississippi victory added to Obama ’s lead over Clinton but left him far short of being able to clinch the nomination to run against Republican John McCain in the November general election .
Obama and Clinton are now focused on the big contest in Pennsylvania on April 22 .
A former Metropolitan police detective has been arrested over the murder of a man whose death he himself investigated .
The arrest was one of six made today in connection with one of Britain 's most controversial and high - profile unsolved killings .
Five men were arrested on suspicion of the murder of Daniel Morgan , a 37 - year - old private eye who was found dead with an axe in his head in a south London pub car park in 1987 .
A sixth man , a serving Met police officer , was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office .
The latest arrests , which result from a fifth investigation into the killing , are partly the result of witnesses - some from the criminal underworld - coming forward with statements after many years .
It is understood recent advances in DNA and changes in the law regarding the giving of evidence against fellow criminals have played a part in the inquiry .
Sid Fillery , 61 , a former detective sergeant attached to Catford police station , in south London , who is now believed to be involved in running a pub on the Norfolk Broads , was arrested today in connection with the murder .
Jonathan Rees , 53 , a freelance investigator and Morgan 's former partner , was also believed to be held .
The others arrested were understood to be Jimmy Cook , 53 , Glenn Vian , 49 , and Garry Vian , 47 , all of south London .
A 24 - year - old serving Metropolitan police constable was arrested over allegations of misconduct in a public office .
The men were arrested when they answered bail at Charing Cross police station or attended by appointment .
The police constable , who was not named , was arrested at his place of work .
He has been suspended pending the investigation .
The murdered man 's brother , Alastair Morgan , who has fought tirelessly for more than two decades to have the case brought to justice , welcomed the news .
" This has been an extremely long and arduous battle for my family but we hope that this will perhaps be the beginning of the end , " he said .
The latest investigation , headed by Assistant Commissioner John Yates , had a team of 36 working re-examining tens of thousands of pages of statements from the original inquiries .
It was relaunched three years ago and located in a different building from Scotland Yard to avoid any suggestion of impropriety because of allegations of police corruption from the start of the case .
Police are still seeking other witnesses and a £ 50,000 reward remains on offer .
" It has been over 21 years since Daniel 's murder , " Yates said today .
" Since that tragic event there have been numerous investigations into his death none of which have been able to establish who was responsible .
" The one consistent theme throughout has been the astonishing determination of the Morgan family to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice .
The current investigation has shown that there are still people out there who have highly pertinent evidence about this case .
The arrests today demonstrate the Met 's continued determination to bring those responsible to justice . "
Yates added : " I also hope that these arrests are a reassurance to those in the community who also have information or evidence about what happened to Daniel .
We have long said that within south London the identity of those responsible for the murder is one of the worst kept local secrets .
I urge anyone with any information , however small , to get in touch with us . "
Daniel Morgan , the son of an army officer , studied agriculture and then worked as a salesman in Denmark and as a travel courier before joining a detective agency .
He set up his own company , Southern Investigations , in 1984 with Rees .
He had a number of successes in the field , tracking down an international fraudster for the Bank of Australia , for instance , and his company was financially successful : he owned a BMW , an Austin Healey 3000 – which two decades later was to play a part in the re-investigation – and a Jaguar .
He was married with two children , now both grown up .
Rees had close contacts with the local police and his colleagues believed he wanted to be a policeman himself .
Morgan was unhappy about the closeness of some of those relations and at the direction the work was taking .
At the time of his death , it is believed Morgan was about to expose a south London drugs network , possibly involving corrupt police officers .
Tension between Morgan and Rees heightened over a Southern Investigations contract with the local Belmont car auction in Charlton , whose takings the firm had responsibility for depositing .
In early 1987 , Rees claimed to have been robbed of £ 18,000 of the takings , but Morgan had doubts about whether such a robbery had taken place .
There were also said to be tensions between the two men over a woman they both knew .
On March 10 , Morgan agreed to meet Rees at the Golden Lion in Sydenham , not their regular local but one that happened to be inside the Catford police area where friends of Rees worked .
After the meeting , Morgan went outside to the pub's car park where he was struck on the back of the head with an axe and killed .
The axe , which had been bound with sticking plaster to avoid its bearer leaving fingerprints , was left embedded in his head .
His £ 800 Rolex watch was missing but £ 1,100 was in his pocket , from which DNA traces have been found .
At the inquest , Rees suggested Morgan had made passes at the wives of clients and that there might be a motive for murder there .
There were also tales that he had been watching Colombian cocaine dealers on behalf of a public figure whose daughter had become addicted .
Detectives now believe that the real motive for the murder was a culmination of a number of factors .
On the original investigating team was Detective Sergeant Sid Fillery , a close friend of Rees who moonlighted for Southern Investigations and , after leaving the police , joined the firm .
He did not initially declare his relationship with Rees .
The first investigation petered out and by the time Morgan 's body was finally released for burial in August 1988 , there had been no arrests .
Had it not been for Morgan 's brother and mother , the case might have been logged as one of Scotland Yard 's unsolved murders .
But Alastair Morgan has been dogged in his pursuit of the case , lobbying politicians and police officers even when it seemed the case was closed .
After his first intervention , the Police Complaints Authority - now the IPCC - asked Hampshire police to reinvestigate .
Three people were arrested in 1989 , but charges were dropped .
Two police officers who were arrested in connection with the inquiry have since been completely vindicated and there is no suggestion they were involved in any way .
The investigation is the first in which the Met police used the Serious and Organised Crime and Police Act ( Socpa ) of 2005 which provides a framework through which people can turn Queen 's evidence against co-conspirators and other criminals .
Osama bin Laden 's chief deputy in an audiotape Tuesday accused Shiite Iran of trying to discredit the Sunni al - Qaida terror network by spreading the conspiracy theory that Israel was behind the Sept. 11 attacks .
" The purpose of this lie is clear — ( to suggest ) that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no else did in history .
Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it , " he said .
itching
They just do n't give a fuck !
Bin Laden was , though , a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies .
Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan .
Al - Qaida , literally " the database " , was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians .
Inexplicably , and with disastrous consequences , it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way , Bin Laden 's organisation would turn its attention to the west .
anybody
Pants !
D-
F
real
You blow up a bus in Whogivesafuckistan ?
You 're a terrorist .
You overthrow a legitimate government and replace it with a puppet government that proceeds to butcher 500,000 of its own people ?
You 're a hero .
Here 's your medal .
The Onion has a pretty good track record of not only reporting the news before it happens , but making it funny , too .
They 've been eerily prescient before , but sometimes I forget just how good these guys are !
Just last month I posted a hilarious Onion TV video that featured a supposed al - Qaeda operative arguing with a 9/11 Truther .
The video works on many levels , but for me it was funny because the al - Qaeda guy is so obviously spewing Bush administration talking points and desperately trying to claim credit for something clearly beyond their capabilities .
He even brings a receipt for flight lessons and brags about his connections to the White House : " Me and Bush , we go out , we hang .
" The idea of al - Qaeda stepping up to defend the Bush administration 's version of events on 9/11 is pretty hilarious , but come on !
That 's just over the top , right ?
It was a good chuckle and then we all moved on .
Apparently somebody thought this was n't funny enough in fiction so al - Qaeda has made it real !
Just sit back and soak that in .
I did n't make up that quote , amazingly .
One enemy of the U.S. / Israel accusing the other of understating the first 's evil is funny enough , but this treads onto satire when al - Zawahri says blaming Israel makes Muslims look stupid !
Haha !!
This is straight out of the Bush regime 's racist playbook .
Look at the implication : Muslims can be heroes only if they 're terrorists !
Only a moron or a stooge would admit such a thing about his own people .
Sunni or Shi'ite , you 'd think Zawahri would try to unify the sects against the Zionists , but instead he plays right into the Bush regime 's hands by simultaneously defaming Muslims everywhere ( as if every Muslim is justfor a chance to blow himself up ! ) and sowing divisiveness amongst his people at the same time .
Zawahiri is either a tactical moron or a CIA stooge .
Could he actually expect to sway Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with this argument ?
Ahmadinejad may be an idiot , a tool and a loudmouth , but he is not a terrorist or a dictator .
He is like Putin , a strongman that the people have turned to in order to provide a hedge against U.S. imperialism .
Ahmadinejad knows , like Putin , that the 9/11 attacks were self - inflicted in order to provide a pretext for Bush 's endless wars of conquest ( and embarrassment ) .
Heck , even our allies in Japan are starting to question the events of that day .
In retrospect it looks like an incredible boon to an administration that has done nothing but evil with the goodwill generated worldwide in response to the tragedy .
Many people say the Bush administration is too incompetent to pull off the attacks and subsequent coverup , but I say al - Qaeda is too incompetent to do ... much of anything !
Call the Bush team what you will , but they are masters at manipulation and misdirection .
They managed to steal two elections and they orchestrated an incredible propaganda campaign to trick the nation into war with Iraq .
I remember watching the news back in early 2003 thinking I was living in an endless Twilight Zone episode .
And what happened to the treasonous military men , the lying pundits and the architects of this atrocity ?
Well they 're mostly still around and many of them have been promoted !
People need to realize that the Bush administration is n't incompetent when it comes to stuff like Katrina : ...
There 's a difference .
They look after their own , not a bunch of poor folks who do n't vote Republican anyway .
Al - Qaeda is a CIA - sponsored group whose only role is to draw attention away from the real terrorists .
This is common knowledge among the elite , although some still cling to a twisted sort of incompetence theory :
Oh , I think it occurred to them alright .
It was the plan all along .
You think the CIA can't " take care of " a few jihadis waving around U.S. - made stinger missile launchers ?
The CIA does n't just letplay with their toys .
They can find you .
After all , details about members of al - Qaeda are , by definition , in " The Database .
" That raises another question :
Who the fuck would name their terrorist organization after a " structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system " ?! I have an idea .
I 'm going to start an organization dedicated to the Liberation of the Great State of Minnesota from the Oppressive Federal Government of the United States of America .
I 'm going to name this organization ..... What do you think ?
" Pants " ... or " Pants ! " ? ... I 'm not sure , does the exclamation point sell it ?
Anyway , my point is that it 's completely fucking ridiculous .
I just made my hypothetical liberation front look clueless , stupid .... and somewhat artistic , I guess .
Maybe " al - Qaeda " would make a good , Dadaist band name in Arabic , but it does n't do shit for a supposedly committed bunch of terrorists .
Let 's look at other " terrorist " organizations and what kind of names they have ( I 'll assign grades based soley on the clarity and effectiveness of the name , not their tactics or ideology ) : I have to give al - Qaeda afor their crappy name .
I would give them an , but the randomness of it is pretty funny ... except for the whole killing and murder thing .
But that 's the rub ; I just do n't buy these guys as terrorist masterminds .
They can't even fucking name themselves right , so why would I think they could pull off 9/11 ?
Even if you say , " okay , maybe ' The Base ' refers to a military base " it makes no sense because the modus operandi of these guys is supposedly their decentralization .
There is no main headquarters .
They 're ostensibly a loose - knit group of cells that operate independently , yet are n't really controlled by Osama either , who is mostly a figurehead who provides funding ( or did ... he 's probably dead ) .
Let 's face it : " al - Qaeda " probably only makes sense if you do n't speak Arabic .
If you 're still not convinced al - Qaeda is a joke , watch an incredible BBC documentary called The Power of Nightmares .
You 'll be glad you did .
As for me , I will continue to worry about theterrorist organization plaguing this wretched earth : The Central Intelligence Agency .
A look at their record exposes the deep hypocrisy of the United States government when it comes to terrorism :
Even The Onion can't make that level of hypocrisy funny .
Labels : 9/11 , America , bizarre , Bush , CIA , conspiracy , funny , humor , hypocrisy , iraq , murder , propaganda , rant , stupidity , terror
The scientific and political arguments surrounding the health of our planet can make the whole topic seem beyond the grasp of the individual .
How fast is the climate changing ?
Exactly what effect to humans have ?
And what will the government do about it ?
How we treat Earth also involves trillions of little decisions by billions of individuals .
That in mind , on this Earth Day , LiveScience presents 10 ideas for saving energy and otherwise cutting down on your impact on the planet .
The list was compiled by the Earth Day Network organization and republished here with permission .
1. Change light bulbs
Highly efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) last for years , use a quarter of the energy of regular bulbs and actually produce more light .
Look for the government 's ENERGY STAR label , which means the bulb has been tested for quality and efficiency .
While each ENERGY STAR qualified bulb will cost more initially — anywhere from $ 3 to $ 9 a piece — remember that there are two price tags : what you pay at the register and what you pay in energy costs to over the bulb 's lifetime .
So you may pay more up front , but you will actually save hundreds of dollars in your household budget over the long term because of their long life .
While CFLs were harder to find a few years ago , they 're now widely available and much more affordable .
You 'll find them at major home improvement and hardware stores — even grocery and some convenience stores .
Here 's the impact .
If every household in the U.S. replaced a burned - out bulb with an energy - efficient , ENERGY STAR qualified compact fluorescent bulb , the cumulative effect is enormous .
It would prevent more than 13 billion pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere — which is like taking more than a million cars off the road for an entire year .
There are other , simple things with household lighting you can do to conserve : turn off unneeded lights , dim lights when you can and bring natural sunlight into your home when it is feasible .
But changing those old light bulbs and replacing them with ENERGY STAR qualified compact fluorescents that can last for a decade or more is by far the best thing you can do .
2. Drive differently , or drive a different vehicle
The sad truth is that your car emits as much carbon dioxide as your entire house .
That 's the bad news .
The good news is that anything you can do to improve the fuel efficiency of your car will have an enormous impact on climate change .
In fact , experts say that paying attention to fuel efficiency in your car may be the single biggest thing you can do to prevent global warming
Buying a fuel - efficient car ( like a hybrid ) is wonderful .
In fact , replacing your gas - guzzling car with a fuel - efficient one is by far the best thing you can do , out of all your choices .
But not all of us can do that — at least , not right now .
Carmakers have n't sold enough hybrids in the U.S. yet to make them as affordable as they should be .
That will change , but not for a few years .
So , in the interim , there are things you can do with the car you drive now to conserve energy and be more fuel - efficient .
Drive less .
Every year , Americans as a whole drive more miles than they did the year before .
Stop this trend , and we drive a stake in that trend .
Telecommuting and public transportation are great options — once a week saves a ton of carbon dioxide a year — but even piling multiple errands into one trip helps .
If you can walk instead of drive , even better .
Get your car tuned up .
Just a simple tune - up often improves fuel efficiency by half .
If 100,000 of us went out and got a tune up , we save 124,000 tons of carbon dioxide .
Slow down , do n't race your car 's engine , and watch your idling .
All of these save on gas ( saving you money ) and have a big impact on burning gasoline .
Horribly inefficient SUVs , minivans and pickup trucks now make up more than half of the cars on American roads .
The real tragedy is that automakers could double the current average fuel efficiency of SUVs if they wanted to , which would save 70 tons of carbon dioxide per car .
The technology exists .
Unfortunately , consumer demand does not .
3. Control your temperature
The bad news is that half of your household energy costs go towards just two things — heating and cooling .
The good news is that means you have lots of room for improvement , and even small changes make dramatic improvements in household fuel efficiency .
Older heating and cooling systems are a third less efficient than the new systems .
So replacing the old with the new is a wonderful idea , but not very practical for most of us .
Things you can do right now to make sure you 're setting the right temperature in your house include :
Tune up your heating system .
This one thing every couple of years can reduce your heating costs by 10 percent a year .
Clean vents , close unused vents , and change filters in the vents .
Again , just these simple things will save you 10 percent .
Buy a programmable thermostat , which can regulate different temperatures at different times of the day .
And if you have one , use it !
Right now , three - quarters of people who have programmable thermostats do n't use them at all .
Add two degrees to the AC thermostat in summer , and two degrees in winter .
If everyone did this , the cumulative impact is significant .
Make sure windows and doors are sealed .
Again , this will dramatically improve your household fuel efficiency .
Of course , if you can stand it , by far the best approach is to avoid air conditioners at all .
Ceiling fans , instead of AC , can reduce your cooling costs by more than half .
4 . Tame the refrigerator monster
Did you know that your friendly refrigerator has a voracious energy appetite ?
It is , by far , the single biggest consumer of electricity in the average household , responsible for 10 - 15 percent of the electricity you use each month .
Older refrigerators , as a rule , are far less efficient than the newest ones — as much as 50 percent more efficient in many cases .
But buying a brand - new , energy - efficient refrigerator is almost certainly not in the cards for most of us .
Fortunately , other things will help .
Do n't set the thermostat too high .
Even 1 degree will make a big difference .
If your refrigerator is near a heating vent , or always in the sun , then change the location , cover up the heat vent near it or drape the window .
Turn on your " energy saver " switch near the thermostat .
Clean the condenser coil .
This one , very simple thing can improve the efficiency of your refrigerator by a third !
Get rid of your second refrigerator .
If you do n't need it , do n't waste the energy .
Make sure the doors seal properly , and keep the cool in .
5 . Twist some knobs
The other big users of energy in your household are your hot water heater , your washer and dryer , and your dishwasher .
Each , in its own way , can be inefficient .
Here are some things to try :
Either turn the hot water heater down a couple of degrees , or turn on the " energy conservation " setting .
Buy insulation for your hot water heater at a local store and insulate the pipes as well .
Install a timer on your water heater to turn off at night and just before you wake up in the morning .
When possible , wash a few dishes by hand .
Over time , that will save a few loads in the dishwasher , conserving energy .
Do n't pre-rinse dishes .
Today 's detergents are powerful enough to do the job .
Wait until you have a full load to run the dishwasher .
Wash clothes in warm water , not hot .
The clothes will be just as clean , and you 'll cut energy use by 50 percent .
Do n't over - dry your clothes .
That will save 15 percent .
6 . Plant smartly
While it is true that planting more trees will help in the short term because they essentially soak up carbon , they also release carbon dioxide when they die .
So it just postpones the problem .
But there are other reasons to plant trees — as wind breaks to save energy , and as shade to lower cooling costs .
And even the short - term help while we get our act together is a good thing .
As for plants , do everything you can in your yard and garden to create ways in which plants use less water .
Choose hardier plants , plant things in groups that need more water and put in mulch to help keep moisture in .
When you mow your grass , make sure you do it smartly — with sharp blades , and only when the grass needs cutting .
Finally , make sure you water your lawn sparingly .
All of these will conserve energy .
7 . Invest in green energy
Imagine if we ran out of fossil fuels tomorrow , what would we do ?
Well , we'd get our electricity from renewable sources — solar panels , geothermal and wind power sources .
Many utilities now give consumers the option to buy " green power . "
Ask for it !
Learn the truth about nuclear power and natural gas as viable " green " options .
They are n't .
Radioactive waste will be a problem for tens of thousands of years into the future , and natural gas kicks out almost as much carbon dioxide as coal and oil .
Natural gas can help us make a transition , but it is n't the solution .
Finally , if you invest , invest in green stocks and renewable energy companies through socially responsible funds .
They perform just as well ( if not better ) than all of the unfiltered funds .
8. Go organic
Even with our vast reservoir of scientific knowledge about farming , most American farmers still spray a billion pounds of pesticides to protect crops each year .
Now here 's the kicker : when chemical pesticides are used to kill pests , they also kill off microorganisms that keep carbon contained in the soil .
When the microorganisms are gone , the carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
And when those organisms are gone , the soil is no longer naturally fertile and chemical fertilizers become a necessity , not a luxury .
But besides going organic — thereby saving the carbon release from soil — there are other simple things you can do with food that will also make a difference :
Eat locally grown food .
If the food does n't have to travel far , there 's less carbon dioxide from the trucks that ship it .
Eat fruits and vegetables in season .
Again , that saves the enormous transportation costs .
Plant your own vegetable garden .
It 's not as hard as you might think .
9 . Buy recycled
This may sound simple , but it takes less energy to manufacture a recycled product than a brand new one .
So if you and every other consumer buy recycled , you 'll help create a market , and conserve energy along the way .
Because many manufacturers do n't go out of their way to tout their recycled products , you should know that aluminum and tin cans , glass containers , and pulp cardboard have a fair amount of recycled content .
So buy away !
Recycled is often considerably cheaper than non-recycled , so it 's cost - effective as well as conservation - minded .
For instance , recycled paper can be as much as a third cheaper than non-recycled paper .
Finally , before you buy , check to see if the product or its packaging can be recycled .
The recyclable logo ( three arrows forming a triangle ) is fairly common now .
10 .
Be a minimalist
We know it 's difficult , but in today 's consumer economy , an easy way to conserve energy is to simply use — and buy — less .
Every time you buy something , energy has gone into getting that product to you .
So the less you buy , the more you save energy - wise .
It 's a simple equation .
This last item on our Top Ten list may , in fact , be the single biggest way to make a dent in the global warming problem .
Again , we know it sounds obvious , but buying less things — some of which you just do n't need — changes the energy equation across the board , on every single consumer product .
If everyone used less , the impact would be large indeed .
So how about some specific things ?
Here are a few :
Buy in bulk .
In short , bulk items use less packaging , which translates into less energy .
Buy one of something , not 21 of something .
You do n't need 21 pairs of shoes , if one pair works just as well .
Go through your closet .
Donate or recycle what you really do n't need , then make a pledge not to replace everything you just got rid of .
Buy quality products that will last longer .
Over time , you 'll obviously buy fewer products that way .
Be creative in what you use for work , play and leisure .
You do n't always have to buy new products for activities .
Re-use in creative ways .
LAHORE , April 3 : Eight women traffic wardens turned up on heavy - duty bikes on city ’s major roads on Thursday for patrolling duty for the first time in the history of the country ’s traffic police .
Eighty - four wardens , including the eight women , were handed over 250 cc bikes by city police chief ( additional IG ) Malik Mohammad Iqbal .
“ We have imparted a 15 - day training to eight female wardens in the first phase and as many wardens are receiving training in the second phase , ” Chief Traffic Officer SSP Ghulam Mehmood Dogar told Dawn .
He said that the wardens would patrol The Mall , Jail Road , Gulberg Main Boulevard and Defence Main Boulevard in pair .
They will regulate traffic , help and educate people and issue tickets .
“ The main focus of the women wardens will be on extending emergency help to commuters , especially female and children , ” he added .
He said that separate beats comprising different sectors had been allocated to the women wardens .
Mr Dogar believed that the presence of women wardens on roads would change attitude and behaviour of commuters .
He said that six lady wardens were already patrolling on CG - 125 bikes .
There are 134 female traffic wardens in the traffic police but most of them are doing office work .
The city traffic police have 200 250 cc bikes in its fleet of which 84 have been handed over to the wardens .
Double Picture Illusion - Optical Illusion
Look carefully at this picture , what do you see ?
After you make your decision , scroll down for an explanation .
You saw a couple in an intimate love position , right ?
Interestingly , research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario .
What they will see , however , is nine ( small & black ) dolphins in the picture !
So , I guess we 've already proven you 're not a young innocent child .
Now , if it 's hard for you to find the dolphins within 6 seconds , your mind is SO corrupted that you probably need help !
OK , here 's help : look at the space between her right arm and her head , the tail is on her neck , follow it up .
Look at her left hip , follow the shaded part down , it 's another one , and on his shoulder ..
New geological evidence indicates the Grand Canyon may be so old that dinosaurs once lumbered along its rim , according to a study by researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder and the California Institute of Technology .
The team used a technique known as radiometric dating to show the Grand Canyon may have formed more than 55 million years ago , pushing back its assumed origins by 40 million to 50 million years .
The researchers gathered evidence from rocks in the canyon and on surrounding plateaus that were deposited near sea level several hundred million years ago before the region uplifted and eroded to form the canyon .
A paper on the subject will be published in the May issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin .
CU - Boulder geological sciences Assistant Professor Rebecca Flowers , lead author and a former Caltech postdoctoral researcher , collaborated with Caltech geology Professor Brian Wernicke and Caltech geochemistry Professor Kenneth Farley on the study .
" As rocks moved to the surface in the Grand Canyon region , they cooled off , " said Flowers .
" The cooling history of the rocks allowed us to reconstruct the ancient topography , telling us the Grand Canyon has an older prehistory than many had thought . "
The team believes an ancestral Grand Canyon developed in its eastern section about 55 million years ago , later linking with other segments that had evolved separately .
" It 's a complicated picture because different segments of the canyon appear to have evolved at different times and subsequently were integrated , " Flowers said .
The ancient sandstone in the canyon walls contains grains of a phosphate mineral known as apatite -- hosting trace amounts of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium -- which expel helium atoms as they decay , she said .
An abundance of the three elements , paired with temperature information from Earth 's interior , provided the team a clock of sorts to calculate when the apatite grains were embedded in rock a mile deep -- the approximate depth of the canyon today -- and when they cooled as they neared Earth 's surface as a result of erosion .
Apatite samples from the bottom of the Upper Granite Gorge region of the Grand Canyon yield similar dates as samples collected on the nearby plateau , said Caltech 's Wernicke .
" Because both canyon and plateau samples resided at nearly the same depth beneath the Earth 's surface 55 million years ago , a canyon of about the same dimensions of today may have existed at least that far back , and possibly as far back as the time of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago . "
One of the most surprising results from the study is the evidence showing the adjacent plateaus around the Grand Canyon may have eroded away as swiftly as the Grand Canyon itself , each dropping a mile or more , said Flowers .
Small streams on the plateaus appear to have been just as effective at stripping away rock as the ancient Colorado River was at carving the massive canyon .
" If you stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon today , the bottom of the ancestral canyon would have sat over your head , incised into rocks that have since been eroded away , " said Flowers .
The ancestral Colorado River was likely running in the opposite direction millions of years ago , she said .
When the canyon was formed , it probably looked like a much deeper version of present - day Zion Canyon , which cuts through strata of the Mesozoic era dating from about 250 million to 65 million years ago , Wernicke said .
From 28 million to 15 million years ago , a pulse of erosion deepened the already - formed canyon and also scoured surrounding plateaus , stripping off the Mesozoic strata to reveal the Paleozoic rocks visible today , he said .
The prevailing belief is that the canyon was incised by an ancient river about six million years ago as the surrounding plateau began rising from sea level to the current elevation of about 7,000 feet .
The new scenario described in the GSA Bulletin by Flowers and her colleagues is consistent with recent evidence by other geologists using radiometric dating techniques indicating the Grand Canyon is significantly older than scientists had long believed .

There are some diseases that we never really knew where it started or where it came from .
It just mysteriously appears .
I have made a list of mysterious disease that even medicine sometimes could n’t explain .
Morgellons Disease
A very mysterious skin disorder has cropped up again just recently .
It is said to have a creepy - crawly feeling on the skin and has an odd multi-colored fibrous filaments protruding from an open wound .
It can sometimes be blamed as psychotic delusions but some medical communities say the symptoms are very real .
Canada , Australia , UK , and the Netherlands are said to be affected by the disease .
But majority of the reported cases came from Florida , California , and Texas .
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
The classic MUPS or medically unexplained physical symptoms , it is the feeling of more than just being tired .
Most patients often get bed - ridden for days .
This disease is debilitating and ca n’t be resolved by bed rest .
It can even persist for years , the cause has never been identified yet and no specific diagnostic procedures are available .
Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease
A rare brain disorder , also known as the Mad - Cow Disease , is contracted from eating an infected beef .
It can be fatal and quick acting , this disease develops even the doctors could n’t possibly figure out and prevent .
The incidence of death in the United States was said to be higher in patients aging from 55 - 65 years old .
Schizophrenia
A mental disorder which is considered the most puzzling , the patient suffers from inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality .
The patients can be delusional , has hallucinations , disorganized speech , and lack of motivation or emotion .
The disease has no defining medical tests .
Autoimmune Disorders
A disease that treats the normal body function and organs as the enemy such as Lupus and Multiple Sclerosis ; they usually are debilitating , chronic , and it usually do n’t have a cure and treatment is symptom - based .
Pica
Insatiable urge to eat non -food substances like paper , glue , clay , and dirt .
This disease has no cause and no cure .
Pica in children can be very dangerous , sometimes children eat paints that contain lead and they may suffer from lead poisoning leading to brain damage .
Avian Flu
A bird carried powerful flu virus , and mutates into a strain that affects humans .
The death rate is actually 50 % mostly by humans handling infected birds .
Common Cold
Common colds maybe a common disease but still mysteriously can’t be treated by antibiotics but a simple chicken soup and rest can do the trick .
The doctors actually know a little about the nose - running , cough - inducing cold , and the root cause .
Alzheimer ’s Disease
A degenerative brain disorder which manifests differently among different people .
The root cause ca n’t be determined or understood and it ca n’t be treated effectively .
Patients ’ disease progresses from a mild cognitive impairment to advanced dementia .
AIDS
An acquired immune deficiency syndrome still has no cure .
It is the most potent killer most especially in developing countries .
We all know it started from monkeys and jumped into humans .
Failed machines same as those to be used in Pennslvania tally
BRAD BLOG Sequoia Voting Systems ’ legal threats against Princeton computer science professors and New Jersey election officials have apparently had their intended effect .
The strong - arm email sent to professors Ed Felten and Andrew Appel was apparently accompanied by a two - page letter to Union County , New Jersey , Clerk Joanne Rajoppi , who originally discovered a tally failure in Sequoia ’s AVC Advantage touch - screen voting machines after the February 5th Super Tuesday election .
The same error was subsequently discovered in at least five other counties .
Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello tells the New Jersey Times that Sequoia ’s decision to block an independent analysis of its touch - screen voting machines makes no sense if the firm is confident that they work properly .
“ I think it ’s unfortunate that they ’re not letting an independent investigation take place , ” Sollami - Covello tells the paper this morning .
“ They should have no problem with having a third party investigate the product if they are confident in their product . ”
Another Mercer County , NJ , official sent a letter to the state Attorney General criticizing Sequoia ’s bizarre explanation for failures discovered in the systems following state ’s recent Primary Election , characterizing what he describes as the company ’s “ strange , confusing solution . ”
He said the company ’s explanation for the problem , which succeeded in blaming voters and poll workers as usual , was based on a “ bizarre scenario , with no cited evidence or testimony ” to back it up .
. .
Amazingly ( or perhaps , not so much at this point ) , Union County ’s attorneys folded to the pressure from the company , which claimed that Election Officials in NJ — who spent millions on the voting systems — are not legally allowed to examine them independently because “ the voting machine software is a Sequoia ‘ trade secret ’ and cannot be handed over to any third - party . ”
Fear of a lawsuit from Sequoia , which will also control the state ’s elections in an upcoming June primary , as well as the November general election , has led to county attorneys backing down from their plans for the time being , unless the state AG jumps in to take action .
In the threatening email from Smith to the Princeton professors sent last Friday , the company executive threatened legal action if a “ non-compliant analysis ” of their voting systems was carried out .
“ We will also take appropriate steps to protect against any publication of Sequoia software , its behavior , reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property , ” Smith warned . . .
A Sequoia executive , Edwin Smith , put Union County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi on notice that an independent analysis would violate the licensing agreement between his firm and the county .
In a terse two - page letter , Smith also argued the voting machine software is a Sequoia “ trade secret ” and cannot be handed over to any third - party .
Rutgers University law professor Penny Venetis stated what should be quite obvious in the Star - Ledger article today .
. .
“ We should n’t have a corporation dictating how elections are run in the state , ” Venetis said .
“ If an elected official believes there was an anomaly and the matter has to be investigated , then the official should be able to consult with computer experts without interference . ”
Livermore Laboratory ’s computer scientist David Jefferson jumped in to comment on our story yesterday , which included the full threatening email sent to the Princeton Professors , in order to note the importance of such a test being carried out on New Jersey ‘s Sequoia machines prior to the use of the very same systems next month in Pennsylvania .

A few years ago , I wrote an entry about knee - jerk contrarians on the Internet : those delightful people who find fault in anything and everything , dismissing months or years of work with a few words .
This is nothing new .
It ’s as old as communication itself .
I ’m sure that the moment man discovered fire , there was some guy nearby saying , “ Too smoky .
Can burn you .
Lame . ”
In the modern age , we ’ve found a much more efficient way to express disdain , distilled into only four letters : FAIL .
This usage as a standalone interjection has been around for years , since at least 2003 , but its recent explosion in popularity comes from 4 chan and the Lolcats memes .
Dedicated blogs like FAIL Blog , Shipment of FAIL and Fail Dogs further spread the meme .
On Twitter , the conservation of space combined with a meme - savvy audience creates a perfect storm for spreading FAIL .
With only 140 characters , it ’s not surprising that people have taken to using this often as a shorthand for longer criticism .
Here ’s a recent example from Chris Messina ( who hopefully wo n’t mind me picking on him ) :
factoryjoe : @skitch Nice Twitter +
Email integration , but where ’s the OAuth ??
FAIL !
Obviously , Chris adores Skitch .
It ’s the best screenshot application ever made , he uses it constantly , and evangelized it to friends ( I found out about it from him , in fact ) .
I ’m sure he intended it as a gentle ribbing , but the message is pretty straightforward : Skitch has failed because it does n’t support an emerging standard he feels strongly about .
Pretend you ’re one of the Skitch developers , and compare the original to this slight reworking :
@skitch Nice Twitter +
Email integration !
I ’d love OAuth support , too .
Part of the problem is that “ FAIL ” implies objective truth , when it ’s just your personal opinion .
Tantek Çelik pointed out that , in LOLspeak , “ DO NOT WANT ” would be more appropriate since it clearly conveys a personal opinion .
I know many people who make stuff for the web , all of them very passionate about what they do .
And every time I see a “ FAIL ” assigned to their work , it makes me sad .
Yes , I know you ’re trying to be funny .
But I ’m starting to see a trend away from the funny , and towards the angry , bitchy , or mean .
So please , mind yer words .</ missmanners >

( CNN ) -- U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Bush should consider boycotting the opening ceremony of the Olympics Games in Beijing this summer to protest China 's human rights record .
President Bush and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have both criticized China 's record on human rights .

" I think boycotting the opening ceremony , which really gives respect to the Chinese government , is something that should be kept on the table , " Pelosi told " Good Morning America " co-anchor Robin Roberts in an interview to air Tuesday morning , according to the ABC News Web site .
" I think the president might want to rethink this later , depending on what other heads of state do . "
Pelosi said she does not think U.S. athletes should boycott the games themselves .
" I believe a boycott of the Beijing Olympics would unfairly harm our athletes who have worked so hard to prepare for the competition , " she said in a statement last week .
President Bush has said he intends to meet with China 's president during a trip to see the Olympic Games in Beijing , which start on August 8 .
Bush did n't elaborate on what issues he might bring up , but his administration has accused China , a major U.S. trade partner , of human rights abuses .
Other world leaders have wrestled with whether to attend the Olympics .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he may skip the opening ceremonies .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she will skip the Olympics .
Britain 's Prince Charles said in January he has " no plans to attend the ceremony . "
Pelosi has been a vocal critic of China 's crackdown on anti-government protesters in Tibet .

" If freedom - loving people throughout the world do not speak out against China 's oppression in China and Tibet , we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world , " Pelosi told reporters during a visit to the Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , in Dharamsala , India , on February 21 .
Dharamsala is the center of the Tibetan community in India , where many Tibetans fled after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 .
" The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world , " Pelosi added .
In a statement from her office on Friday , the California Democrat encouraged people to express their views in San Francisco next month when the Olympic torch passes through on its worldwide trek .
" I support the rights of individuals and groups to make their views known about the actions of the Chinese government . "
China launched its torch relay Monday in a controlled ceremony in front of invited guests at Tiananmen Square .
The torch will be taken on a 130 - day journey around the world in what is said to be the longest torch relay in Olympic history .
Students for a Free Tibet , a Tibetan exile group , said its protesters will challenge police as the flame moves through 23 cities on five continents before returning to China , where it will be taken throughout the nation on the way to opening ceremonies .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang has said that the games should not be politicized .
" We hope to enhance mutual understanding , friendship and cooperation with other peoples through the Games , " Qin said in a statement on the ministry 's Web site .
" We must follow the purpose of the Olympics and not politicize the games . "

From The Daily World in Aberdeen , Washington on January 24 , 2008 :
“ We need to try this to see if it works , ” said Councilman Bob McCullough .
“ The key issue in all this is traffic safety . ”
“ If you do n’t want a ticket , do n’t run a red light , ” said Councilwoman Margo Shortt , who felt safety should trump everything else and the red light cameras would prevent accidents .
From The Daily World in Aberdeen , Washington on February 16 , 2008 :
Mayor Bill Simpson will hold off on plans to put red light cameras in Aberdeen intersections in the wake of an initiative Tim Eyman is proposing to reduce traffic congestion .
[…]
Eyman has proposed an initiative that could take any revenue the city would receive from the tickets the cameras would generate and put it into a special account to help reduce traffic congestion statewide .
“ That ’s not really what we were expecting when we got into all of this , ” Simpson said .
[…]
Eyman ’s initiative aims to reduce congestion by opening up carpool lanes to all vehicles in non-peak hours , requires traffic signals to be synchronized and insists accidents be cleared from roadways quicker .
Yesterday , I replaced the hard drive in one of my laptops .
Everything was under warranty , so no problems there .
Now that I have a brand spanking new hard - drive I figured I would take advantage of its innocence , and partition off a section for the anticipated release of Ubuntu 8.04 … aka Hardy Heron .
What a great call .
Of course , I went ahead and installed the OEM Vista on a 60 gig partition , simple to do using the recovery disks provided by Toshiba .
For the record , it is very important that you install the Microsoft Windows OS first if you plan on dual booting with Linux , so you can rewrite the micro$oft boot manager with the more friendly Linux boot manager .
Basically , you are n’t under time constraints to choose which OS you want to boot at startup .
Today , I fidgeted with excitement as I booted up my clean Vista install , and as a first task on this windows machine , immediately browsed to Ubuntu.com to download Hardy Heron .
Unfortunately , I was one of many people ( stats yet to be released , but it must have been a lot ) , and the ubuntu site was down ..
Argonne National Laboratory was downloading at 15KBs and University of Maryland was at about 30 KBs … I ended up using the Ubuntu mirror at Georgia Tech .
Software Library which was running at about 140KBs over my 3G HTC phone , and I downloaded the 699MB file in about 2 hours .
After downloading the file , I made sure to burn a DISK IMAGE .. very important , do not burn a data CD , burn as an IMAGE .
I then shut down my computer , rebooted with the disk in , and was greeted with the Ubuntu install screen .
I followed all of the prompts , and when it asked me about partitioning , I selected manual and made the following adjustments .
I set a new partition of 50 gigs for Ubuntu install , and I also created a 4 gig swap partition … a clever little trick that helps speed things up a bit .
I then wrapped up the install , let it do its thing , and now I have a FREE desktop operating system that not only took less time to install than Vista ( 1 hr vs. 2.5 ) but has more functionality .. at least for what I need it for .
I ’ll follow up in a few to let you all know how my experience has gone .
Considering Ubuntu ’s track record of operating systems , I ’m sure this one will be just as impressive .
I hear , though I ’m yet to experience , that there are some small driver support issues for laptops .
Just as a general note .. if you have some old laptop somewhere with windows 95 on it , you can easily wipe the hard - drive and get an install of Hardy Heron going that will perform almost as well as a new machine running windows .
Linux is such a lightweight system that it does n’t require all of the processing power and space as a microsoft system does .
Granted I ’m sure I will always have at least one copy of windows running within arms reach , if for the sake of compatibility alone .
UPDATE :
I personally have not had any driver issues , though a friend of mine with an ATI graphics card has experienced a small issue .
I have an Intel graphics card , which is pretty versatile .
If you have the ATI card , you simply go to System -> Administration ->
Software Sources and enable the repository for restricted software .
Then go back into your drivers , and you should be able to select and update without a problem .. you can use the tutorial here -> Every Flavor Beans

Both Qatar 's oil minister and the head of OPEC can see oil hitting $ 200 a barrel before the end of the year and one analyst says gas could reach $ 7 a gallon within four years .
That could mean cataclysm for the global economy .
The world got a little relief today when BP reopened its North Sea pipeline .
But the price of gas is averaging $ 3.60 a gallon and the price of oil is flirting with $ 120 a barrel with no relief in sight .
Market forces do n't seem to be functioning in their normal order .
OPEC controls only about half of the world 's oil supply .
Ordinarily , when prices spike skyward , the world 's non-cartel spigots open wide .
Why is n't this happening and who 's to blame ?
Oil Companies .
Admittedly , obscenely compensated oil executives are laying low these days .
Big
Oil is rolling in profits .
The Bush Administration 's tax subsidies to oil companies , which were intended to prod exploration , should infuriate commuters .
And yet the profit margins of oil giants are only slightly higher than the average for the S&P
500 .
And much of the wealth from these companies is pumped back into the economy in dividends , employment , capital spending and the like .
Big
Oil should n't get a walk ( and windfall profit taxes make more sense than ever ) .
But it 's only a small part of the problem .
China and India .
It seems to be a global fact that an automobile signals your arrival into the middle class .
Without question , demand for oil in these countries is putting an inexorable upward push on gas prices .
This is n't going to change in your lifetime , and it should sound the alarm for North
Americans and Europeans that their middle - class lives will be threatened unless they develop alternative forms of energy – fast .
But the increasing demand for oil in China and India is a long - term , slow slope trajectory .
It does n't explain recent spikes .
And in the short term , it 's self correcting .
As oil prices spike , economies slow and the demand for oil eases .
So does its price .
Ben Bernanke .
Oil is currently priced in U.S. dollars .
The Federal Reserve has feverishly tried to calm credit markets in recent months with lower interest rates , which are a kind of Valium for bankers .
As interest rates drop , so does the value of the dollar .
So it takes more dollars to buy a barrel of oil .
Without question , the credit crisis is a more pressing concern than high gas prices .
Credit , after all , is the life blood of an economy .
It is widely expected that tomorrow the Feds will reduce interest rates again .
But many analysts believe this is the last cut we 'll see for a while .
Fighting inflation – including rising gasoline prices – is becoming a priority .
When interest rates begin inching up again , it will be bad news if you 're taking out a car loan , good news at the pump .
In the meantime , just be glad you do n't have Ben Bernanke 's job .
Speculators .
It 's never a good omen when fear swallows reason on the trading floor .
But this seems to explain part of what 's happeningwith the price of oil .
Or maybe it 's just greed .
Whatever .
The good news is that these speculative frenzies tend to end quickly .
And ultimately , it 's traders ' fingers that get burned , not consumers .
Suppliers .
Here 's the mysterious missing piece in high gas prices : Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar and other OPEC members try to keep supplies tight and prices high .
But England , Norway , Russia and other non-OPEC countries open the spigots to take advantage of high prices .
This usually brings prices down .
But supply disruptions have become rife – even with OPEC countries , such as Nigeria , thanks to an insurgency that keeps shutting down its pipeline .
Norway 's production has dropped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001 .
Britain 's has dropped by 43 percent .
Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay has dropped by 65 percent from its peak .
Russia 's is down and so is Mexico's .
It 's enough to make you think speculators are on to something .
When does fear resemble reason ?

Iraq : a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic dimensions
By Kate Randall
19 March 2008
Five years of the US - led war and occupation of Iraq have created a humanitarian crisis affecting all aspects of Iraqi society .
This catastrophe is illustrated by the millions of Iraqis either killed or displaced , the daily toll of death and violence , the fracturing of families and communities , and the crumbling of basic infrastructure and social services .
The destruction of Iraqi society — an act that the WSWS has termed “ sociocide ” — stands as one of the most terrible crimes of the modern period , for which every faction of the American political establishment bears a heavy guilt .
This brutal violence has been propelled by one basic aim : to advance the interests of the American corporate establishment by seizing control of Iraq ’s territory and material resources .
( See “ Five years after the invasion of Iraq : A debacle for US imperialism ” )
The most stunning indicator of destruction in Iraq is the number of people who have been killed .
Last year , the British - based polling agency ORB put this figure at 1.2 million , which substantiated an earlier figure published in the medical journal Lancet by scientists from Johns Hopkins University .
Beyond deaths , however , the daily toll of the occupation is present in the disintegration of some of the most basic requirements of modern life .
Several recent reports document aspects of this tragedy .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has collected together some statistics and interviews in a new study titled , “ Iraq : No Let - up in the Humanitarian Crisis . ”
As the report notes , “ Five years after the outbreak of the war in Iraq , the humanitarian situation in most of the country remains among the most critical in the world . ”
Many Iraqis have no access to one of life ’s basic necessities : clean water .
A lack of qualified staff to operate and repair water and sanitation facilities , exacerbated by rising prices and poor security conditions , has led to a severe water crisis .
According to the ICRC study , many of these facilities have effectively collapsed in some parts of Iraq .
In some areas , large influxes of displaced persons have placed additional strains on already limited services .
The average monthly Iraqi salary is now estimated at US $ 150 , according to the ICRC .
This , however , refers only to those who receive a salary .
By some estimates , unemployment in Iraq is as high as 50 , 60 , or even 70 percent .
With drinking water costing about one dollar for 10 liters , families would need to spend at least $ 50 a month on water alone — or about a third of their income .
Facing this impossible situation , many — especially the most poor — turn to unsafe water sources .
An ICRC water engineer in Basra commented , “ At night , most people pump their water directly from the network .
That makes the water pressure drop too low to reach all the areas that the network is supposed to cover .
In addition , people sometimes pump sewage , thus contaminating the water tanks they have at home . ”
The quality of the water supply is affected by outdated networks of pipes that do not protect against contamination , the breakdown of equipment and an unreliable electricity supply .
The distribution of chlorine , essential for sterilizing drinking water , is restricted because it can be used in bomb making .
In many areas — including parts of Baghdad , Salaheddine , Diyala and Ninewa — untreated water is pumped directly from rivers or wells .
Sanitation systems in many cases have deteriorated to such an extent that drinking water is in danger of being contaminated by raw sewage .
This resulted in a widespread outbreak of cholera in 2007 , a threat that still exists .
Unreliable supplies of electricity and repeated power shortages are widespread across Iraq .
Parts of Baghdad , where temperatures can reach 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit ) in the summer , have only one hour of electricity available a day .
A similar situation exists in Anbar province .
Abu Samer from Baghdad told the ICRC , “ To get six hours of electricity per day by connecting to a private generator , I have to pay at least $ 50 dollars [ a month ] . ”
“ Sometimes I have to queue for a whole day to buy 20 litres of fuel , ” said Ibrahim Kassem from Ramadi .
“ But queuing is dangerous .
You never know if there will be a bombing . ”
A number of factors contribute to the scarcity of electricity , including insufficient supplies of refined fuel , poor maintenance , the failure to carry out repairs to boost capacity , and sabotage .
In addition to the suffering of residents , the severe lack of electrical power means water - treatment plants , hospitals and other facilities need to rely on generators , which themselves often fail due to a growing shortage of refined fuel .
Many Iraqis do not have access to the most basic health - care services .
The ICRC notes that there are presently 172 public hospitals with 30,000 beds , while 80,000 beds are needed .
Most of these hospitals were built more than 30 years ago , and are in substandard condition .
Drugs and other essential items are also lacking .
There are some private clinics and hospitals , but these are unaffordable for the vast majority of Iraqis .
There are not enough qualified doctors and other medical staff , particularly in Najaf , Missan , Anbar , Wasit and Babil .
Doctors , nurses and their families are often threatened and are in danger of being kidnapped or killed .
According to Iraqi government sources , more than 2,200 doctors have been killed and more than 250 kidnapped since the US invasion .
At least 20,000 of the 34,000 doctors registered in 1990 have fled the country .
Another shocking index of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq is the preponderance of refugees , both those displaced within the country and those who have left its borders .
An estimated 4 million Iraqis , or 14 percent of the population , have been either internally displaced or have fled to neighboring countries , where they struggle to eke out an existence .
The Wall Street Journal reports that aid agencies estimate more than 2 million Iraqis are now displaced inside the country , due to both sectarian violence and fighting between US soldiers and insurgents .
About 60 percent , or about 1.2 million , of these internal refugees are children .
According to the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , an average of 60,000 Iraqis were leaving their homes every month in 2006 , many of them fleeing to Jordan and Syria .
The Iraqi Red Crescent Organization says that there are still about 2 million Iraqi refugees living in these two countries .
Facing mounting social costs from this influx of refugees , Jordanian and Syrian authorities have begun to tighten visa rules and are sending many back to Iraq , where they no longer have a place to live .
They must move into overcrowded homes with relatives or find other accommodations .
The Red Crescent has built about 40 refugee camps across Iraq since 2003 , but these are basically tent cities , often with no running water , electricity or proper sanitation and garbage collection .
The Iraq government ’s Ministry of Migration set up a few other camps .
Most of these camps are now shut down , and fewer than 1 percent of displaced Iraqis currently reside in them .
Those displaced persons unable to move in with friends or relatives try to find new homes in unfamiliar neighborhoods ; some squat in abandoned buildings .
Many of these refugees are unable to take advantage of aid from charitable agencies and are not registered to receive food rations provided by the government .
Most are unemployed , putting increased financial strain on those family members who can find work .
Thousands of Iraqi families have been torn apart , with many losing their male breadwinners to violent deaths , incapacitating injuries or illnesses .
Many women do not know whether their husbands , brothers or sons are alive , dead or imprisoned .
Tens of thousands of prisoners , the majority of them men , are currently in detention , according to the ICRC .
The largest detention center , Camp Bucca , near Basra in the South , is run by the US - led Multinational Forces in Iraq .
It houses more than 20,000 inmates .
Violence continues on a daily basis , claiming the lives of Iraqi civilians in sectarian bombings , and at the hands of the US military and Iraqi police .
According to the Associated Press , from November 2006 to August 2007 , an average of 65 Iraqis died — or were found dead — each day from violence .
That number dropped to a two - year low this January , when an average of 20 Iraqis died each day .
These numbers have since begun to climb .
In February , approximately 26 Iraqis died from violence , and so far in March that number has grown to an average of 39 a day .
These figures certainly underestimate the daily toll of death and destruction , which continues every day .
On March 3 , two car bombs killed 24 people in Baghdad .
And on March 6 , two massive bombs claimed the lives of 68 people in Baghdad ’s Karradah neighborhood .
On Monday , a bomb exploded near the shrine of Imam Hussein , a Shia pilgrimage center in Karbala .
The death toll for that bombing now stands at 52 .
The bombing coincided with a surprise visit to Iraq by Vice President Dick Cheney , who commented on the US operation , “ If you look back on those five years it has been a difficult , challenging but nonetheless successful endeavor ... and it has been well worth the effort . ”
On March 13 , the London Timesonline reported the death of a 10 - year - old Iraqi girl killed by US gunfire in Diyala province , north of Baghdad .
US troops shot the girl after firing a warning shot at a dirt mound where they claimed a woman had been acting suspiciously .
The young girl was discovered behind the mound of dirt , suffering from a gunshot wound .
Soldiers treated her at the scene and called for emergency assistance , but she died en route to the hospital .
Many similar civilian casualties undoubtedly go unreported .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) has hit yet another web site over copyright infringement with a new lawsuit .
The organization says that Pullmylink.com facilitates copyright infringement by indexing and posting links to what the MPAA believes is pirated content .
Pullmylink.com ultimately profits from piracy , argues the MPAA , and should be shut down .
We 've heard these arguments before .
The lawsuit follows a string of previous suits filed against similar services recently in an attempt to crack down on piracy , including peekvid.com , youtvpc.com , showstash.com , cinematube.net , ssupload.com , and videohybrid.com .
That 's not all : two years ago , the MPAA sued BitTorrent , eDonkey , USENET , and TorrentSpy ( among others ) for making it easy to find and download copyrighted content , too .
In TorrentSpy 's case , the court eventually ruled in the MPAA 's favor after finding that those behind TorrentSpy attempted to destroy evidence and lied under oath .
The reason the MPAA believes that pullmylink.com is " profiting " from providing these links is because it serves ads on its page .
The organization says that pullmylink.com has 12,000 unique daily visitors generating some 39,000 pageviews on those ads , although it does n't specify where it pulled that data from .
12,000 unique daily visitors is a drop in the bucket , definitely putting it on the smaller side of things .
But that has n't stopped the MPAA from breaking out its big legal guns .
" Pullmylink.com and sites like it are a one - stop shop for copyright infringement , " said MPAA VP John Malcolm in a statement .
" We have filed several other similar suits and will continue to do so in order to hold operators accountable for their illegal activities .
Profiting from the theft of other people ’s creative works is illegal and we have every intention of shutting this , and sites like it , down for good . "
This latest lawsuit comes as BitTorrent use is on the rise , but the MPAA still believes that things are getting better on copyright infringement front .
The folks behind the Pirate Bay were recently indicted by Swedish prosecutors , which the MPAA says is evidence that its efforts are paying off .
" In some ways , the situation is improving in that we 've gotten the attention of law enforcement and Swedish prosecutors have taken action [ against The Pirate Bay admins ] , " Malcolm told Ars recently .
" Content providers can't afford to sit by and do nothing .
We need to highlight that [ copyright infringement ] is not a victimless crime and take appropriate actions . "
Of course , the MPAA 's lawsuit against Pullmylink.com has another effect that the MPAA is fully aware of .
People who had no idea Pullmylink.com existed ( including me ) are now aware of it and what it offers .
We would n't be surprised if a lot of them are going to head over to check it out — perhaps downloading a few movies in the process .
More than one reader hinted as much to us , and let 's be honest here : should n't the MPAA have bigger fish to fry ?
So many people have to live with painful conditions day in and day out .
Sometimes , their pain is n’t obvious , but it ’s still there .
For example , someone with a bad back may experience ongoing pain and never say much about it .
People whose lives are impacted by pain are often very brave and make a point of keeping their suffering to themselves .
However , now and then , they may let it slip just how much they struggle to stay positive in the face of discomfort .
Many people end up taking painkillers as a solution .
This can seem like the best way forward especially when you are in urgent need of pain relief .
These days it ’s all too easy to buy co-codamol 30/500 and other strong prescription painkillers at online pharmacy sites without realizing that these are only short term solutions .
If you know someone who is living with a painful condition , you should be aware that you can help .
While you might not be able to take that person ’s pain away , you may offer them some advice or just be a supportive and loving friend , partner or family member .
Sometimes , people who live with pain feel very alone with their pain .
They feel like no one understands .
Suggest Some Alternative Therapies
In addition to providing the proverbial shoulder to cry on , you may want to ask the person if they have considered natural pain relief methods .
For example , some people experience a lot of pain relief via acupuncture , which happens when tiny needles are stuck into the body ’s pressure points .
When pressure points are stimulated with needles , a lot of people find that their pain eases or disappears .
While every type of pain might not respond to acupuncture , a lot of pain does respond to it .
Chinese medicine has been around for centuries and acupuncture is a drug - free way to explore alternative pain relief .
Results vary , but those who use it and get good results definitely believe in it .
Also , there are a few natural supplements which are quite effective .
Comfrey Cream is great for soothing pain topically and St. John ’s
Wort is available in capsule form and soothes pain as it also helps to boost and balance mood .
While you should n’t pressure someone in pain to do things that they do n’t want to do , suggesting alternatives may , at the least , open up a good dialogue between the two of you and help the other person to know how much you care .
In our busy world , taking the time to show someone in pain that you think about them , look for possible solutions to their problems and want the best for them is a powerful expression of friendship .
October 29 , 2007
The facts are easy to understand .
Decades ago we had one autistic birth in every 2000 .
Today we have one in every 150 .
That is a frightening increase that quite simply , must have a cause .
It is not believable to have occurred from random chance or normal progression .
There seem to be three sides on the causation argument .
Group one says that the increase is traceable to mercury based preservatives that were implemented by companies ’ right before the autism explosion started .
The second group says that there is no such causation relationship , vaccines are safe , and we should spend more time worrying about early detection and services for the autistic child then trying to find out why .
The last group admits that they simply do not know enough yet .
The first group contains a great deal of parents of autistic children , who rightly want to know why their children fell into this extreme spike in autism .
They have been a true grassroots effort , trying to find out the dark secrets in corporate America for years .
They eventually received some much needed public clout when Robert Kennedy wrote this piece in 2005 :
http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity/
While some minor errors have been discovered in this article since it ran over two years ago ( see bottom of Deadly Immunity ) , they were minimal and not damaging to the main points it contained .
Without rehashing the entire article , the essential thrust is that it seems our government was more concerned about damage control and protecting the interests of corporate vaccine makers than in safeguarding the children of America .
Tough rhetoric ?
Too bad .
One cannot read the Kennedy piece and not feel outraged while digesting the history of mercury based vaccines and the carnage they may have wrought on generations of children .
This is of course assuming that the causation can be proven .
Pro-vaccine crowds will clamor that mercury was no longer used after 2001 , yet autism rates have not declined .
If so , I would like to hear from all sides how that fits in with the perception of vaccines as the bad guys .
What I do not need to hear anymore are the voices of those with a clear interest in downplaying the vaccine connection telling me to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain .
These are the primary people in group two .
They consist of “ scientists ” and medical practitioners who primarily wish to defend vaccines and corporate spokespersons who wish to defend their companies from the threats of legal action .
We saw another fluff piece come out this week in the Wall Street Journal , which has always sided with the machinery :
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119344390330373531.html
Dr. Brown tells a heart wrenching tale about watching a seven year old girl die from chickenpox and how she “ vowed never to let a child on my watch suffer from a disease that was preventable by vaccination . ”
How terribly noble and of course completely irrelevant to this discussion .
The issue has never been to do away with vaccinations , just the horrific poisons placed in them by companies looking to save some money .
Dr. Brown goes on to defend the vaccination industry by telling us all the benefits of vaccines .
Since she is an educated woman , I will assume that Dr. Brown realizes that her argument is a strawman ; and a most vile strawman at that .
What is at issue is not the efficacy of vaccines but the decision made by vaccine companies to use a preservative based on mercury ; which is one of the most deadliest toxins known to man .
They chose to use this preservative so they could mass produce the vaccines and increase profits dramatically .
When the parents of autistic children started putting the pieces together , those same companies decided to stop using these mercury based preservatives even though they insist on their safety .
Dr. Brown goes on to trash a book by Jenny McCarthy , who actually is a mother of an autistic child .
She splits hairs over what may have been two errors found in the entire book and thus makes a case to dismiss her entire account .
She even mocks her at one point claiming she has a “ medical degree from the University of Google . ”
This is a common tactic of the voices in group two .
Dismiss opponents as wrong and mock them as stupid because they are not part of the very medical establishment they claim is trying to cover up the autism scandal .
Of course Jenny McCarthy did not write a book claiming to be a doctor .
Her book is entitled , “ Louder Than Words : A Mother ’s Journey in Healing Autism . ”
It seems the good doctor missed the point .
Perhaps that is because while she is a parent , she is not a parent of an autistic child .
Maybe if she was , she would be more understanding of the harrowing journey to which Ms. McCarthy speaks .
Perhaps she would understand that maybe cute sound bites , poor strawmen , and stupid derision are not the best way to handle this situation .
Perhaps she would be defending the parents and not the vaccine companies .
Dr. Brown claims that it is the vaccination program that is under attack but she knows better .
Somewhere in medical school she must have learned English .
It is not the vaccination program under attack by group one .
It is the poison the vaccine producers used to increase their profits that are under attack .
So all disingenuous distractions aside , let ’s try and stay on point .
Secrecy plea ties up torture flights case SAN JOSE
A lawsuit accusing a San Jose flight - planning company of helping the CIA transport prisoners to overseas torture chambers must be dismissed because it would risk exposing state secrets , a Bush administration lawyer argued Tuesday to a federal judge , who seemed to reluctantly agree .
The five plaintiffs can't prove that Jeppesen International Trip Planning subjected them to wrongful imprisonment and torture without first showing that the company aided the CIA , that foreign governments collaborated , and that the so - called extraordinary rendition program subjected them to brutal treatment , Justice Department attorney Michael Abate said at a hearing in San Jose .
Each one of those assertions depends on classified information that can't be aired in court , he said .
" Without the information in question , this case cannot be litigated , " Abate told U.S. District Judge James Ware .
The result of allowing the government to keep its secrets out of court " can be harsh , " he said , but under the state - secrets doctrine recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court since 1953 , " private parties bear that burden on behalf of society . "
Ware did not issue a ruling after the 70 - minute hearing , and made it clear that he considered some aspects of the government 's position to be extreme .
He questioned Abate 's argument that the imprisonment and interrogation of each plaintiff remained an official secret , even though the men knew how they were treated .
" If they 're in the program , the secret 's disclosed , at least to them , " the judge said .
When Abate insisted that legal precedents require official government confirmation to remove the veil of secrecy , Ware said the doctrine known as the state - secrets privilege " should be called a state privilege to do whatever it wants . "
But Ware later questioned the plaintiffs ' ability to prove Jeppesen 's alleged role without secret information .
Ben Wizner , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union , which is representing five people who say they were tortured or abused in overseas prisons , said statements by a company official and records of foreign governments tie Jeppesen to the CIA program , but Ware said he was n't sure he could consider them as long as the government claims its relationships with private operators are confidential .
Even when individual liberties are at stake , Ware said , he has to " walk the line " between those liberties and the government 's need to protect military secrets .
He promised a prompt ruling .
Jeppesen , a subsidiary of a company owned by Boeing Co. , provides a variety of flight - planning services , including routing , weather forecasting , fueling and arranging ground transportation .
The suit accused the company of arranging at least 70 flights since 2001 , including those of the plaintiffs , as part of the CIA 's program of extraordinary rendition - transporting terrorism suspects to countries beyond the reach of U.S. law for interrogation and detention .
Three of the plaintiffs , still in prison , were tortured in Morocco and Egypt , the suit said .
The other two were allegedly abused at a U.S. airbase in Afghanistan and later released .
The Bush administration has acknowledged the existence of the rendition program , which began on a smaller scale under the Clinton administration , but has denied taking prisoners to countries where they were likely to be tortured and says it has been given assurances of humane treatment .
The lawsuit , filed last July , named only Jeppesen as a defendant , but the government intervened , as it has done in other cases , and moved for dismissal .
Wizner , the plaintiffs ' lawyer , told Ware the case relies heavily on information that has already been made public .
He said President Bush and other top officials have defended the rendition program , CIA Director Michael Hayden has provided numerous details in public appearances , and a Council of Europe report last June identified Jeppesen as the CIA 's aviation services provider .
Wizner also cited a court declaration by former Jeppesen employee Sean Belcher , who said company director Bob Overby told new employees in August 2006 that the company handled " all the extraordinary rendition flights ... the torture flights . "
If the suit is dismissed , the ACLU attorney said , " no court will ever be able to say whether the program is legal . "
He said the government " has engaged in vigorous public debate " about the rendition program and should n't be allowed to avoid judicial scrutiny of its role .
But Abate , the government 's lawyer , said other courts have recognized that any attempt to decide the legality of rendition - which he called the " terrorist detention and interrogation program " - would require probing the inner workings of the program and of the CIA itself , both off - limits to the judiciary .
For decades , the war on cancer has been waged with the medical equivalent of buckshot :
Toxic drugs are injected into patients and then scatter , with only a small fraction landing on the intended target .
Tumors may shrink , but patients often suffer horribly .
Now , inside laboratories in Massachusetts and around the world , scientists are developing cancer weapons that are made tiny enough to pierce cancerous cells and smart enough to spare healthy ones .
The devices , often made of common materials like plastic or rust , hold the promise of delivering payloads of powerful medication directly to tumors .
Other diminutive devices would act like glowing beacons , quickly indicating when cancer has spread or returned .
The federal government is investing nearly $ 145 million in the quest , with $ 20 million of that devoted to research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University .
And the pace of discovery is accelerating : Already , one cancer - detection method developed at Massachusetts General Hospital is awaiting approval by federal regulators .
Still , the research must solve a host of medical and engineering riddles demanding the expertise of cancer doctors , as well as chemists , electrical engineers , and computer scientists .
" We 're dreaming about how cancer [ treatment ] can be changed , " said Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia , a physician and engineer at MIT .
" But it has to be borne out in patients - that 's the ultimate challenge . "
This is a field in which size matters .
The smaller , the better .
Just how small ?
Think of a tennis ball .
Now , think of something tens of millions of times smaller .
That is the size of some of the tumor - detecting and drug - delivering vehicles being developed .
The devices are known as nanoparticles , and at their smallest , they are single crystals of a material .
A favorite choice among scientists is iron oxide , better known as rust .
Even if hundreds of the particles are suspended in liquid in a test tube , they are barely visible .
But their potential is huge .
Doctors have long been frustrated by their inability to know before they operate whether cancer has colonized surrounding lymph nodes .
If cancer has traveled from a man 's prostate to the adjacent tissue , for example , a doctor might very well opt for radiation rather than surgery .
" The goal of the surgery is cure , " said Dr. Mukesh Harisinghani , a Massachusetts General Hospital radiologist .
" But if I expose the patient to the [ risk ] of the surgery and he still has disease present elsewhere , I 'm not curing him . "
So the Mass .
General scientists enlisted iron oxide nanoparticles to go hunting for cancer - riddled lymph nodes .
The nanoparticles are pumped into patients .
If there 's no cancer present , the slivers of iron are absorbed into the lymph nodes , which appear black on an MRI scan , signaling health .
By contrast , if cancer has colonized the lymph nodes , the MRI will turn white , because malignant cells can't consume the iron nanoparticles .
The Plant Riverside District in Savannah : Model for Three Corners in Vero Beach ?
Will OJ Simpson be the Next Celebrity Apprentice ?
Hmmm , maybedoes n't watch TV or for that matter read the newspaper .
Word is that The Donald is recruiting or at least considering retired football playerto appear on the next Celebrity Apprentice .
A source told the NY Post that :
" Simpson really wants to do it .
Trump and NBC are thinking about it , but are being very cautious .
There 's a certain amount of heat associated with Simpson . "
A certain amount of heat ?
That is one of the biggest understatements I have heard this week .
Odds are that NBC is n't even tossing this around .
So many potential problems crop up , including the fact that OJ may be heading back to the slammer .
Simpson was acquitted in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in 1995 .
A recap on his current troubles are not limited too : robbery with a deadly weapon , burglary with a firearm , first degree kidnapping and the list goes on .
Here 's a thought - as long as he is looking at OJ , why not have Lil Kim , Richard Hatch , Michael Jackson , Foxy Brown , oh and why not throw in Pete Doherty .
Now that , my friends , would be some entertainment .
We wonder who would cry the most - Michael or Pete .
The amount of debris orbiting the Earth has reached a critical level .
Old satellite parts , solar panels and the odd astronaut 's lost glove now pose serious risks to space missions .
A report from the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety is calling for stringent international laws to be brought in urgently to avert a tragedy .
The threat posed by orbiting debris can only be allayed by extending civil aviation standards into space , says the report , which is to be presented to the United Nations in April .
' Failure to act now to regulate space to protect property and human life would be pure folly , ' says the association 's director , Tommaso Sgobba .
Professor Richard Crowther , who is representing the UK at a UN space safety meeting in Vienna , agrees : ' Eventually binding international civil aviation style laws will have to come . '
Last week , the United States courted an international row after shooting down a disabled spy satellite , saying its fuel could cause serious damage if it crashed to Earth .
Russia , however , claimed that the operation was a US cover - up to test its anti-satellite weapons .
According to the space agency Nasa , there are now 9,000 pieces of orbiting junk , weighing a total of more than 5,500 tonnes : old rocket launchers , tools and instruments dropped by astronauts , and pieces of exploded spacecraft .
Examples include a glove lost by astronaut Ed White during a 1965 space walk , a camera that Michael Collins let slip in space in 1966 and a pair of pliers that an International Space Station astronaut recently let slip through their fingers .
Space junk varies in size from tiny bolts and screws to huge lumps of fuselage and are to be found in two main regions : low Earth orbit , a few hundred miles above Earth , and geostationary orbit , 22,300 miles up , where communication satellites are programmed to hover above the planet .
In low Earth orbit , pieces of debris pose particular problems .
They could strike manned spacecraft and lead to fatal depressurisation , space experts warn .
In 1991 , a space shuttle had to carry out an emergency seven - second burn of its engines to avoid being struck by part of a Russian Cosmos satellite .
Low - orbiting debris also poses a risk to Earth itself .
In 2006 , pieces of a Russian spy satellite burnt up in the atmosphere , passing perilously close to a Latin American Airbus carrying 270 passengers over the Pacific .
To date , only one person has been injured by space debris , however : an Oklahoma woman who was hit in the shoulder by a piece of a Delta rocket 's fuel tank , but who was uninjured by this extraterrestrial attack .
The problem , according to the Association for the Advancement of Space Safety report , is that up to 20 countries are now able to launch objects into space - but very few of these have rigid safety protocols .
Nor is the problem of space debris confined to near Earth , it adds .
Satellites in geostationary orbit are supposed to be moved farther into space after they become defunct - but often that obligation is not met .
More than 200 dead satellites now litter this vital part of space .
Within 10 years that number could increase fivefold , warns the report .
The resulting chaos could lead to serious damage or loss of a spacecraft .
' Unfortunately we may have to wait for something to happen , perhaps a big near miss , before people realise we can't go on as we are , ' Crowther said .
Feb. 29 confuses United 's software
Passengers using United Airlines ' " Easy Check - In " found it anything but that on Leap Day when the automated system failed , resulting in longer lines at its U.S. airport counters .
The airline blamed the service interruption on software issues related to the leap year .
Spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said customers could n't get Easy Check - In kiosks to confirm that they had been checked in or print out their boarding passes for several hours .
McCarthy said no flights were delayed because of the problem .
The airline apologized to customers for any inconvenience .
She said United did n't have any such problems with the software on Leap Day four years ago .
Mr Zoellick called for a " new deal " to help ward off a food crisis The World Bank has announced emergency measures to tackle rising food prices around the world .
World Bank head Robert Zoellick warned that 100 million people in poor countries could be pushed deeper into poverty by spiralling prices .
The crisis has sparked recent food riots in several countries including Haiti and Egypt .
The World Bank endorsed Mr Zoellick 's " new deal " action plan for a long - term boost to agricultural production .
Emergency help would include an additional $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) to Haiti , where several people were killed in food riots last week , and a doubling of agricultural loans to African farmers .
Starvation risk Mr Zoellick 's proposals were endorsed by the World Bank 's steering committee of finance and development ministers at a meeting in Washington .
We have to put our money where our mouth is now so that we can put food into hungry mouths
Robert Zoellick
World Bank head The World Bank and its sister organisation , the IMF , have held a weekend of meetings that addressed rising food and energy prices as well as the credit crisis upsetting global financial markets .
The leader of the International Monetary Fund last week said hundreds of thousands of people were at risk of starvation because of food shortages .
Prices have risen sharply in recent months , driven by increased demand , poor weather in some countries that has ruined crops and reduced production area , thanks to an increase in the use of land to grow crops for transport fuels .
The price of staple crops such as wheat , rice and corn have all risen , leading to an increase in overall food prices of 83 % in the last three years , the World Bank has said .
GLOBAL FOOD PRICE RISES Wheat : 130 % Soya : 87 % Rice : 74 % Corn : 31 % Time : Year to March 2008

Food costs : facts & figures
The sharp rises have led to protests and unrest in many countries , including Egypt , Ivory Coast , Ethiopia , the Philippines and Indonesia .
In Haiti , protests last week turned violent , leading to the deaths of five people and the fall of the government .
Restrictions on rice exports have been put in place in major producing countries such as India , China , Vietnam and Egypt .
Importers such as Bangladesh , the Philippines and Afghanistan have been hit hard .
Rich urged to act " We have to put our money where our mouth is now so that we can put food into hungry mouths , " Mr Zoellick said .
" It 's as stark as that . "
He called for more aid to provide food to needy people in poor countries and help for small farmers .
He said the World Bank was working to provide money for seeds for planting in the new season .
He also urged wealthy donor countries to quickly fill the World Food Programme 's estimated $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) funding shortfall .
Mr Zoellick 's " New Deal for Global Food Policy " also seeks to boost agricultural policy in poor countries in the longer - term .
On Saturday , the head of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , warned of mass starvation and other dire consequences if food prices continued to rise sharply .
" As we know , learning from the past , those kind of questions sometimes end in war , " he said .
He said the problem could lead to trade imbalances that may eventually affect developed nations , " so it is not only a humanitarian question " .

What are these ?
Early Friday morning , March 7 , one of the world 's most endangered species --a North Island brown kiwi -- hatched at the Smithsonian 's National Zoo Bird House .
Keepers had been incubating the egg for five weeks , following a month long incubation by the chick 's father , carefully monitoring it for signs of pipping : the process in which the chick starts to break through the shell .
The chick remained in an isolet for four days and is now in a specially designed brooding box .
The box will be not be on exhibit , but will be accessible on Friday , March 14 , by webcam on the Zoo 's Web site at http://nationalzoo. si. edu/ Animals / Birds / Kiwi / default .

Since kiwis are nocturnal , the best time to view the chick exploring and foraging in its box will be in the evening .
The sex of the chick is still unknown and is difficult to determine by sight .
For this reason , Bird House staff enlisted the help of National Zoo geneticists .
Using DNA samples swabbed from the inside of the egg and from the bird 's beak , the geneticists hope to decipher its sex in the coming weeks .
This is only the third time in the Zoo 's history that a kiwi has successfully hatched .
The first hatching occurred in 1975 and was the first to occur outside of New Zealand .
The National Zoo did not have another successful hatching until 2005 ; that male bird , Manaia , may currently be seen Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays at the 11 a.m.
" Meet a Kiwi " program at the National Zoo's Bird House .
Kiwis in captivity are extremely rare -- only four zoos outside of New Zealand have successfully bred kiwis , and only three U.S. zoos , including the National Zoo , exhibit them .
There are five species of kiwi and all are unique to New Zealand .
The North Island brown species of kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand .
They are widely thought to be the most ancient bird and have existed in New Zealand for more than 30 million years .
Kiwis typically mate for life , and both parents share the responsibility of caring for the egg .
After kiwi chicks hatch , however , they receive no parental care .
Unlike other bird species , kiwis hatch fully feathered and equipped with all of the necessary skills they need to survive .
The North Island brown kiwi species is classified as endangered by the International Union of Conservation of Nature .
The wild population is declining at a rate of approximately 5.8 percent a year .
Nearly 60 percent of all wild North Island brown kiwi chicks are killed by stoats , a species of weasel and an introduced predator .
The remaining wild population of the North Island brown kiwi is estimated at roughly 24,000 , down from 60,000 in the 1980s .

The performance aspect of Acid3 The Acid3 test says " To pass the test , a browser must use its default settings , the animation has to be smooth , the score has to end on 100/100 , and the final page has to look exactly , pixel for pixel , like this reference rendering " .
( Emphasis mine . )
There has been some question as to what " the animation has to be smooth " means .
The idea is to make sure that browsers focus on performance as well as standards .
Performance is n't a standards - compliance issue , but it is something that affects all Web authors and users .
If a browser passes all 100/100 subtests and gets the rendering pixel - for - pixel correct ( including the favicon ! ) , then it has passed the standards - compliance parts of the Acid3 test .
The rest is just a competition for who can be the fastest .
To determine the " score " for performance in a browser that gets 100/100 , click on the " A " of " Acid3 " on the test after having run the test twice ( so that the test uses the browser 's cache ) .
An alert should pop up , giving a total time elapsed , and reporting any tests that took longer than 33ms .
Test 26 is the only one that should take any significant amount of time , as it contains a tight loop doing some common DOM and JS operations .
The test has " passed " , for the purposes of the " smoothness " criteria , if all the tests took less than 33ms ( it'll give you a message saying " No JS errors and no timing issues . " if this happens ) .
Then the only issue is the total time — is it faster than all the other browsers ?
An important question is " using what hardware ? " .
Performance tests vary depending on the hardware , so some " reference platform " has to be picked to make a decision .
Since " computer " browsers are the first priority with Acid3 , as opposed to browsers for phones or other small devices , and since we want the hardware to be able to run the three major platforms of today , I have decided that the " reference hardware " is whatever the top - of - the - line Apple laptop is at the time the test is run .
As hardware improves , performance improves too , so to take this into account test 26 is set up to take longer and longer over time .
Today I calibrated the test so that the performance it expects is plausible and will remain so for the next few years , based on results that browsers get on the past few years of Mac laptops .

The antialiasing controversy in Acid3
The Acid3 test has a rendering subtest that checks the positioning of text in particular conditions ( absolutely - positioned generated content with embedded fonts ) .
To get precise results , I used a single glyph from the Ahem font , which has well - known metrics .
My plan was to have the glyph set up so that a perfect white 20 × 20 pixel square glyph from the font would be overlaid exactly on a 20 × 20 pixel square red background , thus hiding everything when things lined up .
I positioned this test in the upper right hand corner , snug against the black border of the test .
The problem with this test is that on some platforms , specifically Mac platforms with LCD antialiasing , the font rendering system actually renders the glyph using sub - pixel effects , which ends up overlapping the border and makes the test not look the same as the reference rendering .
This would affect any browser , but only on Mac .
Unfortunately , the WebKit team " fixed " this problem by simply hard - coding the Ahem font and making it not antialias .
Now , I argue that this is a bug in the antialiasing , but sadly there 's no real spec for the antialiasing and so other people argue that it should n't be in the test in the first place , whether I 'm right or wrong .
What we all agree on is that the font - specific hack is lame .
( It 's especially bad with this font because Ahem is supposed to be a testing font and we specifically do n't want it going down different codepaths ! )
So Hyatt and I came to a deal .
I would move the test down and to the left one pixel , so it does n't affect the border anymore , he would accept to remove the hack , and would fix one additional bug ( a background - position rounding bug ) .
This does n't affect Opera 's news of their progress , as their build is currently only available on Windows .
The test will probably have a few more minor changes as people track down the last few remaining problems , in particular in the SVG subtests and on the performance part of test 26 .
( Test 26 is supposed to track the incremental speed of computer hardware , but it has n't been really calibrated well yet , I just estimated what the numbers should be . )
It 's great to see WebKit and Opera work so hard on interoperability issues such as those brought up by Acid3 .
The Microsoft and Mozilla teams are currently in the " crunch time " of their respective browsers ' releases , so it 's expected that they would n't be working on this at this time — at the end of a release cycle , stability , performance , and user experience are usually much more critical .
Hopefully once IE8 and Firefox3 are released they will be able to turn once more to the world of standards and we 'll see big improvements of the Web platform again .

Tests that are never quite finished Since we announced the Acid3 test a few short weeks ago , two major browser vendors have been tripping over themselves trying to pass the test , with both Opera and Safari getting very close in the last few hours .
Of course , with a test as complex as this one , I was bound to make some mistakes , which the browser vendors were very quick to tell me about .
Sometimes they were mistaken , and the test was actually correct ; other times I was wrong , and had to fix the test , and in one case , the spec changed .
Here 's a quick overview of the more major changes I made to the test .
Luckily , none of the errors were too serious .
Sub - pixel testing
It turns out that the original test accidentally required that browsers implement sub - pixel positioning and layout ( and in fact the reference rendering got it wrong too , and relied on the same kind of rounding as Firefox does ) , which is somewhat dubious .
I 've changed the test to not rely on sub - pixel layout .
However , it is very likely that this will be tested in Acid4 , if we can get the specs to be clearer on this .
Surrogate pairs in SVG APIs
One of the submitted tests assumed that SVG APIs worked on Unicode codepoints , but the SVG spec changed to work on UTF - 16 codepoints , like the rest of the DOM API , so the test was changed there .
( The test changed a couple of times , because I originally got the fix wrong . )
The click ( ) method
The test originally assumed that the click ( ) method was reentrant , but the specs were vague on this and someone suggested making it fail if calls to it were nested , so I removed this part of the test ( the spec has n't been updated yet ) .
I replaced it with an attribute test ( the new second part of subtest 64 ) .
The Performance Test I made the loop counter in the performance test ( a part of subtest 63 ) less complicated and shorter , to make it at least plausible that browsers could be fixed to pass that test quickly enough that it would n't always feel jerky .
At the same time , I updated the test 's infrastructure to report more details about pass and fail conditions and how long each subtest takes to run .
Namespace bug Someone noticed that http://www.w3.org/1998/XML/namespace should have been
http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace in one of the subtests .
Linktest timeout I made the linktest more resilient to slow network conditions .
However , the test is still going to give you major issues if you are on a network with multi-second latency , or if the acidtests.org site is being slow .
When we released Acid2 , the first browser passed it in about a fortnight .
Acid3 is orders of magnitude more complicated .
I really did n't expect to see passing browsers this side of August , let alone within a month .
I am really impressed by the level of commitment to standards that Opera and the WebKit team ( and Apple in particular ) are showing here .

Moebius
After baking it for several weeks , we have finally decided Acid3 is stable enough to announce it is ready .
We 'll be working on a guide and other commentary in the coming weeks and months , but it 'll take a while — Acid3 is far more complex than Acid2 was .
I have to say straight up that I 've been really impressed with the WebKit team .
Even before the test was finished , they were actively following up every single bug the test showed .
Safari 3 ( the last released version ) scores 39/100 with bad rendering errors .
At the start of last month their nightly builds were scoring about 60/100 with serious rendering errors .
Now barely a month later the nightly builds are already up to 87/100 and most of the rendering errors are fixed .
That 's a serious testament to their commitment to standards .
( Also , I have to say , it was quite difficult to find standards compliance bugs in WebKit to use in the test .
I had to go the extra mile to get WebKit to score low !
This was not the case with most of the other browsers . )
Speaking of standards , and of good news from browser development teams , Microsoft 's IE team announced today that they were changing their mind about their mode switch , and that bug fixes they make to their rendering engine will be applied to pages in what HTML5 calls " no- quirks " mode ( what has historically been known as " standards mode " ) .
I 'd like to congratulate the IE team on this brave decision .
It 's the right thing for the Web .
Meanwhile , HTML5 continues to make good progress .
I have a page now which shows my progress in replying to e-mails , and as you can see from the changelog tracker , checkins are as fast and furious as ever .

音楽や映像コンテンツの著作権やその保護手段に関連する問題をめぐり，機器メーカーと著作権や著作隣接権の権利者団体との間で対立が深まっている。日経エレクトロニクスでは，著作権法の研究者であり，「MiAU（インターネット先進ユーザーの会）」の発起人の一人でもある白田氏に，こうした一連の議論と著作権法そのものの在り方について聞いた。日経エレクトロニクス2007年12月17日号に掲載したインタビューの全文を掲載する。（聞き手＝竹居
智久，山田 剛良）
－なぜ機器メーカーと権利者団体の間の溝が深まってしまったのでしょうか。
写真：栗原 克己
著作権関連のある権利者団体の人と公開討論会で同席した時のことです。その人の「メーカーの皆様には，コンテンツの権利を尊重するテクノロジー作りをお願いしたい」という発言に私はがくぜんとし，その場で強硬に抗議しました。
法の中心にあるのは自由です。技術者がどのような技術を開発するかは技術者が決めること。機器の質を高めるために技術の先鋭化を進めるのが技術者の本分です。これに対して，現在の秩序を崩さない丸まった技術だけを要求する。他人の自由を侵す傲慢に無自覚すぎると感じたからです。知的な営みの一つである技術開発は，文明を支えてきました。それが，ある特定の産業を守るために方向性を指図されたり，我慢したりするというのは，相当おかしな状態です。
例えばDAT。最近はすっかり見掛けなくなりました。著作物を技術的に保護する手段によって，不便さが目立つ機器になってしまったのが理由の一つだと思います。権利者の要求に応えるために，ユーザーに迷惑をかける機能をわざわざ実装する。その結果，自分が一生懸命設計した機器が消えてしまう。そのときの技術者の気持ちを思うと本当に悲しくなります。
私は昔からラジコンやオーディオ，コンピュータのプログラミングなどの趣味にかなりの時間を費やしており，理系の道に進みたいという思いがありました。残念ながら挫折して法学の道に進んだのですが，著作権法の研究を志したキッカケの一つは，コンピュータのプログラムに著作権が関係すると知ったことでした。現在でも高性能オーディオ機器などから透けて見える，可能な限りシンプルなシステムこそが最善であるといった技術者的な思想に強く共感しています。
音楽などの創作物には，素晴らしいものが多くありますし，その作者らによる知的努力を心から尊敬します。かといって，技術者の知的努力や「開発した技術を残したい」という思いをないがしろにしていいのでしょうか。著作権関連の権利者団体の人にこういう疑問を投げ掛けると，たいてい「それは関係ない」という答えが返ってきてしまいます。最近のメーカーと権利者団体のやり取りを見ていると，メーカーの技術者たちに，権利者の主張は受け入れるべきものという固定観念があるように感じます。法律も人間が作ったものであり，絶対ではない。「この決まりはおかしい。社会的な不利益が生じる」と技術者や産業界は強く主張してもよいのです。
Immigration is good for the financial health of Social Security because more workers mean more tax revenue .
Illegal immigration , it turns out , is even better than legal immigration .
In the fine print of the 2008 annual report on Social Security , released last week , the program ’s trustees noted that growing numbers of “ other than legal ” workers are expected to bolster the program over the coming decades .
One reason is that many undocumented workers pay taxes during their work lives but do n’t collect benefits later .
Another is that undocumented workers are entering the United States at ever younger ages and are expected to have more children while they ’re here than if they arrived at later ages .
The result is a substantial increase in the number of working - age people paying taxes , but a relatively smaller increase in the number of retirees who receive benefits  a double boon to Social Security ’s bottom line .
We ’re not talking chump change .
According to the report , the taxes paid by other - than - legal immigrants will close 15 percent of the system ’s projected long - term deficit .
That ’s equivalent to raising the payroll tax by 0.3 percentage points , starting today .
That is not to suggest that illegal immigration is a legitimate fix to Social Security ’s problems .
It is another reminder , however , of the nation ’s complex relationship with undocumented workers .
Would the people who want to deport all undocumented workers be willing to make up the difference and pay the taxes that the undocumented are currently paying ?

Exactly as the British press predicted , last week ’s congressional testimony by Gen. David Petraeus and Green Zone administrator Ryan Crocker set the propaganda stage for a Bush regime attack on Iran .
On April 10 Robert H. Reid of AP
News reported : " The top US commander has shifted the focus from al - Qaida to Iranian - backed u2018 special groups ’ as the main threat . . .
The shift was articulated by Gen. Petraeus who told Congress that u2018unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq . ’ "
According to the neocon propaganda , the " special groups " ( have you ever heard of them before ? ) are breakaway elements of al Sadr ’s militia .
Nonsensical on its face , the Petraeus / Crocker testimony is just another mask in the macabre theatre of lies that the Bush regime has told in order to justify its wars of naked aggression against Muslims .
Fact # 1 : Al Sadr is not allied with Iran .
He speaks with an Iraqi voice and has his militia under orders to stand down from conflict .
The Badr militia is the Shi’ite militia that is allied with Iran .
Why did the US and its Iraqi puppet Maliki attack al Sadr ’s militia and not the Badr militia or the breakaway elements of Sadr ’s militia that allegedly now operate as gangs ?
Fact # 2 : The Shi’ite militias and the Sunni insurgents are armed with weapons available from the unsecured weapon stockpiles of Saddam Hussein ’s army .
If Iran were arming Iraqis , the Iraqi insurgents and militias would have armor- piercing rocket - propelled grenades and surface - to - air missiles .
These two weapons would neutralize the US advantage by enabling Iraqis to destroy US helicopter gunships , aircraft and tanks .
The Iraqis cannot mass their forces as they have no weapons against US air power .
To destroy US tanks , Iraqis have to guess the roads US vehicles will travel and bury bombs constructed from artillery shells .
The inability to directly attack armor and to defend against air attack denies offensive capability to Iraqis .
If the Iranians desired to arm Iraqis , they obviously would provide these two weapons that would change the course of the war .
Just as the Bush regime lied to Americans and the UN about why Iraq was attacked , hiding the real agenda behind false claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and connections to al Qaeda , the Bush regime is now lying about why it needs to attack Iran .
Could anyone possibly believe that Iran is so desirous of having its beautiful country bombed and its nuclear energy program destroyed that Iran would invite an attack by fighting a " proxy war " against the US in Iraq ?
That the Bush regime would tell such a blatant lie shows that the regime has no respect for the intelligence of the American public and no respect for the integrity of the US media .
And why should it ?
The public and media have fallen for every lie the Bush regime has told .
The moral hypocrisy of US politicians is unrivaled .
McCain says that if he were president he would not attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics because China has killed and injured 100 Tibetans who protested Tibet ’s occupation by China .
Meanwhile the Iraqi toll of the American occupation is one million dead and four million displaced .
That comes to 20 % of the Iraqi population .
At what point does the US occupation of Iraq graduate from a war crime to genocide ?
Not to be outdone by McCain ’s hypocrisy , Bush declared : " The message to the Iranians is : we will bring you to justice if you continue to try to infiltrate , send your agents or send surrogates to bring harm to our troops and / or the Iraqi citizens . "
Consider our " Christian " president ’s position :
It is perfectly appropriate for the US to bomb and to invade countries and to send its agents and surrogates to harm Iraqis , Afghans , Somalians , Serbians and whomever , but resistance to American aggression is the mark of terrorism , and any country that aids America ’s victims is at war with America .
The three - week " cakewalk " war that would be paid for by Iraqi oil revenues is now into its sixth year .
According to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz , the cost of the war to Americans is between three and five trillion dollars .
Five trillion dollars equals the entire US personal and corporate income tax revenues for two years .
Of what benefit is this enormous expenditure to America ?
The price of oil and gasoline in US dollars has tripled , the price of gold has quadrupled , and the dollar has declined sharply against other currencies .
The national debt has rapidly mounted .
America ’s reputation is in tatters .
The Bush regime ’s coming attack on Iran will widen the war dramatically and escalate the costs .
Not content with war with Iran , Republican presidential candidate John McCain in a speech written for him by neocon warmonger Robert Kagan promises to confront both Russia and China .
Three questions present themselves :
Will our foreign creditors — principally China , Japan and Saudi Arabia — finance a third monstrous Bush regime war crime ?
Will Iran sit on its hands and wait on the American bombs to fall ?
Will Russia and China passively wait to be confronted by the warmonger McCain ?
Should a country that is over - extended in Iraq and Afghanistan be preparing to attack yet a third country , while threatening to interfere in the affairs of two large nuclear powers ?
What sort of political leadership seeks to initiate conflict in so many unpromising directions ?
With Iran , Russia , China , and North Korea threatened by American hegemonic belligerence , it is not difficult to imagine a scenario that would terminate all pretense of American power :
For example , instead of waiting to be attacked , Iran uses its Chinese and Russian anti-ship missiles , against which the US reportedly has poor means of defense , and sinks every ship in the American carrier strike forces that have been foolishly massed in the Persian Gulf , simultaneously taking out the Saudi oil fields and the Green Zone in Baghdad , the headquarters of the US occupation .
Shi’ite militias break the US supply lines from Kuwait , and Iranian troops destroy the dispersed US forces in Iraq before they can be concentrated to battle strength .
Simultaneously , North Korea crosses the demilitarized zone and takes South Korea , China seizes Taiwan and dumps a trillion dollars of US Treasury bonds on the market .
Russia goes on full nuclear alert and cuts off all natural gas to Europe .
What would the Bush regime do ?
Wet its pants ?
Push the button and end the world ?
If America really had dangerous enemies , surely the enemies would collude to take advantage of a dramatically over - extended delusional regime that , blinded by its own arrogance and hubris , issues gratuitous threats and lives by Mao ’s doctrine that power comes out of the barrel of a gun .
There are other less dramatic scenarios .
Why does the US assume that only it can initiate aggression , boycotts , freezes on financial assets of other countries and bans on foreign banks from participation in the international banking system ?
If the rest of the world were to tire of American aggression or to develop a moral conscience , it would be easy to organize a boycott of America and to ban US banks from participating in the international banking system .
Such a boycott would be especially effective at the present time with the balance sheets of US banks impaired by subprime derivatives and the US government dependent on foreign loans in order to finance its day - to - day activities .
Sooner or later it will occur to other countries that putting up with America is a habit that they do n’t need to continue .
Does America really need more political leadership that leads in such unpromising directions ?

More than two million have been displaced by the conflict
An estimated 300,000 people may have died as a result of the Darfur conflict , the UN head of humanitarian affairs John Holmes says .
That is an increase of 50 % from the previous figure of 200,000 killed in the five years of fighting in the region in western Sudan .
Mr Holmes gave the revised total to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York .
Sudan disputes the figure , saying 10,000 are now known to have died .
The previous figure of 200,000 came from a 2006 study by the World Health Organisation .
It included those killed in the fighting itself as well as people who died from disease and malnutrition because of the conflict .
The 2006 figure " must be much higher now - perhaps as much as half again , " Mr Holmes said .
He said the new total was an extrapolation from the previous figure and was not based on a new study .
Disputed figure Speaking later to reporters , Mr Holmes added : " I am not trying to suggest this is a very scientifically - based figure .
It is extrapolated from the 2006 figure , it is not new research . "
Mr Holmes said : " We continue to see the goal posts receding to the point where peace in Darfur seems further away today than ever . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Holmes ' comments were hotly disputed by the Sudanese ambassador to the UN , Abdul Mahmoud Abdel - Halim , who accused him of exaggerating the figure .
" These remarks by Holmes are not helpful , are not correct , are not credible , " Mr Abdel - Halim told the Reuters news agency .
" He should tell us who made that study , who commissioned it and how was it done . "
Mr Abdel - Halim put the number who died at 10,000 , which is 1,000 higher than the Khartoum government 's previous estimate .
The Sudanese number only comprises those who have died in combat , he said .
Eric Reeves , the American author of a book on Darfur , " A long day 's dying " says the figure may be even higher than that estimated by Mr Holmes .
" We know that the figure has been far too low , for far too long , " Mr Reeves told the BBC .
" Mr Holmes said that 300,000 was a conservative figure .
In my own view based on many mortality assessments , looking at all the data that I can put my hands on the figure is likely to be closer to 500,000 , " he said .
He also said that the government in Khartoum was refusing to allow mortality studies to be conducted in Darfur .
Peacekeeping force The Security Council was also told that the joint UN - African Union peacekeeping force for Darfur is unlikely to be up to full strength this year .
The joint UN - AU special representative for Darfur , Rodolphe Adada , said troop levels in the UNAMID mission he leads " is at less than 40 % of its mandated level of 19,555 and it is very unlikely to achieve full - operating capability before 2009 " .
After the meeting , he suggested the force could reach 80 % of its strength at the end of this year as attempts were made to accelerate deployment .
The conflict in Darfur in western Sudan began in 2003 after rebel groups began attacking government targets , saying their communities were being discriminated against in favour of Arabs .
In retaliation , the government launched a military and police campaign in Darfur , prompting 2 m people to leave their homes .
Arab Janjaweed militia are accused of following up on government raids on villages with a campaign of murder and rape .
The Sudanese government denies links to the Janjaweed , but admits establishing " self - defence militias " .
It says the problems have been exaggerated .

What are these ?
The gunmen were dressed in military uniforms and took weapons from a police station in Bartica , 80 miles ( 130 km ) south - west of the capital Georgetown .
The attack is the second blamed on gangs in recent weeks .
On 26 January , 11 people - including five children - were killed when gunmen attacked the village of Lusignan .
At least six gunmen arrived in Bartica late on Sunday by a speedboat on the Essequibo River and attacked the town 's police station , regional official Hilbert Knights said .
' Attacked in bed '
Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy said nine of the civilians killed included five people who were sleeping in hammocks alongside the river , outside Bartica 's police station .
The town of 15,000 people is a supply centre for miners prospecting for gold and diamonds in the country 's interior .
Police believe that Guyana 's most - wanted man - alleged gang leader Rondell Rawlins - is responsible for the January killings in Lusignan .
He has accused the authorities of kidnapping his 18 - year - old pregnant girlfriend and has promised to carry out further attacks .
Authorities have offered a reward of $ 150,000 for the capture of Mr Rawlins , who is also wanted over the murder of a government minister in 2006 .
Senator Hillary Clinton has charged that Senator Barack Obama has plagiarized a line from current Massachusettes Governor Deval Patrick .
In response to charges that Patrick 's campaign for Governor was filled merely with soaring " words , " Patrick said that by that measurement , the " I Have A Dream , " and " All men are created equal " lines were just words too .
Obama responded to Clinton 's charges the same way in a recent speech .
Patrick has responded to these allegations by saying that he did n't mind Obama using the line , as they share ideas often .
Patrick has also endorsed Senator Obama for the Presidency .
Senator Clinton failed to mention that she herself has done the exact same thing .
A YouTube user posted a video of her campaigning before the Iowa caucus , stealing Obama 's phrase " Fired Up and Ready To Go . "

( CNN ) -- President Bush on Thursday said " serious and complex challenges " remain in Iraq that will prevent further withdrawals of U.S. troops this summer despite a reduction in violence in the past year .
President Bush said Thursday that there is " much work ahead " in Iraq but that progress is being made .
Speaking after two days of congressional testimony by the top U.S. officials in Iraq , Bush credited his deployment of nearly 30,000 additional troops last year for a " major strategic shift " in the conflict .
The president also announced he will reduce combat tours from 15 to 12 months , citing the heavy strain on troops and their families .
The shortened tours would apply only to troops deployed on or after August 1 and would not cut back tours for those currently in Iraq .
" Our nation owes a special thanks to the soldiers and families who have supported this extended deployment , " Bush said .
Bush 's progress report on Iraq comes after he met with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , U.S. ambassador to Iraq .
Watch what Bush says about the pause in withdrawals »
Petraeus and Crocker spent two days this week on Capitol Hill testifying on the status of the 5 - year - old war .
The president said there is " much work ahead " in Iraq but noted cooperation from the Iraqis is stronger than ever .
" All our efforts are aimed at a clear goal : a free Iraq that can protect its people , support itself economically and take charge of its own political affairs .
No one wants to achieve this goal more than the Iraqis themselves , " he said .
The president said Iraq is moving forward on the economic front and is expected eventually to shoulder the full burden of its security costs .
Bush also warned Iran against arming Shiite Muslim militants in Iraq , saying that the Islamic republic " has a choice to make . "
" If Iran makes the wrong choice , America will act to protect our interests , our troops and our Iraqi partners , " he said .
Petraeus on Tuesday recommended that troop withdrawals from Iraq be paused for 45 days after July when U.S. forces in Iraq will be reduced to 140,000 .
Watch Petraeus explain the role of U.S. troops in Iraq »
Bush accepted this recommendation Thursday , saying Petraeus will " have all the time he needs . "
Asked whether further reductions could resume after the pause , Petraeus told lawmakers earlier this week that future troop levels should be based on conditions on the ground .
" War is not a linear phenomenon , " he said .
" It 's a calculus , not arithmetic . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates ordered Army tours in Iraq and Afghanistan extended to 15 months in April 2007 to sustain the additional deployment to Iraq -- but top Army officials have warned that the war has left the service " out of balance , " as Gen .
Richard Cody , the service 's vice chief of staff , told a House committee Wednesday .
Gates said in a Senate hearing Thursday afternoon that he did not expect Petraeus ' review to be lengthy , adding that he hoped there would be further troop withdrawals in the fall .
Sen . Carl Levin of Michigan , a Democrat critical of the conduct of the war in Iraq , seized on the differing views .
" What recommendation did President Bush adopt a few hours ago ?
Gen. Petraeus ' open - ended approach or Secretary Gates ' brief pause ? " he demanded .
" The answer is Gen. Petraeus ' . "
Despite Gates ' professed optimism about further troop withdrawals , he acknowledged that levels will not fall as low as 100,000 by January of next year , as he had hoped in September 2007 .
The Democratic leaders of Congress , who have pushed unsuccessfully to end the war since winning control of the House and Senate in 2006 , said Bush 's speech showed the president plans to leave the widely unpopular war in the lap of his successor when he leaves office in 2009 .
" The president has a timeline -- January 20th of next year , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said .
" Our troops also need a timeline . "
" The president still does n't understand that America 's limited resources cannot support this endless war that he 's gotten us involved in , " Reid said .
Watch Reid 's harsh words for Bush »
" His announcement -- while some look to as a great victory -- is , I say , two steps backward and one step forward . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said that " we need better answers from the president . "
" The president has taken us into a failed war , he 's taken us deeply into debt and he 's taking -- that debt is taking us into recession .
We need some answers from the president , " she said .
The war in Iraq has claimed more than 4,000 U.S. lives and cost an estimated $ 600 billion since 2003 .
It is widely unpopular at home , with a March CNN poll showing about two - thirds of the country opposes the conflict .

All About George W. Bush • Iraq War
When biochemist Magdy Mahmoud Mustafa el - Nashar was released from custody in Cairo in 2005 , no one could have be more relieved than the vacationing former student and his family .
Falsely accused by British authorities for alleged links to the July 7 , 2005 London transport bombings that killed 52 and maimed 700 , el - Nashar was taken into custody in Egypt because he had casually known two of the suicide bombers .
He had met them while obtaining a Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of Leeds .
When freed , el - Nashar told the International Herald Tribune ,
The reason for suspecting me was because I specialize in chemistry .
I am completely innocent , ” he said , adding that he planned legal action against British media that he said had defamed him .
He did not identify the media .
Released unharmed by Egypt ’s notoriously torture - prone Interior Ministry police , el - Nashar lived to tell the tale .
But unbeknownst to the former North Carolina State University student there was a disturbing backstory to his arrest .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) released a damning report Tuesday documenting the FBI ’s abuse of the process for obtaining a National Security Letter ( NSL ) in connection with its probe of el - Nashar .
Incredibly , the Bureau delayed its own investigation in North Carolina “ by forcing a field agent to return documents acquired from a U.S. university , ” Ryan Singel reports .
Why ?
Because the agent received the documents through a lawful subpoena , while headquarters wanted him to demand the records under the USA Patriot Act , using a power the FBI did not have , but desperately wanted .
When a North Carolina State University lawyer correctly rejected the second records demand , the FBI obtained another subpoena .
Two weeks later , the delay was cited by FBI director Robert Mueller in congressional testimony as proof that the USA Patriot Act needed to be expanded .
That ’s right .
The investigation into a suspected accomplice to mass murder was sidetracked because FBI bureaucrats sought additional powers they “ desperately wanted , ” in order to escape judicial oversight and expand their brief to shower the public with flimsy National Security Letters .
During 2004 - 2005 for example , the Bureau issued some 100,000 NSLs , often on no more than a hunch .
Under provisions of the oppressive USA Patriot Act , Bureau gumshoes can issue NSLs without probable cause to obtain phone records , e-mails , credit reports and bank statements so long as the request is relevant to a “ terrorism ” or “ espionage ” investigation .
Unlike grand jury subpoenas however , NSLs have no expiration date and recipients of these baneful warrants are bound by draconian gag orders forever forbidding disclosure of their content .
Violations can result in stiff fines and even a stint in federal prison .
According to an EFF Press Release ,
In the report , EFF used documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request coupled with public information to detail the bizarre turns in the FBI ’s investigation of a former North Carolina State University student .
Over the span of three days in July of 2005 , FBI documents show that the bureau first obtained the educational records of the suspect with a grand jury subpoena .
However , at the direction of FBI headquarters , agents returned the records and then requested them again through an improper NSL .
EFF ’s Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl denounced this egregious flim - flam by FBI Director Robert F. Mueller when he testified before Congress in 2005 :
The FBI consistently asks for more power and less outside supervision .
Yet here the NSL power was misused at the direction of FBI headquarters , and only after review by FBI lawyers .
Oversight and legislative reforms are necessary to ensure that these powerful tools are not abused .
However , in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday , FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni claimed that the FBI ’s misuse of the NSL in the el - Nashar case may have been the result of “ miscommunication . ”
According to EFF , citing a 2007 report by Caproni ’s Office of the General Counsel ,
the FBI ’s Charlotte Division , “ acted upon the advice and direction of FBIHQ [ and ] Charlotte personnel sought legal advice prior to the service of the NSL . ”
FBI documents show that the NSL at issue was reviewed by the Senior Supervisory Special Agent for the Raleigh office , and then reviewed by the Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Division before being signed .
Attentive readers may recall that Caproni had earlier rejected a ruling by the secretive FISA court that had rebuffed Bureau requests to obtain sensitive records because “ the ‘ facts ’ were too thin ” and the “ request implicated the target ’s First Amendment rights . ”
The FBI used an NSL as a “ work around ” and proceeded anyway .
Why ?
Because the Bureau ’s General Counsel believed “ it was appropriate to issue the letters in such cases because she disagreed with the court ’s conclusions . ” [ emphasis added ]
Meanwhile , the ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday “ to uncover the extent of the FBI ’s misuse of National Security Letter powers . ”
According to the ACLU :
Specifically , the lawsuit seeks the release of records pertaining to the FBI ’s use of NSLs at the behest of other agencies including the Department of Defense ( DoD ) as well as documents concerning the FBI ’s use of its gag power .
Newly un-redacted documents released to the ACLU last month in a separate Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit revealed that the Defense Department is using the FBI to circumvent legal limits on its own NSL power and may be obtaining sensitive records of people within the U.S. to which the military is not otherwise entitled , simply by asking the FBI to issue the record demands .
While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI - issued NSLs is mandatory , the Defense Department ’s NSL power is more limited in scope .
To make matters worse in the el - Nashar case , the Bureau tried to cover up the incident by failing to report it for nearly two years to the Intelligence Oversight Board ( IOB ) .
That is , until shortly before Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine ’s report on FBI NSL abuse was due before Congress .
Statutory requirements demand that potential violations be reported to the IOB within 14 days .
Not that we can expect any earth - shattering “ oversight ” from a de-fanged IOB .
As I wrote last month , the Bush administration quietly stripped the “ independent ” IOB of much of its authority to root out illegal spying activities by the intelligence “ community . ”
As I noted then , a little noticed February 29 executive order signed by Bush gutted the board ’s mandate to refer illegal activities by the national security state to the Justice Department .
“ Self - policing ” at its finest in the Bushist panopticon !
What little “ oversight ” remains are in the hands of a compliant Congress , more attuned to the needs of their real “ constituents , ” the horde of well - heeled corporate lobbyists and their paymasters who rule over an ever - expanding private “ security ” empire .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The clock is chasing down 1 A.M.
It 's late for dinner - or for interviews - in Almaty , Kazakhstan 's former capital .
But self - made Kazakh uranium czar Moukhtar Dzhakishev is just hitting his stride .
Between spoonfuls of Beluga caviar and bites of ruby - colored tuna flown in from Dubai , he is explaining that his small state - owned company , Kazatomprom , will soon rule the global nuclear energy industry .
" I do n't think there will be any competitors , " he says softly .
" I will eat them . "
In Kazakhstan , where the family of President Nursultan Nazarbayev controls much of the country 's abundant resources , Dzhakishev , 44 years old , is a rare breed : a Moscow - educated entrepreneur who took over a floundering mining industry - and the world 's largest uranium deposit outside Australia - when the Soviets broke camp here .
Now , after three years of skyrocketing uranium prices , he has found himself at the forefront of a global uranium boom that is fast making him one of the most powerful men in the country - and increasingly influential beyond it .
Kazakhstan 's ascendancy is far from assured , but Dzhakishev , described by colleagues as Kasparov - sharp and poker - faced , makes it sound as if he already has it all wrapped up .
His confidence might be laughable if his arguments were n't so damn convincing .
As Dzhakishev sees it , a widespread nuclear renaissance is not only inevitable but well underway .
And he 's probably right .
Global warming is weighing heavily on the international conscience , and with it comes a newfound sense of urgency to dispense with coal and other carbon fuels .
No alternative is more developed , economically viable , and emission - free than nuclear energy .
Since world electricity use is expected to double in the next few decades , nearly every industrialized country is considering a fresh buildout of nuclear power .
Worldwide , 34 new reactors are under construction , and 280 are being planned or proposed .
China alone has broken ground on five reactors to feed that nation 's insatiable need for power .
That has raised questions about whether uranium producers can find enough of the element to fuel this long - term growth .
In 2006 producers met only 62 % of demand .
( The rest was recycled from a diminishing supply of decommissioned warheads or taken from dwindling Cold War stockpiles . )
The World Nuclear Association says uranium mining could need to increase by almost 300 % in the next two decades .
Talk of such a crunch has brought the market to fever pitch .
Spot prices for uranium jumped from about $ 7 a pound in late 2000 to a record high of $ 136 in June .
Prices today hover at $ 74 .
More than 400 uranium companies are listed publicly , hedge funds buy warehouses of the stuff , and old U.S. mines are grinding back to life .
Applications for new mines in Colorado and Utah have risen more than 200 % since 2003 .
Internationally , the world 's largest uranium suppliers - Canada 's Cameco , France 's Areva , and Australia 's BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Rio Tinto ( RTP ) - are scouring for pay dirt at a pace rivaled only by Big Oil .
And though existing mines are being expanded in Canada , Australia , and Africa , what producers really want is access to the deposits in Kazakhstan .
" Kazakhstan needs to deliver , " says Nick Carter , an analyst at Ux Consulting , a U.S. research firm .
The boom has put Dzhakishev in an enviable position .
First , he made an audacious promise to more than quintuple production by 2015 , to 27,000 metric tons a year , which could quench the market 's thirst .
Now he wants the world to rely on Kazakhstan for all things nuclear - not just the metal for fuel .
Uranium , which today accounts for a fraction of the nation 's GDP , would become as important for its economy as the $ 35 billion Kazakh oil industry is currently .
In the past few months Dzhakishev has gone on a high - profile international deal - signing tear , landing agreements aimed at transforming Kazatomprom from an obscure Third World mining group to a full - fledged , integrated nuclear energy powerhouse .
Last summer he locked up contracts to ship half of China 's uranium imports , agreed to buy 10 % of U.S. reactor maker Westinghouse ( owned by Japan 's Toshiba ) , and scored a deal with Cameco ( CCJ ) to build a conversion facility , a technologically advanced link in the nuclear fuel cycle .
" It 's been honeymoon , honeymoon , honeymoon , " he gloats .
But the game is far from over .
Dzhakishev 's production forecasts are wildly optimistic , requiring the skilled labor , improved infrastructure , and materials to run 16 new mines .
That would be tough to execute in any business environment ; Kazakhstan is an especially rough - and - tumble place .
It is an emerging market with an autocratic government and a rap sheet for bribery that ranked it near the bottom of Transparency International 's global corruption index last year .
And Dzhakishev 's plan could be laid waste by the kind of volatility to which metals commodities are prone .
When fresh supply flooded the market , the price of uranium plunged last July , sending futures contracts down with it .
" I do n't know if they have the resources to do it , " says Benoit de Galbert , project manager for Katco , Dzhakishev 's joint venture with Areva , who believes a top - to - bottom modernization is needed .
" Dzhakishev is pushing , but sometimes you have the impression he is alone . "
An atypical mine
To get to Kazakhstan 's uranium fields , you hop a short flight west from Almaty along the foothills of the Tian Shan mountains and land on a grass field in Shymkent that 's strewn with Soviet - era planes .
Three hours north by car , where caravans of camels roam an arid steppe , you come upon a series of ten - story windowless boxes .
It does n't look like a typical mine .
The boxes are processing facilities that treat a slurry of uranium , sulfuric acid , and water .
The acid loosens the uranium from its bond with the rock below - a process called in situ leach - and the liquid is sucked out through a giant straw , no digging required .
Production costs as little as $ 10 a pound , a fifth the cost of open - pit mining .
That low cost is part of what has made Kazakhstan 's uranium so attractive .
Raw uranium is found on almost every continent .
Its biggest producers come from the most bountiful regions , like Canada , where literally any backyard might contain a pound of it .
Cameco produces a fifth of the world 's uranium and runs three large mines there .
But in the past year its Cigar Lake mine , which it operates with Areva , has been hobbled by flooding and natural disasters , setting production back perhaps to 2011 .
Australia has the most reserves , about a third of the world 's uranium , but the ore is of poor quality .
The U.S. has mines and fresh exploration but ranks low among world suppliers .
Much of the growth in the industry is coming from Africa , where environmentally destructive open - pit mines continue to be developed , and in Kazakhstan .
Last year Kazatomprom leaped over Rio Tinto and Areva to become the world 's second - largest production company behind Cameco , providing about 5,000 pounds , or 12 % of global supply .
Gondwana was a ‘ supercontinent ' comprised of Antarctica , South America , Africa , Madagascar , Australia - New Guinea , and New Zealand , as well as Arabia and the Indian subcontinent of the Northern Hemisphere .
It existed between 500 and 180 million years ago but geologists have debated for decades over how it eventually broke up .
The two primary camps support a theory claiming the continent separated into many small plates and a second theory believes it broke into a few large pieces .
In a new paper published in ‘ Geophysical Journal International ’ , Dr. Graeme Eagles at the University of London says he has the answer .
Dr Eagles , working with Dr Matthais König from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven , Germany , devised a new computer model showing that the supercontinent cracked into two pieces , too heavy to hold itself together .
Between around 250 and 180 million years ago , it formed part of the single supercontinent ‘ Pangea . ’
Evidence suggests that Gondwana began to break up at around 183 million years ago .
They analyzed magnetic and gravity anomaly data from some of Gondwana ’s first cracking points – fracture zones in the Mozambique Basin and the Riiser - Larsen Sea off Antarctica .
Eagles and König then reconstructed the paths that each part of Gondwana took as it separated .
The computer model reveals that the supercontinent divided into just two large , eastern and western plates .
Approximately 30 million years later , these two plates started to split to form the familiar continents of today ’s Southern Hemisphere .
" You could say that the process is ongoing as Africa is currently splitting in two along the East African Rift , " says Dr. Eagles .
" The previously held view of Gondwana initially breaking up into many different pieces was unnecessarily complicated .
It gave fuel to the theory that a plume of hot mantle , about 2,000 to 3,000 kilometres wide , began the splitting process .
A straight forward split takes the spotlight off plumes as active agents in the supercontinent ’s breakup , because the small number of plates involved resembles the pattern of plate tectonics in the rest of Earth ’s history during which plumes have played bit parts . "
According to Eagles and König , supercontinents like Gondwana are gravitationally unstable to begin with , and have very thick crusts in comparison to oceans , so they eventually start to collapse under their own weight .
Says Dr. Eagles ,
" These findings are a starting point from which more accurate and careful research can be made on the supercontinent .
The new model challenges the positions of India and Sri Lanka in Gondwana which have been widely used for the past 40 years , assigning them very different positions in the supercontinent .
These differences have major consequences for our understanding of Earth . "

The baby seal looks into the eyes of her executioner .
Barely a flicker of emotion shows on the fisherman 's face as he smashes a steel - tipped club into her mouth .
She lies whimpering on the ice , blood pouring from her jaw and nose .
But she is not yet dead , so the sealer hits her in the face another four times before slamming a hooked " hakapik " club into her stomach and dragging her across the ice towards the ship .
Yet even this savagery is not enough to kill the poor creature .
A few seconds later , the pup starts wriggling furiously .
She is clearly still alive , though in terrible agony .
The fisherman smashes her head another three times .
I pray to myself that she is dead before she is skinned - but from where I am standing , it is impossible to tell .
Scroll down for more ...
Savage : ' It 's quite clear that the sealers are failing to adhere to the new regulations .
It 's the same old hunt we 've seen in the past '
Sad to say , this pitiful scene was far from unique when I visited the Canadian ice floes last weekend to see whether the introduction of new rules designed to make the country 's annual seal cull " humane " have been properly implemented .
Under these regulations , a pup must first be shot or battered into unconsciousness .
The fisherman then has to check that an animal is fully " insensible " before slicing open the arteries near
its flippers , allowing the creature to " bleed out " before it can be skinned .
These rules were brought in to forestall a possible EU ban on the import of sealskins .
The European Commission is currently mulling over a ban which , if it becomes law , would destroy the sealing industry .
As Phil Jenkins , spokesman for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans , explains : " We 're trying to make sure there is no possible way that a seal could be skinned while it was irreversibly unconscious but not dead .
" It 's really going the extra mile to make sure that it 's as humane as it can be . "
Having travelled to Nova Scotia to investigate the slaughter at close range , I can say categorically that the new rules are being completely ignored by the fishermen .
They are not even paying lip service to them .
To make matters worse , not only are the Canadian authorities making no attempts to enforce the legislation , they are also desperately trying to prevent the media and other observers witnessing what really goes on .

Slaughter : A harp seal struggles to get away from an axe - weilding hunter
Brutal :
The hunter drags his butchered quarry across the ice leaving a trail of blood
I spent almost a week on the east coast of Canada trying to observe the cull but at every step the local authorities did their best to stop me .
They consistently refused to issue the media and animal welfare campaigners with the necessary permits to observe the cull .
On Saturday afternoon , though , I finally managed to get hold of one ( which has since been withdrawn ) .
Such obstructions are matched by the hostility of the sealers themselves , who have become increasingly aggressive towards independent observers .
On previous trips , Canadian fishermen have threatened me with knives , guns and hakapiks .
Two years ago , when I visited the floes with a group of MEPs , we were involved in a high - speed car chase in which sealers repeatedly tried to force us off the road .
We were eventually forced to barricade ourselves into a hotel , where we remained for eight hours while officials from the European Commission and the U.S. embassy negotiated our release .
The authorities justify reporting restrictions by claiming that animal welfare campaigners and the media have consistently misrepresented the cull .
They claim that the images used to accompany reporting are , in some cases , decades out of date .
Loyola Sullivan , Canada 's fisheries ambassador and head of the delegation to the EU , says : " We are not going to be bullied or blackmailed into forcing people who depend on the sealing industry out of their livelihoods using
baseless allegations . "
Yet when I finally made it to the ice floes on Saturday , in a helicopter provided by the Humane Society of the United States , the carnage was every bit as horrific as the pictures suggest .

Seconds from death :
An unwary seal is inches from safety as a hunter sneaks up behind it
It 's a goner :
The hunter washes blood from the seal 's lifeless body in the icy waters
Swathes of ice were drenched in blood .
Piles of carcasses lay steaming in the sunshine .
Fishing boats were off - loading men armed with hakapiks .
They fanned out across the ice , killing all that came within range .
Many of the fishing boats were pouring seal blood into the sea , turning it scarlet .
Other sealers were casually tossing the skinned bodies of pups into the sea .
A few will have been cutting the hearts out of the baby seals ready to eat for breakfast - an age - old tradition
amongst sealers .
I witnessed dozens of seals being battered to death .
At " best " only one was killed in full accordance with the new regulations .
About a quarter were tested for death before being skinned but we saw only one pup having its arteries sliced open and left to " bleed out " .
Such scenes will be repeated hundreds of thousands of times over the coming weeks .
At least 275,000 baby seals will be killed so that their skins can be made into cheap fur coats , leather shoes and tacky trinkets .
The great tragedy of the slaughter is that it was stopped 25 years ago , following a ban on the import of seal pelts into the European Union - a ban that destroyed the economics of the industry .
But the Canadian government eventually found a loophole and ruthlessly exploited it .
Five years ago , the cull re-started with a vengeance when the authorities ordered the battering to death of a million baby seals .
I was there to watch the horror unfold - the first British journalist in a generation to document the cull .
Since then , another 1.5 million baby seals have been slaughtered - almost one - third of the seal population .
Every year , British and European politicians have rushed to condemn the slaughter .
Yet every year they have failed to take concrete action .
Now , at last , there is a glimmer of hope .
Scroll down for more ...
No mercy :
One of the hunters takes a swipe at a seal and manages to miss
Stavros Dimas , the EU's Commissioner for the Environment , said this week that the European Commission would soon propose an outright ban on the import of seal pelts .
" The Commissioner is very concerned at the inhumane way that baby seals are killed , " said a spokeswoman .
" Last year , we sent a team of expert observers .
What the team saw did not alleviate the Commissioner 's worries . "
These may turn out to be just weasel words designed to ward off action for another year - but this time there is a sense that the end of the slaughter could be near .
Several countries have already taken independent action to ban seal pelt imports .
But our own Government is dithering , saying that ministers have " written again to Environment Commissioner Dimas and others reiterating UK support for an EU - wide ban " .
British animal welfare campaigners are wary of such words .
Mark Glover , of the Humane Society International , says : " We 've heard the same excuses for three or four years now .
A European ban is crucial but the UK should also act on its own .
" We can not see any reason why they wo n't do so .
" It 's quite clear that the sealers are failing to adhere to the new regulations .
It 's the same old hunt we 've seen in the past . "
After witnessing the slaughter at close hand , it would be impossible to disagree .
An international team of astronomers have conclusive new evidence that a recently discovered “ dark galaxy ” is , in fact , an object the size of a galaxy , made entirely of dark matter .
Although the object , named VIRGOHI21 , has been observed since 2000 , astronomers have been slowly ruling out every alternative explanation .
In a new research paper , entitled 21 - cm synthesis observations of VIRGOHI 21 – a possible dark galaxy in the Virgo Cluster , researchers provide updated evidence about this mysterious galaxy .
They have now performed a high resolution observations of VIRGOHI21 using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope ( WSRT ) , to better pin down the quantities of neutral hydrogen gas .
They also did followup observations with the Hubble Space Telescope , looking for any evidence of stars .
Astronomers first suspected there was an invisible galaxy out there when they spied galaxy NGC 4254 .
This unusual - looking galaxy appears to be one partner in a cosmic collision .
All the normal evidence is there : gas is being siphoned away into a tenuous stream , and one of its spiral arms is being stretched out .
But the other partner in this collision is nowhere to be seen .
The researchers ’ calculated that an object with 100 billion solar masses must have careened past NGC 4254 within the last 100 million years , creating the gas stream , and tearing at one of its arms .
This was the clue that an invisible dark matter galaxy might be lurking nearby .
A detailed search turned up a mysterious object called VIRGOHI21 , located about 50 million light - years from Earth .
Were it a normal galaxy , you would be able to see it in a powerful amateur telescope .
But there ’s nothing there .
Even in the Hubble Space Telescope , not a single star is shining from this massive region of space .
It was only visible in radio telescopes , which could detect the radio emissions from neutral hydrogen gas located in the cloud .
When they first published their research a few years ago , the astronomy community was understandably skeptical , and proposed several alternative theories to explain the mysterious object .
For example , there could be additional mass associated with VIRGOHI21 , and not just dark matter .
The discovery of red giant stars in the region would give some indication that this was a more normal interaction .
But Hubble turned up nothing .
Dr. Robert Minchin , lead researcher from the Arecibo Observatory , said , “ not even the power of Hubble has been able to see any stars in it . ”
It ’s possible that VIRGOHI21 has always been this way , formed from primordial dark matter and neutral hydrogen after the Big Bang .
It ’s been cruising the Universe ever since , disrupting galaxies as it goes .
However , there do seem to be ways that galaxies and their dark matter can be separated .
Only a few months ago , a ring of dark matter was found surrounding a group of colliding galaxy clusters by the Hubble Space Telescope .
Perhaps VIRGOHI21 is the wreckage from one of these cluster collisions ; a shred of dark matter hurled out into space .
It could be that there are many of these dark galaxies out there .
A new sky survey , carried out with the 305 - metre ( 1000 - foot ) Aricebo radio telescope in Puerto Rico should tease out more of these objects in the future .
The survey is called the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey ( AGES ) .
This most recent paper has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal .
Michael Mukasey appears to think so :
US Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey has written a very lawyerly letter to the Senate Judiciary committee .
The letter fails to use the word " waterboarding " although the acceptance of a cast - iron prohibition on " torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " might fairly be seen to cover banning it .
The letter might be enough to peel off a few votes on the torture issue .
If you read the letter with any care , however , you will see that it very carefully refuses to say that - even in the face of the FISA legislation occupying the field - the the law can place any limits on a President who decides to wiretap US citizens , in the US , without a warrant , so long as he decides he wants to and is willing to wave the bloody shirt of national security .[.. ]
If the Senate confirms him after this , they 're complicit in undermining the Constitution .
Again .

French surgeons have been training their Afghan counterparts
Dr Hashmatullah Nawabi was trained by French surgeons at the French Medical Institute for Children in Kabul .
To mark the occasion , Dr Nawabi carried out a relatively simple closed heart operation in front of the media .
The doctor , who had previously trained in the Soviet Union and worked in Germany , has been deemed capable of performing complex operations alone .
French doctors performed the first open heart surgery in war - torn Afghanistan in 2006 .
The country did not previously have the technology to conduct such surgery .
Meanwhile , several hundred doctors and medical workers in the western Afghan province of Herat called off a strike on Wednesday .
They had been demanding better security after a rise in recent attacks - including kidnappings - on staff and their families .
The strike had severely affected medical services in the area , but was stopped after negotiations with a team sent to Herat by President Hamid Karzai .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Army Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , has been chosen to become chief of U.S. Central Command , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday .
Gen . David Petraeus has been the commander in Iraq for more than a year .
Petraeus would replace Adm. William Fallon , who said last month that he was resigning .
Fallon said widespread , but false , reports that he was at odds with the Bush administration over Iran had made his job impossible .
In addition , Gates said , Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno , commander of the Multinational Corps - Iraq -- the No. 2 position in Iraq -- is being nominated to fill Petraeus ' post .
Odierno has been home from Iraq for only a couple of months but has agreed to return , Gates said .
The plan is for Petraeus to leave Iraq in late summer or early fall , Gates said , to ensure a smooth transition and plenty of time for Odierno to prepare .
" We expect to move the paperwork on these nominations to the White House and to the Senate very quickly , " Gates said .
" Because of the complexity of this series of moves , I respectfully ask the Senate to move on them expeditiously , hopefully by Memorial Day , so the families and we can plan appropriately . "
Odierno was in line for a Pentagon desk job as Army Vice Chief just over a year after helping Petraeus implement the " surge " in U.S. troops in Iraq .
The Pentagon says Petraeus will stay in Iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over .
Watch the challenges ahead of Petraeus »
Gates said the generals ' promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in Iraq .
" The course certainly that Gen. Petraeus has set has been a successful course .
So , frankly , I think staying that course is not a bad idea .
I would say it 's a good idea , " Gates said .
Watch Gates nominate Petraeus »
Central Command , which oversees U.S. forces in East Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , has its headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa , Florida .
Gates said Odierno is well known to troops in Iraq , to military leadership and to Iraqis , and " I believe , in most parts of the world , especially in the Middle East , personal relationships make a difference . "
" I believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress , " Gates said .
The defense secretary said he expects to easily win Senate approval for the nominations once they are made by President Bush .
He said he had spoken with Sens. Carl Levin , D - Michigan ; John McCain , R - Arizona ; and John Warner , R- Virginia , and " I do n't really anticipate any problems . "
In a press release Wednesday , McCain praised the move .
" Both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction , and I am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility , " McCain wrote .
Gates acknowledged that Fallon 's " decision to step down was unexpected . "
" I had intended that Adm .
Fallon probably stay on for a third year .
His second year would have ended in February , " he said .
" So I 'm faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed -- and a commander who knows what 's going on in the region . "
Asked whether he was using Petraeus " almost as a finger in the dike " because of the shortage of Army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare , Gates admitted that there are few Army officers with experience in and knowledge of Iraq .
Odierno served as commander of the 4th Infantry Division , the unit that captured former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
Petraeus was picked in January 2007 to replace Gen. George Casey as the chief commander in Iraq and won Senate confirmation that month .
He previously served as head of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and as a commander in Iraq , and he was one of the main writers of an Army manual on counterinsurgency efforts .
He was seen as the logical choice to replace Fallon .
In his new post , he will oversee U.S. forces in all the Middle East , not only Iraq and Afghanistan .
" I recommended him to the president because I am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job , " Gates said .
In testimony to Congress this month , Petraeus said Iranian agents have played a " destructive role " in Iraq by backing Shiite militants , called " special groups " by the United States .
The U.S. believes that Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force is behind the support for militants .
" Unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq , " Petraeus testified .
Last month , in an interview with CNN's Kyra Phillips in Baghdad , Petraeus acknowledged some " friction " between himself and Fallon in the past year , but " actually , over the last six months or so , our relationship was really very , very good . "
" There was friction in the beginning .
He has a different job than I have , " Petraeus said .
" There can be understandable differences of your take , if you will , on a situation .
As they say in politics and government 101 , where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization , and we sit in different chairs . "

The Dalai Lama is a symbol of kindness and compassion .
Perhaps meditation helps him keep his benevolent attitude .
Many wonder how the Dalai Lama can retain his kindness and magnanimity , even as his homeland is torn apart by violence .
New neuroscience research may help explain the exiled Tibetan leader 's unremitting compassion for all people .
Meditation may increase a person 's ability to feel empathy and benevolence for others , according to a study published March 26 in the journal PLoS ONE .
Scientists asked subjects — both expert meditators and novices — to practice compassion meditation while inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine ( fMRI ) .
The participants heard sounds designed to provoke an empathetic response , such as a distressed woman calling out , as well as positive sounds ( a baby laughing ) and neutral sounds ( background noise at a restaurant ) .
" We wanted to see how compassion meditation changes the way you perceive emotional sounds , " said Antoine Lutz , a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin who conducted the research with his colleague Richard Davidson .
When subjects heard the sounds , both groups experienced more brain activity in areas associated with empathy and emotions while meditating than while not meditating .
The distressed sounds elicited stronger empathetic responses than the positive and neutral noises , and the brain activity in these regions was much stronger in the seasoned meditators .
" The difference was very clear , " Lutz told LiveScience .
" We saw significantly more activation in this circuitry in experts than in novices .
What is interesting is that the regions that are more activated are the regions which we think should be more important in compassion . "
These regions include the insula , or insular cortex , which is associated with bodily representations of emotions , and the temporoparietal junction , which previous research has shown to be involved in distinguishing between oneself and others , as well as in perceiving the mental and emotional states of others .
" Both of these areas have been linked to emotion sharing and empathy , " Davidson said .
" The combination of these two effects , which was much more noticeable in the expert meditators as opposed to the novices , was very powerful . "
Sixteen of the 32 total subjects had practiced meditation for at least 10,000 hours ; the same - aged beginners had learned the basics a week before the study began .
Compassion meditation involves first focusing on loved ones and directing loving - kindness toward them , and then extending that goodwill to all beings indiscriminately .
This technique is widely practiced among Tibetan Buddhists , Lutz said .
The researchers argue that their findings suggest compassion can be learned and increased with practice , similar to any skill or talent .
" It kind of primes the mind to react with benevolence to others when a situation requires that , " Lutz told LiveScience .
" You naturally know how to feel compassionate about someone you care about .
This practice tries to build on that and extend that to others . "
Previous research has shown that meditation can increase mental focus and concentration and help people release negative emotions .
Other claims on behalf of meditation , such as that it benefits health , have so far been unsubstantiated with research .
The researchers want to further test how much the boost in compassion persists once a person is not in a meditative state .
" These practices should change the emotional baseline of a person , " Lutz said .
" How does this change the way in regular life this person is behaving ?
That 's the long - term question . "
He and Davidson suggest that compassion meditation may benefit depressed people or young people who struggle with aggression and violence .
" I think this can be one of the tools we use to teach emotional regulation to kids who are at an age where they 're vulnerable to going seriously off track , " Davidson said .
More research is needed before meditation could be developed into a treatment , Lutz said .
" This study is really a first step , " he said .
" The next step is to try to longitudinally assess the effects of these techniques on behaviors and brain functions , and see how these techniques can eventually be applied to targeted populations . "
According to Google Analytics , one of the most heavily trafficked posts on my blog is the one I wrote years ago , the Risks of Distributed Version Control .
It ’s full of a lot of semi-angry comments about how wrong I am .
I thought I would follow up to that post with some newer thoughts and news .
I have to say , after using Mercurial for a bit , I think distributed version control is pretty neat stuff .
As Subversion tests a final release candidate for 1.5 ( which features limited merge - tracking abilities ) , there ’s a bit of angst going on in the Subversion developer community about what exactly the future of Subversion is .
Mercurial and Git are everywhere , getting more popular all the time ( certainly among the 20 % trailblazers ) .
What role does Subversion — a “ best of breed ” centralized version control system — have in a world where everyone is slowly moving to decentralized systems ?
Subversion has clearly accomplished the mission we established back in 2000 ( “ to replace CVS ” ) .
But you ca n’t hold still .
If Subversion does n’t have a clear mission going into the future , it will be replaced by something shinier .
It might be Mercurial or Git , or maybe something else .
Ideally , Subversion would replace itself . 🙂
If we were to design Subversion 2.0 , how would we do it ?
Last week one of our developers wrote an elegant email that summarizes a potential new mission statement very well .
You should really read the whole thing here .
Here ’s a nice excerpt :
I 'm pretty confident that , for a new open source project of non-huge size , I would not choose Subversion to host it [...]
So does that mean Subversion is dead ?
That we should all jump ship and just write a new front - end for git and make sure it runs on windows ?
Nah .
Centralized version control is still good for some things : * Working on huge projects where putting all of the * current * source code on everyone 's machine is infeasible , let alone complete history ( but where atomic commits across arbitrary pieces of the project are required ) .
* Read authorization !
A client / server model is pretty key if you just plain are n't allowed to give everyone all the data .
( Sure , there are theoretical ways to do read authorization in distributed systems , but they are n't that easy . )
My opinion ?
The Subversion project should n't spend any more time trying to make Subversion a better version control tool for non-huge open source projects .
Subversion is already decent for that task , and other tools have greater potential than it .
We need to focus on making Subversion the best tool for organizations whose users need to interact with repositories in complex ways [ ...]
I ’ve chatted with other developers , and we ’ve all come to some similar private conclusions about Subversion ’s future .
First , we think that this will probably be the “ final ” centralized system that gets written in the open source world — it represents the end - of - the - line for this model of code collaboration .
It will continue to be used for many years , but specifically it will gain huge mindshare in the corporate world , while ( eventually ) losing mindshare to distributed systems in the open - source arena .
Those of us living in the open source universe really have a skewed view of reality .
From where we stand , it may seem like “ everyone ’s switching to git ” , but then when you look at a graph like the one below ( which shows all public ( not private ! )
Apache Subversion servers discoverable on the internet ) , you can see that Subversion is n’t anywhere near “ fading away ” .
Quite the opposite : its adoption is still growing quadratically in the corporate world , with no sign of slowing down .
This is happening independently of open source trailblazers losing interest in it .
It may end up becoming a mainly “ corporate ” open source project ( that is , all development funded by corporations that depend on it ) , but that ’s a fine way for a piece of mature software to settle down .

Charles Tombe is refusing to comment on the affair
Local elders ordered a man found having sex with the goat , later called Rose , to " marry " her last February .
" The idea was to publicly embarrass the man , " says Tom Rhodes , editor of the Juba Post , which first ran the story .
The BBC 's story of the " wedding " caught the public imagination and became one of the most read internet stories .
Rose , black and white , is believed to have died after choking on a plastic bag she swallowed as she was eating scraps on the streets of Juba .
' Sense of humour '
After the marriage , Rose had a male kid - but " not a human one " - Mr Rhodes said , hastily .
The " husband " , Charles Tombe , said he was drunk at the time but has since refused to comment on the issue .
The kid is owned by Mr Tombe .
Wow - what have we done ?
We have triggered a monster
Tom Rhodes
Juba Post
More than a year after the BBC story was first published , it is still picked up by various web forums and being emailed across the world .
Recently it got more than 100,000 page views for five successive days .
Over time , it has received several million hits - making it historically one of the biggest - hitting stories the BBC News website has published .
A Google search uncovers more than 1 m different web pages , based on the same story .
Mr Rhodes , a Briton who helped found the Juba Post in 2004 , was shocked when he learned how many people around the world had read the story his newspaper had originally published as a short , light - hearted account and not even bothered to publish on its website .
" Wow - what have we done ?
We have triggered a monster , " he said .
He said that he had seen that it occasionally returned in the BBC 's " Most read stories " and was worried that he would have trouble with South Sudanese , accusing his paper of tarnishing the image of the region - now trying to rebuild after 21 years of war .
But he says he has not come across any such anger .
" It does n't portray Sudan in a bad light - it shows the Sudanese have a sense of humour , " he says , referring to the elders ' original punishment .
He has , however , had people come up and say to him : " Oh , you 're the goat man . "
Mr Rhodes explains that South Sudan remains a conservative society .
If a man is caught sleeping with a girl , he is ordered to marry her immediately in order to save her honour and that of her family , he says .
This was the basis for Mr Tombe 's punishment , after the goat 's owner found him with his animal and complained to local elders .
They ordered him to pay a dowry of 15,000 Sudanese dinars ( $ 50 , at the time ) and also named the goat Rose .
Afterwards , he left with the goat , not quite hand - in - hand , more hand - in - hoof , to his home in the Hai Malakal suburb of Juba - and not in Upper Nile State as we originally reported .

Lynne Cheney went to pimp her latest book ( no Western lesbian scenes , sorry , folks ) on The Daily Show .
True to his distaste for the vitriol that passes for news discourse on most American stations , Jon kept it civil , but made his points , albeit while admitting that it was both uncomfortable and unfair to hold the wife responsible for actions of the husband .
The most revealing point was when Cheney trotted out that most tired Republican line that we have n't been attacked since 9/11 .
Thankfully , Jon showed -- in the most polite way possible -- how completely disingenuous that talking point is .
CHENEY : You know , I think when the history books are written , that we will look back on this period of time and we will say , on 9/11 , we really thought within six months , we would be attacked again , maybe six weeks .
It 's been more than six years and that is not an accident .
I think this administration - my husband and the President - deserve a lot of credit for that .
STEWART : Okay .
CHENEY : Good ( laughter )
STEWART : Well , alright .
There was , I mean , there was the anthrax thing .
And then there was - well , you know , the first time they bombed the World Trade Center , it was eight years until we got attacked again .
And they were n't apparently doing anything ...
CHENEY : Well , yes , but there were many attacks in between 1993 and the World Trade Centers coming down in 2001 .
Remember the USS Cole , for example .
There were worldwide bombings going on , the bombings in embassies in Africa .
So the terrorists were n't reluctant to damage American interests and kill Americans .
Friends ?
STEWART : We are friends , it 's just ... you know they have been doing that all these past six years .
They 've been ... I mean , you know , the Spanish bombing and the English bombing and all the bombs in Iraq ...
CHENEY : Yes , but I 'm talking about American interests
STEWART : Are n't we interested in ...?
Alright , I assumed that they were our allies .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A transgender man who is six months pregnant said in an interview aired by Oprah Winfrey on Thursday that he always wanted to have a child and considers it a miracle .
File photo shows Oprah Winfrey in Los Angeles , California , February 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Danny Moloshok
“ It ’s not a male or female desire to have a child .
It ’s a human desire , ” a thinly bearded Thomas Beatie said .
“ I have a very stable male identity , ” he added , saying that pregnancy neither defines him nor makes him feel feminine .
Beatie , 34 , who lives in Oregon , was born a woman but decided to become a man 10 years ago .
He began taking testosterone treatments and had breast surgery to remove glands and flatten his chest .
“ I opted not to do anything with my reproductive organs because I wanted to have a child one day , ” he told the talk show host .
Beatie ’s wife Nancy said she inseminated him with a syringe using sperm purchased from a bank .
Now , he said , his size 32 jeans are getting a bit tight and his shirts are a bit stretched .
Nancy , to whom he has been married for five years and who has two grown daughters by a previous marriage , also appeared on the show , saying the couple ’s roles will not change once the baby is born .
“ He ’s going to be the father and I ’m going to be the mother , ” she said .
Their marriage is legal and he is recognized under state law as a man .
The couple was shown on video provided by People Magazine , which collaborated with Winfrey on the show , showing the room that will be the baby ’s nursery .
Beatie said the little girl was going to be “ daddy ’s little princess . ”
The couple was also filmed in their hometown of Bend , Oregon , where he underwent an ultrasound showing the baby in his womb .
“ I ca n’t believe it .
I ca n’t believe she ’s inside me , ” Beatie said while watching the ultrasound image .
“ We see her as our little miracle . ”
His obstetrician , Dr. Kimberly James , who practices in the Oregon town , told Winfrey , “ This is a normal pregnancy . ”
She said Beatie stopped taking testosterone two years ago and his levels of the hormone are normal .
“ This baby is totally healthy , ” she said .
“ This is what I consider a normal pregnancy . ”
The couple said they had been turned down by a number of other doctors before James agreed to take him as a patient .
The couple said an earlier attempt at pregnancy failed when he developed a tubal pregnancy , resulting in surgery that removed his Fallopian tubes .
The couple said they decided to go public with the pregnancy because they wanted to control the way the news got out .
“ We ’re just going to have the baby now , ” Nancy said .
“ If we have to , we ’ll go hide . ”
The couple runs a small business in Bend and has some savings , she said .
In addition , Beatie is working on a book about his childhood , his mother ’s suicide and his life growing in Hawaii where , as a girl , he was a teen beauty pageant contestant and earned a martial arts black belt .
Winfrey called the development “ a new definition of what diversity means for everybody . ”
Heroes are boring .
Shoot gun , blow up car , quip , save girl , fuck her .
Nope , given the choice between a clean - cut , rational character and an unshaven , mumbling , drugged - up lunatic , we 'll take the schizo every time .
Nothing lights up the silver screen like a bona fide wacko , so we 've gone to great lengths to bring together the craziest MFs that cinema has ever seen .
Between them , they 've killed hundreds of innocent people , snorted mountains of drugs , tortured dozens of cops , destroyed planets before breakfast and drenched many a sane co-star with their rabid spittle .
Take a large step back and enjoy : may the mentals do battle !
20 . FRANK COSTELLO in THE DEPARTED
Jack Nicholson is undoubtedly the master of madness : behind that Cheshire Cat grin and those cracked black eyes must be all sorts of demons waiting to escape .
His crime kingpin Frank Costello is no exception ; decades on the game have put a sizeable chink in his sanity .
Death is a way of life to Big Frank - he idly toys with a recently lopped - off hand at the dinner table and his only eulogy to a gunned - down victim is to remark " she fell funny " - so it 's no surprise he positively revels in the blood and misery such a line of work brings with it .
Such a plot could drive anyone crazy - his mole is working up the ranks of the Boston police , while a police mole has infiltrated his mob - but Frank is above and beyond .
Even harmless houseflies can't escape his wrath .

19 . GARLAND GREENE in CON AIR
When you 're on a plane full of convicts , serial rapists and murderers and you 're the guy everyone 's scared of , that 's when you know you 've made it as a fully - fledged nutjob .
So crazy he 's even been granted a nickname ( although ' The Marietta Mangler ' is n't exactly affectionate ) Garland Greene might seem quiet and intelligent on the outside , but it 's a creepy cover for the inner psycho and child killer that lies within ( " One girl , I drove through three states wearing her head as a hat . " ) .
That 's not to say he does n't have a devilish wit ; he 's always the first to make a quip or insult the retards he 's surrounded by : " Define irony : a bunch of idiots dancing around on a plane to a song made famous by a band that died in a plane crash . "
Even serial mentalists make good points sometimes .
Moment of madness :

18 . BILLY LOOMIS & STU MACHER in SCREAM
When Wes Craven put his little ironic hat on and made the Scream series , an entire generation raised on horror movies sat up and took notice .
Finally , here was a series that recognised the ' rules ' of the genre and even poked fun at them .
So , when goody two - shoes Neve Campbell finally finds out who 's been trying to perforate her with a kitchen knife , she discovers it 's not one , but two movie savvy psychopaths that take great pleasure in quoting Norman Bates , use corn syrup like in Carrie and cite Hannibal Lector as a hero .
Unfortunately , Billy ( last name Loomis - hello ) and Stu do n't have the brains to be truly memorable movie psychos and meet their end by stabbing each other - for a retarded cover story - and falling foul of the most hackneyed of horror cliches .
You 'd think they 'd know better .
Moment of madness : Sticking each other like goons .
" I 'm feelin ' a little woozy here ! "
17 . WALTER SOBCHAK in THE BIG LEBOWSKI
Forever dressed in his dressing gown and burning off a doobie , The Dude is one laid back ... uh , dude .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said about his best friend Walter , a hyperactive , right - wing military nut who clearly still suffers from daily ' Nam flashbacks .
Step into his domain and you 're entering a world of pain : even humdrum activities like a frame at the bowling alley turn into life or death situations ( " Mark it zero ! " ) so trusting him in a hostage situation is most unwise ( " You want a toe ?
I can get you a toe ... " ) .
Perhaps the reason for his rage is the fact he 's rolling on the Shabbos ( despite not being Jewish ) .
Perhaps it 's because these fucking amateurs do n't know the rules .
Or maybe it 's just because he 's got more screws loose than an IKEA warehouse .
Trust us , you do not want to find out what happens when you fuck this stranger in the ass .
Moment of madness : Pulling a gun on his bowling opponent when he dares dispute a foul .
It was a league game after all .
16 . MICHAEL MYERS in HALLOWEEN
Michael Myers is n't just your run -of - the - mill horror movie slasher .
He 's better than that .
This is a man who needs no frills to terrify - just a dude in a boiler suit with a great big knife and a William Shatner mask on .
Michael started early , too : at the age of six , mini-Myers stabbed his sister to death on Halloween night ( presumably she regretted choosing ' trick ' over ' treat ' ) , and fifteen years later , he 's busted out for another candy - laden killing spree .
The exasperated yet creepy Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail and is under no illusion - Michael Myers is fucking nuts .
" I realised what was living behind that boys eyes was purely and simply evil , " he says , before being proved extremely right across seven movies and a shitty Rob Zombie remake .

Few substances in nature are more magical than royal jelly , a protein confection secreted by worker bees and eaten by bee larvae .
For the first several days of their lives , all larvae eat royal jelly ;
after that , most move on to nectar and pollen .
They grow up to be sterile and short - lived workers , toiling tirelessly for the colony 's greater good before dying after a few seasons .
But a few lucky larvae stay on an all - jelly diet : they grow up to be queens , laying eggs and living for years .
What 's so special about royal jelly ?
Scientists are n't sure – but in a study published yesterday in Science , Australian National University biologists suggest that it's an epigenetic agent , activating genes in just the right combination for turning a would - be worker into a queen .
They arrived at this conclusion by using an enzyme called Dnmt3 to turn off DNA methylation – the chemical process by which genes are silenced
\– in bee larvae , which then became queens with fully - grown ovaries .
Since their development paralleled that of jelly - fed queens , the researchers reasoned that royal jelly does the same thing .
Assuming the inference proves correct , scientists must next determine how royal jelly does this , and what genes are involved in the process .
Another question , given royal jelly 's powers in bees : what happens when people eat it ?
The substance is sold at caviar - equivalent prices as a dietary supplement , fertility aid , medicine and cosmetic , but clinical data does n't yet support its use for any of these purposes .
However , the topic is explored in one of Roald Dahl 's lesser - known short stories , " Royal Jelly . "

With the recent acquisition of MySQL by Sun , there has been talk about the MySQL open source database now becoming relevant to large enterprises , presumably because it now benefits from Sun 's global support , professional services and engineering organizations .
In a blog post about the acquisition , SUN CEO Jonathan Schwartz wrote that this is one of his objectives .
While the organizational aspects may have been addressed by the acquisition , MySQL faces some technology limitations which hinder its ability to compete in the enterprise .
Like other relational databases , MySQL becomes a scalability bottleneck because it introduces contention among the distributed application components .
There are basically two approaches to this challenge that I 'll touch in this post :
1. Scale your database through database clustering
2. Scale your application , while leaving your existing database untouched by front - ending the database with In - Memory - Data - Grid ( IMDG ) or caching technologies .
The database acts as a persistence store in the background .
I refer to this approach as Persistence as a Service ( PaaS ) .
While both options are valid ( with pros and cons ) , in this post I 'll focus mostly on the second approach , which introduces some thought - provoking ideas for addressing the challenge .
Disclaimer :
While there are various alternative in - memory data grid products , such as Oracle Coherence and IBM ObjectGrid , in this post I 'll focus on the GigaSpaces solution , because for obvious reasons I happen to know it better .
Having said that , I try to cover the core principles presented here in generic terms as much as possible .
Scaling your database through database clustering :
There are two main approaches for addressing scalability through database clustering :
Database replication is used to address concurrent access to the same data .
Database replication enables us to load - balance the access to the shared data elements among multiple replicated database instances .
In this way we can distribute the load across database servers , and maintain performance even if the number of concurrent users increases .
Limitations :
Limited to " read mostly " scenarios : when it comes to inserts and updates , replication overhead may be a bigger constraint than working with a single server ( especially with synchronous replication ) : when it comes to inserts and updates , replication overhead may be a bigger constraint than working with a single server ( especially with synchronous replication )
Performance : Constrained by disk I /O performance .

Consistency : asynchronous replication leads to inconsistency as each database instance might hold a different version of the data .
The alternative -- synchronous replication -- may cause significant latency .

The alternative -- synchronous replication -- may cause significant latency .
Utilization / Capacity : replication assumes that all nodes hold the entire data set .
This creates two problems : .1 ) each table holds a large amount of data , which increases query / index complexity .
2 ) We need to provision ( and pay for ) more storage capacity with direct proportion to the number of replicated database instances : replication assumes that all nodes hold the entire data set .

Complexity : most database replication implementations are hard to configure and and are known to cause stability issues .

Non-Standard : each database product has different replication semantics , configuration and setup .
Moving from one implementation to another might become a nightmare .

Moving from one implementation to another might become a nightmare .
Database partitioning ( " sharding " ) : database shards / partitions enable the distribution of data on multiple nodes .
In other words , each node holds part of the data .
This is a better approach for scaling both read and write operations , as well as more efficient use of capacity , as it reduces the volume of data in each database instance .
Limitations :
Limited to applications whose data can be easily partitioned .
Performance : we are still constrained by disk I/ O performance we are still constrained by disk I/O performance
Requires changes to data model : we need to modify the database schema to fit a partitioned model .
Many database implementations require that knowledge of which partition the data resides in is exposed to the application code , which brings us to the next point . : we need to modify the database schema to fit a partitioned model .

setting - up database partitions is a fairly complex task , due to the amount of moving parts and the potential of failure during the process .
Non-standard : as with replication , each database product has different replication semantics , configuration and setup .
Partitioning introduces more severe limitations , as it often requires changes to our database schema and application code when moving from one database product to another .
Time for a change - is database clustering the best we can do ?
The fundamental problems with both database replication and database partitioning are the reliance on the performance of the file system / disk and the complexity involved in setting up database clusters .
No matter how you turn it around , file systems are fairly ineffective when it comes to concurrency and scaling .
This is pure physics : how fast can disk storage be when every data access must go through serialization / de-serialization to files , as well as mapping from binary format to a usable format ?
And how concurrent can it be when every file access relies on moving a physical needle between different file sectors ?
This puts hard limits on latency .
In addition , latency is often severely affected by lack of scalability .
So putting the two together makes file systems -- and databases , which heavily rely on them -- suffer from limited performance and scalability .
These database patterns evolved under the assumption that memory is scarce and expensive , and that network bandwidth is a bottleneck .
Today , memory resources are abundant and available at a relatively low cost .
So is bandwidth .
These two facts allow us to do things differently than we used to , when file systems were the only economically feasible option .
Scaling through In Memory Caching / Data Grid
It is not surprising that to enhance scalability and performance many Web 2.0 sites use an in - memory caching solution as a front - end to the database .
One such popular solution is memcached .
Memcached is a simple open source distributed caching solution that uses a protocol level interface to reference data that resides in an external memory server .
Memcached enables rudimentary caching and is designed for read - mostly scenarios .
It is used mainly as an addition to the LAMP stack .
The simplicity of memcached is both an advantage and a drawback .
Memcached is very limited in functionality .
For example , it does n't support transactions , advanced query semantics , and local - cache .
In addition , its protocol - based approach requires the application to be explicitly exposed to the cache topology , i.e. , it needs to be aware of each server host , and explicitly map operations to a specific node .
These limitations prevent us from fully exploiting the memory resources available to us .
Instead , we are still heavily relying on the database for most operations .
Enter in - memory Data Grids .
In - memory data grids ( IMDG ) provide object - based database capabilities in memory , and support core database functionality , such as advanced indexing and querying , transactional semantics and locking .
IMDGs also abstract data topology from application code .
With this approach , the database is not completely eliminated , but put it in the * right * place .
I refer to this model as Persistence as a Service ( PaaS ) .
I covered the core principles of this model in this post .
Below I 'll respond to some of the typical questions I am asked when I present this approach .
How Persistence as a Service works ?
With PaaS , we keep the existing databases as - is : same data , same schema and so on .
We use a " memory cloud " ( i.e. , an in - memory data grid ) as a front - end to the database .
The IMDG loads its initial state from the database and from that point on acts as the " system of record " for our application .
In other words , all updates and queries are handled by the IMDG .
The IMDG is also responsible for keeping the database in sync .
To reduce performance overhead , synchronization with the database is done asynchronously .
The rate at which the database is kept in sync is configurable .
The in - memory data model can be different from the one stored in the database .
In most cases , the memory - based data model will be partitioned to gain maximum scalability and performance , while the database remains unchanged .
How does PaaS improve performance compared to a relational database ?
Performance gains over relational databases are achieved because :
PaaS relies on memory as the system of record , and memory is significantly faster and more concurrent than file systems .
Data can be accessed by reference , i.e. , no need for continuous serialization of data , as with a file system .
Data manipulation is performed directly on the in -memory objects .
Complex manipulation is easily achieved by running either Java /.
Net /C++ code or a SQL query .
There is no need for serialization / de-serialization of data or network calls during the process .
Reduced contention : instead of placing all data in a single table , and consequently having many clients accessing that table , we split it into many small tables , each of which will be accessed by a smaller number of clients .
Parallel aggregated queries : queries that need to span multiple partitions to perform join / sum / max operations can be executed in parallel across the nodes .
The fact that the queries run on smaller data sets reduces the time it takes to perform the actual operation on each node .
In addition , the fact that queries execute on multiple machines leverages the full CPU and memory power of those machines .
In - process local cache : read - mostly operations are cached in the client application local address space .
This means that subsequent reads will be executed locally .
Avoid Object - Relational Mapping ( ORM ) : read operations are performed directly from memory in object format .
Thus , there is no need for O/R mapping overhead at this level .
O/R mapping happens in the background either during the initial load process , or during the asynchronous update of the database .
If you keep the database in sync , is n't your solution limited by database performance ?
No .
Because :
Data is sent asynchronously and in batches
Updates are performed in parallel by all partitions .
Updates to the database are executed collocated in the same machine as the database through a mirror service .
This enables to reduce the network overhead to the data base as well as benefit from specific optimization such as batch operations .
The database is not used for high availability purposes .
This means that In - flight transactions are not stored in the database , only the end result of the business transactions .
This reduces the amount of updates that are sent to the underlying database .
Also keep in mind that queries do n't really hit the database , only updates and inserts .
All this together means that the IMDG acts as a smart buffer to the database .
It is common that the number of read / update hits the IMDG receives is 10 x higher than the number of hits on the underlying database is seeing .
The database and the application are now decoupled , giving you more options for optimization .
For example , there are scenarios where writing to the database is required to ensure the durability of the data .
In this scenario , you can store the data directly in a persistent log ( to ensure durability ) .
The log can be updated at a relatively high rate .
You can read the data from the persistent log back into the database as an off - line operation .
With these options in place we can easily get to 30,000 to 40,000 updates per second with a single instance of MySQL .
If this is not sufficient you can always combine data base clustering to speed up the data base access .
Does n't asynchronous replication mean that data might be lost in case of failure ?
No , because asynchronous replication refers to the transfer of data between the IMDG and the database .
The IMDG , however , maintains in - memory backups that are synchronously updated .
This means that if one of the nodes in a partitioned cluster failed before the replication to the underlying database took place , its backup will be able to instantly continue from that exact point .
What happens if one of my memory partitions fails ?
The backup of that partition takes over and becomes the primary .
The data grid cluster - aware proxy re-directs the failed operation to the hot backup implicitly .
This enables a smooth transition of the client application during failure -- as if nothing happened .
Each primary node may have multiple backups to further reduce the chance of total failure .
In addition , the cluster manager detects failure and provisions a new backup instance on one of the available machines .
What happens if the database fails ?
The IMDG maintains a log of all updates and can re-play them as soon as the database becomes available again .
It is important to note that during this time the system continues to operate unaffected .
The end user will not notice this failure !
How do I maintain transactional integrity ?
The IMDG supports the standard two - phase commit protocol and XA transactions .
Having said that , this model should be avoided as much as possible due to the fact that it introduces dependency among multiple partitions , as well as creates a single point of distributed synchronization in our system .
Using a classic distributed transaction model does n't take advantage of the full linear scalability potential of the partitioned topology .
Instead , the recommended approach is to break transactions into small , loosely - coupled services , each of which can be resolved within a single partition .
Each partition can maintain transaction integrity using local transactions .
This model ensures that in partial failure scenarios the system is kept in a consistent state .
How is transactional integrity maintained with the database ?
As noted above , distributed transactions might introduce a severe performance and scalability bottleneck , especially if done with the database .
In addition , attempting to execute transactions with the database violates one of the core principles behind PaaS : asynchronous updates to the database .
To avoid this overhead , the IMDG ensures that transactions are resolved purely in - memory and are sent to the database in a single batch .
If the update to the database fails , the system will re-try that operation until the update succeeds .
What types of queries are supported ?
Template matching ( matching object based on class name , class hierarchy , and attribute values )
SQL – support range queries , ' like ' semantics , etc .
Continuous queries – through a combination of notification and SQL .
Parallel query ( a.k.a Map / Reduce ) – queries that are not designated for a specific partition are automatically broadcasted to all partitions and the result is implicitly aggregated on the client side .
Iterator – iterate through a large result - set of data .
You can find some code snippets of the different query APIs here .
This model relies heavily on partitioning .
How do I handle queries that need to span multiple partitions ?
Aggregated queries are executed in parallel on all partitions .
You can combine this model with stored procedure - like queries to perform more advanced manipulations , such as sum and max .
See more details below .
What about stored procedures and prepared statements ?
Because the data is stored in memory , we avoid the use of a proprietary language for stored procedures .
Instead , we can use either native Java /.
Net/C++ or dynamic languages , such as Groovy and JRuby , to manipulate the data in memory .
The IMDG provides native support for executing dynamic languages , routes the query to where the data resides , and enables aggregation of the results back to the client .
A reducer can be invoked on the client - side to execute second level aggregation .
See a code example that illustrates how this model works here .
Can I change these prepared statements and stored procedure equivalents without bringing down the data ?
Yes .
When you change the script , the script is reloaded to the server while the server is up without the need to bring down the data .
The same capability exists in case you need to re-fresh collocated services code on the server - side .
Do I need to change my application code to use an IMDG ?
It depends .
There are cases
In which introducing an IMDG can be completely seamless and there are cases in which you will need to go through a re-write , depending on the programming model :
Nature of Integration with IMDG Comments / limitations Hibernate 2nd level cache Seamless Best fit for read - mostly applications .
Limited performance gain as it still heavily relies on the underlying database .
JDBC Seamless , but limited SQL commands written against the IMDG are guarantied to run with other JDBC resources .
Does n't support full SQL 92 and therefore existing applications may require code changes .
Recommended for monitoring and administration .
Not recommended for application development as it introduces unnecessary O/R mapping complexity .
HashMap Seamless Extensions such as timeout and transaction support are available as well .
GigaSpaces Spring DAO
Partially seamless Abstracts the transaction handling from the code .
Domain model is based on POJOs , and therefore , does n't require explicit changes , only annotations ( annotation can be provided through an external XML file ) .
If our application already uses a DAO pattern then it would require changing the DAO .
This allows narrowing down the scope of changes required to use an IMDG - specific interface .
This option is highly recommended for best performance and scalability .
What topologies are supported ?
Replicated ( synchronous or asynchronous ) , partitioned , partitioned - with - backup .
See details here .
Do I need to change my code if I switch from one topology to another ?
No .
The topology is abstracted from the application code .
The only caveat is that your code needs to be implemented with partitioning in mind , i.e. , moving from a central server or a replicated topology to partitioning does n't require changes to the code as long as your data includes an attribute that acts as a routing index .
How are IMDGs and PaaS different from in - memory databases ( IMDB ) ?
The relational model itself does n't prevents us from taking full advantage of the fact that the data is stored as objects in memory .
For example , when we use in - memory storage in an IMDG , we do n't need the O/R mapping layer .
In addition , we do n't need separate languages to perform data manipulation .
We can use the native application code , or dynamic languages , for that purpose .
Moreover , one of the fundamental problems with in - memory databases is that relational SQL semantics is not geared to deal with distributed data models .
For example , an application that runs on a central server and was uses things like Join , which often maintains references among tables , or even uses aggregated queries such as Sum and Max , does n't map well to a distributed data model .
This is why many existing IMDB implementations only support very basic topologies and often require significant changes to the data schema and application code .
This reduces the motivation for using in - memory relational databases , as it lacks transparency .
The GigaSpaces in - memory data grid implementation , for example , exposes a JDBC interface and provides SQL query support .
Applications can therefore benefit from best of both worlds : you can read and write objects directly through the GigaSpaces API , query those same objects using SQL semantics , and view and manipulate the entire data set using regular database viewers .
Can I use an existing Hibernate mapping to map data from the database to the IMDG ?
Yes .
In addition , with PaaS , the Hibernate mapping overhead is reduced as most of it happens in the background , during initial load or during the asynchronous update to the database .
Further information on Hibernate support is available here .
Can I use PaaS with .
Net or C++ applications ?
Yes .
Starting with GigaSpaces 6.5 both Hibernate ( Java ) and nHibernate (. Net ) are supported .
C++ applications deffer to the default Hibernate implementation .
In addition , with GigaSpaces ' new integration with Microsoft Excel , .
Net users can easily access data in the IMDG directly from their Excel spreadsheets without writing code !
Final words :
While this approach is generic and can be applied to any database product , MySQL is the most interesting to discuss as it is widely adopted by those who need cost - effective scalability the most , such as web services , social networks and other Web 2.0 applications .
In addition , MySQL faced several challenges in penetrating large enterprises .
With the acquisition of Sun , MySQL becomes a viable option for such organizations , but still requires the capabilities mentioned above to compete effectively with rival databases .
The combination of IMDG / PaaS with MySQL provides a good solution for addressing some of the bigger challenges in cloud - based deployments .
More on that in a future post .
Mr Clegg said the prime minister had to make a stand for human rights Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has urged Gordon Brown to boycott this summer 's Olympic opening ceremony in protest at China 's human rights record .
He said the prime minister could not attend the event in Beijing " in good conscience " , given the country 's crackdown on protests in Tibet .
In a letter , Mr Clegg said Mr Brown must " take a stand for human rights " .
The prime minister has ruled out a boycott .
The Olympic torch passes through London this weekend .
Tennis player Tim Henman , athlete Kelly Holmes and cricketer Kevin Pietersen will be among the 80 bearers .
' Reconsider '
The torch will be carried 31 miles through 10 London boroughs and welcomed by Mr Brown outside 10 Downing Street .
Protests against China 's reaction to demonstrations in Tibet are expected along the route , as are protests by Chinese students in support of the Games .
" Serious concerns can not be swept under the carpet for the sake of ceremonial duties . "
Nick Clegg
In his letter to the prime minister , Mr Clegg said : " I understand that on Sunday you will welcome the Olympic torch to London .
" I urge you to reconsider your participation in this event and indeed any future events to mark the Beijing Games , including the opening ceremony on the 8 August .
" Recent events in Tibet , broken promises over media freedoms , ongoing human rights abuses and intransigence over the humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur demand a response .
" Serious concerns can not be swept under the carpet for the sake of ceremonial duties . "
Downing Street sources say the prime minister 's welcoming of the torch does not mean is any less concerned about the situation in Tibet , but is mindful that the Dalai Lama has advised that countries should not boycott the Beijing Games .
However , there is still concern in government circles about the level of protests that may be seen on Sunday and fears they may damage London as well as Beijing .
Tibet 's government - in - exile , based in India , says about 140 people were killed in the crackdown on recent unrest by Chinese security forces .
Beijing disputes this , saying 19 people were killed by rioters .
The Olympic torch will go through 20 countries before being carried into the Beijing Games ' opening ceremony .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
Sender narkomane til scientologene Her behandles Hege ( 29 ) fra Våler av scientologer .
Norske kommuner bidrar med millioner .
( Dagbladet.no ) Hege Jakobsen ( 29 ) fra Våler i Solør har sittet i en badstue i Danmark fire timer .
Det har hun gjort i over 20 dager .
Hun skal svette ut stoffer og dårlige minner fra kroppen .
Disse har støttet Narconon - behandling :  Os Kommune Sosial kontor  Bergen Kommune , Laksevåg Bydel  Radøy Sosialkontor  Loddefjord Sosialkontor  Lyngdal Sosialkontor  Bergen Kommune  Lindås Sosialkontor  Ulriken Bydelssenter  Stord Kommune  Arendal Kommune  Vest - Agder Fylkeskommune  Aust - Agder Fylkeskommune  Hordeland Fylkeskommune  Helse Sør  Helse Vest
- Man opplever mange rare ting når jeg sitter i saunaen .
Blant annet opplever jeg at gamle arr begynner å synes , sier Hege til Dagbladet.no .
Hege er bare en blant nærmere 50 norske misbrukere som har sittet og svettet i det klamme rommet .
Behandles med sauna
- Man har foretatt IQ - tester før man starter saunaprogrammet , og sammenlignet dem med tester foretatt etter at man har tatt programmet .
De fleste hadde økt IQ - en med så mye som 15 prosent , sier leder for Narconon Danmark , Ole Thiemer , til Dagbladet.no .
Han tror at man kan svette ut rusen gjennom en kombinasjon av saunabruk , vitaminer og mineraler .
Programmet leger stor vekt på bruken av Niacin , et vitamin B også kjent som nikotinsyre .
Badstukurset varer gjennomsnittlig i 20 til 30 dager , og hver økt varer opptil fire og halvt time .
Narconon baserer sin behandling på læren til L. Ron Hubbard , mannen som grunnla scientologikirken .
Kirken er blitt beskyldt for hjernevasking , og sterkt kritisert for kontroversielle tester og dyre kurs .
- Vi vasker hjernene
- Jeg vet at noen anklager oss for å drive med hjernevasking .
Til dem vil jeg si : Vi vasker ut alt i hjernene som har med stoff å gjøre , sier Thiemer , til Dagbladet.no .
Som første norske medium har Dagbladet .
no fått lov til å observere det kontroversielle behandlingstilbudet .
Selv om Thiemer sitter under et stort portrett av Hubbard når vi intervjuer ham , sier Thiemer at Narconon er helt uavhengig av scientologikirken .
For på tross av at alle bøkene , metodene og til og med livsfilosofien er utviklet av den kontroversielle science fiction - forfatteren , har ikke programmet noen offisielle bånd til kirken grunnlagt av den samme mannen .
- Hubbard reddet livet mitt
- Hvis man går ut i en stor og mørk skog om natten , blir de fleste redde .
Men hvis man går til den samme skogen om dagen , vil mye av redselen forsvinne .
Jeg tror mye av motstanden mot dette programmet er basert på uvitenhet og manglende kunnskap , sier Thiemer til Dagbladet.no .
Men selv legger ikke Thiemer skjul på at han er troende scientolog :
- Jeg ble scientolog fordi Hubbards metoder bokstavelig reddet mitt liv , sier Thiemer , som selv var rusmisbruker til han var 35 år gammel .
- Jeg tenkte at hvis jeg blir så « powerful » av å lære dette her , hva vil da skje hvis jeg lærer resten ?
sier
Thiemer , som bedyrer at det er valgfritt for dem som deltar i programmet , om de vil bli scientologer eller ikke .
Valgfritt å bli scientolog
- Det er noen som blir scientologer , og noen som ikke blir det .
Det er deres valg .
For å si det sånn : Jeg har etter hvert blitt så god at hvis jeg ville at alle skulle bli scientologer - da ville alle blitt det , sier Thiemer .
Når Dagbladet .no besøker Narconon på Vestsjælland , er det rundt fem nordmenn der .
En av dem er Sturla fra Sandnes .
Han har bare vært på gården én dag .
- Jeg var inne her for to uker siden også , men da fant jeg ut at jeg ikke klarte det .
Jeg hadde ikke fått sagt ha det til ungen , damen og livet mitt .
Så jeg frika rett og slett ut .
Men nå har jeg fått sagt ha det til livet mitt .
Så nå er jeg klar , sier Sturla .
Behandlet 50 nordmenn
Ifølge Narconon har nærmere 50 nordmenn benyttet seg av tilbudet siden programmet startet i 2001 .
Cirka 20 nordmenn har fått støtte fra sosialkontor , helseregionene eller sin lokale kommune for å delta i programmet .
Hver behandlingsplass koster til sammen mellom 180 000 og 200 000 kroner .
Ifølge Narconons egne tall , har altså norske kommuner brukt over 3,6 millioner skattepenger på scientologprogrammet .
Gården på Vestsjælland ligger nær en stasjonsby som heter Mørkøv .
Hvem skulle tro at bak de gule murveggene ligger løsningen på Vestens narkotikaproblemer ?
Det tror i hvert fall Thiemer .
Han har ambisjoner om at Narconon skal bli det største behandlingstilbudet i Danmark innen tre år .
Sosialkontorene betaler
- Det virker som man har gitt opp , og det har spredt seg en apati i samfunnet når det gjelder rusbehandling .
Vi tror at vi sitter med løsningen , sier Thiemer .
En av de som har tatt regningen for at norske rusmibsurkere skal oppholde seg i Danmark er Radøy Sosialkontor .
- Vi har vært svært fornøyd med tilbudet .
Jeg vil anbefale andre å velge det samme , sier leder for sosialtjenesten i Radøy , Øystein Mongstad , til Dagbladet.no .
Han forteller at de har brukt cirka 200.000 kroner per person som har deltatt i programmet .
Også ruskonsulent i
Os kommune , Rune Bakke , er fornøyd med Narconons tilbud .
- De fyller et behov i markedet , sier han .
Verken han eller Mongstad synes det er noe problem at programmet er basert på scientologi-metoder .
- Jeg har jo registrert at programmet har falt mange skolemedisinere tungt for brystet .
Men for oss er det viktigste at programmet fungerer , sier Bakke .
Narconons program består av ni trinn hvor rusmisbrukerne blant annet deltar i terapeutisk kommunikasjonskurs , et saunaprogram og et såkalt sansekurs .
Det siste kurset heter « Veien til lykke » .
Der lærer man å bli en « troværdig og ydende samfundsborger » og får en « god vejledning i at leve et lykkeligt liv » .
- Skaper fred
- Det å håndtere selve stoffmisbruket er bare en liten del .
Man må også forsøke å finne ut hvorfor man blir misbruker .
Man må utdanne personene i hvordan håndtere livet , sier Thiemer .
Han har stor tro på at heftet « Veien til lykke » kan løse mange av dagens konflikter .
- Når vi har delt ut heftet på steder hvor det har vært mye konflikt , som Israel og Palestina , så viser statistikken at det blir mindre kaos og vold når folk begynner å lese det .
Heftet gir folk noen ikke - religiøse begreper om moral , sier Thiemer .
Deltakerne i Narconon - programmet som medvirker i dokumentaren har sett videoene og godkjent innholdet .

Exercise : Cycling can hold back the years
Taking regular aerobic exercise could stop the biological clock and delay ageing by up to 12 years , claim researchers .
Keeping fit by jogging or cycling through middle age and beyond slows and even reverses the decline in muscle power , balance and co-ordination in later life .
Without regular workouts , maximum aerobic power falls in men by up to half between the ages of 20 and 60 .
Women begin to lose fitness aged around 35 , with aerobic power also falling by up to half by the age of 60 .
Eventually , everyday activities become " intolerably fatiguing " for older men and women , says the study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine .
But cardiovascular training - which strengthens the heart and lungs - would compensate for the onset of middle age , when the body 's capacity to use oxygen and generate energy falls with each passing decade .
And it has the added bonus of prolonging physical independence in old age , according to physical education experts at Toronto University .
They were exploring the idea , first put forward by them 20 years ago , that one of the most important factors influencing the quality of life in old people was the maintenance of sufficient " aerobic power " .
Scroll down for more ...
The latest study analysed existing research to discover how far the benefits of training last into old age .
It found that relatively high - intensity aerobic exercise over a relatively long period of time could boost maximal aerobic power by 25 per cent .
Dr Roy Shephard , of the university 's faculty of physical education and health , said long - term aerobic training can maintain or restore aerobic power in later life .
The effect is the equivalent of turning back the biological clock for older people by up to 12 years , he added .
He said : " A regular exercise programme can slow or reverse the loss of aerobic fitness , reducing the individual 's biological age and prolonging independence . "
In the UK , most people do not exercise five times a week for 30 minutes or more - the Government 's official recommendation for maximum health benefits .
The level of exertion should be enough to raise the heart rate to 120 beats a minute or higher , which includes a brisk walk and swimming .
But taking a stroll or even doing the gardening is also regarded as healthy activity .
A recent survey revealed at least one - quarter of men and women take no moderate or vigorous physical activity .
Other evidence shows regular activity cuts the risk of a range of health problems including diabetes , depression and heart disease .
It also reduces the chances of premature death from any illness .
When is a bird not a bird ?
I suspect when the Democratic frontrunner flips it .
Barack Obama campaigned among friendly crowds yesterday in North Carolina , one state he ’s expected to win easily in the next few weeks .
Perhaps he let his guard down , or maybe he did n’t even realize he made the gesture — but despite its subtlety , the crowd certainly recognized it .
Watch the video and decide for yourself :
He ’s talking critically about his opponent , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , and the kind of distasteful gotcha politics that occur in Washington .
And he says , “ That ’s all right .
Sen. Clinton looked in her element . ”
Watch the video right then .
The presidential candidate raises his right hand to seemingly scratch his cheek .
He does n’t use his whole hand though .
Just one finger .
Briefly .
A couple of strokes .
Obama has a pretty satisfied look on his face afterwards , which makes it look a little more purposeful than not .
It ’s subtle enough to have deniability for anyone who might get offended , but clear enough for his followers to enjoy the moment of disrespect towards Hillary .
And who has n’t wanted to flip off a Clinton at some time in their lives ?
Is this a damaging moment for Obama ?
Probably not , although it ’s not exactly classy .
In fact , it might have a charm all its own , a warmth and humanity that certainly does n’t come out when Obama debates .
Update : Redstate says it ’s definitely the salute ; Jim Geraghty needs a little more convincing .

Calorie intake before conception may mean the difference between boys and girls .
Eating breakfast cereal might make it more likely you have a boy .
Punchstock
The sex of new babies is influenced by the mother 's diet before she conceives , a new study suggests .
According to a survey of 740 British mums to be , a high - calorie diet is more likely to lead to a baby boy in nine months ' time .
Researchers led by Fiona Mathews of the University of Exeter collected data on the pre-conception dietary habits of pregnant women , and found that 56 % of women in the highest one - third of calorie intake had male fetuses .
In the lowest third , only 45 % bore boys .
The women , who were attending maternity clinics , were asked to compile a ' retrospective diary ' of their food intake in the weeks before they fell pregnant .
Mathews and her colleagues then analysed the results to look for a relationship between food intake and the sex of their offspring .
The level of calorie intake was the main dietary factor that affected offspring sex , say the researchers , who report their research in Proceedings of the Royal Society B1 .
Overall , women in Matthews ’s study who produced sons ate an average of 180 calories more per day than those who had daughters — " the equivalent of eating a banana " , she says .
Intriguingly , a major difference seemed to be between women who routinely ate breakfast cereals and those who did n't , Mathews adds .
Among those who ate breakfast cereals almost every day , 59 % gave birth to boys .
In contrast , 43 % of those who claimed to eat breakfast " rarely or never " produced sons .
Sugar babies
The researchers are unsure of why this happens , although they suggest that it could be to do with levels of glucose in the blood .
Male test - tube embryos generally require a more glucose - rich growth medium to survive in the lab —
Mathews suspects that a similar process may operate in the uterus , so women with higher sugar levels are more likely to nurture a male embryo as it is implanted in the womb lining .
Mathews even suggests that the prevalence of dieting in young Western women might be skewing the sex ratio towards more baby girls .
She cites studies from the United States showing that average energy intake in adolescent women has declined by 17 % between 1965 and 1996 .
It is not clear how overeating may affect gender selection , however — the new study excluded obese women because of the other health complications involved with being severely overweight .
The results seem to fit with the biological theory that many animals , perhaps including humans , tend to produce male offspring when food and resources are in plentiful supply .
This is thought to be a strategy to maximize genetic returns , as successful , healthy sons can go on to produce far more grandchildren than daughters .
What mum eats
It 's an interesting theory , although far from proven , says Paul Haggarty , an expert on nutrition and reproduction at the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen , UK .
“ There are some plausible biochemical mechanisms , although what they have done is pretty limited , ” he says — it was a rather small study , he points out .
Haggarty adds that his own database of dietary habits in some 1,500 Scottish mothers shows no evidence that diet can affect the gender of their offspring .
“ But who knows , we may well come up with something very interesting in bigger data sets , ” he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Nevertheless , evidence is emerging that not only is it true that ‘ you are what you eat ’ — but also that your mother ’s or even your grandparents ’ diet can affect your health .
Previous studies of mice have shown that coat colour can be determined by a mother 's diet during pregnancy , and that children ’s risk of diabetes can be raised by chemical changes to DNA that resulted from their grandparents ’ poor diet when pregnant with the children ’s parents .
Haggarty would also like to see more conclusive , large - scale studies that address the effect of food supplements such as folate , which is crucial for healthy embryonic development , on the gender or health of babies .
Pregnant women , and those hoping to get pregnant , tend to take far more supplements than the general population , he says .
Although Mathews and her team did not collect data on food supplements , she suggests that trace nutrients such as potassium in the diet might also affect the sex of babies , perhaps by raising the acidity of the womb , which might make it more welcoming for a male embryo .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores
Inc , the world ’s largest retailer , unveiled plans on Monday to film its gun sales in the United States and create a computerized log of purchases in a bid to stop guns falling into the wrong hands .
Wal - Mart , which is the largest seller of firearms in the United States , agreed a 10 - point code , which also includes rigid inventory controls , with a bipartisan coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns led by New York ’s Michael Bloomberg .
The retailer said it will develop a first - of - its - kind computerized crime gun trace log that will flag purchases by customers who have previously bought guns later recovered in crimes .
“ Wal - Mart currently uses a strong point of sale system , ” said J.P. Suarez , senior vice president and chief compliance officer of Wal - Mart .
“ This code is a way for us to fine - tune the things we ’re already doing and further strengthen our standards .
We hope other retailers will join us . ”
The Responsible Firearms Retailer Partnership is designed to strengthen the points in the gun purchasing system that criminals have exploited in the past , Wal - Mart and the Mayors Against Illegal Guns said .
According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , 46 percent of its criminal gun trafficking investigations involved cases in which someone who is not legally allowed to purchase a firearm does so through the use of a proxy , known as a straw buyer .

ROME , April 19 ( Reuters ) - Oil at $ 117 a barrel has left energy producers and consumers in rare agreement there is little they can do for now to prevent prices rising higher still .
Oil hit the latest in a series of records on Friday after a rebel attack in Nigeria added to supply concerns and offset the impact of a U.S. - led economic slowdown , which has begun to eat into energy demand .
“ There is a possibility of still going higher , ” Shokri Ghanem , Libya ’s top oil official , said on his arrival in Rome on Saturday for talks between producer and consumer countries .
Top fuel burner the United States has led the calls for more oil to try to calm prices , but OPEC ’s biggest producer Saudi Arabia has dismissed this as political rhetoric .
“ Today there is no reason to jump up and down and say ‘ we will supply more crude ’ -- because that request from consuming countries is probably politically - driven rather than a fundamental requirement , ” Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi said in an interview with industry newsletter Petroleum Argus .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) has repeatedly said it will not use the International Energy Forum ( IEF ) in Rome as the occasion to revise its output policy .
“ There will be friendly talks as usual when we see each other , ” said Ghanem .
“ There are no plans for an official meeting . ”
CONSPICUOUS ABSENCES
While nearly all of the 13 OPEC energy ministers will attend the IEF talks from Sunday to Tuesday , the group ’s president Chakib Khelil of Algeria is staying away , as is U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman , according to aides .
The United States is smarting from the impact of high oil prices and gasoline at more than $ 3 a gallon has begun to erode demand .
The head of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , which represents consumer countries , stopped short of calling for more oil , saying instead that stocks would build provided OPEC maintained output .
“ If the producing countries maintain the current level of production , stock levels in consuming countries will come back , ” said IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka .
“ That will give a better balanced market . ”
But he said the price was too high , especially for developing countries .
Previous IEF meetings have been dismissed as talking shops , but Tanaka said the energy executives and roughly 60 ministers attending would find “ common issues and common interests ” and he wanted to see them all agree the price was too high .
OPEC ’s second biggest producer Iran has typically supported strong oil prices .
Its energy minister said Friday ’s record price did not reflect fundamentals of supply and demand and was artificially supported by the weakness of the U.S. dollar .
“ It ’s not the real price , ” Nozari said .
A sustained bull run , which set in around 2002 , has drawn momentum this year from the dollar ’s slide to record lows against major European currencies , making dollar - denominated oil attractive as an inflation hedge .
Market fundamentals , including strong demand from emerging economies , such as China and India , and chronic under - investment that has tightened supply has also driven the rally .

The Federal Communications Commission has proposed almost $ 4 million in fines to seven major retailers for " willfully and repeatedly " selling analog - only TV sets without labels that warn consumers that the devices may not work after February 17 , 2009 — the last day of analog broadcasting .
The scofflaws include the Sears - Roebuck / K- Mart group , which received a fine of $ 1.096 million ; Wal - Mart , hit with a $ 992,000 forfeit ; and CompUSA , which took the lowest penalty at $ 168,000 .
Ironically , some of these retail giants have repeatedly filed statements with the FCC assuring the agency that they take their digital transition ( DTV ) obligations with the utmost seriousness .
Fry 's , Circuit City , Best Buy , and Target also received fines , bringing the total up to $ 3,928,000 .
All seven retailers can appeal the decision .
It 's the label , stupid
After February 17 , 2009 , all United States television stations must broadcast using digital signals , potentially turning millions of U.S. analog sets into useless pieces of furniture .
Those currently with cable can continue using analog sets after the transition , but an estimated 19 million to 22 million U.S. households rely entirely on analog signals , and they 'll need to purchase converters for their televisions to receive DTV broadcasts .
The FCC requires all TV retailers that still sell these analog only sets explain this situation by putting a " conspicuous " label on the device that says the following :
CONSUMER ALERT
This television receiver has only an analog broadcast tuner and will require a converter box after February 17 , 2009 , to receive over - the - air broadcasts with an antenna because of the Nation ’s transition to digital broadcasting .
Analog - only TVs should continue to work as before with cable and satellite TV services , gaming consoles , VCRs , DVD players , and similar products .
For more information , call the Federal Communications Commission at 1-888-225-5322 ( TTY : 1-888-835-5322 ) or visit the Commission ’s digital television website at : www.dtv.gov.
Last summer , the FCC's Enforcement Bureau began inspecting appliance retailers across the United States , among them the Sears and K - Mart stores ( the two retailers merged in late 2004 ) , to make sure they complied with this rule .
The agency issued repeated citations to both Sears and K - Mart for selling unlabeled analog - only TV sets , gave the companies a chance to respond to the charges , then inspected them again .
The second inspection " once again observed in twenty - seven Kmart stores , the Sears Roebuck website , and sixteen Sears Roebuck stores , television receiving equipment with analog - only tuners on display without the required Consumer Alert labels , " the FCC's Notice of Apparent Liability to Sears / K - Mart , issued on Thursday , concluded .
Promises , promises
As noted earlier , these fines come despite repeated assurances by retailers that the companies will make good on educating the public about the digital transition .
In October of last year , Best Buy , Target , and Circuit City — all fined by the FCC on Thursday — filed similar statements with the FCC , assuring the agency that they would take a leadership role in DTV education .
" Best Buy will include educational items about the DTV Transition and the end of analog broadcasting in its in - store ' video loops ' that are shown on the TVs displayed for sale , " the big appliance retailer wrote to the FCC on October 16th .
" Circuit City will include items on the DTV Transition and the end of analog broadcasting in its in - store ' video loops ' that are shown on the TVs displayed for sale , " the electronics seller wrote to the FCC on the same day .
But , as Ars has reported , US Pirg did its own survey of retailer DTV readiness earlier this year and found it dramatically wanting .
The national consumer watchdog group 's " secret shoppers , " deployed across retail stores around the country , found that 81 percent of sales staff they spoke to provided inaccurate information about crucial DTV issues , like the converter boxes that make analog sets digital ready .
Over a third of the sales reps that US Pirg shoppers spoke to also gave inaccurate information about the transition deadline ( February 17th , 2009 ) .
On the same day that the FCC announced the fines , Circuit City filed yet another statement with the agency outlining its improved DTV policies .
The statement assures the Commission that Circuit City has begun an " expedited phase - out " of analog - only TV sets both in the retailers ' stores and on its retail Web site .
The FCC issued also proposed penalties to several manufacturing firms for shipping analog - only television sets to retailers .
Television maker Syntax - Brillian received a $ 1,266,100 fine for this , and another $ 11,000 for providing " material factual information that is incorrect without a reasonable basis for believing the material factual information was correct " during the agency 's investigation of the problem .
The manufacturer Precor received a $ 357,900 fine .
Evolution .
Intelligent design .
These are terms that can cause great consternation in the minds and hearts of many , particularly opponents of each view .
Now , that anxiety and debate have resurfaced in theaters everywhere with Ben Stein 's new documentary , " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed . "
The press kit says , " ( ' Expelled ' ) exposes the widespread persecution of scientists and educators who are pursuing legitimate , opposing scientific views to the reigning orthodoxy . "
( To see a trailer of the movie or access its free resources , go to www.getexpelled.com.)
I like Ben Stein .
I think he 's funny , creative and an insightful commentator on a host of issues .
I 'm not bent on defending him or " Expelled , " but I 'm glad he made it .
I saw it last weekend , and I liked it .
I think it will wake up many people to the truth .
What truth ?
That educational arenas have become limited learning environments because of biases against God , the Bible and creationism .
Stein is correct in saying that passionate antagonism and hostility ( that parallels any fundamentalist extremism ) equally exists in naturalist and Neo - Darwinian camps .
Proof of their avid bias easily can be seen in some evolutionists ' reviews of this film .
Many are loaded with as much inflammatory language , intolerance and bigotry as any hate - filled group .
I 'm not endorsing the movie because it is flawless or unbiased in its presentation , but because it raises real issues of educational suppression .
Why can't creationism or intelligent design be taught in public schools ?
Naturalists answer by saying that ID is not a science .
Rather than debate classifications , however , I would ask further , Why can't variant theories of the origin of life be presented even outside science courses ?
Is n't education based upon presenting a wide array of knowledge and opinions ?
Since when does science own the market on how life began ?
If it is based largely upon empirical investigation of present , repeatable data , then the evolutionary theory for the beginning of life stands upon no more solid ground than ID .
Why ?
Because neither theism nor the naturalistic view of life 's earliest origin is provable in a strict scientific sense .
They are both past , unrepeatable singularities , which takes them out of the scientific realm of study and observation .
For example , no branch of science can prove how inorganic matter produced organic cellular life .
And evolution , even if accepted as factual , does not dispel a Creator because Neo - Darwinism cannot explain the inception of life on earth definitively .
So if both evolution and ID stand upon similar hypothetical platforms of discussion and possibility , why can't they both be taught in academic arenas as theories of our origin ?
ID deserves a seat in classrooms across America .
Again , dissenters of creationism answer this question by classifying ID as a religion and further say that religion belongs exclusively in homes and churches .
Says who ?
They answer that the separation of church and state in the First Amendment bans ID from entering classrooms in any form .
What they do n't realize , however , is their conclusion is a constitutional misinterpretation and bastardization of the First Amendment .
It was written and adopted , among other reasons , so that Congress neither would establish a federal religion nor restrict religious or speech freedoms , which can include religious instruction in public classrooms .
Whether theories of life 's origin are classified as religion , science , philosophy or social studies , our Founding Fathers would disagree adamantly that any theory should be locked out of classroom instruction .
In fact , when Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia , he did so with an expectation that a spirit of freedom would flourish among alternative educational views .
While he prohibited sectarian theology in that particular university in order to establish its distinction from other denominationally affiliated higher institutions , Jefferson did not abolish instruction or debate on Providence , theism or creationism ( which he even embedded in the Declaration of Independence ) .
On Dec. 26 , 1820 , he wrote to Destutt de Tracy , " This institution of my native state , the hobby of my old age , will be based upon the illimitable freedom of the human mind , to explore and expose every subject susceptible of its contemplation . "
One day later , he charged William Roscoe : " This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind .
For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead , nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it . "
If America 's Founding Fathers espoused openness to religion , creationism and the Bible being taught in schools , then it beckons the question , Why do n't we ?
To leave out of educative curricula the most influential text in Western civilization -- including in American history , law and literature -- is a blatant and biased withholding of proper public instruction .
That is why my wife , Gena , and I are on the board of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools , which has helped 443 public school districts in 37 states to implement a course on it .
More than 200,000 students have been taught from it already .

BOGOTÁ , Colombia
For seven years , Democrats have rightfully complained that President Bush has gratuitously antagonized the world , exasperating our allies and eroding America ’s standing and influence .
But now the Democrats are doing the same thing on trade .
In Latin America , it is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton who are seen as the go - it - alone cowboys , by opposing the United States ’ free - trade agreement with Colombia .
Some Democrats claim that they are against the pact because Colombia has abused human rights .
Those concerns are legitimate  but they should n’t be used to punish people like Norma Reynosa , a 35 - year - old woman who just may snip the flowers that go into the Mother ’s Day bouquet that you buy .
Human rights are n’t abstract to Ms. Reynosa .
Two of her relatives were killed in the brutal warfare and insecurity that plague her home region in Colombia ’s South .
A third was killed by a land mine , and a fourth was kidnapped at age 12 to work for guerrillas in the National Liberation Army , or the ELN .
Ms. Reynosa ran a small restaurant but had to flee when the guerrillas demanded that she pay more extortion money than she could afford .
In this video , someone in Iraq identified as " Motari " tosses a puppy into the air , probably killing or crippling it .
The video is very disturbing , and is located here .
The David Motari ( a United States Marine ) depicted in this picture looks identical to the man posted in the video who is identified as " Motari " ; though , with goggles on , it 's hard to make a perfect ID .
Here is his " Bebo " profile containing additional pictures .
It could also be the case that the video is fake .
This seems highly unlikely , given the low - tech camera used to shoot the footage .
I will keep you updated on the matter .
If David Motari is the puppy killer , he is undoubtedly a sociopath who does not feel remorse or shame .
After confirming him as the puppy killer , we must engage in an online campaign to ensure that everyone who does business with or associates with him is warned .
The puppy had no choice ; humans , through education , will .
UPDATE : A rumor has surfaced that David Motari works for Blackwater Worldwide .
A Blackwater official has confirmed that no one depicted in that video is a Blackwater employee or contractor .
UPDATE : David Motari's " Bebo " profile has been switched to private : people outside of his " friends network " are not authorized to view his profile .
He has ignore my repeated requests to confirm or deny that he is the " Motari " depicted in the YouTube video .
I will keep you updated as this story develops .
UPDATE : Others have noted , and I agree , that we must await confirmation of the puppy killer 's identity before taking further action .
The matter is still under investigation , and we need to confirm identities .
Once we have confirmation , we should do everything legally within our power to make the killer 's life a living Hell .
But we must await confirmation before taking further action .
UPDATE : The Marine Corp is investigating the matter .
UPDATE : I have an update to this post , including a link to mainstream media coverage , here .

World affairs editor , BBC News
Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 I have spent almost a year of my life here , reporting on the conflict .
An increase in US troop numbers has helped contain violence I have witnessed a disturbing amount of death and injury , and several of my friends have lost their lives .
Others have become refugees and asylum - seekers .
It has lasted almost as long as World War II and cost almost as much .
Only one of its original aims , the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , has been achieved .
Of the other aims , one was unobtainable because Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction to be destroyed , and the other - bringing democracy to the Middle East - has been indefinitely postponed .
Nothing new in any of this , of course .
Anti-war commentators have repeated it all again and again , while pro-war commentators mostly avoid mentioning any of it .
More importantly , the war has shown the limits of American power .
It is clear the United States can only manage to fight two small wars at a time .
Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched the US armed forces almost to breaking point .
America after the invasion of Iraq is no longer the superpower it was before .
Rearguard action
Yet American resilience and inventive power seem to have turned the corner here , at least in military terms .
Tactics which were losing the war have been abandoned , and new , more intelligent tactics have taken their place .
Now , the American forces are engaged in fighting a rearguard action , winning time during which the long - term decisions can be taken about withdrawal or some form of continuing presence here .
We have seen how hard it is for the Americans to deal with a few thousand lightly - armed volunteers
Some people - for instance Senator John McCain , the Republican candidate for the White House - will no doubt call this rearguard action a success .
He may even be tempted to call it a victory .
Yet at present it is hard to think of it as particularly successful .
On Monday , Vice - President Dick Cheney came to Baghdad and talked about " the phenomenal improvement in security " .
That day more than 60 Iraqis were killed in bomb attacks .
He had to travel with unprecedented numbers of bodyguards , even though he never left the heavily defended Green Zone .
Two mortar rounds hit the Zone while he was there .
None of this feels like a phenomenal improvement in security .
Elementary errors Still , ever since the start of 2007 , when Gen David Petraeus started introducing radically new tactics , the war has entered a different phase .
The various elements in the insurgency have been divided , the Mehdi Army has been persuaded to keep its head down , and the American and Iraqi forces have gone on the offensive , denying their enemy the chance to dig in and control territory .
Dick Cheney has vowed the US mission in Iraq will be completed Before Gen Petraeus took over , American military tactics were negative , and sometimes seemed almost defeatist .
The insurgents were able to operate at will along the main roads in Baghdad .
They took over entire suburbs and towns .
At the same time there was a breathtaking lack of political understanding .
In the first year after the invasion , Iraqi politicians found the American proconsul , Paul Bremer , both arrogant and silly .
He made a number of elementary errors which have caused lasting damage .
Nowadays , by contrast , the face of American policy here is Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador to Iraq .
He speaks good Arabic and has a sympathetic understanding of the country and its people .
Altogether , the American military and diplomatic presence here has much more professionalism and intellectual seriousness to it .
Long - term danger Iraqi friends of mine who once hated the fact that the Americans were here now praise them for driving the militants from the streets .
That is a real success .
Violence is down , but Iraqis continue to be killed
But it is small compared with the damage which the war has done to America 's reputation .
The US state department finds it much harder nowadays to be taken seriously when it criticises other countries for their use of torture and arbitrary arrest .
People the world over have been repelled by things that have been done here : things that are now associated with place - names like Abu Ghraib , Haditha , and Falluja .
Above all , we have seen how hard it is for the Americans to deal with a few thousand lightly armed volunteers .
Germany 's 19th - Century Chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , said that great powers had to be very careful when they put their military strength to the test .
Unless they are overwhelmingly successful , he meant , the perception will be that they have been defeated .
In spite of the new successes on the ground here , that is the long - term danger America faces .

What are these ?
Believe it or not , it took a rogue , outcast scientist to prove that it was okay , in fact necessary , for parents to hug their children .
Less than 50 years ago , psychologists , pediatricians , even the federal government warned parents against hugging their children .
Government pamphlets were given out that said things like “ Never kiss a baby , especially in the mouth ” and “ Do n’t rock or play with children . ”
Harry Harlow set out to prove that love is important to the development of a child , and that it plays the crucial role to bonding a mother to her child .
He tested his hypothesis in a series of experiments using insanely cute baby monkeys :
( link )
Harlow 's experiments convinced many people that a baby does n’t bond simply from the need for food , but the need for security and reassurance that in turn develops a healthy sense of curiosity and confidence .
The next time you pick up your little monkey , do n't take that loving embrace for granted .

APRIL 24 -- Oregon educators want law enforcement officials to probe who was responsible for mailing parents a letter on school letterhead suggesting that they supply students with alcohol at post - prom parties .
The letter , a copy of which you 'll find here , was sent this week to families of students at Portland 's Lincoln High School .
Recipients of the missive were urged to consider opening their homes this Saturday for parties as " a safe , secure place for students to have fun , " adding if adults ' provide the alcohol , you can have peace of mind knowing that they did not acquire it illegally .
Condoms were included with the letters -- which were written on Portland Public Schools stationery -- since " STD epidemics have spread through other high school communities and we want to prevent such an outbreak as best we can . "
The letter was purportedly written by " The Lincoln High School Faculty and Administration . "
Officials do not know how the letter 's creator (s ) got access to school mailing lists .
And while rather well written , the letter did include obvious clues that it was a hoax , including a supposed recommendation from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission .
The state agency , the letter claimed , " stated that a fifth of alcohol , like Hennessy Cognac , is sufficient supply for at least 8 adults .
One can assume that for 17 to 18 year old individuals , one fifth can probably be spread out to 4 students .
Considering our reputation ( Drinkin ' Lincoln ) , in some cases one fifth is only enough for a single person . " ( 2 pages )
In a stunning admission , top officials at the Veterans Health Administration confirmed that the agency ’s own statistics show that an average of 126 veterans per week — 6,552 veterans per year — commit suicide , according to an internal email distributed to several VA officials .
Brig .
Gen. Michael J. Kussman , the undersecretary for health at the VA , sent the email , dated Dec. 15 , 2007 .
Kussman had inquired about the accuracy of a news report published that month claiming the suicide rate among veterans was 18 per day .
“ McClatchy [ Newspapers ] alleges that 18 veterans kill themselves everyday and this is confirmed by the VA ’s own statistics , ” Kussman wrote .
“ Is that true ?
Sounds awful but if one is considering 24 million veterans . ”
In an email response to Kussman , Ira Katz , the head of mental health at the VA , confirmed the statistics and added “ VA ’s own data demonstrate 4 - 5 suicides per day among those who receive care from us . ”
The organizations claim the VA , which has a backlog of 600,000 benefits claims to sort through , is unprepared to deal with cases of posttraumatic stress disorder among veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , and has turned away veterans who have sought help for depression at VA hospitals .
Some of those veterans later committed suicide , according to the lawsuit .
The groups want a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction to force the VA to immediately treat veterans who show signs of PTSD and are at risk of suicide .

Past research on police shootings , when examining officer characteristics , has focused on the officer 's race , particularly when it is not the same as the race of the person shot .
Data from 186 officer - involved shootings were used to examine whether race effects existed and , if so , would be eliminated or attenuated by controlling for officer gender , education , age , and history of shooting .
Male officers were more likely to shoot than female officers , and college - educated officers were less likely to be involved in shootings than officers with no college education .
Risk of officer - involved shooting was reduced as the officer aged .
White , non-Hispanic officers were more likely to shoot than Hispanic officers ; however , there was no significant difference between Hispanic and Black officers .
Officers with a previous history of shooting were more than 51 % as likely to shoot during the follow - up period as officers without a history of shootings .

Iran ’s hard - line president proposed Monday to hold public talks with President Bush on a wide range of issues , without saying whether that included international suspicions about the Iranian nuclear program or allegations of Iranian meddling in Iraq .
“ Last year , I announced readiness for a televised debate over global issues with his excellency Mr. Bush .
And now we announce that I am ready to negotiate with him about bilateral issues as well as regional and international issues , ” Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying on the website of Al Alam , the state - run Arabic - language satellite television channel .
The Iranian leader did not elaborate on what specifically he was willing to discuss with Bush but said the talks “ should be held with media present . ”
It was not immediately clear if Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say in all state matters , supported Ahmadinejad ’s proposal .

Khamenei has regularly rejected any direct talks between Tehran and Washington because of what he calls U.S. “ bullying ” of Iran .
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since the 1979 storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran .
The Bush administration said Iran must abandon any nuclear weapon ambitions before talks could be held .
“ Instead of offering televised debates or a media spectacle , the United States has offered actual discussions if Iran would only agree to what the international community has asked for repeatedly : Stop uranium enrichment and reprocessing , ” Gordon Johndroe , a spokesman for the White House ’s National Security Council , said Monday in Washington .
“ We ’re ready whenever they are . ”
These days , the Recording Industry Association of America is arguably best known for its legal campaign against P2P users — filing over 25,000 copyright infringement lawsuits in a few short years will do that , I guess .
But as a music industry trade group , the group has several other responsibilities .
One of those is lobbying Congress for tougher copyright laws , an endeavor that the group spent nearly $ 2.1 million on in 2007 .
Each year , groups that lobby Congress are required to report on how much they spent convincing lawmakers to pass legislation .
During 2007 , the RIAA spent $ 2.08 million lobbing Congress on three pieces of legislation near and dear to its heart :
The PRO - IP Act , the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act , college funding bill The College Opportunity and Affordability Act , and legislation relating to royalties paid by terrestrial and Internet broadcasters .
The far - reaching PRO -IP Act was introduced to the House in December 2007 .
The bill would create a new executive office , the Office of the US Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative , which would be charged with coordinating IP enforcement at the national and international levels .
IP agents would be sent to other countries to assist in investigation and crackdowns in much the same way as they do drug - trafficking investigations .
The PRO - IP
Act would also increase penalties for copyright and trademark infringement , allowing for the seizure of equipment used for copyright infringement .
Originally , the bill included penalties of up to $ 1.5 million for illegally copying 10 - song compilation CDs , but that provision was later pulled by a House subcommittee .
The legislation has yet to emerge from committee , and the last action was a December 2007 subcommittee hearing .
Over in the Senate , the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act is the latest incarnation of the PIRATE Act .
The RIAA loves this bill because it would outsource the thousands of copyright infringement lawsuits filed each year to the Department of Justice , saving the group millions of dollars in legal fees .
The IPEA would also increase funding for the FBI 's investigations of crimes " related to the theft of intellectual property . "
The IPEA has also yet to emerge from committee .
The RIAA 's interest in the College Opportunity and Affordability Act comes from a very controversial provision that requires schools to make plans to implement copyright filters on their networks and offer legal alternatives to file - sharing .
Colleges and universities across the country opposed the IP enforcement provision of the financial aid funding bill out of fears that it would ultimately lead to financial aid being cut off .
House staffers have told Ars that is not the case , saying that failure to plan for filters and legal music services would have no consequences .
The RIAA 's lobbying efforts are n't just limited to Congress .
The group is part of the Copyright Alliance , which also counts the MPAA as a member .
The Copyright Alliance claims to speak " on behalf of the 11 million Americans employed in the creative industries , " and has lobbied the current presidential candidates for tougher copyright laws .
CEO Mitch Bainwol , president Cary Sherman , and director of strategic communications Paige Ralston Fromer were among those working the halls of the Capitol on behalf of the RIAA during 2007 .
As a private trade group funded by the record labels , the RIAA 's budget is an unknown quantity , and it 's impossible to say what percentage of its budget the RIAA spends on lobbying ( or P2P litigation , for that matter ) .
The group 's $ 2.08 million expenditure is a mere fraction of the $ 2.8 billion spent lobbying Congress and the executive branch last year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
$ 2.08 million is n't even enough to crack the top 20 list , which was headed up by the US Chamber of Commerce with $ 52.75 million .
Lockheed Martin brought up the rear of that list with $ 10.41 million spent .

In a statement issued on Friday , he said : “ Bear Stearns has been the subject of a multitude of market rumors regarding our liquidity .
We have tried to confront and dispel these rumors and parse fact from fiction .
Nevertheless , amidst this market chatter , our liquidity position in the last 24 hours had significantly deteriorated .
We took this important step to restore confidence in us in the marketplace , strengthen our liquidity and allow us to continue normal operations . ”
While Bear may have some degree of short - term cash on hand , it is by no means sufficient if all its creditors demand to be paid at once .
It has some valuable businesses like its hedge fund servicing and back office unit , as well as aspects of its real estate operations , but in light of the current market conditions it is unlikely to command a high price , especially from JPMorgan , which has said repeatedly that it is not in the market for an investment bank .
In a conference call on Friday , Mr. Schwartz , who just succeeded James E. Cayne as chief executive late last year , struck a frustrated tone as he described the run on Bear ’s bank over the last 24 hours , raising the possibility that the firm ’s days as an independent bank are numbered .
He reiterated that Bear Stearns had started the week with sufficient capital .
But four days ’ worth of speculation had so rattled customers and lenders that by late Thursday they sought to cash out .
“ As we got through the day , we recognized that at the pace things were going , there could be continued liquidity demands that would outstrip our resources , ” he said .
Standard &
Poor ’s confirmed that situation after it cut its long - term credit rating on the company to BBB from A and said more downgrades were likely .
“ Bear has been experiencing significant stress in the past week because of concerns regarding its liquidity position , ” S.& P. said in a statement .
“ Although the firm ’s liquidity , at the beginning of the week , held steady with excess cash of $ 18 billion , ongoing pressure and anxiety in the markets resulted in significant cash outflows toward the week ’s end , leaving Bear with a significantly deteriorated liquidity position at end of business on Thursday . ”
Mr. Schwartz confirmed on the conference call that the firm is working with the investment bank Lazard to consider strategic alternatives , a stock financial phrase that often signifies a potential sale .
Though Lazard , Bear Stearns approached JPMorgan about securing a credit facility .
“ This is a bridge to a more permanent solution and it will allow us to look at strategic alternative that can run the gamut , ” he said .
“ Investors will be able to see the facts instead of the fiction .
We will look for any alternative that serves our customers as well as maximizes shareholder value . ”

Also at the meeting , council members unanimously approved a resolution asking Congress to open an impeachment inquiry into President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ Everybody has to be held accountable , ” said Charles Kramer , D - 6th District .
The resolution asks that Congress open the hearing based on the administration ’s disregard for the U.S. Constitution , condoning of torture , and lies leading up to the invasion of Iraq .
“ It might end as a symbolic stance , ” said Sean Massey , D - 5th , “ but it ’s an important one . ”

When I read Alanschech ’s article on the “ Dream Bowl ” , where he pitted all the Super Bowl winners in a tournament against each other , I realized what had to be done .
I finally understood the meaning of my mission .
That mission was to figure out who IS the worst team in football history .
I decided to only go as far back as the Super Bowl era ( 1966 ) because I do have a life and I wanted to still be able to enjoy that life rather than spend all my time on WhatIf .
My method for choosing teams was to go through the standings of each of the 42 years and pick out every team with only two or fewer wins .
The only exceptions were teams with two wins and a tie , or two win teams from the strike - shortened 1982 season ( I did take a one - win and no - win team from that year ) .
It just happened to work out that I had an even 50 teams in my tournament .
I seeded the teams 1 - 50 with the worst teams getting the top seeds ( congratulations to the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers ! ) .
Now in order to move on in the tournament , a team had to lose its What If simulation .
The winner was out .
So I gave the top 14 teams a bye from the Wild Card round , and matched up the others .
The top seeds were awarded away field disadvantage , so as to give them a slightly better chance of losing ( which , of course is the goal of the Toilet Bowl ) .
After the other 36 teams turned into 18 pathetic losing teams , we had a nice even 32 team tournament , and I ’m sure you can figure how it worked from there .
So , without further ado , I hope you enjoy the Toilet Bowl , presented by WhatIfSports and brought to you in part by the good people at Armchair GM : All Sports , All You .

The Toilet Bowl
1 vs 2 – ’ 72 Oilers - 27 , ’66 Giants - 20
The Toilet Bowl got off to a start that surprised nobody , as 4 straight punts summed up the first quarter .
Finally , in the second quarter , Skip “ Butler ’s 50 yd. field goal hooks through the uprights ” to put Houston on the board first .
After a third New York punt , Houston put together another drive , but punched this one in the end zone to make the score 10 - 0 .
Finally New York got on the board with 1:50 left in the first half thanks to an Allen Jacobs 37 yard touchdown run .
Naturally , the extra point was missed .
The Giants were ready to head into the locker room only down 4 , but Houston came out firing trying to expand their lead .
However , since they suck , the Oilers instead came up with a three - and - out , and were forced to punt with 1:21 still left on the clock .
New York took advantage of the gift and scored another touchdown before the half was over making the score 13 - 10 , New York at the half .
Both teams looked uninspired in their opening drives of the second half as the 12 fans in the stands and the 38 viewers at home watched back to back punts .
Finally New
York got back in the game on their next possession , scoring another touchdown and expanding their lead to 20 - 10 .
It looked like the Oilers were destined to be the worst team in history as the third quarter sputtered to a close , but they came out defiantly in the 4 th looking to avoid that title .
They scored a touchdown on the back of running back Fred Willis , then on the first Giants play after the kickoff , Bob Atkins picked off an Earl Morrall pass , which led to another Willis touchdown .
The Oilers now led the game 24 - 20 .
New York was forced to punt on their next drive , and Houston scored again ; this time a field goal , making the game 27 - 20 .
However , New York was n’t quite done yet .
They impressively drove the ball down to the Houston 16 with 52 seconds left .
They ran up the middle for a yard , making it 2 nd and 9 on the 15 .
New York called a time out ; 48 seconds left .
Next play Morrall dropped back , saw his open receiver streaking across the end zone , fired , and the ball was promptly batted down at the line of scrimmage .
On third down , Morrall overthrew his receiver in the end zone , bringing up the critical fourth down .
Morrall found his open man again , this time it was Homer Jones .
It was a perfect throw , a wide open receiver , the ball got past the line of scrimmage , and Homer Jones … dropped the ball .
Game over .
Oilers win .
Giants become the worst team in football history .
Folks , I could n’t have written a better ending for the Toilet Bowl myself .
Worst Team in History :
1966 New York Giants 1- 12 -1
So there you have it .
We went waaay back to find the worst team in history , and naturally it came out be the New York Football Giants , a team who apparently just has a knack for losing Bowl games .
Hmm …
Anyway , I was personally hoping to see a more recent team that people could remember come away with the title , just so we could all say , “ Wow they really did suck , and I remember , cuz I was there ( Berman accent ) ” .
But I only call ‘em as I see ‘em , and What If says that the worst team of all time was the 1966 Giants .
Just imagine how the Washington Redskins must feel , being the only team in history to actually lose to the ’ 66 Giants … how embarrassing .
Football fans , you can now go in peace knowing that there is some hope for your NFL franchise ( if you ’re not a Giants fan ) .
After all , at least you do n’t root for the worst team of all time .
The morning after the attack the streets were still awash with blood
The blasts left another 130 people injured , the officials said .
A witness at the scene described people holding body parts and a woman crying as rescuers searched for her sons .
The BBC's Hugh Sykes in Baghdad said the second bomb targeted crowds gathered at the site of the first , causing the high death toll .
He says there are no obvious military targets in the area , and local residents were out shopping ahead of the Iraqi weekend in fine spring weather when the bombs exploded .
Teenagers
A roadside bomb exploded first in the predominantly Shia area , followed a few minutes later by a second blast caused by a suicide bomber , police said .
Many of the victims were teenagers and young adults .
Hassan Abdullah , 25 , told AP he was standing near the clothing shop he owns when the first explosion went off about 150 metres away .
He was walking towards the scene when the second explosion struck .
" I saw a leg and a hand falling near me as I was walking .
The whole place was a mess , " he said .
" Wounded people were crying for help and people started to run away . "
Our correspondent says attacks like this used to occur almost daily but have become much less common in recent months .
However , Iraqi government figures this week showed that the number of Iraqi civilians killed in February was a third higher than in January .
The figures reversed the six - month - long trend of falling death tolls attributed to a surge in US troop numbers , the formation of anti-al - Qaeda militias by Sunni Arab tribes and a freeze in activities of the Mehdi Army militia loyal to radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr .

The measure , signed by President Robert Kocharian , bans public gatherings and imposes restrictions on media reports .
It came after police fired in the air to disperse demonstrators .
Some reports suggest a number of casualties .
Prime Minister Serzh Sarkisian won the 19 February vote against opposition challenger Levon Ter-Petrosian .
Mr Ter -Petrosian says he is under house arrest .
International observers judged the poll in the ex-Soviet Caucasus republic to be generally democratic .
' Standing firm '
The latest clashes erupted after police cleared Freedom Square of opposition demonstrators who had been camping there since the election .
At least 31 people were wounded in the morning stand - off .
Regrouping later , they used buses as barricades .
Some cars were set on fire .
Lines of police were deployed to face the protesters .
A witness told Reuters news agency police had fired in the air " to scare us " .

" They have fired tear gas .
But people are standing firm .
There are thousands of people standing here with us . "
Some unconfirmed reports said a number of people had been injured as police fired in the air .
It was not clear how the injuries were sustained .
Alan , a development consultant in Yerevan , heard a lot of gunfire from his home close to Freedom Square .
" After the shooting , we heard a lot of shouting and saw people running from the scene .
We could see red tracer bullet fire being shot in two directions , " he told the BBC .
Lori , who lives in the centre of Yerevan , saw a line of tanks roll down her street shortly before the violence erupted .
" About 30 minutes later I saw a flash from my window and then we heard a boom sound , " she said .
" We heard shooting and saw red tracer bullets firing in our direction .
The shooting was constant and very heavy for more than an hour . "
But President Kocharian told a late evening news conference that some of the demonstrators were armed and that police said they had been shot at .
" What 's going on now is not a political process .
It has gone over the edge , " he said .
" I appeal to the people of Armenia to show restraint and understanding . "
The state of emergency is to remain in force until 20 March , the presidential decree says .
Witnesses say they have seen army lorries carrying soldiers on the main road heading towards the Armenian capital .
The opposition has said it will continue with the protests .
Official results gave Mr Sarkisian 53 % of the vote , with Mr Ter - Petrosian , a former president , getting 21.5 % .
( CNN ) -- U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , the main suspect in the killing of a 20 - year - old pregnant Marine , has been captured in Mexico three months after fleeing North Carolina , the FBI announced Thursday .
" I loved her , " Laurean told a Mexican reporter who asked whether he killed Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach .
Authorities are awaiting extradition to bring Laurean , who has been on the run since January , back to North Carolina .
He has been indicted on charges of murder , ATM card theft , attempted card theft , fraud and robbery with a dangerous weapon .
Mexican authorities arrested Laurean at 7 p.m. Thursday in San Juan Vina , in Michoacan , about 120 miles west of the capital , after he approached a roadblock set up by the local anti-kidnapping task force , according to the Michoacan state attorney general 's office .
Laurean , dressed in a red t- shirt , jeans and tennis shoes , gave authorities his real name , which was entered into a criminal database that alerted authorities to his fugitive status , Guzman said .
Police said Laurean was calm and gave no resistance .
He told police he had been sleeping in avocado groves and eating the fruit from the trees , Guzman said .
Laurean , who grew a scruffy beard , appeared thin and unkempt , Guzman said .
" This is a clear message to all would - be fugitives from U.S. law that Mexico will not provide them refuge , " U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Antonio O. Garza said in a statement .
" Laurean fled to Mexico early this year in the hope of avoiding justice .
Despite his attempts to elude apprehension , international police cooperation and cutting edge technology led law - enforcement officials to his capture . "
However , if Laurean chooses to fight extradition , it could take two years to return him to North Carolina , said Dewey Hudson , district attorney for Onslow County , North Carolina .
" I 'm very happy he was caught today in Mexico , but I 'm disappointed we did n't catch him in America , " Hudson said .
Mexico 's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives who are turned over by Mexican authorities .
Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she was last seen near Camp LeJeune , North Carolina , in December .
A month later , her charred body , along with that of her fetus , was found beneath a fire pit in Laurean 's backyard in Onslow County .
Authorities believe that Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to his native Mexico .

Lauterbach had accused him of raping her , and it is unclear whether he was the father of her fetus .
Laurean denied the rape allegation or any other sexual contact with Lauterbach .
In a statement issued after her death , the Marine Corps said Laurean 's denial " was believed to be significant evidence . "
Her body was found after Laurean 's wife produced a note he had written claiming Lauterbach slit her own throat during an argument , officials have said .
A 4 - inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach 's neck , though the wound itself would not have been fatal , according to autopsy results .
A law enforcement official said federal authorities recently seized a computer belonging to Laurean 's sister - in - law , which Laurean 's wife was using to communicate with Laurean while he was on the run .
Laurean apparently told his wife in e-mails that he wanted to return to the United States , the official said .
Authorities also seized the wife 's diary .
" It 's clear she 's still deeply in love with him and she is vacillating between loving him and being angry at him for not being faithful to her , " the official said .
" It 's not necessarily illegal for a wife to talk to her husband , but if she had tried to help him in any way , there would have been a problem . "
The news of Laurean 's capture took Lauterbach 's mother by surprise , family attorney Merle Wilberding said .
" She 's grateful he 's been caught , that the system has worked and she hopes will continue to work , " he said .
Lauterbach 's mother has demanded answers from the Marines about why more was n't done to protect her daughter after she made the rape allegation against Laurean .
Mary Lauterbach sent a list of 30 - plus questions to the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps , Gen. James Conway , through her congressman last week and says she 's unconvinced that her daughter 's rape allegation against a fellow Marine was treated seriously .
A Marine Corps spokesman has said the service will respond to all of Mary Lauterbach 's questions and will not comment further until those answers are complete .
After Maria Lauterbach accused Laurean of rape in May 2007 , she was moved to another office , and a military protective order was issued to keep the accuser from the accused .
But Mary Lauterbach and her congressman , Rep. Mike Turner , say the Marines did n't do enough to protect her .
Turner said in a news release this week that the response from the Marines , sent by Lt. Gen. R. S. Kramlich , director of Marine Corps Staff , " demonstrates that the actions taken by the Marine Corps to protect Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach were totally inadequate . "
Turner said there was " a lack of urgency in the Marine Corps ' response to Maria Lauterbach 's plea for help . "
He said the Marine Corps waited six days to start investigating Lauterbach 's rape allegation against Laurean .
The Marine Corps took no action to protect Lauterbach despite an assault on her and vandalism to her car , Turner said .

Can an FDA - approved arthritis drug double as a therapy for Alzheimer disease ?
Claiming it did in a patient , a case report published in the January 9 Journal of Neuroinflammation generated a wave of media attention that splashed across television , the BBC , newspapers and out to numerous online sources and blogs .
The coverage ran the gamut from breathless approval to stern criticism .
Some headlines announced “ Extraordinary Breakthrough - Alzheimer ’s Symptoms Reversed in Minutes , ” other outlets reprinted the press release , CNN ’s Sanjay Gupta balanced promise and caveats , and a blogger posted his open letter to the study authors in which he charged “ This , gentlemen , appears to be a sham . ”
So what is a reader to make of it ?
The Alzforum looked behind the initial media accounts to report the story in greater depth .
Scientists in the field were intrigued about the approach of inhibiting certain cytokines to treat inflammation in AD , yet also expressed reservations about the way these studies were conducted .
The present paper was submitted to J. Neuroinflammation , an open - access journal published by BioMedCentral , on November 29 , 2007 .
It describes the response of an 81 - year - old physician who met diagnostic criteria for probable AD and came to the principal investigator ’s medical practice in October of 2007 .
The patient received weekly injections of etanercept ( marketed under the name Enbrel® ) , a biologic drug that binds and neutralizes tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) .
The paper ’s authors are Edward Tobinick , a dermatologist and internist who runs a private medical group in Los Angeles , and Hyman Gross , a neurologist in private practice in Santa Monica , California .
The paper is freely available and therefore not summarized in detail here .
In brief , the authors report that this patient visibly and measurably improved within minutes of receiving drug injections into the back of the neck , and that his improvement lasted throughout a 7 - week assessment period during which he received one injection every week for the first 5 weeks .
Tobinick and Gross hypothesize that the man ’s cognitive improvement might be due to etanercept ’s ability to quench the action of excess TNFα at the brain ’s synapses .
In an accompanying editorial , Sue Griffin of the University of Arkansas School of Medical Sciences in Little Rock speculates that this drug might be able to counteract “ gliotransmission ” in the human brain , i.e. , the effects on synaptic activity of TNFα released by activated glial cells .
In an unusually personal editorial , Griffin recounts her journey to Tobinick ’s practice to observe the treatment herself , writing : “ … — I was amazed ! ” Griffin is editor - in - chief of J. Neuroinflammation ; the news bureau at her institution issued the press release .
Griffin argues for larger , double - blind follow - up studies to explore both etanercept and the delivery method used by Tobinick and Gross .
The present paper followed publication in 2006 of an open - label pilot study of 15 patients .
This study did not assess patients ’ cognition so soon after they had received the injection , but did claim to provide proof - of - concept that 6 months of weekly etanercept administration improved the performance of patients on the MMSE , ADAS - Cog , and SIB assessment tools ( Tobinick et al. , 2006 ) .
In this paper , one patient , an 80 - year - old study participant , was reported to have died suddenly and without obvious cause during the last week of the trial .
When asked about this study , seven independent academic investigators who were not involved in it all said that the scientific rationale behind targeting TNFα to dampen inflammation in AD and some other neurological conditions is valid .
Case reports have led to the development of new drugs before , and the independent scientists all agreed that formal clinical research should be pursued .
At the same time , they expressed unease about the way in which these studies were performed .
“ The use of etanercept in this fashion is an interesting idea ; however , I believe these studies should be done in randomized controlled trials , so the field can know how to interpret the data , ” said David Holtzman , who chairs the neurology department at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri .
Some criticized the way the study was publicized .
“ This is exciting but very preliminary information , ” said Cynthia Lemere , associate professor of Neurology at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
“ The appropriate way to pursue it at this stage is to apply to FDA and NIH for support to run a rigorous trial , not to promote it to the general public . ”
These comments encompass a range of specific concerns scientists raised .
For one , none of the studies reported so far included controls .
Controls could include injecting placebo , i.e. , sterile saline , in the exact same way that etanercept is injected .
This would test whether any response is due to the drug or to something else about the procedure .
One reason why this is important is that patients with probable Alzheimer disease have been noted to have strong placebo effects , as occurs in other diseases .
“ I never fail to be dismayed at the magnitude of placebo effects in Alzheimer disease ; they are remarkably large , ” said Ben Barres , a professor of neurobiology and leader in glial cell research at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California ( see comment below . )
Another reason is that symptoms in Alzheimer disease patients are known to vary widely over time .
The long - term trajectory of this progressive disease is invariably downward , but within that slow overall decline , patients show frequent ups and downs in cognitive function .
Patients change not only because of their disease but also in response to things around them — stress , the environment , changes in daily routines , Holtzman explained .
This zigzag pattern of overall decline renders it nearly impossible to interpret observations of any intervention done without controls , especially in a single case .
If follow - up studies substantiate that the observed effect is due to etanercept , fundamental scientific questions about where and how the treatment works remain to be addressed .
Toward that goal , other controls could include peripheral administration of etanercept .
Side - by - side comparisons of delivery modes and uptake / metabolism in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) would begin to address issues around whether the injection used in this study is the best way to deliver the drug .
Scientists interviewed questioned whether etanercept reaches the brain and acts there , or instead reduces TNFα in a more indirect fashion from outside the central nervous system ( CNS , see comment by Greg Cole below ) .
According to his papers , Tobinick injected etanercept between the spinous processes of the C6 and 7 vertebrae in the neck in such a way that the needle does not penetrate the CSF space itself but deposits the drug around one of the membranes covering the spinal cord .
There are numerous veins in this region , which are proposed to allow some transport into the brain .
To enhance this transport , the patients were laid on their backs , with their feet higher than their heads , for 5 minutes after the injection .
Tobinick calls this type of injection “ perispinal extrathecal ” administration .
This administration involves a shallower injection than the better known and widely used lumbar puncture farther down the spine , which some physicians consider safer in part because it is less likely to rupture veins .
There is no formal published data yet to show that the perispinal injection does indeed cause brain uptake of TNFα .
Scientists in the laboratory of Pat McGeer took up this question and have unpublished results .
( A noted researcher at the University of British Columbia , Vancouver , McGeer was one of the pioneers who established the concept of inflammation in neurologic disease and advanced it as a therapeutic target .
To date , most controlled trials of anti-inflammatory drugs have been negative , but research is ongoing . )
The Canadian scientists imaged the brains of rats injected with labeled etanercept .
They were able to detect etanercept in the CSF but not the brain parenchyma , where neurons and synapses are located ( see comment below ) .
In addition to determining whether this special injection is effective at delivering etanercept to the brain ’s synapses , one might study whether its inherent risk is necessary , said Murali Doraiswamy , chief of biological psychiatry Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina .
Published evidence from a large randomized , controlled trial of people with psoriasis suggests that etanercept given peripherally ( it usually is injected under the skin ) can ameliorate depression , mood , and other brain - related symptoms ( Tyring et al. , 2006 ) .
This leads some researchers to wonder whether some small fraction of etanercept — a large molecule generally considered unable to cross the blood - brain barrier — might somehow get across , or act on brain TNFα levels indirectly from the outside .
Monkey studies with labeled etanercept would be suitable to answer these questions in preparation for formal clinical trials , said Lemere .
A related question concerns whether people with AD truly have elevated TNFα levels in their CSF .
Several studies have reported such findings while some others have not , and some researchers noted having measured elevated CSF TNFα in some AD patients but not in others .
As yet , scientists have not come to a general consensus that CSF TNFα is elevated in AD , as they have , for example , for tau or oxidative products called isoprostanes .
The relationship between peripheral ( i.e. , plasma ) and central ( i.e. , CSF ) levels of TNFα in AD needs to be sorted out ( e.g. , see Cole comment below ) .
Edward Tobinick is a board - certified dermatologist and internist , who has been active in laser hair removal prior to developing an interest in the use of etanercept for CNS indications .
The hair removal clinic at which Tobinick is medical director , the Institute of Laser Medicine , is in the same building as the Institute for Neurological Research , the medical group that sees AD patients for etanercept treatment ; both are in suites 205 - 210 at 100 UCLA Medical Plaza .
Etanercept is approved for rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and the skin disease psoriasis .
Tobinick has previously disclosed that he owns stock in Amgen , the owner of etanercept .
He holds numerous patents on delivery methods of etanercept for neurologic conditions ( e.g. , United States Patent 7,214,658 ) .
As of January 2008 , the Medical Board of California lists Tobinick as being on probation .
Details of the disciplinary action were not available in time for this news article , but the Board ’s April 2007 newsletter [ .pdf ] on page 20 published a paragraph indicating that Tobinick was charged with unprofessional conduct relating to advertising an unproven treatment for back pain .
Tobinick published uncontrolled open - label treatment results suggesting that etanercept might serve to ameliorate disc- related pain ( Tobinick et al. , 2004 ) .
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland , tested these observations with a double - blind , placebo - controlled dose - response trial .
Last summer they reported that etanercept injection was not effective for this indication ( Cohen et al. , 2007 ) .
A related area of uncertainty pertains to the distinctions between clinical practice and research .
Physicians routinely prescribe drugs off - label , and charge for the drug , as part of their medical practice .
This is a common practice tolerated by the FDA .
In contrast , when the intent is to study a drug for a new indication , i.e. , to collect and publish data , it is treated as research , and as such becomes subject to approval by an institutional review board ( IRB ) .
IRBs often mandate that the physicians submit their study protocols to the FDA for review .
In an interview , an FDA official was unable to say whether an investigational new drug ( IND ) exemption had been submitted for the study of perispinal etanercept in AD , as IND issuances are confidential .
The official pointed out that typically under IRB and IND rules , patients cannot be charged for the treatment given in a research study .
Attempts to clarify how the interrelated issues of IRB rules , payment , and treatment versus research were handled in these studies were unsuccessful .
According to the published papers , the patient described in this month ’s case report was treated as part of clinical practice .
The 2006 paper of the pilot study notes that a central institutional review board , a form of IRB often used for multicenter trials , approved the study , and that the families of the study subjects supplied the study drug .
Most media reports presented the work as a “ UCLA study . ”
Tobinick lists a UCLA e-mail address on the manuscript , and the private medical group where he works full - time is located in a building at UCLA ’s medical plaza .
According to the UCLA media office , Tobinick is a voluntary assistant clinical professor with UCLA ’s Division of Dermatology .
The office stated that his etanercept study did not go through the UCLA IRB .
Greg Cole , associate director of the UCLA Alzheimer Disease Center ( ADC ) , said that the center had nothing to do with Tobinick ’s etanercept work .
( Cole is known for his research on inflammation and cytokine action in AD .
He studies , among other things , curcumin , a spice that has anti-TNFα activity and is being tested in a 12 - month Phase 2 clinical trial at UCLA . )
The J. Neuroinflammation paper identifies coauthor Gross as being at the Department of Neurology , University of Southern California , School of Medicine .
That university ’s website does not list Gross as a faculty physician in the neurology department .
John Weiner , media representative at USC Health Sciences , said that Gross is not on USC ’s regular , paid faculty but has a voluntary appointment .
Weiner added that such voluntary associations are similar to “ adjunct ” appointments at other academic institutions .
Amgen , the maker of etanercept , distanced itself from the study .
A statement regarding Tobinick and Gross ’s study on the company website noted : “ This study was not supported nor endorsed by Amgen .
While Amgen and others have long recognized the potential for TNF inhibitors to have an effect on neurological conditions , we have carefully examined this study and believe that at this time there is insufficient scientific data to support the use of a TNF inhibitor as a means of treating Alzheimer 's disease . ”
Reached by telephone , Amgen spokeswoman Sonia Fiorenza confirmed that this statement referred not only to the present paper , but that Amgen had studied etanercept ’s potential for treating AD internally , as well .
“ As common sense would suggest , we have looked very closely at this , ” Fiorenza said .
According to Amgen ’s 2006 Annual Report , etanercept ( Enbrel® ) sales that year totaled $ 2.9 billion .
On January 15 , this reporter e-mailed Tobinick questions relating to long - term cognitive effects , the precise nature of the injection , IRB approval , patient payment for treatment , total number of patients who responded vs. who did not , and other issues for an author Q&A in the format the Alzforum frequently publishes .
Dr. Tobinick requested a phone conversation instead , but during the subsequent call declined to take questions .
In a later e-mail , Tobinick noted that he is in discussions with academic medical centers .

BBC News , Singida , central Tanzania
They have seen the future - but will it work ?
A group of villagers gather at the local bicycle repair shop at Njiapanda , a dusty roadside hamlet on the rift valley in Singida region in central Tanzania , to marvel at magazine pictures of massive electricity - generating wind turbines .
They have never seen anything like this before and are clearly impressed .
They will soon find out exactly what the turbines are like .
In a matter of months , 24 of these 100 m - plus - high power generators will be erected next to their homes , as part of the first commercial wind farm in sub-Saharan Africa .
This is one of the poorest parts of Tanzania .
There is little agriculture , no industry , but one thing there is plenty of is wind .
It is an untapped resource , but one which could hold the key to providing much - needed electricity to central and northern Tanzania and kick - starting the development of the region .
The people of Singida are expecting a lot of this project
Regional Commissioner Parseko Kone
The 24 turbines , which should be in operation within 18 months , will generate 50 megawatts ( MW ) of power , almost 10 % of Tanzania 's current power needs .
The company behind the $ 113 m project is Wind East Africa .
" It 's important that Tanzania diversifies its power sources , " says project manager Mike Case .
" The country is very reliant on hydro - electric power , which means in times of drought , there is a power deficit .
Oil - generated power is very expensive , so wind power offers a cheaper and more reliable alternative . "
Fewer blackouts
The demand for power in Tanzania is growing by more than 50 MW a year , fuelled partly by an expansion of gold and nickel mining in the north of the country .
At present , electricity is sourced from power plants more than 1000 km away .
The wind farm at Njiapanda will mean that power - hungry industries will soon be provided with electricity generated locally .
Electricity bills are unlikely to be reduced
The wind farm will benefit the local economy , providing jobs during the construction phase and a handful of jobs when it is up and running .
Regional Commissioner Parseko
Kone is also hoping the rest of his impoverished region will profit .
" The people of Singida are expecting a lot of this project , " he says .
" They 're hoping it will help to develop our economy and because wind is free , they 're also expecting cheaper electricity tariffs . "
It is unlikely that tariffs will come down , as electricity is already heavily subsidised , but it does mean that Tanzanians can expect fewer power blackouts .
Power play
Wind power on a commercial scale is unknown in sub-Saharan Africa , despite the existence of constantly blowing and consistently strong winds , especially along the top of the rift valley , the mountain plateau which runs through East Africa from Ethiopia to Malawi and Mozambique .
In Europe , the industry is well developed .
Germany , the European leader in terms of generation , produces more than three gigawatts of power ( 3000 MW ) from wind turbines .
The target in many European countries is to have 50 % of all power generated by wind .
Wind is plentiful but under - exploited in central Tanzania Africa is now set to benefit from the progress made in Europe .
The equipment is becoming cheaper , as well as more robust .
According to wind expert Dr Ladislaus Lwambuka , from the University of Dar es Salaam , Africa is now ready for wind power on a commercial scale .
" If the Wind East Africa project is a success , then it could lead to more wind farms , not just in Tanzania but in the rest of Africa , particularly along the rift valley , where we know the winds are strong . "
There are already plans , if the first phase of the project goes well , to double the number of wind turbines and increase Wind East Africa 's output to up to 100 MW .
The people of Njiapanda and the surrounding dusty plateau may not know it now , but this small part of the rift valley will , by then , be the epicentre of wind power in sub-Saharan Africa .

investigation
It 's a fair question .
No one will let her tell us in any detail .
State Secrets laws do n't permit her to talk to a judge about it , much less a television reporter , and much of the media has avoided looking too intensely at the matter .
Apparently , she knows that several high - placed American officials put US nuclear materials on the black market , some of which were going to Pakistani secret police individuals with connections to ' Al Qaeda ' .
She has put some faces out in the public - people like Doug Feith , the huckster Richard Perle , Congressman Dennis Hastert and , well , check them out for yourself - without explaining the specific allegations .
She claims that several arms of the state are protecting individuals who have participated in the sale of such secrets and aided foreign intelligence moles who helped transmit such materials , frustrating FBI efforts at investigation .
It 's hardly unknown for the state to become a conduit for entrepreneurial criminal activity , particularly the secret state .
Drug smuggling , money laundering , arms transfers , all the usual business of empire can - because of its necessarily illicit nature - become the basis for making a lot of money individually , corrupting departments , and so on .
And the illicit tracking of nuclear materials , particularly low grade radioactive materials , probably involves state actors from a variety of countries .
Why , you might think , should the US be different ?
It is one of the many excellent arguments against nuclear weapons that , like all weapons , the technology is by no means guaranteed to remain the preserve of states ( which is life - threatening enough already ) .
But knowingly transferring nuclear materials in such a way that they could end up in the hands of ' Al Qaeda ' would ordinarily be considered ' treasonous ' .
After all , thousands of inviduals often with no proven record of posing any threat are being locked up in America 's global gulag on the putative off - chance that they might be .
Is it too much to wonder whether the faces put out by Edmonds should be in orange jumpsuits ?
Of course it is .
No one is going to go around embarrassing American officials , much less the intelligence agencies of two key US allies in the Middle East .
The ISI is totally off - limits .
Edmonds is never going to be legally permitted to say whatever she has to say .
Oh , but you 're gonna get an .

While Microsoft remains dominant in the office productivity suite space , it knows that it 's facing renewed competition from online offerings and open source offerings .
While none of those other products really match the breadth and depth of Microsoft's , in some cases they 're reaching " good enough " quality , and Microsoft recognizes the threat of a Clayton Christensen 's " Innovator 's Dilemma " situation , where the good enough product ends up beating out the much more expensive , but more complete product .
So , as part of a strategy to deal with that , Microsoft is testing offering Office as a subscription service .
It 's targeted at consumers , not businesses , who would pay a smaller monthly fee to get Microsoft Office and a variety of other components .
If they stop paying , they lose the software ( but keep their data and documents , of course ) .
While I have no idea if this particular offering will catch on , ita step in the right direction .
Selling software as software is increasingly an unsustainable business model for all the usual reasons ( infinite goods , and the like ) .
Different companies have taken different approaches to dealing with this .
IBM has shifted its business significantly over to services , and even has become a big proponent of free and open source software .
Similarly , Red Hat focuses mainly on services .
Google ( and many other " web " software providers ) focus mainly on ad- supported models for software .
Microsoft , due to its tremendous legacy user base lock - in and inertia has been able keep selling software directly , and will continue to be able to so for a while .
But , eventually , that business model is unsustainable -- and this new " Albany " subscription offering is a step towards moving away from it .
While it may seem like a subscription service is really just the same thing as straight software sales , it is n't necessarily .
It really depends on how Microsoft treats this .
If it treats it as just a way to break up the sales price of software , then it will fail .
But if it rethinks it 's overall approach , and realizes that the subscription fee should be for anthat provides additional benefits , then it could work quite well .
From an economics standpoint , the subscription should be paying for additional ongoing services and benefits , rather than the cost of the software , which has no marginal cost to reproduce .
Those ongoing benefits can be scarce goods , whereas the software itself is an infinite good .
Effectively , you should be paying forand ongoing benefits rather than the completed software .
That is , there needs to be additional ongoing value to paying for the service .
That means not just access to the software , but additional convenience , perhaps online storage , remote access , collaboration features , continual upgrades , service and support and the like .
Make it more into a real service , rather than just a piece of software with monthly payments .
That 's not to say that Microsoft will get this right .
It 's business model is so tied up in direct software sales , it likely will be very difficult for the company to really embrace a full software - as - a - service model .
However , as things go , even experimenting with such a model is definitely a move in the right direction , and a recognition that Microsoft ( even with its continued dominance in direct software sales ) needs to adapt to the changing market .

Bush acknowledges administration official leaked Plame 's name , immediately ' moves on ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano

At a White House press conference Thursday , President Bush acknowledged that someone in his administration leaked the name of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame , but he avoided addressing the question of whether he saw it as a moral issue or was at all disappointed in his senior advisers .
Michael Abramowitz of the Washington Post  who recently wrote an article about how Bush decided on the Libby commutation without consulting with Justice Department lawyers , special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , or even old friends who had been lobbying on Libby 's behalf  asked Bush about his commutation of Libby 's sentence .
Abramowitz stated , " You spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation .
But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisers leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator .
Now that the case is over ... can you say whether you were at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisers , and have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way ? "
" First of all , " responded Bush , " the Scooter Libby decision was , I thought , a fair and balanced decision .
Secondly , I have n't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor .
I did n't ask them during that time , I have n't asked them since .
I am aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person , and , you know , I 've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said , ' I did it . '
Would we have had this -- endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter ?
But it 's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House and it's run its course and now we 're going to move on .
Wendell ... "
Bush neither gave Abramowitz the chance for a follow - up question nor apparently remembered that he had already promised to call after Abramowitz on a different reporter , who interjected an objection to being passed over .
Instead , Bush called on Wendell Goler of Fox News , who stated , " Thank you , sir .
You have spoken passionately about the consequences of failure in Iraq .
Your critics say you failed to send enough troops there at the start , failed to keep al Qaeda from stepping into the void created by the collapse of Saddam 's army , failed to put enough pressure on Iraq 's government to make the political reconciliation necessary to keep the sectarian violence the country is suffering from now from occurring .
So why should the American people feel you have the vision for victory in Iraq , sir ? "
No questions were asked at the press conference about Bush 's pledge to fire anyone in the administration found to be involved in the leaking of Plame 's name , a pledge whose origins go back to September 29 , 2003 , when Helen Thomas asked Scott McClellan at a press briefing , " Scott , has anyone -- has the President tried to find out who outed the CIA agent ?
And has he fired anyone in the White House yet ? "
After a long series of questions from multiple reporters , McClellan finally responded , " There are anonymous reports all the time in the media .
The President has set high standards , the highest of standards for people in his administration .
He 's made it very clear to people in his administration that he expects them to adhere to the highest standards of conduct .
If anyone in this administration was involved in it , they would no longer be in this administration . "
In June 2004 , Bush replied " yes " when asked " do you stand by your pledge to fire anyone found to have [ leaked Plame 's name ] ? "
However , in July 2005 , he offered an amended version , stating , " I would like this to end as quickly as possible so we know the facts , and if someone committed a crime , they will no longer work in my administration . "
No one in the administration was ever fired , but Scooter Libby resigned after being indicted in October 2005 .
Critics say Plame was outed in political retaliation against her husband , Joe Wilson , who was critical of the administration 's rhetoric on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
The following video is from MSNBC's News Live broadcast on July 12 .

Thank you , Mr. President .
PRESIDENT BUSH : No , not you , Michael . ( Laughter . ) Q
If I could switch subjects -- ( Laughter , cross talk . )
PRESIDENT BUSH : Okay , is that -- is that harsh ?
Q Yes . Q No. PRESIDENT BUSH : Like , the new hall -- I should have been more gentle ?
( Laughter . ) Q Yes .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Do we ever use kinder and gentler ?
No. Q ( Off mike , laughter . )
PRESIDENT BUSH : Go ahead , Michael , then you 're next .
Q
If I could just switch subjects for a second to another big decision you made recently , which was in the Scooter Libby case -- PRESIDENT BUSH : Yeah .
Q -- you spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation .
But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisers , you know , leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator .
Now that the case is over -- it 's not something you 've ever spoken to -- can you say whether you 're at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisers ?
And have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Michael , I -- first of all , the -- the Scooter Libby decision was a -- I thought a fair and balanced decision .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bystanders who see someone suddenly collapse should quickly give the person chest compressions even if they are not trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the American Heart Association said on Monday .

The association urged people not to stand idly by because they do not think they know how to administer CPR while an adult stricken with sudden cardiac arrest is dying in front of them .
In recommendations published in its journal Circulation , the group emphasized “ hands - only ” CPR -- a simple procedure that bystanders can perform without worrying about doing the mouth - to - mouth resuscitation part of CPR .
“ The thing that ’s killing people is inaction , ” said Dr. Michael Sayre of Ohio State University , who headed the association ’s team that drafted the new recommendations .
Sayre said people not trained in CPR should do two things when they encounter an adult who has suddenly collapsed : first , call emergency services ; and second , begin pushing “ hard and fast ” in the center of the person ’s chest .
This is necessary to maintain vital blood flow , according to experts .
Chest compressions should continue until emergency medical services responders arrive , Sayre said .
“ Today in the United States , less than a third of victims of sudden cardiac arrest get any form of CPR .
Anything that would increase that is bound to save lives , ” Sayre said in a telephone interview .
“ We want the general public to know that even if they ’ve never been trained , they can help victims of sudden cardiac arrest . ”
In the minutes after an adult collapses , hands - only CPR -- without mouth - to - mouth rescue efforts -- is equivalent to conventional CPR in its life - saving value , Sayre said .
All too often , no one at the scene does anything to help the victim of sudden cardiac arrest -- often because there is no one trained in CPR and other people are scared that they will do something to make the victim ’s condition worse .
But considering the person ’s condition , Sayre said , “ You ca n’t make them any worse . ”
The heart association said that about 310,000 adults in the United States die annually from sudden cardiac arrest that takes place away from a hospital setting .
It said that CPR administered by a bystander can double or triple a person ’s chance of surviving .
About 94 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before reaching a hospital , the group said .
Up to 80 percent of sudden cardiac arrests occur at home , it added .
Brain death begins four to six minutes after a person suffers sudden cardiac arrest if no CPR or defibrillation is given .
“ Hands - only ” CPR is not advised for babies and children or for adults whose cardiac arrest is due to respiratory causes such as a drowning scenario or drug overdose , the group said .
The new recommendations update the group ’s 2005 advice that had asked bystanders to do chest compressions only if they were unable or unwilling to provide mouth - to - mouth efforts .
Conventional CPR is still an crucial skill to know and medical personnel should still perform it , the group said .
After decades of repression , Tibetans are crying out to the world for change .
China 's leaders are right now making a crucial choice between escalating repression or dialogue that could determine the future of Tibet , and China .
We can affect this historic choice -- China does care about its international reputation .
But it will take an avalanche of global people power to get the government 's attention .
The Dalai Lama has called for restraint and dialogue : he needs the world 's people to support him .
Sign the petition below -- It has been delivered at Chinese embassies and consulates worldwide , and will continue to grow and be delivered until talks begin .
Microsoft 's embattled Office Open XML ( OOXML ) document format received ISO fast - track approval today after receiving support from approximately 86 percent of the national bodies that participated in the vote .
ISO approval will be broadly perceived as a sign of validation for the document format which has received widespread criticism from technical experts and standards advocacy groups .
Failure to obtain ISO approval would have put Microsoft at a disadvantage in government software procurement processes which are increasingly mandating or favoring open standards .
The trend towards standards adoption in government IT could have potentially pushed the public sector away from Microsoft 's deeply entrenched office offerings and towards a variety of alternatives like OpenOffice.org which uses the ISO - approved OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) .
ISO 's approval of OOXML — the default format in Office 2007 — will help Microsoft remain competitive in the government software market .
OOXML was approved as an ECMA standard in 2006 but failed to achieve ISO approval during an initial 2007 vote .
ISO 's second fast - track vote , which took place earlier this month , delivered a sufficient number of votes in favor of the format to move forward with ISO approval .
The process has received heavy scrutiny from critics who claim that Microsoft has engaged in abusive practices ranging from committee - stuffing to potential vote buying .
Critics have documented some evidence of various irregularities in national body internal voting processes in Russia , Poland , Mexico , Sweden , Germany , and other countries .
Microsoft refutes the allegations and argues that ISO 's first vote on OOXML failed to pass solely because of IBM 's intervention , a claim that IBM rejects .
A recent ballot resolution meeting was conducted to address the numerous problems that the ISO national bodies have found in the OOXML specification .
During the meeting , ISO participants were to evaluate 2,300 pages of ECMA responses to criticisms of the 6,000 - page OOXML specification .
Due to time constraints , only a fraction of the responses were addressed , leading many to argue that the format was unsuited for fast - track approval .
Although OOXML has many critics , it was also gained numerous supporters over the past year — including some who are directly affiliated with ODF .
One of the most outspoken OOXML supporters from the ODF camp is Patrick Durusau , a coeditor of the ODF specification .
Durusua characterizes OOXML as a " poster child for the open standards development process " and argues that ECMA has been instrumental in facilitating needed changes to an extent that makes it suitable for ISO approval .
Durusau has called for standards advocates to " foster coevolution " between OOXML and ODF in order to encourage more interoperability .
Regardless of OOXML 's ISO status , the format will inevitably become a de facto industry standard as a result of the market dominance of Microsoft 's office suite .
Microsoft says that ISO approval will place the future of the format in the hands of the standards community , but critics point to Microsoft 's long history of outright hostility towards open standards and fear that others will have little say in how OOXML evolves .
Huckabee won Iowa with nearly 36,000 votes .
Hillary lost Iowa , and came in 3rd , with 29 % of the vote .
A projected 220,000 people turned out to vote in the Democratic caucuses , meaning Hillary got 29 % of those voters , or an estimated 63,800 – nearly twice the number of votes that Huckabee got .
( Actually , the Des Moines Register ’s latest numbers show Hillary getting just over 67,000 votes , so I was right . )
So our 3rd place candidate beat their first place candidate by almost a factor of two .
Not sure what it means , but it ’s funny as hell .
The biggest challenge for advertisers today is to get people to watch their commercials .
With all the technology and alternatives to watching commercials on TV I would think that advertisers would do everything humanly possible to eliminate any elements that would immediately trigger a viewer to fast forward to change the channel .
Is this not commen senese ?
If it is , then why in the world do advertisers
JACK UP THE VOLUME OF THEIR COMMERCIALS ?
This annoying “ feature ” is more pronounced in home theater and surround sound based systems .
I ca n’t think of anything that pisses me off more than to be watching a TV show and to all of the sudden be blasted by a commercial from all sides of the room .
Its the ultimate command to change the channel or fast forward .
SO WHY ARE ADVERTISERS SO STUPID ?
Turn down the sound , maybe people will lean forward and listen !
by
In the latter half of the 20th century , Americans were called to meet abstractions with metaphors in a series of gaudy figurations popularly called  The War On . . .
Intended to be wholly symbolic , rhetorical frameworks that loosely invoked the legendary national unity that accompanied Americas good wars , whichever those were , our Wars On various and sundry Things that Are Bad proved the power of language to mold behavior , for often the martial tone spilled into martial practice , and so we find heavily armed SWAT units kicking down doors like soldiers in Baghdad .
More recently , Wars
On have spilled into the private sector , where youll principally find inexplicably aggrieved majorities crying that they and their dearly held beliefs are under siege from the ravenous forces of queers or atheists or $ 3 - an - hour day laborers from Chavezistan .
For this new year , we might look back at the five worst of our Wars
On whatever , and reconsider this , ahem , tortured metaphor .
1. The War on Poverty
Jesus said that the meek would inherit the earth and that the poor are blessed , but his contemporary followers are fairly convinced that he was bullshitting on that one , worn out from miracle - making and winding up for a good punchline which history failed to record .
Americas preference has always been to pretend that there are no poor people , and if there are , its probably their fault anyway .
But in the sixties , with the Great Depression still in living memory , and with a slowly awakening awareness that rural blacks and whites alike often lived in grinding poverty , it was briefly in vogue to consider the neediest ,  as the odd tag line inexplicably reads after certain articles in the New York Times .
This was less out of a true sense of charity , one suspects , than it was out of the eras misplaced competitiveness with the Soviet bogeyman , which was way ahead of America in its own efforts to combat poverty .
The Soviets had simply renamed it the Proletariat , praised it to the sky , and increased its numbers .
Lyndon Johnson called America to wage a War on Poverty , but poverty is a hard thing to get your arms around , and that war swiftly and inexorably changed into something more like a war on poor people .
Johnsonian efforts at redistributionist economics matched early on with a generally strong economy , but as those fortunes went south , so too did the idea that anything could be done about the poor , who quickly went from noble , if hardscrabble , folk characters to dangerous black people lurking around every city corner .
By the time Ronald Reagan first said the words welfare queen ,  the fix was in .
The poor had transmogrified into a legion of flashy pimps .
Bill Clinton ended welfare as we know it ,  and Democrats decided that it wasnt the poor they wanted to help , but the working class ,  a transparent and hoary neologism designed solely to prevent White America from associating anti-poverty programs with crackheads and other mythical varieties of blacks .
2. The War on Cancer
Wars on Diseases are a perennial favorite , and the War on Cancer was the daddy to them all .
Dreamed up by Richard Nixon , it was a curious appendage to the War on Vietnam : a doomed , unwinnable slog against a tenacious and irrepressible foe .
As Susan Sontag famously noted in her seminal  Illness as Metaphor ,  loose talk of making war on a sickness had the deleterious effect of obscuring what sickness actually was .
The body itself became enemy - occupied territory , and cancer not merely a disease , but a stigma .
Since the time of that essay , cancer patients are less stigmatized , and the disease is no longer anathema to polite conversation .
That s a good thing .
Yet the military end of the metaphor continues , and one cant help but note that our treatments for many kinds of cancer are essentially torture .
The mania for endlessly prolonging life has eclipsed the humbler offerings of palliative care .
There are virtually no means that our medicine will not undertake to rid the body of malignancy : pumping it full of poison , shooting it up with radiation , and slicing bits of it clear off .
It is a macrocosm of the horrors of 20th - century war , practiced on the body and offered as medicine .
We might start by questioning whether or not its always worth it .
3 . The War on Christmas
Who could fight a war on Christmas when Christmas is so fucking cute ?
You , that s who .
A hilarious , ginned - up controversy used by the put -upon millionaires of right wing broadcasting to beat down any aspirations in their slack - jawed audience of Peace on Earth and Goodwill to Men , the War on Christmas is the latest in a long series of efforts to convince white , Protestant Americans that they are beset on all sides by powerful interests with guns aimed square at the ineffable heart of the Baby Jesus and all His works .
Businesses and politicians who embrace the ecumenical balm of  Holidays  are the supposed generals in this war , and you , you bastards , with your  Seasons Greetings ,  and your Jew and Nigger holidays that so inconsiderately fall in the same month , you are all to blame .
It s supremely unlikely that youll find any infamous OReillys kneeling at midnight to receive the Host , and yet to hear him howl , youd think that the big guy - in - the - sky suffers from inapposite and non-denominational greeting cards the way he once suffered on the cross itself .
Everyone from Charles Shultz to your cranky Catholic grandmother has long since noted that if anything has undermined Christmas in our so - called culture , its the still - expanding crassness of its commercialization , the idea that the birth of the supposed savior and redeemer of all mankind shall best be celebrated at the Sharper Image .
4. The War on Drugs
Mencken once wrote that George Washington would never be elected now because he loved whiskey and made his own , enjoyed a good dirty joke , and knew more swear words than scripture .
He was writing from the depths of Prohibition , but the spirit of those remarks is truer now than ever .
America is a tippler that pretends to be a teetotaler the worlds largest consumer of porn and loudest extoller of its own moral virtue ; the worlds greatest user of drugs and harshest prosecutor of that use .
Even more than the War on Terror , its the Drug War that shepherded the militarization of our police , the surveillance of our society , and the creation of the worlds largest internal prison population .
The fact that we put people in jail for possessing marijuana is one of the great jurisprudential jokes of all time .
The iniquity in sentencing for crack and powder cocaine offenses , a 15 - year - plus surcharge for getting high while black , is outdone as an injustice only by the fact that any of those sentences exist at all .
It is sometimes argued by those moderates who advocate for more humane drug laws but who nevertheless believe that it would be irresponsible to enact broad legalization , that legalizing would lead to more addicts .
It would .
But better to have more addicts than more prisoners , and the black - market derangement of the drug trade cannot be rectified by half - hearted efforts to decriminalize only those drugs deemed morally acceptable .
Each mans body is his temple , and if he wants to shit on the altar and spray - paint the walls , he can .
A nation of pot -smokers does n’t kill grandmothers in no -knock midnight raids at the wrong street address , nor does it spend billions a year arming South American brown shirts and spraying the only crops that their rural poor can produce that has n’t already been rendered unprofitable and unsustainable by American and European agribusiness and subsidies .
5 . The War on Terror
Do I even need to tell you ?
In a spectacular bit of luck and timing borne on the fruits of American incompetence , a group of men successfully carried out several vicious acts of terrorism against America .
Now you cant carry a bottle of water onto an airplane .
It is the strangest series of causes and effects ever foisted upon the poor people of the planet Earth .
The self - described capo of our Nazislamo enemies stated in the plainest terms that his beef was with Americas constant meddling in the Middle East , our wars and oil - lust and sanctions and tyrannical client governments .
How do we respond ?
By invading the Middle East , meddling in their politics , and setting up more corrupt , useless governments .
Our need to hit someone in the Arab - Muslim world ,  in Tom Friedmans immortally bloodthirsty formulation , was so immediate and disproportionate that it would be parody , but for all the bodies it left and is leaving in its wake .
America went from being a mere back room practitioner of torture to its loudest global advocate , and the imperialism wed always practiced abroad , which we formerly were n’t supposed to talk about , became a point of national pride .
At home we rushed to disregard the old Franklinian aphorism about those who sacrifice liberty for security deserving neither , and the very same people who once ( rightly ) complained about Janet Renos ham - fisted massacre of the Branch Davidians and Bill Clintons relatively subtle efforts to undermine our privacy now shouted that the government must tap every phone , open every letter , and dump every toiletry bag onto the conveyor belt at the airport .
The War on Terror is a bipartisan nightmare , a hideous outgrowth of the governing consensus , and Democratic congress creatures and presidential aspirants are by and large just as willing to speak in bellicose absurdities about the necessity of its prosecution as their cross-aisle counterparts .

Environmental activists say many public Earth Day and other environmental events are leaving a trail of waste and carbon emissions .
USA Today said activists are pushing for greener events with less food waste and drink packaging , as well as fewer giveaway items .
The Convention Industry Council has is working to develop benchmarks for the staging of low - impact events , the newspaper said .
" The dialogue is cheapened when environmental events themselves do not showcase some environmental criteria for how they are implemented , " Ron Mader of the ecotourism journal Planeta.com , told USA Today .
" You 're harming the development of a constituency which would support and carry forth ( green ) ideals . "

A high - speed passenger train jumped the tracks and slammed into another train early Monday .
( ( Associated Press ) )
A collision between two trains in eastern China on Monday that left at least 70 people dead and injured more than 420 is being blamed on human error , Chinese state media say .
Xinhua News
Agency reported on its website that the crash , China 's worst train accident in a decade , took place before dawn near the city of Zibo in Shandong province .
The agency said at least 70 of the injured were in serious condition , including the coach of China 's national sailing team .
Xinhua said investigators had ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash .
The agency 's English - language report blamed the accident on human error , while its Chinese website attributed the crash to negligence , without giving other details .
But two railway officials were fired and face an investigation by the Ministry of Railways .
Witnesses said a train travelling from Beijing to the coastal city of Qingdao , host of the sailing competition during the Olympics in August , derailed and hit a second train at about 4:40 a.m. local time , according to Xinhua .
Rescuers remove a victim from a carriage after two passenger trains collided in east China 's Shandong province Monday .
( ( Associated Press ) )
News photos showed the derailed train at the bottom of a ditch , with rescuers removing passengers from a carriage on its side .
Survivors with white sheets wrapped around their shoulders stood or sat near the wreckage .
The second train did not overturn in the ditch , but a news photo showed one of its carriages resting perpendicular to the track .
In January , 18 people died when a train hurtling through the night at more than 120 km/h slammed into a group of about 100 workers carrying out track maintenance near the city of Anqiu in Shandong province .
Monday 's collision was the worst train accident in China since 1997 when a collision killed 126 people , according to the 163.com news website .
Nato forces mistakenly supplied food , water and arms to Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan , officials today admitted .
Containers destined for local police forces were dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban - controlled area of Zabul province .
The coalition helicopter had intended to deliver pallets of supplies to a police checkpoint in Ghazni , a remote section of Zabul late last month .
By mistake they were dropped some distance from the checkpoint where it was taken by the Taliban , the Internal Security Affairs Commission of the Wolesi Jirga — the Afghan parliament 's lower house — was told .
Hamidullah Tukhi , a local politician from Zabul , told the parliamentary commission that the consignment had been taken by a local Taliban commander .
A Nato spokesman said the pallets were carrying rocket propelled grenades , ammunition , water and food .
Afghan politicians have said they do not believe the drop was an accident .
Nato 's General Carlos Branco blamed it on " human error " when the navigator confused two very similar grid references .
A spokesman at Nato headquarters in Brussels denied the suggestion the alliance had deliberately armed the Taliban .
" We are aware of it but we are not fired up about it .
It sounds like someone made a mistake .
It was a cock - up rather than a conspiracy .
" The forces on the ground are working to get the message across that we do not deliberately supply the Taliban with arms . "
A Dutch youth has been arrested for stealing virtual furniture in Habbo Hotel , a virtual community aimed at teenagers and young adults .
The 17 - year - old was accused of stealing over $ 5800 of virtual property after Sulake , the company behind Habbo Hotel , contacted police with the complaint .
Five 15 - year - olds have also been questioned in connection with the incident .
The six teenagers are suspected of moving the stolen furniture into their own Habbo Hotel rooms .
" The accused lured victims into handing over their Habbo passwords by creating fake Habbo websites , " a Sulake spokesman said .
" In Habbo , as in many other virtual worlds , scamming for other people 's personal information such as user names has been problematic for quite awhile .
We have had much of this scamming going on in many countries but this is the first case where the police have taken legal action . "
The spokesman said the growing number of sites that imitate Habbo Hotel in order to steal users ' login details led to the company 's involvement , and that the police were brought in because real - world currency was involved .
" It is a theft because the furniture is paid for with real money , " the spokesman said , adding , " The only way to be a thief in Habbo is to get people 's user names and passwords and then log in and take the furniture . "
First launched in Finland in 2000 , Habbo Hotel has since expanded to over 30 countries , and now boasts over six million unique users worldwide .
After seeing this story at Forbes , headlined " U.S. Agrees Guilty Billionaire Should n't Go to Jail , " I may have to rethink my assumption that federal prosecutors never are willing to go soft on any white - collar criminals .
Here are the details :
In his plea agreement , [ Igor ]
Olenicoff , 65 , admitted he lied on his 1998 through 2004 tax returns when he answered " no " to a question asking if he had ownership or authority over any financial accounts in foreign countries .
In fact , he had accounts in the Bahamas , Switzerland , Liechtenstein and Britain .
As part of the plea deal , Olenicoff paid $ 52 million in back federal taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties and agreed to bring all the money in his foreign accounts ( believed to total in the hundreds of millions ) back to the U.S .
Forbes estimates the self - made , Russian - born Olenicoff , who came to the U.S. at age 15 , is now worth $ 1.6 billion .
While the false - tax - return charge is punishable by up to three years in jail , Olenicoff 's deal with prosecutors , together with federal sentencing guidelines , made it unlikely he would get more than six months .
Then last month , a U.S. probation officer filed a pre-sentencing report recommending Olenicoff get off with just one year of probation and a $ 3,500 criminal fine .
Those include the Cauchy , Weibull , normal , log - normal , logistic , exponential , uniform , gamma distributions , the central and noncentral beta , chi-squared , Fisher 's F- distribution , Student 's t- distribution , as well as the discrete binomial and negative binomial distributions , geometric , hypergeometric and Poisson distributions .
In addition , there are functions for calculating theoretical moments of distributions , which allow to evaluate the degree of conformity of the real distribution to the modeled one .
The MQL5 standard library has been supplemented with numerous mathematical functions from R. Moreover , an increase in operation speed of 3 to 7 times has been achieved , compared to the initial versions in the R language .
At the same time , errors in implementation of certain functions in R have been found .

Introduction
The R language is one of the best tools of statistical processing and analysis of data .
Thanks to availability and support of multiple statistical distributions , it had become widespread in the analysis and processing of various data .
Using the apparatus of probability theory and mathematical statistics allows for a fresh look at the financial market data and provides new opportunities to create trading strategies .
With the statistical library , all these features are now available in the MQL5 .
The statistical library contains functions for calculating the statistical characteristics of data , as well as functions for working with statistical distributions .
This article considers the main functions of the library and an example of their practical use .
1. Functions for calculating the statistical characteristics of array elements
This group of functions calculates the standard characteristics ( mean , variance , skewness , kurtosis , median , root - mean - square and standard deviations ) of array elements .
1.1 . MathMean
The function calculates the mean ( first moment ) of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN ( not a number ) .
Analog of the mean ( ) in R .
double MathMean ( const double &array [ ] ) ;
1.2 . MathVariance
The function calculates the variance ( second moment ) of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN. Analog of the var ( ) in R .
double MathVariance ( const double &array [ ] ) ;
1.3 . MathSkewness
The function calculates the skewness ( third moment ) of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN. Analog of the skewness ( ) in R ( e1071 library ) .
double MathSkewness ( const double &array [ ] ) ;
1.4 . MathKurtosis
The function calculates the kurtosis ( fourth moment ) of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN. Analog of the kurtosis ( ) in R ( e1071 library ) .
double MathKurtosis ( const double &array [ ] ) ;
1.5 . MathMoments
The function calculates the first 4 moments ( mean , variance , skewness , kurtosis ) of array elements .
Returns true if the moments have been calculated successfully , otherwise false .
bool MathMoments ( const double &array [ ] , double &mean , double &variance , double &skewness , double &kurtosis , const int start=
0 , const int count=
WHOLE_ARRAY ) ;
1.6 . MathMedian
The function calculates the median value of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN. Analog of the median ( ) in R .
double MathMedian ( double &array [ ] ) ;
1.7 . MathStandardDeviation
The function calculates the standard deviation of array elements .
In case of error it returns NaN. Analog of the sd( ) in R .
double MathStandardDeviation ( const double &array [ ] ) ;
1.8. MathAverageDeviation
The function calculates the average absolute deviation of array elements .

On the First Round Capital website we write that : " We love investing in technologies and business models that are able to shrink existing markets .
If your company can take $ 5 of revenue from a competitor for every $ 1 you earn – let 's talk ! "
I ’ve often been asked what we mean by that – so I thought it would be a good topic for a blog post .
My first company , Infonautics , was an online reference and research company targeting students ( mostly high school students ) .
While I was there , I got a firsthand education on “ asymmetrical competition . ”
In 1991 , when we started Infonautics , the encyclopedia market was approximately a $ 1.2 Billion industry .
The market leader was Britannica - with sales of approximately $ 650 Million , they were considered the gold standard of the encyclopedia market containing “ over 44 million words ” written by scholars and “ more than 80 Nobel laureates ” .
World Book Encyclopedia was firmly ensconced in second place .
Both Britannica and World Book sold hundreds of thousands of encyclopedia sets a year for over $ 1,000 .
However , in 1993 , the industry was permanently changed .
That year Microsoft launched Encarta for $ 99 .
Encarta was initially nothing more than the poorly regarded Funk & Wagnall 's Encyclopedia repackaged on a CD – but Microsoft recognized that changes in technology and production costs allowed them shift the competitive landscape .
By 1996 Britannica ’s sales had dropped to $ 325 million - about half their 1991 levels – and Britannica had laid off its famed door - to - door sales staff .
And by 1996 the encyclopedia market had shrunk to less than $ 600 M .
In that year , Encarta ’s US sales were estimated at $ 100 M .
So in just three years , leveraging a disruptive technology ( CD - ROM ) , cost infrastructure ( licensed content versus in - house editorial teams ) , distribution model ( retail in computer stores versus a field sales force ) and pricing model ( $ 99 versus $ 1000 ) , the encyclopedia market was cut in half .
More than half a billion dollars disappeared from the market .
Microsoft turned something that Britannica considered an asset ( a door - to - door salesforce ) into a liability .
While Microsoft made $ 100 M it shrunk the market by over $ 600 M .
For every dollar of revenue Microsoft made , it took away six dollars of revenue from their competitors .
Every dollar of Microsoft ’s gain caused an asymmetrical amount of pain in the marketplace .
They made money by shrinking the market .
[ It is also interesting to note how distruptive business models have continued to impact the encyclopedia market - anyone care to guess what Google and Wikipedia have done to Encarta sales in the last few years ? ]
At Half.com , we tried to do the same thing .
We quickly learned that most readers of fiction books finished reading the book within two weeks after purchase .
So we launched a very simple feature on our site .
Say you purchased a John Grisham book from half.com for $ 15 ( versus a market price of $ 30 ) .
Two and a half weeks later you would receive an email from Half.com offering “ your money back ” – users simply had to check a box and we would list their book for sale for $ 15 .
The vast majority of users would relist the book for sale -- and we found that for best selling books , we would sell the exact same copy of a book four times .
That is , Buyer A would buy the book for $ 15 , read it and sell it to Buyer B for $ 15 , who would then read it and sell it to buyer C for $ 15 , who would read it then sell it to Buyer D .
Of course , we would take commissions from every sale – say $ 3 – and shipping charges – say $ 2 – from each sale .
So for the four transactions , the out of pocket cost to the buyers would be $ 20 .
Now if half.com did n’t exist , you can assume that the books would have been purchased through traditional channels for $ 30 each – for a total out of pocket cost of $ 120 .
Think about it .
For every $ 1 of sales on half.com , we took $ 6 away from the existing traditional channel - another example of asymmetrical competition .
This is the reason why I ’m so excited about our recent investment in Jingle Networks .
Jingle is the owner of 1-800 - FREE411 – the country ’s first nationwide provider of free directory assistance .
Launched late last year , the 1 - 800 - FREE411 service offers consumers a free alternative to the high cost of 411 service provided by traditional carriers .
By including a ten - second advertisement before giving out a phone number , 1- 800 - FREE411 saves consumers on average $ 1.25 each time they look for a phone number from their telephone .
Since American consumers use traditional 411 services 6 billion times a year , 1- 800 - FREE411 has the potential to shrink an $ 8 billion market .
