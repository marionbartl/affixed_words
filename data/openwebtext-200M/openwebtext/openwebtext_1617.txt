Myths that home prices rise forever and interest rates stay low forever are alive and well in Australia .
Please consider this amazing story of corporate insanity as described in the Sunday Telegraph - Revealed :
The home loan that could save you a fortune .
ING Direct , Australia 's fifth largest lender , is preparing to sell loans that have no fixed term and no requirement to repay any capital along the way .
At current rates , the interest - only loans would cut repayments on a $ 300,000 mortgage by $ 5000 a year .
" People are needlessly being denied the chance to buy a property while prices spiral rapidly out of their reach " ING Direct CEO Don Koch said .
" There is an urgent need to provide more affordable options and borrowers should be able to choose whether they want to repay the capital , or not . "
Mr Koch wants to position the bank as a " mortgage partner for life " , with borrowers carrying the same interest - only loan from property to property for as long as they wish , accumulating equity from rising house prices as they go .
Then , as they near retirement , they could sell their property for a big enough profit to pay off the original loan and buy a smaller place outright , leaving them mortgage - free .
Or , they could keep the mortgage going and repay the original capital from their estate , after death .
Banks already offer interest - only loans , but borrowers often are allowed to keep them only for five to 10 years .
Then they must start paying the capital .
But ING says this preoccupation with paying off the loan is unnecessary .
" There is no economic reason for banks to insist on regular capital repayment , " Mr Koch said .
" It just makes the loan more expensive for the borrower .
Financial comparison website InfoChoice CEO
Shaun Cornelius said the move was a welcome innovation : " Depending on the size of the loan , it could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to a borrower 's cash flow over their lifetime . "

Nested Labels work like so :
[ L ] et 's say you wanted to create a simple hierarchy with a " Home " label , and inside it a " Family " and a " Vacation " label .
Just create three labels with the following names : Home
Home / Family
Home / Vacation
You can then create " Home / Family / Kids , " " Home / Pets , " etc. , to get something like the screenshot [ above ] .
If you had the parent label " Home " before you do n't have to create it from scratch .
You can create complex hierarchies of labels if that 's the way you like to organize your mail , and you can expand / collapse labels to save space .
You 'll always be able to tell whether a given label contains unread messages in its collapsed child labels by looking at whether it 's bold or not .

The highly anticipated HTC Incredible was well worth the wait .
This miniature powerhouse not only looks prettier than a stack of Monets , but also smokes most smartphones when it comes to performance .
Weighing in at 4.6 ounces and spanning a mere 2.3 x 4.6 inches and .47 - inches thick , the diminutive device feels sleek and almost toy - like in hand .
The black body , festooned with stylish red flourishes , makes it hard to slap on a protective case .
The sleek look is enhanced by the buttons , which are flush with the surface of the 3.7 - inch , 480 x 800 - pixel OLED touchscreen ( except the optical joystick ) .
With a 1 - GHz Snapdragon processor , the Incredible is so speedy , it makes the Flash look like a morbidly obese couch - jockey .
An iPhone took about 16 seconds to fully load Wired.com ; the speedy Incredible browser took a mere five seconds .
And speaking of which , the Incredible supports the Flash Lite 4.0 , so you wo n't see any of those annoying blue Lego icons that pop up when browsing on the iPhone .
While the Incredible took about 37 seconds to boot up ( compared with iPhone 's 22 ) , it was much speedier during use .
Scrolling through menus , activating apps and the like all took much less time .
The Incredible runs Android 2.1 , the latest version of Google 's mobile OS .
It also has seven screens that you can customize to your liking with pre-installed or downloadable widgets and programs .
Designated buttons for Menu , Homescreen , Back and Search make navigation easy .
The optical joystick — a touch - sensitive button that allows you to scroll and select items — is a bit tricky at first but we found ourselves warming up to it after a few days .
Compared with other touchscreen phones , the display was very responsive to our swipes .
And the shiny screen did n't accumulate finger sludge nearly as fast as an iPhone .
Performance outdoors is poor however :
The Incredible 's screen gets washed out to the point where it 's not readable in direct sunlight .
The 8 - megapixel camera with LED flash performs so well , we abandoned our trusty Canon point - and - shoot in favor of the Incredible 's photo and video - capturing skills .
Colors are vivid and there 's surprisingly little noise .
When you 're done playing Jimmy Olsen , you can upload your images via Bluetooth to your computer , or to Facebook , Flickr , Peep or Picasa , and share them with anyone willing to look .

A minor gripe : YouTube clips do n't play fullscreen .
Pleasingly , the battery lasted for two days of moderate use ; if you 're a phone - attached - to - the - ear type person , you 'll definitely need a daily charge .
The phone 's name might be a tad pretentious but we 'll be damned if it does n't live up to it .
If you 're a Verizon customer looking to upgrade to Android , this is one of the finest phones available on that network we 've yet seen .
In every backpacker ’s hostel I have stayed at , there have always been some characters that appear regularly throughout them all .
Although most backpackers I meet are not at all like this , I do find it funny the more I come across these types of characters while on the road , and so I ’ve decided to list some of them for your and my amusement !
The Backpacker Who Never Left –
In every hostel there is always at least one backpacker who got there and then never left .
This guy usually arrived in the country , checked in at the hostel and then stayed there ever since without moving on .
One good thing about the backpacker who never left however it that they are usually a good resource for what ’s going on in and around the hostel , and nearby backpacker bars .
The Chav – For some reason the chav backpacker is almost always a guy and from England .
I used to think these types of travellers stuck to package holiday resorts like Malaga or Tenerife ; however it seems they also go backpacking too .
You will usually find them travelling with a bunch of other guy mates , and p*ssing all their money away on booze .
The American Tourist – I ’ve met many nice , well educated Americans in my time , but every time I go travelling I almost always bump into someone who really lives up to the stereotype of the American Tourist !
They are almost always loud , make some really general or obvious comments , and are usually in a large group of equally annoying friends .
The Middle Aged Backpacker –
In most hostels I have been to there is usually one lone middle aged backpacker .
They have usually decided to quit their job and travel the world like they have always wanted to but never had the courage until now .
Either that or they are just a hippy who is still going .
Either way , good on them I say !
The Irish – Every single hostel I have ever been to there is almost always at least one person from Ireland – usually a lot more !
They are usually up for good night out , and are generally good craic !
The Irish love a party , and there are some hostels I have been to where the percentage of Irish to any other nationality is about 80:1 !
There were a lot of other backpacker stereotypes I wanted to list here , but decided to condense them into five .
If you have any you ’d like to share however , please feel free to leave a comment !
( I should also note that these are just very general observations and only meant as a bit of fun !
Most people I meet on the road are not at all like this .
🙂 )
The Q&A page has been rearranged to link to my Formspring account first and foremost .
Questions will be answered there , so read and / or ask , for answers to questions !
Also , there was a typographical error in my previous comic post regarding prints .
They are $ 9.95 , not $ 9.99 , so you can take those four cents and throw them in a wishing well for four wishes , and wish for four more prints !
And then you ’ll realize that you could have just kept your 995 pennies and thrown them ALL in the wishing well , to get hundreds of prints , and you ’ll write me to ask me to refund your money in return for the print you purchased .
But I spray my prints with an irresistible candy coating that you wo n’t be able to resist licking upon opening the package , and I ’m not going to take back a licked print , because that ’s gross .
I do n’t want to lick it after it ’s been through all that .

The " Kevin Costner solution ” to the worsening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may actually work , and none too soon for the president of Plaquemines Parish .
Costner has invested 15 years and about $ 24 million in a novel way of sifting oil spills that he began working on while making his own maritime film , “ Waterworld , ” released in 1995 .
Two decades later , BP and the U.S. Coast Guard plan to test six of his massive , stainless steel centrifugal oil separators next week .
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser welcomed the effort , even as he and Louisiana officials blasted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for delays in approving an emergency plan to build sand “ islands ” to protect the bayous of his parish .
“ It certainly is an odd thing to see a ‘ Kevin Costner ’ and a ‘ centrifugal oil separator ’ together in a place like the Gulf of Mexico , ” said actor Stephen Baldwin , who is producing a documentary about the oil spill and Costner ’s device .
“ But , hey , some of the best ideas sometimes come from the strangest places . ”
Meanwhile , “ Avatar ” director James Cameron has said that he would make his underwater vessels available , and actor - director Robert Redford appeared in a commercial , sponsored by the Natural Resources Defense Council , that uses the spill as a clarion call to move forward on clean energy .
It is not the first time Hollywood has come to the rescue with cutting - edge technology .
Paul Winchell , a versatile ventriloquist and the voice of Tigger in " Winnie the Pooh , ” was also an inventor who patented an early artificial heart in the 1960s .
In 1940 , glamorous movie star Hedy Lamarr helped design an un-jammable communications system for use against Nazi Germany .
Costner was unavailable for comment .
But his business partner , Louisiana attorney John Houghtaling , said , “ Yes , Kevin is a star , but he took his stardom and wrote all the checks for this project out of his own pocket .
This was one man ’s vision . ”
Details of any contractual relationship with BP were not disclosed .
Asked if the actor would charge for use of the machines , Pat Smith , a spokesman for Costner , said , “ We do n’t know yet .
We have n’t had that discussion yet .
This is only a test trial . ”
Houghtaling said Costner bought the technology , which was originally developed with help from the Department of Energy , after the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster and turned it over to a team of scientists and engineers for fine - tuning .
“ The machines are essentially like big vacuum cleaners , which sit on barges and suck up oily water and spin it around at high speed , ” Houghtaling said .
“ On one side , it spits out pure oil , which can be recovered .
The other side spits out 99 % pure water . ”
If all goes according to plan , he said , “ We could have as many as 26 machines dispatched throughout the gulf .
Our largest machine is 112 inches high , weighs 2 ½ tons and cleans 210,000 gallons a day of oily water .
We are hoping to have 10 machines that size out there — meaning we could potentially clean 2 million gallons of oil water a day . ”
That kind of talk has intrigued BP , the party responsible for the well blowout that caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history .
“ BP has agreed to test Mr. Costner ’s machines , ” BP spokesman Mark Proegler said .
“ Of course , they need to meet regulations with respect to discharge . ”
With oil washing up on a portion of southeastern Louisiana ’s swampy edges , word of Costner ’s devices and their potential capabilities has triggered intense lobbying over where they should be stationed first .
High on the list of prospective sites is Plaquemines Parish , where “ we ’ve already lost 24 miles of marshland , ” Nungesser said .
“ Everything in it — frogs , crickets , fish and plant life — is dead and never coming back . ”
Houghtaling said he was working on a deployment strategy .
“ Some people want the machines placed out on the blue ocean where the oil is surfacing .
Others want them placed along the coastline . ”
In the meantime , frustration escalated Thursday over the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ’ delay in authorizing dredging to build a chain of barrier islands with sand to protect sensitive coastal areas .
Parish leaders , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , a member of the Senate committee that oversees the Corps , demanded immediate approval of the plan they estimated could cost about $ 50 million .
“ The Corps just does n’t get it , ” Vitter said in a statement .
“ Thick oil has already gotten behind our existing barrier islands and is infiltrating our marsh .
Yet the Corps has no sense of emergency . ”
Corps spokesman Eugene Pawlik said that the agency is using emergency rules to expedite the request , but that it still has to comply with national environmental laws , including soliciting comments from other agencies .
Nungesser dispatched an urgent request to the Obama administration to force the Corps to expedite its review process .
He also reached out to Costner , the man of the hour in Louisiana ’s bayou country .
“ I have Kevin Costner ’s cellphone number and I ’m going to call him and ask him to hold a press conference about the Corps ’ lack of response in this time of emergency , ” Nungesser said .
“ He is a caring man , and people know and respect him .
Maybe he can help us . ”

Victoria Coren presents another edition of the show which dares to commit heresy .
Her guests this week are comedians David Baddiel and Lucy Porter and the co-presenter of daytime quiz show Pointless , Richard Osman .
Together they have fun exposing the wrong - headedness of received wisdom and challenging knee - jerk public reaction to events .
Arguing against the common belief that " the economy is up the creek without a paddle " , David Baddiel says we 're actually sailing serenely through the recession .
Lucy Porter is n't convinced that " the innocence of children is snatched away too fast these days " and wants to know when her 13 month old daughter will start paying her share of the household bills , and Richard Osman finds reasons not to mourn the passing of the News of the World .
Producer : Brian King
An Avalon production for BBC Radio 4 .
Late January 1997 saw the e-mailed warning “ Travellers Beware ! ! ” take the Internet by storm .
The story went that a well - financed , highly organized gang operating in various major U.S. cities was drugging business travelers and making off with their kidneys to sell on the organ transplant black market .
Very scary stuff indeed .
Added to the bottom of what appeared to be the original e-mail were further testimonials from others claiming it was also happening in their part of the country .
Breathtakingly frightening , eh ?
And not a word of truth to it .
The majority of people who had this pass through their hands failed to realize this was but an urban legend , an apocryphal tale told and re-told .
Moreover , it was an urban legend that had been around at least since 1991 .
As part of the effort to dispel belief in this nonsense , the National Kidney Foundation has asked any individual who claims to have had his or her kidneys illegally removed to step forward and contact them .
So far no one ’s showed up .
Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand mentions in The Baby Train that he first heard this horrific story in early 1991 .
Very shortly thereafter he was swamped by it coming in from every direction , told as happening in various large cities .
In this earlier incarnation , friends discover the victim either in his blood - soaked hotel bed , on the floor , or propped up against the side of a building .
It ’s only at the hospital that the grim “ truth ” of the missing organ becomes known .
By 1995 - 96 a couple of interesting little twists were added to the basic story — the victim was now being left in a bathtub full of ice , the “ friends ” seemingly disappeared , and the “ If you want to live , call 911 ” message became firmly woven into the fabric of this tale .
The traveler was now clearly on his own , his fate solely in his own hands .
( A much scarier story that way , do n’t you think ? )
Yet another noteworthy change saw the businessman version of the legend seemingly localize to Las Vegas .
No longer told as happening in Your Town , USA , this flavor of the myth appeared to have taken up permanent residence in Sin City , the place where Bad Things Happen To The Unwary ( especially “ the unwary ” who were seen as having deservedly brought it upon themselves , married men intent upon getting up to some play - for - pay hanky - panky ) .
In this “ Las Vegas ” version , the man was drugged in his hotel room by the very woman he ’d brought up there with him , the ubiquitous Vegas hooker .
( A “ college student ” version appeared on the Internet in May 1996 .
By the fall of that year it had became tangled around both the University of Texas at Austin ’s newspaper , the Daily Texan and someone who worked there as an administrative assistant who came to be misidentified as the editor of that paper in this much - forwarded e-mail .
See our Organ Nicked : Vegetable page for more about this version and how it came to be associated with Kimm Antell .
Or click through the denial from the Daily Texan about its ever having run this story . )
1997 saw the “ New Orleans ” version kick - start what had previously been stuck in Las Vegas and re-attribute it to a handful of large cities , New Orleans and Houston among them .
Changes to the storyline made the victim more sympathetic by casting him as a weary business traveler who ’d paused for a well - earned drink at the end of the day only to be slipped a mickey in the hotel bar .
No longer furtively bringing a hooker back to his room for extramarital hijinks but instead sitting peaceably in a public place , his fate becomes that much more terrifying in that by implication we can now see this happening to us .
There is no 100 % reliable way to pinpoint where an urban legend comes from , what ( if any ) “ true life ” event kicks it off .
Birth records are n’t kept for urban legends , and the pursuit of the debunker boils down to working backwards in an attempt to trace the oft - times tenuous , oft - times non-existent , thread from where it now is back to where it once was .
All of this is by way of introduction to my theory on the origins of this legend .
The plot of the 2 April 1991 episode of the TV show Law and Order ( titled “ Sonata for Solo Organ ” ) featured the theft of a kidney .
Law and Order is a story - driven hour - long drama that prides itself in taking its script ideas from real - life contemporary news .
In this case , the writer said he ’d heard this tale from a friend , and the friend had assured him it came from the pages of a newspaper .
Yet no one could find that article .
And then I found the following .
These horrific claims made by a Turkish man who ’d been brought to Britain to sell a kidney were excerpted from a 8 December 1989 Reuters wire report :
Kurdish Moslem Ahmet Koc , 34 , said through an interpreter he had been lured to Britain last year with the promise of a job by Turkish businessmen who told him he would need a medical check .
He went to a hospital which he thought was a hotel and allowed himself to be given an injection which he believed was a blood test .
When he came round he was told his appendix had been taken out .
It was only three days later that he was told his kidney had been removed and transplanted into another patient in the hospital but that he would be paid a lot of money for it .
Well , there ’s news and there ’s news .
Far from being a victim , Koc was one of a willing consignment of four Turks who sold a kidney that day .
The removals / transplants took place in Britain in 1988 , and in January 1989 Koc went on record in Turkey with his tale of organ abduction , likely in an effort to get the organ brokers who ’d handled his case into trouble with Turkish authorities .
( Which he succeeded in doing — one of the two brothers who ’d arranged the sale was charged in January 1989 and sentenced to two years in jail in May of that year as a result of Koc ’s testimony .
Koc received a two - year suspended sentence for his part in the illegal sale . )
Yet it was not until December 1989 that Koc ’s concocted story about being an unwitting victim became all the rage in the British press for it was then he was called upon by a General Medical Council ’s disciplinary hearing to testify in England against the doctors involved .
His testimony — which included his horrific tale about waking up dazed and confused in a hospital he thought was a hotel — was widely reported at that time .
Justice was eventually served , and Koc ’s advertisement in a Turkish newspaper offering to sell one of his kidneys came to light .
Even so , his story made quite the splash at the time it hit the papers .
Consider how you would react to the following , from the 9 December 1989 Daily Telegraph :
Mr. Koc said he was taken to the hospital by two brothers , Ata Nur and Tunc Kunter , who have been described to the hearing as kidney brokers .
He said he did not see any doctors or nurses when he arrived because he was taken straight into a lift and shown to a luxurious room with a couch , television , wardrobe and bed .
“ They drove me to a building which I thought was a hotel .
I now know it as the Humana .
I had a meal and they ( the Kunters ) left and I woke up in the morning . ”
A woman “ wearing something white like a nurse ” came in and after asking him to sign a document returned with a syringe in her hand .
“ I was told they were going to take some more blood from me , ” he said .
The next thing he knew was when he awoke in a room with bottles on the wall fixed with cables and he had a very wide bandage around his waist , which was painful .
The residue of this December 1989 media splash might well have been what the Law and Order writer ’s friend remembered .
It might also have been what kicked off the story of the unwary traveler , the one about a fella who was lured back to his hotel room and the next day woke up with one less kidney than when he ’d started out .
Certainly this media circus would have at least set in place the major themes of the legend : the unknowing victim , the hotel room , the waking up in confusion and pain the next day .
It takes but little re-working of the details to turn it into a quite recognizable early form of this legend .
As mentioned earlier , the legend has changed from its early days and now includes such up - to - date frills as instructions to call 911 and e-mail exhortations to immediately pass this warning along .
It ’s the panic nature of scarelore that speeds it along at such a breathtaking rate — though a story about a dog and peanut butter might shock one into wondering what this world is coming to , it just does n’t bring with it the same compelling incentive to protect those you care about by getting this information to them right away .
As such , dog - and - peanut - butter stories get told ( or e-mailed ) when one has the time . . . whereas when it ’s scarelore one makes the time .
This panic - stricken reaction takes its toll , and the 1997 New Orleans romp through cyberspace well demonstrates it .
The New Orleans Police Department received more than a hundred calls about this legend .
To combat the misinformation they put up a web page specifically denying this rumor , and fielding calls about the “ crisis ” became yet another drain upon their manpower .
It ’s not just the New Orleans Police Department that was driven crazy by the 1997 outbreak .
In 11 February 1997 Houston Chronicle article , John Makeig wrote :
This message , signed by an Austin man identified as an “ operations engineering manager , ” evidently has been sent via faxes and Internet messages to numerous corporations and organizations nationwide .
But , said police and firefighters in Houston and New Orleans , it is utter nonsense .
The Austin man , whose name and phone numbers are affixed to the bottom of the “ Travelers Beware ! ” message , would certainly agree .
Call his number nowadays and you ’ll get this recorded message : “ If you ’re calling about the story on the Internet , I did not place it . ”
The best explanation we can offer as to why this bit of scarelore has gained , and kept , its popularity , has to do with the growing familiarity of the general population with organ transplants .
As these procedures have become more a part of the world we live in , so has awareness of the problems associated to them .
The stark reality is that there are more people in need of transplantable organs than there are organs to go around .
Knowing that , it ’s reasonable to believe wild stories of kidneys being hijacked from the unwary .
Standing in the shoes of someone desperate for this procedure , would n’t you be willing to pay just about anything to secure what you needed to keep on living ?
And if you were willing to pay whatever it cost , would n’t it be reasonable to believe that an entire class of criminals exists just to service this lucrative business ?
As many urban legends do , this one plays upon our fears .
Fear of travelling to distant cities and thus being out of our element .
Fear of being ill and desperate .
And , most of all , fear of becoming the victim of random crime .
We picture that man waking up in a bathtub filled with ice , and we see ourselves in his place .
It ’s not a nice picture .
Update :
In 1995 , India ’s parliament passed a bill limiting organ donations to close relatives and imposing prison terms of up to seven years for selling an organ .
But in Uttar Pradesh and a string of other states where the law has not been ratified by state legislatures , middlemen continue to track poor people in need of quick money and coax them to operating tables .
In such instances , these paid donors receive about $ 1,000 , more than a year ’s salary for a rural Indian laborer .
Those receiving the stolen kidneys typically pay about $ 6,000 to $ 10,000 for the organ and the transplant operation .
Still , news accounts from India occasionally surface reporting claims that doctors have been arrested for stealing kidneys ( either through trickery or force ) from unsuspecting citizens .
Such claims are difficult to evaluate given the typical lack of any follow - ups in the Western press , but other sources suggest the usual result is that charges are dropped or reduced when investigations determine that the claimants entered into voluntary agreements to sell their kidneys ( and later leveled criminal accusations because they regretted their decisions or were disgruntled with the size of the payments they had received ) .
In May 1998 three surgeons and seven others at the Noida Medicare Center in Uttar Pradesh , India were arrested for tricking indigents out of their kidneys .
According to charges made against them , members of this group approached various unemployed men , holding out the promise of jobs and offering to connect them with those doing the hiring .
Victims were advised that a medical examination was required ; they submitted and then were told something correctable by a small operation had turned up in the exam .
During the operation and unknown to the patients , one of their kidneys would be removed for resale .
Afterwards , nothing further would come of the job offer .
In January 2008 , several people were arrested in the Indian city of Gurgaon for allegedly luring hundreds of laborers to an underground medical facility in that area by promising them jobs , then duping or forcing them into “ donating ” their kidneys for transplant into wealthy clients .
However , police later determined that the primary complainant ’s kidneys were both intact .
Sightings :
In an episode of the television drama Law & Order ( “ Sonata for Solo Organ , ” original air date 2 April 1991 , police in Central Park discover a man whose kidney had been removed without his knowledge :
In that same episode , a doctor explains to detectives why a purloined kidney is of no use in the United States :
This legend also shows up as the plot of the 1993 movie The Harvest .
You ’ll also find it in the 1998 Will Christopher Baer novel Kiss Me , Judas , and it makes a gruesome appearance in the 1998 slasher classic Urban Legend .
The 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back includes a sequence during which one of the lead characters dreams he wakes up in a tub of ice after selling one of his kidneys .
The 6 February 2006 episode of the TV series Las Vegas ( titled “ Urban Legends ” ) references this legend when Danny and Mike enter one of the Montecito ’s hotel rooms to discover a man missing a kidney lying in a bathtub full of ice .
Seriously though - do n't x-ray yourself with sticky - tape .
You can , and we 'll tell you how .
But seriously gang , do n't .

First of all , let 's demystify x-rays .
An x-ray is , in many ways , not any different from visible light .
Both are produced when electrons shake off a little of their extra energy .
Sometimes that happens when they are pumped full of energy and temporarily jump to a higher energy level , only to jump down a bit later .
Sometimes it happens when something snatches a lower electron off and atom and the higher electron gets taken down a peg or two .
Occasionally it happens when an electron is zooming along and is pulled in a new direction by a nearby atom .
The change in its direction causes it to lose energy .
In every case , the energy is emitted in the form of a photon .
Photons have an energy level that corresponds to how much energy the electron dropped .
Photons can only be absorbed by atoms that can absorb their particular energy level .
Visible light photons can be absorbed ( and re-emitted ) by everything that we can see .

X -rays have such high energy that they pass through much of what we can see .
Anything on the extreme low end of the periodic table of elements is of no use to an x-ray photon .
Only bigger atoms have what it takes to absorb an x-ray .
This includes metals and , of course , our bones .
So that 's it .
An x-ray is just a photon with such high energy that it does n't interact with any small - time atoms .
Why are any photons coming off scotch tape ?
Because when a section of tape is ripped off the roll , it glows .
Why does it glow ?
Because it is triboluminescent .
What 's does it mean to be triboluminscent ?
It means that an object will glow when rubbed , crushed or ripped apart .

You can go around in that particular circle for a while .
I did .

Basically , the idea is that electrons gravitate to one part of the tape when it 's all bound together on a roll .
If a section of tape is ripped off suddenly , the electrons are stranded and jump from one side to another .
This jump emits photons , some visible light , and some x-ray .
Now , how to save on medical costs by performing unregulated , unsupervised , and possible dangerous experienced on your own , presumably injured , body parts .
First of all , you need to get rid of that stupid air .
Air ruins everything .
If you were to unpeel some tape in a dark room filled with air , you would only be able to see the tape glow in short bursts - possibly in Morse code telling you what a total loser you were for needing oxygen .

So you have to construct a vacuum chamber .
Put some sticky - tape and an automatic peeler in one end , some x-ray film in the other , and jam that broken limb in between .
Then peel .
The x-ray will take a little longer than the usual one third of a second .
Since the x-rays are emitted in short bursts , it will take a whole second to x-ray your broken foot in your home - made x-ray machine .
But hey , you constructed a vacuum chamber .
Clearly , you have time .

After that , it 's only a matter of taking your home - made x-ray and hobbling down to the nearest emergency room with a really , really smug look on your face .
You sure showed them .

At the same time , federal and city officials have not made public the precise number and location of the buildings involved , or disclosed specifics of what they think took place in each instance .
While the city ’s health department has reviewed 17 cases in which Mr. Todaro performed lead tests , it remains unclear whether city officials plan to conduct any other reviews or retesting .
But the stakes are unquestionably high .
The Environmental Protection Agency has found that the long - term effects of lead exposure in children and adults can be severe .
Inhaling asbestos can cause lung disease and cancer .
Several city agencies sought to play down the dangers .
City regulators have found no evidence that either the fraud or risks are widespread , said Marc La Vorgna , a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg .
“ We can always look for new ways to improve our process , ” he said .
“ D.E.P. is going to start increasing audits , which is the right step to ensure inspections are being completed properly . ”
But , in addition to the continuing investigation that grew out of the charges against Mr. Todaro , there are now six other unrelated federal cases under way exploring allegations of similar practices in the New York City area .
Some 1,500 people hold city or federal certifications to test for lead or asbestos in the area .
One line of inquiry for investigators in the case involving Mr. Todaro is whether any building owners , management firms or contractors for whom he or other inspectors worked paid bribes for the bogus inspection reports .
Officials say substantial sums of money could have been saved by allowing the demolition of buildings without performing expensive asbestos abatement .
Indeed , several current and former law enforcement officials and industry experts underscored that the city ’s construction industry , and in particular the demolition and asbestos abatement sectors , have a rich history of corruption .

This particular volume of “ Tales Of the Enchanted Island Where Extremely Coincidental Things Happen All The Time For No Particular Reason , As It Turns Out ” presents a difficult challenge to the reader .
The first three chapters are actually in the middle of the book .
After reading one page of Chapter 1 , you have to go back 3 chapters and read one page from Chapter Negative 1 .
You alternate this way until you get to Chapter 4 ( which is the 7th chapter ) , at which point you alternate reading one page from Chapter 4 and one page from the final chapter of the book .
I ca n’t remember what you do for Chapter 5 .
Maybe you just skip it .
Then for Chapter 6 you alternate reading one page from Chapter 6 and another page from the 6th Chapter of a completely different book .
Any book .

One of the most popular guaranteed loan available is guaranteed personal loans that offer you quick loan deals easily .
Top payday loans are meant for timely completion of routine works or timely payment towards various expenses .
Such loans are designed to meet any of your valid needs quickly when you need it most .
Such loans guarantee that credit score will only have a limited influence on the decisions of approval .
That is why it is called a guaranteed loan .
The terms and requirements are made available to the borrower beforehand .
Hence , the borrower knows the requirements he has to meet and to make sure that the credit score is above the minimum required .
The loan approval is guaranteed if the borrower meets all the requirements given to him beforehand by the lender .
Guaranteed loans are also designed for would be borrowers who have not so good credit history and need urgent funds to put his matters in order .
You can avail of these loans even if you had a past history bankruptcy , provided it is not happening now .
However , the terms for approval wont be the same ones as those offered to people with a better or good credit rating .
Guaranteed online personal loans support your financial requirements with amount up to $ 1000 .
While approving your loan request for any amount , a lender will look for presence of collateral , your credit score and employment details .
The lending policy of each lender also affects the interest rate , size of the loan amount , duration of the loan and repayment schedule .
Depending upon the loan amount repayment term can go up to 10 years without collateral and up to 30 years in presence of security .
The minimum requirements include a stable income of at least $ 1000 for the past two or three months , a current checking account .
However , what ever credit type you are , a lot depends on the steps taken by you as per the requirement of the lender that will facilitate a prompt approval of the loan .
First of all decide if you want to opt for secured or unsecured guaranteed fast personal loans .
Both the options guarantee a fast approval of the loan amount provided some requirements are met as are pointed out by the lender .
For taking an unsecured guaranteed fast personal loan , you should make sure that the information provided to the lender is accurate .
As no collateral is required for the loan , lender is solely dependent on your details of annual income , employment and overall financial standing .
As for secured loans , the lender is not worried much as it is given against collateral .
Therefore , you can get more attractive rates of interest and payment schedule .
For a faster transaction of the loan process , the online lenders are more appropriate because they can quickly check your loan requirement from simple online application you have filled .
You will be immediately conveyed of your eligibility for the loan and just after the information is verified and approved , the loan will be transferred to your account .
While using the loan wisely , make sure to pay off the loan installments in time to avoid any debt trap and bad credit .
While applying for a guaranteed online loan you should be careful in selecting the lenders as there are certain frauds and loan sharks who will try to attract you with much lower rates but can misuse your predicament later .
To avoid such an eventuality , verify the antecedents of the lender and also consult an expert who you trust .

Now that " drill , baby , drill " has become " pray , baby , pray " at least one person allowed on the mainstream media has called out Palin as being nothing more than a mouthpiece for big oil .
Thank you Douglas Brinkley who actually gives a damn what happens to the economy of Louisiana and New Orleans , unlike Palin who 's concerned with little else than lining her own pocket and scoring political points with her now unfortunate rhetoric like " drill , baby , drill " .
As I noted in my previous post on Brinkley , Digby had the best one liner on Palin that I 've read lately -- How 's That Oily Drilly Thing Working Out For Ya ?*.
Sorry Sister Sarah but all the prayer in the world is n't going to make your " drill , baby , drill " any less of a laughing stock given the real world implications of you and your ilk playing sock puppets for the oil industry and their irresponsible behavior and the real cost to taxpayers and other industries as a result of it .
Transcript via CNN .
BRINKLEY : And that -- what is happening now is an attempt to drill in ANWR .
And when people say , drill , baby , drill , it is taking a wildlife refuge that Dwight Eisenhower created 50 years ago this year and try to drill in it .
BRINKLEY : BP had the big oil spill .
Anybody can look it up online .
And the -- it ended up pouring hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the Arctic .
BRINKLEY : No .
She -- Sarah Palin has been a mouthpiece for the oil industry in Alaska .
In fact , Todd Palin worked for British Petroleum for a long time .
And , before you answer , Doug , to be fair , she also said that any country found to be negligent should be held accountable .
Doug , I want to show you something .
Sarah Palin posted something on her Facebook page today .
I do n't know if you saw this , but I want to read you a quick quote .
She wrote this .
It says : " No human endeavor is ever without risk , whether it is sending a man to the moon or extracting the necessary resources to fuel of civilization .
I continue to believe in it because increased domestic oil production will make us a more secure , prosperous and peaceful nation . "
Continuing the conversation about all this especially accountability , " Keeping Them Honest " with retired General Russel Honore and historian Douglas Brinkley .
GUPTA : And updating on our breaking news now : Alabama joining Louisiana , declaring a state of emergency , as that massive oil slick continues ashore , forecasters anticipating a break in the weather , though , a shift in wind direction tomorrow that might , just might keep , some of the spill away from land .
What President Obama needs to do , and I know Interior has been looking at , is to create national wildlife monument and do permanent protection for the wildlife in Alaska , because the birds up in ANWR come south .
And this is going to be a devastating event for the wildlife , because all of these birds fly down to the Mississippi flyway into these offshore islands that we 're going to be seeing .
You showed one bird picture .
And there are many more to come .
GUPTA : And I tell you , in fact , we -- I do n't know if you saw this at the beginning of the show , professor .
We had some pictures of the birds , actually , some of them already being affected by the oil .
Their feathers are supposed to be very white , but , obviously , they 're really affected by this quite a bit .
And we 're going to see a lot more images .
But picking up on the point you made , General , as someone with such strong roots in Louisiana , like you , do you accept offshore oil drilling as something that 's necessary , or would you like to see it scaled back ?
HONORE : I would like to see it better protected .
We need a regulatory commission with the empowerment like we have that regulate nuclear power plants , because , when we have a disaster in the Gulf , as we see this one unfold , you can't take it back .
So , we need the systems with checks , double - checks , and we need some national research centers focused on how we make that industry safe .
And , as was presented earlier in the early part of the program , we 're now finding out that shortcuts may have been taken in the safety valves that are being used .
GUPTA : Right .
HONORE : That has to work .
And then the safety valve has to have a backup to it .
I do n't think we can wean ourselves off that oil at this point in time , but it has to be made safer and regulated .
GUPTA : And talking about domestic oil production , specifically , Doug , as you know , President Obama restated his commitment to domestic energy production today .
The political path going forward is not going to be easy , of course , but what do you think about that ?
What do you -- how do you see this playing out ?
BRINKLEY : Well , only 6 percent of Americans ' oil is coming from offshore , but a lot of our future oil is offshore .
I think we have got to make a difference between BP negligence and offshore drilling .
It can be done safely .
It is being done off the coast of Norway or Brazil and other places .
And , so , let 's not go after an entire offshore industry .
This has been a big problem with British Petroleum in Alaska , in the Arctic , and now in the Gulf of Mexico .
This is their third major disaster in the United States from a foreign company over the last five years .
GUPTA : Right .
BRINKLEY : And that 's where you 're saying who to hold accountable .
There are going to be other companies that BP farmed things out to , but that petroleum company has been grossly negligent in both Alaska and now the Gulf of Mexico .
GUPTA : And , moving forward , General , I mean , now what needs to be done ?
Let 's say you have all the resources to try and clean -- clean this up and try to protect the Gulf as much as possible .
What are your fellow Louisiana residents saying ?
What does the response need to be at this point ?
HONORE : Mm-hmm .
Yes , I 'm headed down to Plaquemines Parish tomorrow morning .
And the word I 'm getting back , Anderson ( sic ) , from fishermen in that area is -- and I live here now in Louisiana -- is that they 're looking at a devastating impact on their shrimping industry .
As you know , shrimp skim the water .
They are looking at a lot of them at the height of the crop will be killed by this event .
And the long - term impact on our wildlife in that area , while Katrina was a human tragedy , this will be a tragedy of wildlife and fishery that could take years to come back from , once we have figured out how to get this oil off the ...
GUPTA : Right .
HONORE : ... soggy Gulf Coast of Louisiana .
GUPTA : That 's right .
HONORE : This is not a rock - based formation .
This thing will absorb in there and will kill the grasses that are protecting the coastline .
( CROSSTALK )
GUPTA : And we learned after the spill of Valdez , that , obviously , the oil can stick around for a long time .
This is a developing story .
We 're going to stay with it .
General Russel Honore , Douglas Brinkley , thanks so much for joining us .
BRINKLEY : Yes . .
The activist group Queers Against Israeli Apartheid will attempt to march in the July 4 Pride Toronto parade despite a Pride ban on the use of the phrase “ Israeli apartheid , ” setting up a potential confrontation with festival organizers on the day of the event .
“ I do n’t think that a suggestion that they do n’t like our message should keep us out of Pride .
So there is an intention to march , and we will find the message that works in that march and we will be there .
We need our voice to be heard , ” said Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) spokeswoman Elle Flanders .
Flanders declined to discuss the specifics of QuAIA ’s plans .
Though Pride executive director Tracey Sandilands said that QuAIA would be welcomed if it marched under a name that excluded “ apartheid , ” such as “ Queers in Favour of a Free Palestine , ” Flanders said QuAIA would not consider such a change .
Flanders made her comments after an unusual outdoor news conference Tuesday morning on the lawn outside the Dundonald St. house that serves as Pride ’s office .
As Pride officials spoke from a microphone on the front porch , about 100 QuAIA members and supporters surrounded the iron fence that enclosed the lawn , holding pieces of paper that read “ Free Speech ” and chanting “ shame ” and “ resign . ”
Pride co-chair Genevieve D’Iorio said the board voted to ban “ Israeli apartheid ” because the long - running controversy around its use had put the festival “ in jeopardy . ”
“ To not have a celebration is unacceptable and would be detrimental to the experience of millions and to the existence of this organization .
As we celebrate 30 years of Pride in 2010 , this will not be the year we see our festival cancelled because of any one specific message , ” she said .
Asked to explain how the controversy jeopardized the existence of the festival , Sandilands pointed to a council motion tabled by Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti that proposed to withdraw city “ funding and support ” from Pride if QuAIA was permitted to participate .
Sandilands said the loss of the city ’s support would mean the loss of permission to close streets and hold the parade .
In addition , D’Iorio said , the passage of Mammoliti ’s motion would threaten some $ 500,000 in funding that could not be obtained without the city ’s endorsement .
Pride ’s received $ 2.6 million in total funding last year .
Flanders scoffed at the argument that the motion was a threat to Pride ’s existence .
She said the motion was unlikely to pass , especially now that council has referred it to the city ’s executive committee .
Flanders also questioned D’Iorio ’s assertion that the controversy had jeopardized key sponsorships .
D’Iorio said sponsors had expressed “ concern ” but that none had threatened to pull funding .
Sandilands said that Pride had lost $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 in potential new sponsorships over the controversy .
She said it had also lost former participants , including business and non-political nonprofits , who said QuAIA ’s participation made them uncomfortable .
D’Iorio said would - be Pride marchers who violated the ban could be removed from the parade .
If that was not possible , she said , groups or individuals could be barred from future festivities .
Martin Gladstone , the gay and Jewish lawyer who lobbied intensively against QuAIA , and the Jewish advocacy group B’nai Brith Canada praised Pride ’s decision .
Gladstone , however , said he would “ wait and see ” before pronouncing the battle over ; he said QuAIA ’s refusal to abide by the decision “ just shows contempt for Pride and contempt for our whole community . ”

The Pride board voted 4 - 3 to approve the ban .
D’Iorio , interim co-chair Margaret Ngai , Mark Singh , and Daniel Knox voted in favour , while Gaya Arasaratnam , Helen Kennedy , and Francisco Alvarez voted against .
Previous co-chair Jim Cullen resigned soon before the vote .
D’Iorio said he did so for personal reasons .

Impolitic as it is to mention this , in rejecting the analogy with apartheid in South Africa , the Washington Post ’s Richard Cohen is not only denying realities on the ground in Palestine but also the principal and most awkward difference between the two cases .
South Africa ’s whites did not have a dedicated cadre of coreligionists or ethnic kin abroad who labored to protect them from the consequences of their deviance from the norms of humane behavior as defined by Western civilization at large .
Nor , despite open sympathy for South African whites in the American South and among ardent anti-Communists , did apartheid enjoy international ideological support outside the neo -Nazi fringe .
Israel ’s policies are supported morally , politically , and financially by large Jewish communities and a vocal minority of Christians abroad , especially in North America , which is where global power remains concentrated .
Without that support and those subsidies , Israel manifestly could not act as it does .
The dependence of South Africa on external factors was far less direct or clear .
These differences between South Africa and Israel seem to me to be crucial both morally and politically .
Cohen is clearly in denial not only about the realities of the Israel - Palestine situation but more importantly about the moral question raised by his support and that of so many other Jews who identify with Israel not just for the existence of Israel but for for whatever it does : is Israeli pseudo - apartheid entitled to and does it enjoy the approval and support of world Jewry regardless of how inhumane it is to others ?
If the answer to either question is yes , it follows that the Jewish Diaspora and its Christian camp followers are as responsible as Israel itself for the Jewish state ’s increasingly blatant racist outrages against Palestinians and other Arabs .
The corollary to that is that the Diaspora has a responsibility to prevent actions by the state of Israel that threaten the moral standing of Jews outside as well as within Israel .
( The Christian Zionist element is relatively immune to such discredit . )
At some level , Cohen undoubtedly realizes that " whateverism " on the part of the Jewish Diaspora sets up a dynamic in which global anti-Semitism and the extension of the violent struggle against Israeli policies to world Jewry , not just antipathy to Israel , are the eventually inevitable results .
Thus , having been established to protect and secure the world ’s Jews from harm by others , the aggressive amorality of the Israeli state is now the source of an accumulating threat to Jews everywhere –not to mention others who support the Jewish state , like Americans in general .
Cohen ’s reaction to this irony is denial , but widening recognition of it , consciously or subconsciously , seems to me to account for the fact that the most courageous and outspoken protesters in the West against Israel ’s behavior are — with few exceptions — Jews .
To declare " not in my name " is to assert the values of Judaism and to deny that Israel is acting on behalf of either oneself or the world ’s Jews .
Doing so recognizes that Israel is a foreign country and affirms self - respect that accords with the strategic interests of world Jewry .
In a just world that would count for much .
But in the unjust world in which we live , irony will surely become tragedy — unless the moral flaw it embodies is overcome .
This brings me to what presumably agitated Cohen in the first place : the movement to boycott , divest from , and sanction Israel to combat " apartheid " there .
The arguments against boycott , disinvestment , and sanctions in the case of South Africa reflected very significant differences in the South African and Israeli situations and would be hard to make with respect to Israel .
Afrikaner society was ingrown and largely detached from the broader world of the West ; to boycott it was arguably to shame its amour - prôpre at the cost of deepening its isolation and reducing the active challenge to its erroneous policy premises .
Israeli society is among the most cosmopolitan and connected in today ’s world ; the impact of ostracism on it would be far less problematic .
In South Africa , under the Sullivan principles , foreign investors were committed to affirmative action programs to erode apartheid ; their withdrawal had the immediate effect of worsening things for the individual victims of apartheid .
In Israel , there are no affirmative action programs to speak of , nor do foreign investors act to frustrate the expansionism of the settlers or to dissuade the state from supporting them .
On the contrary , many of them are among the most vigorous supporters of the state ’s abuses of its Palestinian subjects .
South Africa enjoyed no foreign subsidies .
In South Africa , sanctions ( outside the sports arena ) were incremental and largely ineffectual until they finally embraced the financial sphere .
Uncertainty about loans and the value of the rand had a sharp effect on business confidence and the lifestyles of the rich , which depended on access to foreign banking services that came to be seen as in jeopardy .
Israel is far more dependent on foreign financing , including subsidies .
The impact of carefully designed sanctions would be far more immediate .
That would not incidentally mitigate the negative effects of sanctions on the long - term economic structure , a problem that has bedeviled the ability of post - apartheid South Africa to compete internationally and to provide the growth in employment necessary to overcome past injustices .
Finally , had apartheid ended in tragedy , as it might well have , Euro - Americans could justly have been accused of a moral error of omission , in that we had failed to intervene to prevent our wayward offspring in southern Africa from perpetrating gross injustices that were ultimately intolerable to the region ’s indigenous peoples as well as to the world at large .
But , if Israel ’s policies are self - destructive and ultimately menacing to those who back them , North America and Europe are guilty of errors of commission .
We do more than wring our hands while sitting on them .
We are fully complicit in these policies .
Should tragedy ensue , what would those who actively aided and abetted Israeli conduct offer by way of an excuse ?
For all these reasons , it seems to me , the case for both the appropriateness and the efficacy of foreign pressure for change on Israel is very much stronger than it was in the case of South Africa .
The question remains , however , at what point will those with the greatest stake in the reemergence of a humane Israel that burnishes rather than blackens the moral standing of Judaism and that discredits rather than invites anti-Semitism recognize that stake and act to secure it ?
That ’s such a tough question that I confess to a bit of sympathy for Cohen and others now so obviously struggling to sustain the comfort of collective denial .
Four years ago , in the build - up to the World Cup in Germany in 2006 , there was a real buzz about South America 's big two .
Brazil could boast a dazzling collection of individual talent .
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira had such riches at his disposal that , as he later confessed , he felt obliged to go against his own principles and select a team that was almost a throwback to 4 - 2 - 4 .
Argentina , meanwhile , brought a team built around the sumptuous passing skills of Juan Roman Riquelme .
In qualification they had already shown hints of great quality - with switches of play , changes of rhythm , continuous formation of attacking triangles .
In the World Cup they topped it all with an awe - inspiring defeat of Serbia .
But they could not quite hit that standard again , and fell on penalties to the hosts in the quarter - final .
Brazil crashed out at the same stage but without ever coming close to living up to the expectations .
Four years later , it is impossible for Brazil to disappoint in the same way - for the very good reason that in aesthetic terms , much less is expected from them .
They top the Fifa rankings , and after an excellent run of results go to this summer 's World Cup finals in South Africa as justified favourites .
But , as Dunga 's squad selection has confirmed , the 2010 Brazil is principally a pragmatic side - deadly on the counter - attack , with a superb array of set - pieces but without the pretension of capturing hearts and minds a la 1958 , 1970 or 1982 .
Argentina , after their problems in qualifying , would also seem to offer the purists less to get excited about .
Selecting a back line made up of four centre - backs gives the team obvious limitations in possession .
Argentina , too , look set to base their play on the counter - attack .

From an idealistic point of view , the most interesting South American team in South Africa will be Chile .
In qualification the Reds scored more goals away from home than anyone else .
It is no coincidence .
Coach Marcelo Bielsa is obsessed with attack .
If the game is played home , away , up a mountain or into a force 10 gale , it makes no difference - Bielsa wants the action to take place in the opposing team 's half of the field .
His trademark 3 - 3 - 1 - 3 formation is designed to apply constant pressure .
He seeks to create two against one situations down the flanks , and while getting his wingers behind the defence .
Tricky right - winger Alexis Sanchez is the side 's big hope , a potential superstar full of changes of direction and bursts of pace .
Centre - forward Humberto Suazo was South America 's top scorer in qualification .
Just behind him Mati Fernandez has yet to show his best in European club football - for the national team , however , he carries something of the thrust of the youthful Kaka and if he is off form , Jorge Valdivia is a delightful twinkle - toed alternative .
Chile are basically a four and six side - the three in the back line plus the holding midfielder are primarily defensive with everyone else looking to push forward .
Such an approach can leave them open to their opponents ' counter - attack , and they struggle to defend in the air .
One of the most fascinating questions of the World Cup will be whether Chile will get away with such a bold gameplan at the highest level .
The weight of history is not on Chile 's side .
They came third when they hosted the World Cup in 1962 .
Other than that , though , their last victory in the tournament was way back in 1950 when they beat the United States .
They played in 1966 , 1974 , 1982 and 1998 without managing a single win .
And the weight of history also presses down on Bielsa .
He needs to overcome the World Cup ghost of 2002 , when he was in charge of his native Argentina .
His team sailed through qualification in a blaze of goals , turned up in the Far East as favourites and promptly crashed out in the group stage .
In part , he was undone by the calendar - with the tournament held earlier than usual to avoid the rainy season , his players had not had enough time to recover from the rigours of the European season .
Perhaps , too , it was a problem Bielsa did not administer well with some of the team complaining that they were being worked too hard in training .
These are vital issues for any side but especially for one of Bielsa's .
Sitting back in defence is less tiring but to play Bielsa 's high - tempo , high - pressure football the players must be in top condition .
Questions on all of these issues - the tactical formation , the physical preparation , the team 's mental and emotional strength - will begin to be answered in just under a month 's time .
Chile kick off their campaign against Honduras on 16 June .
This is no easy baptism .
The pressure is right on from the start .
With Spain in the same group , the opening clash is vital .
Chile badly need to win their first World Cup match on foreign soil for 60 years .
Fans of brave , attacking football will be in their corner .
Comments on the piece in the space below .
Other questions on South American football to vickerycolumn@hotmail.com , and I will pick out a couple for next week .
A quick note of apology - I have got so much on at the moment that I do not have time to get back individually to all the questions , so I am very sorry if you have not had a reply .
But please keep sending them in - they all get read and considered and they all help in formulating themes for future columns .
From last week 's postbag ;
Q ) I 've always wondered why Brazil have never been able to produce marauding box - to - box midfielders like Steven Gerrard , or Michael Ballack ?
Players who score and defend , are everywhere in the middle of the park .
The midfield seems to produce attacking players like Kaka or defensive ones like Gilberto Silva .
Sola Sanusi
A ) I would not say never !
For me the golden age of Brazilian football , certainly as a spectacle , happened not necessarily with 4 - 2 - 4 but with midfielders who had grown up in a culture of 4 - 2 - 4 .
The pair in the middle had so much space to cover that they were obliged to do everything .
Take 1970 - Gerson and Clodoaldo were interchangeable .
In the semi-final against Uruguay , Gerson was being marked tightly , so he sat back and sent Clodoaldo forward to score the vital equaliser .
You can still see this influence in the development of Falcao and Toninho Cerezo in the 70s and 80s .
What has happened since is that Brazilian football has become a hostage to attacking full - backs .
Many of them have forgotten how to defend - Cicinho at Roma was appalled at being expected to mark the opposing winger .
So if the full - backs do not defend , someone else has to - and thus the purely defensive midfielder was born and this separation of midfield functions became the norm .
Q ) Just wondering what you made of the inclusion in the Argentina squad of Fabricio Coloccini and Jonas Gutierrez .
I'm a Newcastle fan and both players have been impressive this season in the Championship .
Is this enough though ?
In particular , seeing Coloccini in there instead of Gabriel Milito of Barca ?
Chris Owens
A ) I cannot for the life of me explain why Coloccini is in , especially as he has hardy featured under Maradona - only one game at right - back against Spain last year .
It is entirely possible that he will not make the cut - but Gutierrez is likely to be in the team and for all his limitations , I can understand it .
Maradona has heaped importance on Juan Sebastian Veron - indeed the big hole in the squad is the lack of cover for him , unless you see Marco Bolatti as a potential replacement .
Anyway , Veron is now 35 and you do not want him taking on too much defensive responsibility .
If he tries it he now has a tendency to arrive late for the tackle and pick up cards .
So I do n't think Maradona is too concerned by the weakness of Gutierrez in providing end product - he is a strong , unselfish character who is there to run and cover and take the defensive strain off Veron .
Maradona even said he would pick Gutierrez if Newcastle were in the third division !
Tonight , with much fanfare , Schwarzenegger released his proposal to fix California 's $ 19 billion budget deficit .
It was a huge disappointment .
Schwarzenegger had a golden opportunity to propose radical changes like privatizing the prison system , privatizing work in general , sending illegal aliens home , or getting rid of defined benefit plans .
Instead , Schwarzenegger wimped out on many key issues .
Budget at a Glance
Please consider some highlights from Schwarzenegger 's revised state budget at a glance
Close the $ 19.1 Billion Deficit Through :
$ 12.4 billion in spending cuts .
$ 3.4 billion in federal money .
$ 3.3 billion in other measures , primarily through borrowing from other state funds .
Spending Cuts
Breakdown
$ 1.1 billion through the elimination of CalWORKS , the state 's primary welfare program , which serves 1.4 million people , two - thirds of them children .
$ 750 million in unspecified cuts to the state 's in - home supportive services program for the disabled , achieved through reductions in wages and services .
Cuts $ 532 million from Medi-Cal , the state 's medical program for the poor , by reducing eligibility , limiting doctor 's visits to 10 per year , reducing funding for hearing aids and other medical equipment , and increasing copays .
$ 811 million reduction in prison health care expenses by making the system more efficient and reducing funding .
About $ 360 million in savings by shifting nonviolent offenders out of state prisons and into county jails and by reducing the juvenile prison population and closing the facilities that house them .
State Employees
Payroll reductions of 5 percent across all state departments , except for constitutional offices , which already achieved 5 percent reductions .
The administration says much of the payroll reduction can be achieved by departments not filling current vacancies .
A 5 percent pay cut for all state workers and a 5 percent increase in their pension contributions .
The administration says this will save $ 1.6 billion .
Media Reporting
Proposing a budget that would eliminate the state 's welfare - to - work program and most child care for the poor , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday outlined a stark vision of a California that would sharply limit aid to some of its poorest and neediest citizens .
His $ 83.4 - billion plan would also freeze funding for local schools , further cut state workers ' pay and take away 60 % of state money for local mental health programs .
State parks and higher education are among the few areas the governor 's proposal would spare .
Elimination of CalWorks , the state 's main welfare program , would affect 1.3 million people , including about 1 million children .
The program , which requires recipients to eventually have jobs , gives families an average $ 500 a month .
Ending those payments would save the state $ 1.6 billion , the administration said .
It would also make California the only state not to offer a welfare - to - work program for low - income families with children .
Democratic leaders immediately vowed to reject the governor 's plans and craft alternatives , which they said could include new taxes on oil companies as well as the abolition of some corporate tax breaks .
Meanwhile , Republican lawmakers , who hold enough votes to block tax increases and budgets , embraced the governor 's approach .
Another issue the governor 's plan addresses is prison costs .
He would reduce them by shifting the responsibility for some state inmates to local governments , as he has proposed before .
According to his estimate , the state would save $ 248 million by sending new low - level felons to local jails instead of to state prisons and by shifting supervision of state juvenile parolees to counties .
Narcotic treatment programs for roughly 160,000 Medi-Cal patients would be eliminated to save the state $ 53.4 million .
And state money for county mental health programs would drop 60 % .
" You ca n't make these numbers work , " said Rusty Selix , executive director of the California Council of Community Mental Health Agencies .
" You 're basically destroying the system . "
On Friday , the governor said he would use his negotiating leverage to continue to push for changes in state government that the Legislature has blocked year after year .
Among them are installing a less generous pension system for newly hired state workers and significant changes to the state budget process — a requirement that California build a larger rainy - day fund , for example — that Schwarzenegger argues would stop the budget " roller - coaster ride . "
" I will not sign a budget if we do n't have pension reform and budget reform , " he said .
Budget Proposal Not Really Balanced
Democrats Riled Up
“ We will not pass a budget that eliminates CalWorks , ” state Senate President Darrell Steinberg told reporters after the governor ’s speech .
“ We will not be party to devastating families .
That ’s not what any of us came to Sacramento to do . ”

The ruling by Lady Justice Hallett on the scope of the inquest into the 7 July 2005 London suicide bombings is the latest in a series of recent blows inflicted on MI5 .
It also drives home the point that it is the courts , and not parliament , that are calling the security and intelligence to account .
Her ruling may not go as far as the relatives of the victims and the wounded would have wanted .
But the appeal court judge makes clear she was not intimidated by suggestions from MI5 lawyers that a fresh investigation into what the security service and police knew about the bombers before the attack would have dire consequences for Britain 's national security and could only help al - Qaida and its supporters .
" To my mind , " she said , " it is not too remote to investigate what was known in the year or two before the alleged bombings .
Plots of this kind are not developed overnight " .
In another telling passage , she said that as far as the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee ( ISC ) is concerned , " whatever its good intentions , it could not fulfill the role of independent investigator " .
She added : " There may be practical difficulties in doing more , it may take some time , but it is a counsel of defeat to say the difficulties cannot be overcome before one has even embarked upon the task " .
MI5 , argued , and told the ISC , that although two of the suicide bombers – Mohammed Sidiique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer – had been on its radar , they were not identified at the time and the evidence was they may have been involved in fraud , not planning terror plots in Britain .
MI5 also argued that they did not have enough resources to follow individuals considered at the time less dangerous than others – notably those involved in fertiliser bomb plots to blow up targets around London .
Those plotters were caught .
We shall see how far Hallett gets in her investigations and how much she will publish without coming against a brick wall of " national security " claims .
Her ruling comes a short time after the appeal court threw out Labour government claims , supported by MI5 , that evidence relating to complicity in the torture or inhuman treatment of Binyam Mohamed – the British resident secretly jailed before being transferred to Guantánamo Bay – must be suppressed .
Her ruling also comes a day after William Hague , the foreign secretary , said that a judge should investigate the mounting evidence and allegations of UK security and intelligence agency involvement in abuses abroad .

The popular image of a church is that of a selfless organization unconcerned with financial gain .
It is reflected in the fact that churches receive tax - exempt status from federal and state governments .
And without question , most churches do engage in substantial charity work .
But that does n’t mean that churches are not , at least partially , money - making enterprises .
Though official records are scarce , the world ’s major churches are all believed to collect annual revenues in excess of several billion dollars .
Like any other institution , these churches work hard to earn the highest possible return on their investments .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints
Otherwise known as the Mormon church , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints has long been one of the world ’s wealthiest religious groups .
Like most major churches , the exact tally of LDS assets is difficult to come by .
In July 2007 , the Salt Lake Tribune covered an Oregon Supreme Court ruling ordering the church to publicize its financials in connection with a lawsuit from an alleged abuse victim , noting that it had not disclosed such information since 1959 .
In 1997 , Time Magazine found that current LDS assets totaled $ 30 billion .
If LDS were a corporation , Time continued , its estimated $ 5.9 billion in annual revenues would have placed it midway through the Fortune 500 .
The LDS church has taken ambitious strides to preserve and grow its wealth over the years .
Beneficial Financial Group , a $ 3.1 billion insurance company with annual revenues exceeding $ 600 million , is wholly owned by the church .
LDS also owns the Deseret Morning News , Utah ’s second - largest newspaper .
Bonneville International Corporation , which controls over two dozen top radio stations across six states , is also wholly owned by LDS through Deseret Management Corporation , the church ’s for - profit arm .
Another $ 6 billion of church money was said by Time to be tied up in “ unspecified investments . ”
All of these activities , it should be noted , are categorized as “ unrelated business income ” and subject to state and federal taxes .
Roman Catholic Church
( Joao Maximo )
In 2005 , MSNBC reported that the Roman Catholic Church owned more real estate globally than any other organization or individual on earth .
Interestingly , a surprising amount of this land does not produce income for the church .
Gabriel Kahn , a Rome Correspondent for the Wall Street Journal , told MSNBC that the church ’s land assets “ are not liquid and they ca n’t be put to use for the Catholic Church in the way they could be for , say , a corporation . ”
But just five years earlier , the church ’s own financial statements told a different story .
In 2001 , an official report stated that the church ’s real estate activities in fiscal year 2000 produced $ 81.7 billion in revenue on $ 51.8 billion in expenses : a nearly $ 30 billion profit .
Outside of real estate , MSNBC suggests that the Catholic church maintains a portfolio of conservative investments .
In 2006 , the Boston Globe revealed that the church turned a profit of roughly $ 55 million on a portfolio heavily concentrated in government bonds .
The Vatican ’s TV and publishing operations , too , were said to have produced an unspecified surplus .
Of course , the bulk of the Catholic Church ’s yearly income continues to come in the form of donations .
The Boston Globe found that “ contributions from worldwide dioceses ” totaled $ 92.9 million in 2005 , while individual donations made directly to the Pope neared $ 60 million .
In recent years , the Vatican has suffered from having a portfolio biased toward dollar - denominated investments .
The UK ’s Guardian found that in 2008 the church suffered its first loss in four years , owing to the decline of the dollar relative to the stronger Euro .
Evangelical Lutheran Church
( hoyasmeg )
The Evangelical Lutheran Church is less guarded than either the Catholic Church or Church of Latter - Day saints , releasing detailed yearly financial reports on its website .
In fiscal year 2009 , the church claims to have earned $ 1,698,336 from “ investment income ” , $ 2,238,629 from “ bequests and trusts ” and another $ 1,003,420 in rental income .
The same report lists a separate column of “ temporarily restricted ” revenues , on which another $ 1,625,000 in investment income is reported .
While the exact nature of these investments are not specified in the report , the church appears to derive substantial income from its Mission Investment Fund .
Through the Mission Investment Fund , the ELCA has made “ nearly 800 active loans totaling over $ 475 million ” to affiliated ministries located in the United States , Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands .
The purpose of loan proceeds is to help these organizations buy land , expand operations or in some way improve the Lutheran experience of nearby worshipers .
At time of writing , the Mission Investment Fund is offering 3.25 % interest on four year , fixed - rate CDs , as well as 5.00 % on one year , adjustable - rate mortgages .
Members of the church are also encouraged to buy high - yield CDs , contribute to Health Savings Accounts , and use checking and savings accounts administered by the ECLA .
In total , the church claims that a significant number of “ schools , colleges , universities , social ministry organizations and outdoor ministries ” are invested in the Mission Investment Fund .
The Takeaway
Despite its un-businesslike nature , a church requires capital to carry outs its operations just as any other organization .
In 2005 , MSNBC ’s Nanette Hansen even wondered if Pope Benedict XVI would “ have to be a money manager as well as a spiritual leader . ”
Regardless of the use to which church investment proceeds are ultimately put , there is no denying the financial clout that their activities provide them .
Both the donations they take in and the investment income they earn help make the world ’s major churches serious financial players .

John Shepherd - Barron at the cash dispenser in Tain , Ross - shire
The man credited with being the inventor of the world 's first hole - in - the - wall cash dispenser has died in hospital following a short illness .
John Shepherd - Barron , who was born in India , to Scottish parents , had been living in Portmahomack in Ross - shire .
He died at Inverness 's Raigmore Hospital on Saturday , at the age of 84 .
Mr Shepherd - Barron came up with the idea for a cash machine while in the bath .
The first ATM machine was installed at a bank in London in 1967 .
The inventor 's idea for a cash machine was the first to be tested ahead of other patented devices .
Reg Varney , from the television series
On the Buses , was the first to withdraw cash from the hole - in - the - wall at Barclays bank in Enfield .
In an interview with the BBC in 2007 , Mr Shepherd - Barron said : " It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money , anywhere in the world or the UK .
" I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser , but replacing chocolate with cash . "
Barclays moved quickly to commission a machine .
I later worked out you would have to eat 136,000 such cheques for it to have any effect on you
John Shepherd - Barron
Over a pink gin , the bank's then chief executive signed a hurried contract with Mr Shepherd - Barron , who at the time worked for a printing firm .
Plastic bank cards had not been invented , so Mr Shepherd - Barron 's machine used cheques that were impregnated with carbon 14 , a mildly radioactive substance .
The machine detected it , then matched the cheque against a Pin ( personal identification number ) .
Mr Shepherd - Barron denied there were any health concerns , telling the BBC in 2007 : " I later worked out you would have to eat 136,000 such cheques for it to have any effect on you . "
The machine paid out a maximum of £ 10 a time .
The first machines were vandalised and one that was installed in Zurich in Switzerland began to malfunction mysteriously .
It was later discovered that the wires from two intersecting tramlines nearby were sparking and interfering with the mechanism .
Killer whales Mr Shepherd - Barron 's wife influenced his thoughts on the Pin , used to operate the machines .
The inventor could remember his six - figure Army number but he ran the idea by his wife Caroline .
Mr Shepherd - Barron said : " Over the kitchen table , she said she could only remember four figures , so because of her , four figures became the world standard . "
After moving to Portmahomack , he invented a device that played the sound of killer whales to ward off seals from his fish farm .
However , he told the BBC that it had only succeed in attracting more of the " scoundrels " .
James Goodfellow , of Paisley , Renfrewshire , was credited with being the inventor of the Pin and awarded an OBE in 2006 .
He devised the mechanism of keying in a number code to cash machines in the 1960s .
Forty years after he applied for his patent , he was recognised in the Queen 's Birthday Honours List .
Mr Goodfellow said he had " only been doing his job " when he dreamt up the concept .

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh claimed that President Obama is ignoring the victims of the Tennessee flood because , “ he does n’t have any constituents there , ” which implied that Obama is ignoring Tennessee , because they support Republicans and they are white .
However , Limbaugh neglected to mention that FEMA was on the ground in Tennessee before the rain even started .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters

While taking a call from a man in Tennessee who claimed that the flooding has been ignored Limbaugh said , “ Well he knows he does n’t have any constituents there to speak of , well seriously .
I do n’t want to poison the well here …
It ’s true though you still will not find a donation link at a White House website for Tennessee .
You will find it for Haiti , and you will find it for people in the Gulf because of the oil slick . ”
Limbaugh ’s claim that there is no donation link is not true at all .
If you go to the White House website and click the post on the front page titled On The Ground Before the Raindrops Started Falling , you will find that Robert Gibbs posted , “ You can lend a hand to those affected by flooding and tornados in Tennessee and across the region by donating to the Red Cross at http://www.redcross.org/ or texting “ RedCross ” to 90999 and a $ 10 donation will be added to your bill , ” which certainly looks like a link to me .
Rush Limbaugh was trying to play the race card here and flip the claim that George W. Bush ignored New Orleans after Katrina because most of those trapped were black and Democratic on its ear to make it look like Obama is ignoring Tennessee because the people there are white and did not support him in 2008 .
However , the President signed disaster declarations for Alabama and Tennessee on May 3 and 4th respectively .
The rain came on Saturday and Sunday , and federal aid was approved by Monday and Tuesday .
Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen said that FEMA was on the ground in Tennessee before the rain started falling .
This contradicts Limbaugh ’s claim that Obama has ignored the flooding in the state .
I will agree that the flooding has been neglected by the media in favor of the Gulf oil spill .
Limbaugh ’s allegations about the federal reaction and prioritization are simply false , but when has Rush ever been in the habit of telling the truth on his radio show ?
Even though one of the most prominent studies that raised the issue of vaccine safety — Andrew Wakefield 's link between the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine and autism — has been thoroughly discredited , the fear of vaccines has proven remarkably malleable .
In addition to MMR , fears focused on a mercury - based preservative called thimerosal .
Both of those have been cleared by subsequent research , but that has n't stopped people from questioning vaccine safety .
Instead , a pattern emerged : some people doubted the exculpatory research , as others continued to blame the same cause ( vaccines ) while casting about for a new mechanism .
One of the more recent targets of the latter group has been the recommended vaccine schedule , which calls for a significant number of injections within the first year of age .
A number of people have argued that this schedule causes a response that ultimately produces neurological damage .
This idea has now taken a hit from a study published in the journal Pediatrics .
The study found little correlation between vaccination schedules and performance on a battery of tests of mental performance that were administered seven years later — the few associations that did turn up indicated that the prevailing vaccination schedule actually improves mental performance .
To perform the new analysis , some researchers took advantage of a cohort of children that had been organized to check on the safety of thimerosal .
Seven years after vaccination , the 1,047 kids had been given a large battery of tests that measured a variety of mental processes , from hyperactivity scores to metacognition .
It turns out that not all of these children had been given the full recommended suite of vaccines during their first seven months .
Nearly half of the children fell into the " timely receipt " category , while about 20 percent never received the full suite of vaccinations ; the remainder got them all , but on a delayed schedule .
This provided the opportunity to compare test performance among these groups .
Factors such as parental education and income were included in the analysis to control for known influences on test performance .
( Parents who kept to the vaccination schedule tended to have higher incomes and education levels , which tend to correlate with many of these test scores . )
The researchers performed a binary comparison between the top and bottom 20 percent when it came to vaccination scheduling , along with a multivariate analysis .
The binary comparison indicated that , if anything , adhering to the recommended vaccination schedule improved the children 's cognitive development , as those kids outscored the least timely group on 12 of the 42 tests , whereas the converse did n't occur .
Most of these differences vanished in the multivariate analysis , however , which suggests they were n't very robust .
Still , it 's anything but support for the contention that the vaccination schedule can be harmful .
The authors caution that there could be some other demographic factor that they have n't accounted for that influences the test results .
Still , if vaccines were doing anything significant here , they argue that it should have been apparent .
They also note that the recommended vaccination schedule has changed since the time of the study , but it has resulted in a reduced exposure to antigens during the first year of life .
There 's little question that the paper was intended to put fears about vaccine safety to rest .
" These data may reassure parents who are concerned that children receive too many vaccines too soon , " the authors conclude , while noting that there are some very clear medical reasons to get the vaccinations early on , such as for diseases that have higher fatality rates for younger infants .
Still , I 'd place the emphasis on " may " in that sentence .
The antivaccine community has n't completely given up the mercury and MMR claims despite copious evidence , and has shown a remarkable ability to invent new reasons to question the safety of vaccines as each of their prior justifications is debunked .
Still , there 's almost certain to be a population that is committed to vaccinations but is unsure about the recommended schedule , and this study may go a long way towards convincing them .

So far it 's been a good homestand for the Giants .
And so far it 's been a great homestand for Barry Zito .
Despite a period of discontent in the first three seasons of his $ 126 million deal , the lefty has finally figured out the way into the hearts of the home crowd .
Win .
Friday night at AT&T Park Zito added to the best start of his career , improving to 4 - 0 as the Giants beat the Rockies , 5 - 2 .
For the second start in a row , he was serenaded with chants of , " Barry , Barry ! " from the San Francisco faithful .
That 's in sharp contrast to the boos that rained down over the former Cy Young Award winner over the last few seasons .
But that was then , and this is now .
And now Zito is looking a whole lot like the guy who won Baseball 's most prestigious pitching honor when he was with the Athletics .
In eight innings of work Zito held the Rockies to just two runs on five hits and three walks , while striking out five .
At one point he retired 10 batters in a row .
As a result , Zito is now tied with Tim Lincecum for most wins on the team , and saw his ERA move to a measly 1.53 .
But he could n't do it alone .
The Giants lineup also picked up the slack , scoring three runs in the go - ahead fifth inning .
Pablo Sandoval started things off with an infield hit that scored Andres Torres , and Aubrey Huff followed it up with a two RBI , bases - clearing double , putting the Giants on top , 5 - 2 .
That is where they stayed .
Jeremy
Affeldt came in for the one - out save , and the Giants improved to 5 - 2 on this nine - game homestand .
Coach with no time for fancy - dan footballers is one win away from Champions League glory
Louis van Gaal 's first act as Bayern Munich manager was to shut himself in a monastery for a month .
Inspired by its ascetic ethos , the Dutchman totally immersed himself in the intensive German lessons offered by enterprising monks and emerged with more than merely a decent grasp of modal verbs .
Most managers would refuse even to contemplate spending a large chunk of the summer break cloistered away from secular society in an abstemious parallel universe , but Van Gaal 's retreat into a religious order this time last year proved emblematic of the 58 - year - old 's modus operandi .
Startlingly left - field , yet intensely conservative , eminently logical , but invariably imaginative , Van Gaal is a supreme strategist whose blend of industry and innovation has helped him to choreograph four teams in three countries to 18 major trophies , the latest with Bayern 's 4 - 0 demolition of Werder Bremen in the German Cup final yesterday .
Aware that Bavarians expect Bayern 's manager to speak their language , he typically mastered essential German in the fastest possible time .
Next up was the initially vexing , ultimately successful mission to become the first Dutch coach to win the Bundesliga and , now , Van Gaal is attempting to squeeze even greater job satisfaction from his inaugural season at the club dubbed " FC Hollywood " .
On Saturday , in Madrid , club football 's most glittering prize is up for grabs when a martinet capable of accruing enemies even faster than silverware aims to mastermind a Champions League triumph at Internazionale 's expense .
Already , a German media bearing scars inflicted by the former Ajax , Barcelona , Holland and AZ Alkmaar coach 's infamous sarcasm has dubbed a clash that pits him against his one - time assistant at Barcelona , José Mourinho , as " God v The Son of God " .
Despite both boasting out - size egos , the pair remain good friends , regularly exchanging warm texts as they bask in the European limelight .
" This is going to be one Champions League final where the coaches , rather than the players , dominate attention , " Glenn Roeder says .
In 2007 , the then Newcastle manager was " Van Gaaled " when AZ knocked his side out of the Uefa Cup after an extraordinary second leg in Holland .
It began with the sound of a high - volume recording of Winston Churchill 's " We shall never surrender " speech crackling over the stadium Tannoy as kick - off beckoned , as the home manager , trailing 4 - 2 , sought a psychological advantage .
" You can never overestimate Van Gaal , " Roeder adds .
" He 's one of the world 's great coaches ; José Mourinho wo n't be complacent . "
Mourinho says that while the late Sir Bobby Robson taught him the value of shrewd man-management , Van Gaal highlighted the importance of preparation and strong defence .
If both finalists are very much systems men , sharing an almost evangelical belief that , by dint of tactical ingenuity , the manager is king , they remain far from footballing soulmates .
Van Gaal remains considerably more attack - minded than his Portuguese rival , permitting significantly greater scope for improvisation within the parameters of any tactical framework , but Mourinho 's man-management is considerably more evolved .
Many would say it possesses the emotional intelligence lacking in his unashamedly old - school mentor , who was required to rebuild a reputation shattered by a disastrous stint in charge of the Dutch national side , culminating in the so - called Clockwork Oranje 's failure to qualify for the 2002 World Cup .
You would certainly be unlikely to catch Inter 's coach emulating Van Gaal and screaming insults in the face of Franck Ribéry after the over - heated winger dared to sit down and take his boots off during a scorching training session last summer .
Or to see Mourinho spot Luca Toni slumping in the canteen over lunch and immediately stride over , angrily pull one of his ears and order him to sit up straight .
Although Toni is now on loan at Roma and Van Gaal 's relationship with Ribéry remains uneasy , the realisation among Bayern 's players – particularly younger homegrown ones – that he is capable of improving them beyond recognition permits him to take some breathtakingly Clough - like liberties .
It is no coincidence that the 20 - year - old forward Thomas Müller and the 21 - year - old defender Holger Badstuber have emerged from the youth ranks to keep Ribéry and company unexpectedly on their toes during a season when Bastian Schweinsteiger has also surpassed himself in midfield .
Roeder adds : " Van Gaal generally has more success with younger players who fully appreciate what he 's doing for them than with more cynical older stars ; maybe that 's why his time in charge of Holland did n't work out .
But he 's a brilliant , brilliant coach and even difficult players respect that . "
At Bayern , it also helps that he is not Jürgen Klinsmann .
Supporters had come to loathe their former manager 's Americanised obsession with image and swiftly realised Klinsmann 's slickly spun , relentlessly positive soundbites , plastic smiles and careful placement of Buddhist statues in training - ground lounges masked clay feet .
Tactless and taciturn , Van Gaal was eagerly embraced as an " authentic " antidote .
In return , Bayern 's so - called Tulip General is seeking to relight the flame of perfection he first sparked when his Ajax team – which featured , among many other extravagant talents , Jari Litmanen , Frank Rijkaard , Patrick Kluivert , Marc Overmars and Edgar Davids – effectively redefined Total Football .
" We play very attractively at Bayern , " says Van Gaal , a stickler for formal manners , who faced the sack last autumn after indifferent results .
" We are always looking to attack and put opponents under incredible pressure . "
It has been much the same since Aloysius Paulus Maria van Gaal exchanged life as a slow and stocky , but eye - catchingly sweet - passing , Sparta Rotterdam midfielder for a coach 's tracksuit at Ajax .
" I have my own ways , I 'm not going to change and I have no desire to , " says the unusually unmaterialistic multi‑millionaire , who , to his wife 's dismay , disdains fancy restaurants , designer watches and male fashion .
" My way is a footballing philosophy more than a system .
A system depends on the players – I 've played 4 - 3 - 3 with Ajax , 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 with Barcelona and 4 - 4 - 2 with AZ – but a philosophy is for life .
" The coach is the team 's focal point , so preparing the tactical formation is essential .
Every player must know where he has to be and support his team - mates .
There has to be absolute discipline and mutual understanding .
Discipline is the basis of creativity and flexibility . "
Although he claims immunity to the vagaries of popular opinion , Van Gaal does sometimes bend his rules , slightly .
At Barcelona , where his falling out with Rivaldo over the Brazilian 's penchant for unscripted dribbling still raises eyebrows , he compromised over the training regime .
" Spanish players refused to do the running he demanded , " Roeder says .
" So he introduced the ball to every session .
The players thought they 'd won , but ended up running just as much . "
Despite his formidably cold , cutting and sometimes contemptuous public persona , Van Gaal has aspiring coaches jostling for placements under his wing and Adam Sadler , the former Norwich City assistant manager and now No2 at Gateshead , visited AZ as part of his Pro Licence .
" I had sky - high expectations , " he says .
" But Louis van Gaal exceeded them .
He was welcoming and open .
He 's a man of integrity and strong moral values who demands maximum concentration .
He does n't let players relax . "
In past years , the Dutchman has claimed to be coveted by Manchester United and England , but Roeder questions his suitability .
" Van Gaal spends hours on passing drills and technique , " he says .
" They 're things a lot of English players do n't enjoy – which is why we 're not as good , technically , as we could be . "
During the dark days of last autumn , when Bayern drifted towards Bundesliga obscurity , there was a feeling Van Gaal might not be right for Munich either .
Elimination from the Champions League group stages looked likely , dressing - room dissent festered , everyone was mystified when he deployed a 3 - 3 - 3 - 1 formation against Hamburg and dismissal loomed .
A watershed arrived when the still - struggling coach addressed Bayern 's important AGM in November .
Privately thrilled by his uncompromising refusal to bow to chairman Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 's demands for weekly debriefs and a consistent two - man strike force , the audience greeted Van Gaal 's startlingly honest speech with wholesale applause .
Dressing - room rebels took note , the manager mellowed a little and a corner was turned .
Although fortune continued to smile on Bayern 's less - than - serene Champions League progress , their one - and two - touch game was turning into an art form , a reborn Mark van Bommel invariably controlled midfield and a miraculously fit Arjen Robben revelled in the form of his life .
Much to the relief of his second wife Truus , Van Gaal – whose first spouse , Fernanda , the mother of his two daughters , died of cancer in 1994 – had once again prevailed against adversity .
" Louis is actually extremely warm - hearted , but he does n't get the idea of being nice to people he does n't think are nice , " she says .
" He 's also very honest and naive .
Almost no one is as honest as him .
It makes life difficult , but Louis has this complete belief in himself and his methods . "
A study in the March edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry , senior - authored by Jerome C. Wakefield , empirically challenges the effectiveness of psychiatrists ' official diagnostic manual in preventing mistaken , false - positive diagnoses of depression .
This is n't the first time that Wakefield has challenged the DSM criteria for diagnosing depression .
His first assault caused such controversy that the criteria were slightly tightened , but DSM - V is on the horizon and I suspect psychiatrists are busy pushing their particular niche obsessions .
According to the DSM , the diagnosis of major depression requires the presence – for two weeks – of at least five possible symptoms out of a list of nine , which include , for example , sadness , loss of interest in usual activities , lowered appetite , fatigue , and insomnia .
However , these symptoms can also occur in normal responses to loss and stress .
False positive diagnoses occurwhen someone reacting with intense normal sadness to life 's stresses is misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder .
Recent studies suggest that a very large percentage of people have such symptoms for two weeks or longer at some point in their lives ; therefore , how many of these individuals really are afflicted by a mental disorder or are responding within normal limits to loss or stress has been a matter of debate .
Under the 1994 DSM - IV revision the so - called Clinical Significance Criterion ( CSC ) was added in the hope of avoiding so many false positives .
In addition to the two weeks of sadness and other depressive symptoms , a specified minimal " clinically significant " threshold in the form of harm due to distress or role impairment ( in occupational , family , or interpersonal contexts ) must have resulted from the symptoms in evidence before they could be considered signs of depression .
But Wakefield 's new study shows that the Clinical Significance Criterion is n't doing its job of filtering out false positives .
This allows Wakefield to bring out another study he did earlier which was largely dismissed because it was undertaken before the CSC was implemented but failed to get published because it was completed just after the new guidelines .
One can sense that Wakefield smells blood here !
But this is no mere academic discussion .
The diagnostic criteria for depression are remarkably weak ; just two weeks of symptoms seems a very short period on which to base a diagnosis which may well lead to medication .
Wakefield 's criticisms strike me as the same as those against the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) .
You can try the BDI yourself , just click here .
How depressed do you score compared to how depressed ( or not ) you are currently feeling ?
However , this recent study looked at how often doctors actually use these DSM criteria when making a diagnosis .
Nearly 25 percent of the psychiatrists indicated that they used the DSM - IV MDD ( major depressive disorder ) criteria to diagnose depression less than half of the time .
In contrast , more than two - thirds of the non-psychiatrist physicians indicated that they used the DSM - IV MDD criteria less than half of the time when diagnosing MDD .
The difference between the psychiatrists ' and the non-psychiatrists use of the criteria was significant , but equally pathetic .
Many complained that they could n't remember the full criteria or that they were overly complex .
What do these people get paid for ?
The best doctor I ever had was surrounded by books and would often dip in to verify something or to pick precisely the right medication .
Do you think I was going to complain because he wanted to double - check that he was n't making a mess of my diagnosis ?
When was the last time you ever saw a physician open a book , or even consult something online ?
I feel there is absolutely no excuse for such lack of knowledge and expertise .
It makes arguments over the DSM largely irrelevant - perhaps a clearer focus on training doctors , and especially non-psychiatric physicians , would be much better for the mental health of the population .

Stepping Stones : Telling More Interesting Lies
“ Oh what a tangled web we weave , when first we practice to deceive … ”
– Sir Walter Scott
Lying to someone in roleplaying games often goes something like this :
“ I want to convince the guy these are not the droids he ’s looking for . ”
“ Okay , roll . ”
> roll roll roll < " I win ! "
It 's simple : you have a goal and you roll to achieve the goal .
It 's also boring .
Worse yet , it does n't give the player anything interesting to do .
Even if you roleplay telling the lie ( and use something like a Virtual Roll ) you ’re still just saying what you want the person to believe ( “ these are n’t the droids you ’re looking for … ” ) and then rolling for it .
How interesting is that ?
Resolving a direct lie with a die roll also reduces the would - be victim to a ( literally ) two - dimensional caricature : they either believe the lie or they do n’t .
Forget about a nuanced or interesting reaction based on their personality .
It ’s a litmus test , not roleplaying .
Laying a Foundation of Deceit
So what if we take that option off the table ?
Let ’s arbitrarily say you ca n’t roll to make someone believe your main lie .
Instead come up with a different lie — a stepping stone — that will ( hopefully ) pave the way to convince them of your real lie , then roleplay from there .
I ca n’t roll to convince the chamberlain to give me an audience with the Duke , but I can roll to convince him I ’m a visiting dignitary from Carpathia and then try to persuade him to give me an audience because of that .
I ca n’t roll to make you think your partner betrayed you , but I can roll to convince you I saw him talking to Fez Mumbo last night at the casbah , and we all know who Fez Mumbo associates with …
I ca n’t roll to convince you the harmless butler is trying to murder you , but I can roll to convince you that he was a practicing physician in Berlin until he performed a series of ghastly experiments and was confined to an insane asylum .
After a clerical error led to his release he changed his name and fled all past associations , eventually adopting the guise of a humble man-servant .
If you watch closely you may notice the nervous tic he takes pains to conceal , doubtless a sign of his lingering psychosis …
What makes a good starting lie ?
– It ca n’t refer to or directly imply the main lie you ’re going for — that ’s too easy .
– It should make the situation more interesting and give everyone more to talk about .
A stepping stone lie generally creates more details than a direct lie , because you are trying to say some things just to insinuate something else .
There may be lots of unplanned side effects of those details as the game continues , but that ’s part of the fun ( “ You ’re a Carpathian noble ?
Death to the tyrant monarchy !
Free Carpathia ! ” ) .
– Making up stuff is good , but incorporating known facts is better .
If you know there ’s an army marching into town tomorrow , use it in the lie .
If you know the governor has a gambling problem , use it rather than making up a totally fictional character in your lie .
Adding lots of detail also tempts the fates by making it more likely the whole house of cards will come crashing down — the sign of a truly daring liar .
Kudos to you sir !
What About My Original Lie ?
Hopefully you ’ll never roll for the main lie at all .
Once the stepping stone lie is accepted , the situation should take on a life of its own and reactions will fall into place from roleplaying .
By coming up with a stepping stone lie , you are really making up details that you think would make the person believe what you wanted them to believe in the first place .
What would it take to make a person think the butler was out to kill them ?
They ’d have to think the butler was a very different person than they thought , and so on .
You ’re making the logic of your lie explicit , making it easier for anyone else to figure out how their character ( or NPC ) would react to it .
You do n’t have to use this technique for every lie — save it for the ones that you want to play out as part of the plot .
The juicy bits .
On the other hand if you use it for small lies you may find all those fictitious details chasing you around as the game goes on ( “ But you told me you were with the bishop last night ! ” ) .
Which is awesome trouble to be in .
Sound of silence ( Image : Viktor Drachev / AFP / Getty Images )
IS A sound only a sound if someone hears it ?
Apparently not .
Silent videos that merely imply sound – such as of someone playing a musical instrument – still get processed by auditory regions of the brain .
Kaspar Meyer at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and colleagues showed eight volunteers nine silent video clips that implied sound , including people playing violins , a dog howling and chainsaws cutting into trees .
As they watched , their brains were scanned using functional MRI .
Each type of implied sound created a unique pattern of brain activity in …
You 're not guilty of rape :
Those skinny jeans were too tight to remove by yourself , jury rules
Tight - fitting : Skinny jeans like those worn by the alleged rape victim
A man was acquitted of rape today after a jury agreed his victim could not have been sexually assaulted while wearing skinny jeans .
Nicholas Gonzales , 23 , told a court in Australia that sex with the 24 - year - old woman was consensual , despite her claim he had ripped off her size six skinny jeans before the attack .
The Sydney jury sent a note to the judge during the trial asking for more information about ' how exactly Nick took off her jeans ' .
The note from a jury member added : ' I doubt those kind of jeans can be removed without any sort of collaboration . '
The not guilty finding follows two other courts - in Seoul and Italy - dealing with the question of whether a woman wearing the tight - fitting jeans can be raped .
In the Seoul case in 2008 , the court overturned a seven - year sentence of a man convicted of raping a woman wearing skinny jeans .
But in the same year an Italian court upheld a rape conviction , ruling that ' jeans can not be compared to any type of chastity belt . '
Mr Gonzales , the Sydney court was told , had met his victim for drinks in April 2008 before going to his house to listen to music .
The woman said they had gone upstairs to his room so he could play his drums - but he had pushed her onto the bed and lay on top of her .
' I struggled to try to get up for a while and then he undid my jeans and he pulled them off , ' she said , before adding that she was then raped .
Questioned by defence lawyer Paul Hogan , the woman said she weighed 42 kilograms ( 6.6 stone ) and did not find it difficult to squeeze in and out of her jeans .
Mr Hogan said : ' I 'm suggesting it 's difficult for skinny jeans to be taken off by someone else unless the wearer 's assisting , collaborating , consenting . '
' Ii would disagree , ' the woman replied .
Miss Veronica Wensing , chairwoman of the National Association of Services Against Sexual Assault , told the Sydney Morning Herald that a woman 's outfit should not be an issue in alleged rapes .
' Any piece of clothing can be removed with force , ' she said .

Denmark is one of the largest exporters of pork in the world .
The United States has an effective model in Denmark to reduce antibiotic resistance caused in part by the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production .
Using predominantly an industrialized system , the Danes produce more than 26 million hogs each year and sell nearly 90 percent of its pork to nations around the globe .
In 1998 , Denmark became one of the first countries proactively seeking to reduce the growing human health threat of antibiotic resistance by phasing out the routine use of antibiotics in healthy food animals , a practice that continues in the United States .

2010 Mazda6 – Click above for high - res image gallery
As Americans , we typically view Canadians as our friendly neighbors to the north .
So friendly are they , in fact , that it seems unimaginable that one would do anything as vile as , say , sell a woman with reduced mental capacity a used Mazda at a 60 - percent markup over new .
Unfortunately , that 's exactly what Madeline Leonard claims happened to her when she visited an Orangeville , Ontario dealership Leonard brought her 2004 Mazda in to have its tires replaced , and somehow wound up being talked into purchasing a 2010 Mazda6 demo with around 3,700 miles on the odometer .
To make matters worse , the car 's final price tag totaled around $ 66,000 CAD with taxes and numerous upsells .
Among other things , the salesman convinced Leonard that she needed extras like stain guard , rust protection and window etching .
While the Mazda6 carries an MSRP of $ 39,969 CAD , the Orangeville dealership had priced the car at $ 45,846 CAD Despite being unemployed and living on a fixed income that nets her under $ 2,000 CAD per month , the dealership financed Leonard with an eight - year loan that will end up costing her an additional $ 16,000 CAD .
The Orangeville dealer currently has a D+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and faces changes from the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council of engaging in unfair practice by making an unconscionable representation .
Thanks for the tips , everyone !
Posted by John , April 2nd , 2010 - under Jobs , Katy Gallagher , Wage cuts .
Tags : ACT politics
Katy Gallagher , the ‘ leftwing ’ ACT Treasurer , has offered public servants pay increases of 4.75 % over two years , 2.25 % in the first year and 2.5 % in the following one .
The Reserve Bank predicts inflation ( both core and headline ) this year will be 2.5 % and a little more in 2011 .
In other words the Government ’s revised pay offer is actually a real pay cut of a bit under one percent .
That ’s how much this left - influenced Stanhope Labor Government thinks of its staff .
‘ But we ca n’t afford any more ’ squawks Gallagher in the tradition of all conservative politicians .
‘ Anything more and we ’ll have to cut jobs ’ says the Irony Lady , Canberra ’s own version of Margaret Thatcher .
Actually , Canberra Labor is already cutting jobs with its recruitment freeze .
This means , assuming separations are running at 5 % per annum , that the remaining staff are doing that extra work – enough justification on its own for the Unions ACT claim of 4 and 4.5 percent over two years .
Add in a local ‘ efficiency ” dividend of 0.5 % per annum and the only result Labor is offering its employees is working harder for less .
Factor in inflation and the claim of the union bureaucrats for 8.5 % over two years looks , typically , very miserly indeed .
The Community and Public Sector Union has already broken ranks and ‘ moderated ’ its claim to 3 % and 3.25 % over the next two years .
No doubt that ’s a consequence of the great and clearly successful strategy of the CPSU affiliating with the ALP around the country .
The only beneficiary of this so far appears to have been former National Secretary of the CPSU Stephen Jones who has been given a nice little sinecure in federal parliament for keeping industrial peace , forcing his members to accept the calamities that flow from the Federal efficiency dividend and delivering meagre wage outcomes for public servants .
Like all conservatives , the ACT Government wants to make its workforce pay for the global financial crisis .
Workers did n’t cause the crisis ; we should n’t pay for it .
ACT Labor wants to strangle its public service to cut costs .
There is only one way public servants here can win a real wage increase and defeat Gallagher ’s threat of job losses .
A strike of public servants that stops all services ( and calling on other unions like the nurses , teachers and bus drivers to join in solidarity ) is the only way forward .
Given the pussy cats who currently run most of the unions in Canberra wo n’t do that , it means ordinary members are going to have to regain control of their unions and call mass meetings to vote on such action .

At approximately 12.15 pm on 9 th May , two representatives of the Irish newspaper , The Sovereign Independent entered The Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin , Ireland , where the latest meeting of the Trilateral Commission was taking place and confronted David Rockefeller at his dinner table .
We unassumingly entered the reception area of the hotel and proceeded through the lobby to the seating and dining area at the back of the premises where we sat down and ordered coffee .
There was a table immediately behind us which was set up for lunch for 6 people .
We had a few copies of our newspaper with us and discussed posting a few at reception to Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller when to my utter surprise I noticed David Rockefeller ’s bodyguard walking in my direction .
Without acting suspicious I then observed the trademark walking stick behind the bodyguard and David Rockefeller was suddenly walking past us and took the seat at the table set for lunch directly
behind us .
We immediately decided that we could n’t miss this opportunity to confront the evil sitting in our midst and to our complete surprise were given the opportunity when the bodyguard appeared to leave the room .
With a few deep breaths we both rose and confronted David Rockefeller at his dinner table in front of his guests with the words .
“ Mr. Rockefeller , you will never get your New World Order .
We are not your slaves ; we are not your slaves ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The room fell into complete silence as our words reverberated all the way through to the reception area with the stunned looks on Rockefeller ’s guest ’s faces evident in the footage .
Rockefeller had a look of complete shock on his face as I leant over him and placed a copy of The Sovereign Independent right in front of him on his table taking
care not to touch him in any way or to disturb anything on his table .
We calmly turned away as the bodyguard , clearly not knowing that we had caused the disturbance , ran past us to get to Rockefeller .
We walked the approximately 40 m to the front entrance , down the drive past the
attending police officers and onto the street ,
Unfortunately due to the risk of our phone being taken from us as we were filming the video is a bit shaky and Rockefeller can only be seen briefly at the end , almost in silohette , although , anyone who knows what
he looks like should clearly recognise him .
He is only in the last few frames of the video on the far left .
We ’d been there the previous day with Jim Tucker , holding a peaceful protest , outside the gates with a number of other groups which had gone well .
Hundreds of copies of the newspaper were handed to passersby who
had wanted to know what was going on .
There had also been an attempt to have Henry Kissinger arrested under an arrest warrant issued by the Spanish authorities which was , as far as was known , still valid .
This evidence was presented to the police
officers on duty and recorded .
This matter is currently ongoing with visits to the Spanish embassy in Dublin being made this morning , Monday 10 th May .

Comment on this article

CNN Medical Producer
When men show up at the pharmacy to pick up prescription drugs for sex problems , they have several options .
Viagra . Cialis .
Levitra .
That has n’t been the case for women with similar problems .
But a Food and Drug Administration panel next month will debate approving a pill that could bring on the demise of this double standard .
The drug , called flibanserin , has been developed to boost women ’s libido .
“ The most common sexual problem for women is low desire , ” says Sheryl Kingsberg , a clinical psychologist with University Hospitals in Cleveland , Ohio .
“ These women are really distressed by it . ”
The German drug company Boehringer Ingelheim developed flibanserin as an antidepressant .
The drug did n’t work as a treatment for depression , but it did produce a surprising libido - enhancing side effect in some women .
“ There are millions of women who have a sexual life that is problematic for them , ” says Michael Sand , the company ’s director of clinical research on flibanserin .
According Sand , women taking flibanserin experience an increase in sexual desire and satisfying sexual activity and a decrease in emotional distress .
If the FDA approves flibanserin , Kingsberg says , the drug will be a game changer .
“ If nothing else , it 's going to open the door to women knowing that they 're entitled to good quality sexual health .
That it 's not just for men anymore , ” says Kingsberg , who has been a paid consultant for the company and for other developers of libido - enhancing drugs .
Boehringer Ingelheim plans to discuss its findings on flibanserin with the FDA on June 18 .
Next week on CNN , Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen will explore female libido and what ’s available now to help restore a lagging sex drive .

Thanks to lots of help from Ben Cotton and Jordan Sissel , I ’ve finally managed to get some RPMs built .
This is a Good Thing ( tm ) .
The reason that it ’s good is because once I have RPMs of the various software that I need to install , I can create a local ( internal ) yum repository .
And that is a Very Good Thing ( tm ) .
I mentioned it briefly a while back , but I ’ve been working with puppet , and installing things through the puppet fileserver is miserable .
However , I can specify additional repositories for my machines using puppet , AND I can specify that packages are installed .
Combine those two , and you ’ve got a powerful combination for getting software installed where it needs to be .
I had my first success last night , installing a custom - packaged JVM .
Honestly , after figuring out the spec file , the repo is simple .
All you need to create a repo is a directory accessible by web browser .
For instance , on the host that I ’m using to build my RPMs , I made ~/public_html / repo .
Inside that , I created i386 , x64 , and noarch subdirectories .
At this point , you need to toss the RPMs that you ’ve made into the proper directories , then run “ createrepo ~/public_html/repo/noarch ” , for instance , and voila !
Instant repo .
On the machine that you want to have talking to that repository , go into /etc/yum.repos.d/ and create “ my-internal.repo ” ( or whatever you want to name it ) , and put lines equivalent to the following
[ Internal - Repository ]
name =Matt ’s Internal yum repository of doom
baseurl=http://webserver/~msimmons/repo/noarch
gpgcheck=0
At this point , you can do “ yum search ” and a package name that you ’ve put in your repository , and it ’ll find it .

How awesome is that ?
Pretty awesome , in my opinion .
Of course , there are more uses for this than just installing customized software .
You can also use it to create a local mirror of a repository .
This is useful if you have a bunch of machines on which the software needs updated , but you do n’t want to kill your network bandwidth by having everyone go talk to a remote repo at the same time .
Instead , you mirror the remote repo to your internal repo , then replace the default yum repo with your internal repo .
Problem solved !
This use case does have the added benefit of your being able to have finely grained control of which software packages make it onto your machines , as well .
It ’s not hard to conceive of a “ testing ” repo , where you run packages to make sure they do n’t blow up your configs , and after having proven themselves , get moved to the “ production ” repo .
Also , implementing something like this can absolve you of the necessity to use extra repositories like EPEL , which may contain the software you want to install , but also contain other packages that might conflict with another configured repo package .
I can see myself really leveraging this in the future .
It ’s too powerful of a tool not to use .
I wish I would have learned about it sooner , but I did n’t , so I ’m sharing it in the hopes that someone else is inspired to check it out and start implementing it too .
Do you use an internal repo ?
Why or why not ?
Also , if you do have a repo , what tips can you give us on how to best use it ?

Comes now the case of The Lady With Irritable Bowels vs. ESPN , in which a longtime employee of the Worldwide Leader , beset by looming layoffs and a spastic colon , finds herself pooping repeatedly in an office garbage can .
It 'll break your heart .

We 'll call the plaintiff Jane Doe .
In the lawsuit , filed earlier this month in New Britain , Conn. , Superior Court , Jane says she was hired in 1980 as one of ESPN 's original employees , and she worked in Bristol until the spring of last year .
( For her sake , we wo n't say in what capacity . )
For almost as long , she received treatment for an uncomfortable disorder that I 'll leave to her lawsuit to describe :

This was a stressful time to work at ESPN .
Layoffs were on the horizon , and employees labored in the shadow of George Bodenheimer 's swinging axe .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The situation was doubly bad for Jane .

Her doctor had retired , and according to the lawsuit , Jane could n't get an appointment with a new one for several weeks .
Meantime , in March of last year , she began to experience " severe cramping . "
And as her suit puts it : " [ W ] henever she had moments of fear , she needed to use the bathroom immediately . "

To clarify : Jane 's symptoms — perhaps compounded by the stress of the workplace — would so overwhelm her that she would have to dash into a meeting room , lock the door , crap in a garbage can , double - bag it , and then dispose of her own waste .
As it happens , this is also how ESPN makes First Take .
Jane told no one , for perfectly understandable reasons .
She had scheduled an appointment with a doctor for the last week of March , and one assumes that at this point , she thought she was in the clear .
Not so fast , my friend .

Yes , Jane had been caught on camera .
She explained to Hrisko that she was not disgruntled , merely incontinent — that in fact she had a medical condition but no medication .
Jane was suspended one week without pay .
According to the lawsuit , the personnel director promised to fight for her .
Alas ...

Jane is now suing for damages in excess of $ 15,000 , claiming that ESPN violated the state 's Fair Employment Practices Act .
" The suit is without merit , " an ESPN spokesman says , " and she was dismissed for misconduct . "
That may well be , but however the court decides , ESPN has already lost .
The company has created in Jane a martyr , either to her own infirmities or to the spirit of honorable protest .
And above all , Jane has provided an enduring metaphor for what her former employer delivers to us on a daily basis : a large sack of its own crap .

The car hit a tree and landed in a plunge pool
A man and woman had an " incredible " and " mind - boggling " escape when their sports car fell 270 ft ( 82 m ) down a ravine in Powys , say rescuers .
The BMW car hit a tree and bounced at least twice to land on all four wheels in a plunge pool .
The pair , in their 50s , were airlifted near Dylife , on the road between Machynlleth and Llanidloes .
Mark Jones , of Brecon Mountain Rescue team , said : " If you saw that in a film you would think it was far - fetched . "
The alert was raised at around 1140 BST after a crash involving two vehicles , one of which left the road .
In 25 years in mountain rescue , I have never seen anything like this and find it incredible that anyone survived this crash Mark Jones , Team leader , Brecon Mountain Rescue Team
Around 25 firefighters from Mid and West Wales Fire Service were involved in the operation to reach the couple .
Mr Jones said his team arrived as the casualties , a man and a woman , were being hoisted into the rescue helicopter which was hovering below the level of the road from which the car had crashed .
He calculated the distance car plunged on its way down
He said : " I have never seen anything like it .
The word ' awesome ' is overused .
" If you looked at the distance that they have fallen , you would not think there was any chance they would survive .
" They mounted the crash barrier and through a series of clipping trees and exactly the right bit of ground , they have landed in a little pool in a stream at the bottom of the cliff .
" It landed on all four wheels in just the right place - six feet either side and they would not have survived .
" It was absolutely mind - boggling how they pulled it off .

The incident happened near Dylife , Powys
" As I understand it , the expectation was to go down there and just find a couple of bodies .
" In 25 years in mountain rescue , I have never seen anything like this and find it incredible that anyone survived this crash , let alone that they were relatively unhurt . "
The pair managed to free themselves and were helped by fire crews before an RAF helicopter winched them to safety and flew them to hospital .
Rescuers gave first aid at the scene .
Brecon Mountain Rescue
Team ensured the rescuers made their way back up the ravine safely .
The RAF Valley crew said the couple had been " very lucky " .
Although the man had head and shoulder injuries , he was not believed to be seriously hurt .
The woman had slight injuries and was also airlifted to hospital in Bangor .
Las Vegas can’t handle another era of unimpeded growth , study says

Beyond the Sun Sonoran Institute
Environmentalists and Southern Nevada ’s water chief Pat Mulroy finally agree on at least one point .
A report by the Sonoran Institute , an Arizona - based nonprofit think tank , says that if the Las Vegas Valley ’s population grows to capacity using the Bureau of Land Management acreage designated for development , even the most stringent water conservation measures wo n’t be enough to ensure that everyone has enough H2O .
Filling in the remaining 27,000 acres using today ’s zoning and planning rules would allow about a half - million more people to call the valley home .
The one big problem :
There ’s not enough water for all of them .
The Sonoran Institute says that would remain true even if the valley adopted measures such as banning residential lawns and requiring low - flow fixtures indoors .
In other words , as Mulroy is fond of saying :
We ca n’t conserve our way out of our water problem .
But Mulroy and the institute report , which was funded by the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada and the Toiyabe chapter of the Sierra Club , part ways on what the answer is .
For more than two decades , Mulroy has pushed for a pipeline that would divert up to 170,000 acre - feet of water from eastern Nevada to support growth in Lincoln County and the Las Vegas Valley .
The report echoes what environmentalists have been arguing for years , that instead of spending billions on a pipeline that could drain rural basins , kill off wildlife and ruin the rural ranching and tourism economy , the valley should reduce the amount of water it needs in the future by limiting growth .
And that ’s really at the heart of this report .
The valley could grow again .
It could eventually fill the vacant homes and build a heck of a lot more , and it could construct a 300 - mile pipeline to suck water out of eastern Nevada to support that .
But will that make a better Las Vegas ?
The unimpeded growth of the past two decades has seriously harmed Las Vegas economically and ecologically , the report argues .
And unless government takes action now , during the lull , the planning mistakes of the past 20 years could create an even more unsustainable future .
The status quo — fast - paced development and reliance on two industries , hospitality and construction — made the area economically vulnerable .
The recessionary result has been devastating .
The silver lining of the Great Recession is that it gives the community time to re-evaluate what it wants to be , says Clark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani , who supports the report ’s findings .
“ I do n’t think there ’s much resistance to at least having the conversation about what ’s the next step for the recovery of the valley , ” she says .
“ Now we should be stepping back and asking , ‘ Is that what we want ?
Is it a product that ’s going to attract people here and keep people here ? ’
Now we can ask , ‘ What do we want the valley to look like ? ’
We did n’t have time before because of the growth boom . ”
But to get away from Las Vegas ’ old pattern , the region will need to cultivate new , more stable industries such as health care and renewable energy , both of which the report says could grow if the community invested heavily in education and focused on using available land and empty office parks to build these industries .
The current planning system is n’t set up to do this , the report says .
At the report ’s core is a recommendation to create an overarching planning body with the authority and mission of making the valley more economically , socially and environmentally sustainable .
It would have to take into account , on any proposed master plan or project in the valley : energy , water , air pollution , transportation , economic diversification and the environment .
In short , it would be faced with accepting something Las Vegas has defied since its inception — the city is in the desert .
The report says existing coalitions and commissions do n’t have the authority or inclination to do this .
But Giunchigliani thinks the main change the report says is needed to save Las Vegas is possible under the current system .
She plans to take the report to the Southern Nevada Regional Planning Coalition .
She said the report ’s recommendation to consolidate planning under one body might eventually be achieved , but not all at once .
The commissioner said change will have to come in a piecemeal fashion .
“ That , I think , is the best way to approach this , ” Giunchigliani said .
“ I think there ’s an opportunity here .
I do n’t think we ’ll see the type of resistance here that you would have seen when everyone was depending on growth . ”
Life 's a beach !
Clint Dempsey says his future - and Fulham's - is written in the sand
Clint Dempsey does n’t deal in cliches .
Life , as he keeps saying , is too short to waste words .
But he uses an analogy to describe how he views his place in the world .
The Fulham and USA star leans forward , suddenly animated , and his normally relaxed Texan drawl is injected with urgency .
He acts out his point , jabbing out first his left fist and then his right one , which bears a nasty cut and a number of stitches , the result of a ‘ stupid ’ accident and why the 27 - year - old American has been sporting a bandage on his wrist of late .
Grains of time : Dempsey 's season is ending on a high with Fulham and the USA
‘ You grab some sand and put it in your hand , ’ he says .
‘ That ’s all the people who want to play the game .
‘ Then , you drop the sand and that ’s all the people who make it to the next level .
‘ Then you pat your hand and there are only a few left .
And they ’re the ones who make it in the world .
‘ That ’s how I view it .
I ’m just someone who wants to make it in the world , just trying to take care of my family and give them a good life and a better life than I had . ’
When we meet at Fulham ’s Motspur Park training ground in Surrey , Dempsey is two days away from becoming the first American to play in a major European final .
‘ I do n’t like looking at things like that , ’ he says .
‘ I ’m just a player trying to go out and be the best that I can be .
‘ There are players from all over the world who have their goals and dreams to do something .
I know if I am the first American , I wo n’t be the last . ’
It has been a remarkable , 10 - month , 18 - game and 20,000 - mile journey for Fulham .
To adapt Dempsey ’s analogy , from the 192 grains of sand — teams — that started the competition last July there are now just two left .
Be the best : Dempsey 's goal for Fulham against Juventus encapsulates the American 's attitude towards the game
If you ’re starting to think this engaging , articulate American is spouting formulaic nonsense from a Nike advert , think again .
Dempsey has starred in campaigns for the sportswear giant , but his commercial was hardly orthodox .
Filmed before the 2006 World Cup , it showed the forward , nicknamed ‘ Deuce ’ , rapping on the song Do n’t Tread on Me alongside fellow Texans XO and Big Hawk .
Poignantly , at Dempsey ’s instruction the video was dedicated to his older sister , Jennifer , who died suddenly in November 1995 from a brain aneurism .
She was just 16 .
Dempsey was 12 .
His early interest in football ( he never calls it soccer ) had been sacrificed so that his parents , Aubrey and Debbie , could channel their limited resources into Jennifer ’s burgeoning tennis career .
VIDEO : Deuce and Don't Tread
But after her death Dempsey resumed the three - hour trips from the family ’s trailer in the back of his grandparents ’ garden in Nacogdoches , Texas , to Dallas , where the nearest football club , Longhorns , were based .
After three years at Furman University in South Carolina came a move to Major League Soccer club New England Revolution in 2004 , where Dempsey was voted MLS Rookie of the Year .
His £ 1.5 million move to Fulham followed in January 2007 .
It has been some journey .
Dempsey said : ‘ I just go out and play .
All you can really control is what you do on the field and try to be the best that you can be .
That ’s kind of what I ’ve done my whole life .
‘ You know that you ’re having to fight stereotypes , coming from America .
I ’m coming from a place where the game really was n’t respected .
African dream : Dempsey admits football is n't respected in America - progress at the World Cup would change that
‘ When I go back it will be good if there ’s an American who comes along and says , “ I was inspired by this player ” .
‘ But if it all ended I ’d be happy because I ’ve accomplished my dreams .
That ’s why I am where I am today – hopefully , in a Europa League final . ’
For Fulham , this is not just another European final .
Like Dempsey , they have never been here before .
They are aware that the club are making history and it makes the players relish it even more , he says .
The impact made by Roy Hodgson , the League Managers ’ Association manager of the year , has also been ‘ huge ’ since his arrival in December 2007 .
Dempsey said : ‘ The thing that I enjoy most about Roy is that he ’s given us the confidence to play .
We ’re not bypassing the midfield and just kicking it up all the way to the top all the time .
‘ For me , that ’s the style I fell in love with : getting the ball down , people running off the ball for each other , making movements , trying to keep the ball and build in attack .
‘ That ’s why I fell in love with the game and I ’m glad I ’m able to be in a team that plays with that style . ’
Tonight ’s final will not be the end of Dempsey ’s season .
There is still the small matter of the World Cup and that Group C opener , England v USA , in Rustenburg on June 12 .
‘ It ’s exciting , ’ he said .
‘ To do well in the competition you ’ve got to beat good teams so it ’s going to be a tough game but we still think it ’s a group we can advance from .
Once you do that , anything can happen . ’
The USA scraped through qualifying in the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa , then beat Spain 2 - 0 and were 2 - 0 up against Brazil in the final before losing 3 - 2 .
Despite the ultimate disappointment , Dempsey enjoyed the experience of playing in South Africa , particularly the feeling that football can somehow be a force for good in the country .
He did n’t mind the vuvuzelas , either .
Dempsey said : ‘ When you play in Mexico they have horns and it ’s a similar sound .
It shows their culture and how they cheer for sport .
‘ It was good to see the passion people had ; the excitement around the game .
You see people living in conditions that are pretty tough and they are still so positive .
It lets you know what ’s really important in life .
‘ Hopefully it ’ll be a tournament that ’s going to be a good experience for all and not something marked with tragedy , like the Africa Cup of Nations . ’
Badge of honour : Dempsey is proud to represent his country but safety fears mean his wife and child wont be in South Africa
Dempsey ’s parents and his older brother Ryan will be in South Africa to watch him in his second World Cup .
But his wife Bethany , 26 , an educational psychologist , and their one - year - old daughter Elyse will stay at home .
‘ Even though there ’s security you still worry about the safety of your wife and daughter , ’ Dempsey said .
‘ The world we live in today , you do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
‘ Especially being an American , you ’re always a target .
We ’re not really loved that much around the world , for political reasons .
It is kind of scary when you go to these countries and you ’ve got to know what to expect .
‘ When I was in the Under 20 World Cup ( in 2003 ) in the United Arab Emirates , we had helicopters following us and six cars in front of us , six cars behind us .
It was after 9/11 .
If we do well , then great , if we do n’t , then that ’s what it was .
The most important thing is everybody makes it home safely . ’
The increasingly harsh asylum seeker policy of the Opposition has come as no surprise .
In competing for votes , the government and the Opposition are rivals for policies aimed at electoral protection rather than sound public policy based on compassion .
Measures designed to convince the unwary public that deterrence is a valued goal , fail in both intent and in matters of justice and human rights .
By announcing its decision to reverse some of the more positive reforms of the Rudd government , we are seeing in Tony Abbott a resolve to send a message to asylum seekers and people smugglers that is based on irrationality and deception .
The policies have been formulated with an unforgiveable harshness of heart .
The Opposition undoubtedly has access to evidence that the Howard government policies had serious outcomes for both asylum seeker wellbeing and for the reputation of the nation .
By continuing to refer to asylum seekers as illegal entrants , there is reinforcement of an ideological claim that it is illegitimate to seek asylum on our shores .
As the Refugee Council of Australia points out , it is not a crime to enter Australia without a visa for the purpose of seeking asylum .
Among the most serious of the announced policy scourges is the proposal to re-introduce the cruel and inhumane Temporary Protection Visa ( TPV ) that was in place from 1999 to 2008 .
The TPV , by discarding the fundamental rights owed to refugees , sends a signal that they are not worthy of our full protection .
Studies have shown that people in this situation were cast as second rate refugees and faced insecurity about their futures .
Poor mental health outcomes arising from prolonged detention were exacerbated by ongoing uncertainty .
The prohibition of family reunion was perhaps the utmost form of suffering , with men separated from their wives and children for extended periods of time while they remained in visa limbo .
In re-introducing this policy I am convinced that Opposition immigration spokesperson Scott Morrison has never sat , as I and other advocates have done , with people who grieved for the children they were unable to hug during the years of enforced separation .
The Opposition is turning a blind eye to the prospect that the deterrence objective may have the opposite effect , and that women and children are likely to take boat journeys to Australia as the only means of family reunion available to them .
The loss of the lives of 142 women and 146 children on the SIEV X vessel in 2001 should have been a wake - up call about the perils of this visa , but deterrence determination persisted .
It should be mandatory for all politicians to visit the SIEV X memorial in Canberra as a reminder of this tragedy .
The work for benefits notion is another in the litany of flawed policy directions .
This provision serves little purpose other than to demonise asylum seekers by portraying them as aspiring welfare recipients .
This is far from the truth as stories abound of how refugees contribute productively to Australian society when given the opportunity to work and to be self - sufficient .
Research on TPVs demonstrates that employers were reluctant to hire people with uncertain visas and this had a detrimental effect on TPV holders , creating not only feelings of worthlessness but the lack of capacity to support themselves and their families in Australia or abroad .
We are yet to hear the Opposition announce where it intends to seek new offshore solutions .
If the Coalition gains political power , it will be seen internationally as a human rights pariah through this further betrayal of our human rights responsibilities .
The cost alone of offshore processing is an illogical response to boat arrivals .
Author Susan Metcalfe who has considerable experience of previous offshore processing on Nauru , reminds us that the Pacific Solution was replete with stories of mental illness , dependence on medication and acts of self harm and hunger strikes arising from despair .
Surely the Opposition has heard the stories of desperate people fleeing persecution .
If it has not , then there are many lawyers , mental health professionals and human rights advocates who can provide details .
People fleeing harsh regimes will not be scared away by political posturing .
It is a credit to those who care about our shared humanity that the proposed changes are now under the intense scrutiny of refugee advocates and dissenters within Abbott 's own party .
It is these human rights champions who will prosper when future generations look back on the travesty of justice occurring in our name .

Hi Cody ,
as you wanted to have a mail with all my concerns about client - side - window - decorations ( CSD ) , here is a very long mail presenting all my concerns what will not be possible any more with CSD and why I think that these particular features will be impossible .
The list is based on KWin ’s current feature set .
Please see this mail as an offer to help .
I could also just say “ what do I care ?
We wo n’t support it in KDE , so let them destroy their desktop if they want . ”
But I do care .
I do not want to blame your work , but I fear that you just do n’t see the disadvantages and that CSD will be pushed onto the users without considering all pros and cons .
That ’s why I decided to CC the Ayatana mailinglist and publish this letter as an open letter on my blog .
CSD is a topic that is important for every user and nothing we should discuss in a small group .
As you probably have noticed I oppose the introduction of CSD .
I think they will have more disadvantages than benefits to the user .
In fact I do not see any pro argument for CSD .
All the pros I found during hours of research on some wiki pages , GNOME
Shell design documents , blog posts , etc. do not give one valid reason .
In fact most of the pro arguments are already present in KWin .
I will refer to the arguments for CSD again at the end of my mail .
If there are any other pro arguments not recorded on the Wiki page , please publish them .
Consistent window decorations :
This in fact is my greatest doubt .
The current situation is that all windows have the same window decoration .
For CSD to work applications have to be changed to support them .
This will render the changed applications using CSD while all other applications are decorated by the window manager .
I think it is impossible to have the same behavior for both CSD and wm decos .
I think there are lots of legacy applications which cannot be changed , for example Amarok 1.4 which is still used by many users even in GNOME .
I doubt you will be able to change Qt 3 to use CSD .
My bigger concern is that we will end up with applications shipping their own style and doing their own kind of decorations .
So we end up with situations like one window has buttons on left , one on the right , one in order close , maximize , minimize , the other in close , minimize , maximize , etc .
Why do I have this concern ?
Well let ’s just look on the Microsoft Windows desktop to see what proprietary applications tend to do when they get the chance to influence the decorations .
I expect the same thing to happen on free desktops as we already have such style issues with proprietary applications .
For example Google Earth and Opera both do not use the default Qt style but ship their own one .
In case of Google Earth it ’s even bundled with an own Qt copy so you cannot even overwrite the setting .
I also expect that “ free ” software will do such issues – to get a famous example : launch Chromium in Ubuntu Lucid .
It has the decoration handles on the wrong side .
And for the user experience this is very bad .
Now I want to explain why it is impossible to have consistent decoration handling between CSD and wm decos in the case of KWin.
KWin has a default button layout ( Menu , sticky on the left , ( help ) , minimize , maximize , explicit spacer , explicit spacer , close on the right ) , which is hardcoded into the source code .
The layout could change at any time if the KWin developers and the usability team decide that there is a more usable layout !
Each decoration plugin is allowed to overwrite the default button layout ( which is done by the default decoration Oxygen ) .
In case of my theme engine Aurorae each theme is allowed to overwrite the default layout .
However , that ’s not all – the user is allowed to customize the layout .
So to get it right CSD would have to check which decoration plugin is loaded and would have to know how the button order is defined .
As this layout is also hardcoded this is just impossible .
The CSD would have to guess KWin ’s default layout and check KWin ’s settings if the user has changed the layout .
I doubt you want to add KConfig support to GTK CSD .
The whole situation becomes more complicated if a user is using Compiz in KDE .
In that case the CSD would have to check if kde - window - decorator is used , which would require to parse the KWin settings or to read Emerald or whatever .
Let ’s just forget about other window managers as the point is already obvious : a client - side - decorated window cannot know how the layout of decoration buttons in the window manager decorations is set .
In order to get CSD working properly all windows would have to use CSD and as said before this is just impossible due to legacy applications .
There is one more important thing to know : KWin guarantees binary compatibility for the decoration API for the lifetime of KDE platform 4 .
We cannot change the decoration API in order to support CSD without breaking BC and all decorations !
: This in fact is my greatest doubt .
The current situation is that all windows have the same window decoration .
For CSD to work applications have to be changed to support them .
This will render the changed applications using CSD while all other applications are decorated by the window manager .
I think it is impossible to have the same behavior for both CSD and wm decos .
I think there are lots of legacy applications which cannot be changed , for example Amarok 1.4 which is still used by many users even in GNOME .

And for the user experience this is very bad .
Closing hung applications :
Currently there is an easy way to close a hung application .
You click the close button in the decoration and the window manager will notice that the application does not response any more and will offer to forcefully close the window .
With CSD this is impossible .
The close button is part of the hung application and so the click event cannot be recognized .
I do not expect users to know shortcuts like ctrl+alt+esc to forcefully close a window and so they will be stuck with an unresponsive application .
In case the application is caught in an endless loop this would render the system unusable and an unexperienced user has only one choice : force the system to reboot by the power switch .

Consistent user actions between decoration and task manager : KDE keeps the context menu of the decoration and the tasks applet in sync .
It uses the same order of options , the same look &feel and the same wording .
If a change is required it has to be manually submitted to both menus .
I ca n’t see how a non-KDE application wants to be in sync with KDE ’s context menu .
I do n’t think I have to mention that the context menus are currently all using a Qt style .
As we all know GTK does not look like Qt in KDE .
So there will be a visual inconsistency in context menus .
( Seems that I mentioned it nevertheless )
Btw different window managers offer a different set of features .
So one menu for all window managers just does n’t work .

User actions menu in general :
This brings us to the next topic :
What happens in response to right clicking a CSD .
KWin by default shows the user actions menu including KWin internal options like window tabbing ( if the decoration supports it ) , opacity and the option to configure the window behavior .
Will a CSD be able to populate KWin specific options ?
How do I access the window behavior settings from a client side decoration ?
What happens when I use the shortcut to show the menu ( alt+f3 ) which is handled by KWin ?
Why is it a different one for CSD , while it is the same for all other windows ?
Another case of inconsistent behavior .

One place to configure mouse actions :
Another point directly motivated by the one before : what actually happens if I left , right , middle click the decoration .
KWin provides completely configurable actions in the user interface .
I wanted to present all possible options but there are too many , so I just write down which different actions are supported : doubleclicking the decoration ( just titlebar , not border ) mouse wheel the decoration ( just titlebar , not border ) different settings for what happens when you left / right / middle click the decoration ( titlebar and border ) for active and for inactive window .
The settings include things like open context menu , place window to the back , raise window , start window tab dragging , etc. etc .
If you want a complete list of options please have a look on the settings .
I do not see how a CSD can know about what is configured in KWin .
This just has to result in inconsistent behavior and complains by users because right click opens the context menu and does not move the window to the back .
: Another point directly motivated by the one before : what actually happens if I left , right , middle click the decoration .
KWin provides completely configurable actions in the user interface .
I wanted to present all possible options but there are too many , so I just write down which different actions are supported : Different settings for the maximize button : KWin supports to configure the action which should be performed when left / middle / right click the maximize button : maximize horizontal , maximize vertical or maximize both .
This is an issue where I ask myself : will this be supported at all and of course the same as above : the CSD cannot know KWin ’s setting .

This is an issue where I ask myself : will this be supported at all and of course the same as above : the CSD cannot know KWin ’s setting .
Differentiating between window and decoration : KWin currently supports different actions when you click the window and the decoration .
E.g. it ’s possible to raise a window by clicking the titlebar , but clicking the window content will raise and activate it .
As there is no decoration provided by KWin any more this functionality would be lost completely .
Removing title bar actions means that many useful features are lost , like wheel on titlebar raises windows or changes opacity .
You do n’t want that functionality in the window as the window needs the wheel event to scroll the content .

Window Shading : window shading is a tricky operation for CSD and I do n’t see how you could get it working .
I just had a look at the KWin code and it seems like window shading requires wm decos .
The window get ’s unmapped and only the deco is shown .
I do n’t know how KWin would behave if the window is undecorated , but I think that window shading is not possible any more .
Even if it were possible we would have again a very inconsistent behavior as the decoration handling would switch from client - side to wm .
To this point I want to quote the NETWM spec :
Some desktop environments offer shading ( also known as rollup ) as an alternative to iconification .
A shaded window typically shows only the titlebar , the client window is hidden , thus shading is not useful for windows which are not decorated with a titlebar .

To this point I want to quote the NETWM spec : Adding additional buttons : KWin allows to add additional buttons to the decoration .
Our default decoration provides buttons like keep above , keep below and shade .
By default a sticky button is used .
Our default layout has more buttons than all the decoration themes provided by Ubuntu .
I am very concerned that CSD will not have the same set of buttons and that it is not possible to globally add / remove buttons as it is possible today .
The reasons why that is not possible have been presented in the fist topic .

Remote X - Clients :
If a session includes remote X - Clients using CSD these will use the GTK style of the remote system resulting in inconsistency .
Currently this works fine as remote clients are treated like every other client .

Shadows : A CSD window will not have a shadow provided by KWin .
Shadows are an important feature to distinguish the active from inactive windows .
As it is not obvious why we cannot provide shadows for CSD windows I have to explain how the shadow works .
Since 4.3 the decorations are able to paint shadows .
This is a KWin internal thing : the decoration provides a padding region and this region is internally ignored for things like window snapping and to ensure that the shadow is not clickable ( as the decoration is a widget this is important ) .
Currently Oxygen and Aurorae are the only default shipped decorations making use of this feature .
If a decoration does not provide it ’s own decoration the shadow effect will draw a shadow .
There is exactly one variant of shadow to suit them all .
And this is just impossible .
If you have a dark widget theme a dark shadow is a bad idea .
The shadow is a texture which is painted below the window texture .
This means if the window has an alpha channel the blending will be done to the shadow and not to the windows below which looks really bad .
Just search for images showing a translucent Konsole in KDE 4.x with x < 2 .
Now I still have n't mentioned why a CSD decoration wo n't have a shadow .
We see why it would be a bad idea ( as you want to have an alpha channel ) but there is more in it .
I assume that you want to have round corners in your decoration .
So you have to set a shape or your corners will be clickable ( bad idea ) .
If a window has a custom shape the shadow effect will not apply the shadow to the window as it does n't know the shape .
We could just paint the shadow but in most cases it would look really bad or we could find some tricky logic that looks where the window is painted and how to draw the perfect shadow .
We have n't found a solution to this problem during the last 2,5 years and I do not expect that we find a solution to this issue in the future .
It would require shaders so it is not an option which would work for all users and I think that the shadow inside the decorations is the better approach .
Oh and what we currently do to decorations cannot be done by windows as that requires changes in the NETWM protocol and in the window managers .
As you might guess I am not interested in spending time on adding stuff to KWin required to make CSD work ;-)

Tooltips : KWin has a setting to provide tooltips when hovering decoration buttons .
I do not see how this can be consistent between CSD and wm decos .
Obviously the tooltips wo n’t look the same as the one is GTK and the other is Qt. Furthermore I do n’t think that the titles of the tooltips can be the same and even if they were the same I do n’t think that they would be translated in the same way in all existing languages .
This is another case of inconsistency .

Obviously the tooltips wo n’t look the same as the one is GTK and the other is Qt. Furthermore I do n’t think that the titles of the tooltips can be the same and even if they were the same I do n’t think that they would be translated in the same way in all existing languages .
This is another case of inconsistency .
Netbook mode : KWin has a special netbook mode to hide the decoration for maximized windows when the netbook mode is chosen .
I do not see how a GTK CSD window can honor such a setting .

Accessibility : KWin provides globally customizable border sizes .
Some decorations ( Oxygen and Aurorae ) also provide customizable button sizes .
Both sizes are dependent on the decoration or in case of Aurorae from the theme .
So there is no way for a CSD to get the same border size .
I think accessibility is a very important feature .
In fact Aurorae allows to change two settings : border size and button size , everything else is defined in the theme .

Window Tabbing : KWin ’s window tabbing is part of the decoration API .
A window which does not have a decoration cannot be included in window tabs .
So it destroys a useful functionality .

Numbering in window title : KWin provides a feature to number the windows .
So if you have two windows foo , the second will be called foo < 2 > in the decoration .
This is specified in the _NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME hint , so in fact it is possible to implement this feature .

Forcefully adding buttons : KWin allows to add buttons to window decorations even if the window does not provide the action .
E.g. if a window is not closeable we can force it to be closeable by a window rule to get the button back .
My concern is that with CSD the application would not add the button again as it has in the internal logic that there is no close button for this window .
The same obviously applies for maximize button , etc. KWin allows to overwrite any of the settings a window might set , which is the right of a window manager .

Changing themes : KWin and also Metacity allows to change the themes for all window decorations at one place .
If we introduce CSD we have some applications having a wm themed decoration , some applications with a GTK themed decoration and some with a Qt themed decoration .
If we introduce CSD the current setting dialog is more than confusing and would have to be removed .
Btw I just want to mention that I rewrote the KWin decoration selection module for 4.5 .
More on the work going on in KWin regarding decorations later in this mail .

Probably much much more I just have not thought about yet or forgotten to mention in this list .
I think the point is obvious : we have a well established system and there have to be good reasons to change something so fundamentally to the window behavior .
This brings me to the next topic :
The pro arguments of CSD .
The point is : I do not know of one pro argument .
I thought a lot about why do they want CSD and all I can come up with is that you want RGBA windows , but this is no reason to go for CSD .
This is perfectly possible with KWin since 4.4 , so I do not see why you would want to go for CSD .
If there are other reasons please communicate them .
And please use this list as a starting point to step back and think about what you want to achieve and if CSD is the right approach to achieve it .
If all you want is RGBA it will be easier to extend Metacity to support it or ( in case of Canonical ) switch to a default window manager which supports it .
I assume that Ubuntu 10.10 will be shipped with Compiz 0.9 so you could get a window manager which supports both non-compositing and compositing and alpha in the decoration .
And I just want to mention that Ubuntu has another window manager in the main repository which supports all the required features , but I do n’t expect Ubuntu switching to KWin as the default window manager 🙂
So let ’s look again on the list of pro arguments on the GNOME wiki :
Fix issues with the non-reparenting window manager Compiz :
Not an issue any more as Compiz 0.9 is a reparenting window manager .
Nice this one is done
Have a good reason for RGBA :
As mentioned KWin supports this by extending the window decoration behind translucent content ( http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2009/11/window-decoration-behind-translucent-windows/).
So you could go for this approach .
Just as a note : KDE does not make use of this feature , but it is supported .
so not valid .
Possible performance improvements : please test if it is really an improvement .
Considering KWin ’s approach to RGBA decorations I do n’t think it is .
Just the idea that there could be improvements is not a valid argument .
single source for theming the application and decoration : that would be nice , but as my concerns in this mail show , the opposite is most likely true .
I love that idea , but could you please first fix GTK to use the Qt style in KDE environment ?
That would be nice from an integration point of view .
So not valid .
Get gtk+ working on Wayland : I do n’t see how Wayland can be an argument for CSD .
Could we consider Wayland as unimportant till it is looking like something is actually going on ?
I checked the commits in 2010 in the public git repository and well it looks like KWin has more commits per day .
It ’s nice that you think of the future , but please do n’t use it for argumentation .
So also not valid .
And that ’s the problem I have with CSD .
I have a very long list of issues , so to say the cons and there are no valid pro arguments .
I like innovation , but I completely dislike innovation for the sake of innovation .
I also dislike to break with existing solutions .
If we break existing solutions there has to be a good reason for it .
And here I am still missing the good reasons .
Now last but not least I want to present some of the work going on in KWin for decorations .
Decorations are currently the most actively developed part of KWin .
In 4.3 we added support for translucent window decorations , in 4.4 we added support to paint decorations behind translucent windows and we received window tabbing support .
Currently there is a very active development in our default decoration Oxygen and in my theme engine Aurorae .
I initially implemented Aurorae for 4.3 to have a decoration which makes use of translucency .
Since 4.4
Aurorae is part of KWin and I have spent much time on improving it for 4.5 .
So it is now based on the Qt Graphics View framework , it allows to place the decoration to the left or right to make better use of vertical screen space .
The theming support is improved , so it ’s possible to have one common background for a button group .
That ’s something the Canonical designers might like – in fact this feature is inspired by the brokeness of the new Ubuntu theme during the beta phase of Lucid 😉 I started to work on a designer application for Aurorae themes .
The decoration configuration module has been reworked and allows to directly install new themes for kde - look.org through GHNS .
I have some more ideas for Aurorae in 4.6 .
So I want to make the decoration auto - hiding for maximized windows to save more vertical space .
I am thinking about adding a special element for fullscreen applications to easily switch back to normal mode .
I plan to make Aurorae a common library which can be used not only in KWin but also directly in Compiz .
In fact the Aurorae code does not have a KWin dependency any more .
This was required to get the designer work and is also used to render the previews in the configuration module .
I think it would be a pity to abandon all this work and to replace it with something that is not on par from the feature side of view .
And AFAIK also in Metacity there is some work going on to design a new theme format .
So as expected this mail has been rather long and I think I missed probably have of the points I had in mind .
Thanks for taking the time to read it and thinking about if CSD are the right way to go .
If you have questions how to get your wished features to work with existing technology please do not hesitate to ask and I will try to help you .
I am sure the Compiz devs will also offer their help to get required features implemented .

I 'm trying to write some Python code that will establish an invisible relay between two TCP sockets .
My current technique is to set up two threads , each one reading and subsequently writing 1 kb of data at a time in a particular direction ( i.e. 1 thread for A to B , 1 thread for B to A ) .
This works for some applications and protocols , but it is n't foolproof - sometimes particular applications will behave differently when running through this Python - based relay .
Some even crash .
I think that this is because when I finish performing a read on socket A , the program running there considers its data to have already arrived at B , when in fact I - the devious man in the middle - have yet to send it to B .
In a situation where B is n't ready to receive the data ( whereby send ( ) blocks for a while ) , we are now in a state where A believes it has successfully sent data to B , yet I am still holding the data , waiting for the send ( ) call to execute .
I think this is the cause of the difference in behaviour that I 've found in some applications , while using my current relaying code .
Have I missed something , or does that sound correct ?
If so , my real question is : is there a way around this problem ?
Is it possible to only read from socket A when we know that B is ready to receive data ?
Or is there another technique that I can use to establish a truly ' invisible ' two - way relay between [ already open & established ] TCP sockets ?
After all that , it comes to this .
Three hundred and sixty games , 221 shots against the post and 968 goals later , 31 of them for Leo Messi , 26 for Gonzalo Higuaín , 25 for Cristiano Ronaldo , 21 for David Villa and one for Duda straight from a corner but only four for Manucho , the man who promised 40 , we 're still none the wiser .
There are more questions than answers and the more we find out the less we know .
Can Marca stoop any lower ?
Can Javier Clemente get any angrier ?
Has there ever been a mullet as magnificent as Nestor Gorostio's ?
Who 's going to be celebrating come the final day ?
And when will the final day actually be ?
After eight months , everything comes down to eight days in La Liga .
Or seven days , depending on when La Liga decides to schedule judgement day .
As for the title itself , it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that it comes down to one solitary summer evening in Seville .
It really is all to play for .
Well , almost all .
When week 36 closed just before midnight last night , one or two minor issues had been sorted out , like Osasuna clinching survival or Villarreal and Getafe seeing any mathematical chance of a Champions League place finally desert them , but most were left hanging as precariously as a baby over a Berlin balcony .
Yet again , the results resolved little , prolonging the agony or keeping the dream alive , depending on the colour of your shirt .
The big two continued their simultaneously fascinating and yet oddly tedious head to head , Barça beating Tenerife 4 - 1 and Madrid beating Mallorca 4 - 1 back ; Almería finally won after seven games ; Zaragoza got a vital penalty ; and Sevilla smashed five past Racing Santander , the side who sold their soul the day they sold Sergio Canales – from six unbeaten , they 've won just two in 16 since his transfer to Real Madrid .
All of which mattered ; none of which actually settled anything .
Mostly , it served to leave things as they were , only tighter and tenser .
A season that has often felt flat has , almost by inertia , bequeathed a final two weeks that promise to be ridiculously dramatic .
Earlier this season , Athletic Bilbao coach Joaquín Caparrós agreed to get wired - up to a heart - rate monitor during a match .
By the end , the needle was shooting beyond 170 beats per minute , almost double the norm , and Caparrós was screaming : " It 's screwed !
I 'm going to break the bloody thing ! "
Over the next week , he wo n't be the only one .
Nor will heart - rate monitors be the only piece of additional equipment needed on the bench : as teams all over the country depend on each other , sub goalies and Royston Drenthes everywhere will finally have a role to play – listening to the radio .
In 48 hours ' time , La Liga heads into the final two rounds of games and only one thing is definite : Valencia will finish third , clinching an automatic Champions League place .
Everything else is still up for grabs and a bewildering number of permutations are still possible .
In fact , according to one particularly clever man in a white coat , Spanish football 's premier number - cruncher Alexis Martín Tamayo , there are 3,486,784,401 potential combinations .
When week 37 kicks off at 9 pm on Saturday night , every single game will have something riding on it .
Not least a maletín or two .
Depending on how the results fall , the same could yet be true of the final day .
On Saturday night , only three teams will have nothing to play for : Atlético Madrid , Osasuna and Deportivo de la Coruña .
Everyone else has .
Espanyol , Almería , Zaragoza and Sporting should be safe but could still go down ; Xérez are almost certainly doomed but could yet survive .
All three relegation spots remain unresolved and nine teams could still mathematically occupy them – Espanyol on 41 points , Almería ( 41 ) , Zaragoza ( 40 ) , Sporting ( 39 ) , Málaga ( 36 ) , Racing ( 36 ) , Tenerife ( 35 ) , Valladolid ( 33 ) , and Xérez ( 30 ) .
Eight of the nine have their future in their own hands ; winning both games , they would be safe .
But Málaga face Real Madrid on the final day while Valladolid go to Camp Nou , Racing face Valladolid and Sporting , and Tenerife play Almería .
As for Xérez , they were beaten 3 - 1 by Valencia on Tuesday and have to win both matches – against Almería and Valencia – and hope that results go their way .
Ultimately , Xérez were too late .
Late building their squad , late getting a manager , late getting rid of him , late getting new owners , and late paying Inland Revenue .
Hell , their former president was even late when he turned up at that brothel – even if he was so reluctant to accept the fact that he got into a fight with a bouncer and came back an hour later , with a gun .
When they began pre-season training , Xérez had only 13 players , their coach had kept them waiting for a month , and they begged and borrowed to complete the squad – only two players have a contract for next season , only one of their normal starting XI cost any money .
When the new owner arrived in the winter and looked at the accounts he admitted no one had paid any tax for " years " , and immediately changed the coach .
Cuco Ziganda departed in week 19 .
Xérez had eight points , had won once , and scored eight goals .
17 weeks later , they have 30 points , 34 goals and a rumba in honour of their new , miracle - working coach .
But they also have virtually no chance of survival .
At the other end , the final Champions League place will be between Sevilla – who have 60 points and play Barcelona on Saturday and Almería on the final day – and this season 's revelation Mallorca , who have 59 points but a better run-in , facing nothing - to - play - for Depor and probably - nothing - to - play - for - by - then Espanyol .
One of those two will get the first Europa League slot , with Getafe ( 52 points ) , Villarreal ( 52 ) , and Athletic ( 51 ) fighting for the other one .
Or two if Sevilla make it to the Champions League and win the Copa del Rey final against Atlético Madrid on 19 May – which , thanks to more genius from the Spanish Football Federation , is an official international rest day and one for which Uruguay have called up Diego Forlán and Brazil have called up Luís Fabiano .
Then there 's the title itself .
Last night was another successful tightrope walk , yet another one of those games that was going to finally end the title race but did n't – just like the clásico did n't , just like Barcelona 's visit to Villarreal did n't .
Mallorca dominated Madrid and took the lead but all they had done was awaken the man Marca calls a " beast " this morning and has been trying to beatify all season .
If Madrid did virtually nothing , Cristiano Ronaldo did virtually everything , scoring a hat - trick , producing what he described as " possibly the best performance of my career " and leading Madrid to a sixth comeback in 10 games .
The parallels to the season when they somehow won the league under Fabio Capello get stronger .
If matches were settled by the first goal , Barcelona would be 24 points ahead of Real Madrid .
Instead , they are a solitary point behind with two games to play .
But most think it 's just one game really .
After all , between them Madrid and Barcelona have won 24 and drawn two of the past 26 , they have both already broken the wins record ( Madrid have 30 , Barcelona 29 ) , and have pulverised the points records , beating the former best set in 1996 - 97 – a campaign with 42 games rather than 38 .
Barcelona have 93 points , Madrid 92 , totals that Pep Guardiola rightly described as " fucking barbaric " and Jorge Valdano insisted meant there should be " two champions ' medals handed out " .
Not surprising then that few expect them to drop points on the final day : Barcelona face Valladolid at home , Madrid go to Málaga .
This weekend , though , is a different matter .
On Saturday night , Real Madrid face Athletic Bilbao at home , one of only two sides apart from Barça to have beaten them this season ; Barça travel to Sevilla , the only other side to have done so – and the side that knocked them out of the Copa del Rey .
And even a draw would hand the title to Madrid .
All season long Barcelona have racked up points , twice they have beaten Real Madrid , and 90 minutes in Seville could ruin it all .
Back in October , 90 minutes seemed to have ruined Madrid too and made the league title more than just a two - horse race .
But it did n't .
All season , Madrid have appeared on the verge of a breakdown , all season Marca have called for Manuel Pellegrini 's head – they 've even taken to giving Guardiola three out of three on the manager 's ratings to ensure he overtakes the Chilean in the manager - of - the - year awards – and yet he may win the league .
Barcelona have lost four times in all competitions and may finish empty - handed ; Atlético Madrid have lost 22 times and may win a cup double .
Fifty - five games , 52 wins , nine draws , and four defeats .
All that and it comes to this .
Week 36 results : Getafe 1 - 1 Sporting Gijon , Barcelona 4 - 1 Tenerife , Almería 4 - 2 Villarreal , Valencia 3 - 1 Xérez , Atlético 3 - 1 Valladolid , Racing 1 - 5 Sevilla , Zaragoza 1 - 0 Espanyol , Osasuna 3 - 1 Deportivo , Athletic 1 - 1 Málaga , Mallorca 1 - 4 Madrid .

Netflix has canceled its $ 1 million contest aimed at finding a better recommendation engine in the wake of a privacy lawsuit settlement .
The company informed its users today via the company blog , noting that it had " reached an understanding " with the Federal Trade Commission , leading it to ditch the Netflix Prize contest .
Netflix first announced the contest — actually the sequel to its original contest — in August of 2009 .
The goal was to crowdsource its active user base to write a more intelligent recommendation engine based on users ' past rentals .
This is something Netflix already does , of course , but there 's always room for improvement ; the company wanted to find the Next Big Thing™ by offering $ 1 million to the person with the best algorithm .
Part of the contest involved Netflix disclosing what it considered to be anonymized user data to those trying to come up with solutions .
This , however , led to a lawsuit by a closeted lesbian mother who argued that Netflix had not sufficiently anonymized the information and that she ( among others ) could be easily outed due to her own rental history .
Indeed , within weeks of the data being released , researchers had found a way to use an external data source to decode an individual 's viewing history with surprising accuracy , but Netflix did not immediately withdraw the contest .
The FTC eventually got involved and spent the following months discussing the issue with Netflix .
That brings us to today : Netflix has officially settled the lawsuit and , as part of the settlement , is giving up the contest .
" The resolution to both matters involves certain parameters for how we use Netflix data in any future research programs , " wrote Netflix 's Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt .
This does n't mean Netflix is giving up on improving its recommendation engine —
Hunt ended the blog post by saying the company would continue to explore better options — but the company will have to come up with new ways to " collaborate with the research community . "
North Korea ’s pint - sized dictator is a master of propaganda and social manipulation , but he also apparently suffers from insecurity , delusion , and severe OCD .
Here are 10 “ facts ” about Kim Jong Il , as reported by the media .
The word “ facts ” is in quotes because the first 5 on the list are examples of propaganda that Kim Jong
Il uses to brainwash his citizens into maintaining his almost god - like image .
The last 5 are actual facts .
10 Supernatural
The “ Fact ” : He had a supernatural birth
According to North Korean historical literature , Kim Jong
Il was born in a log cabin inside a secret base on Korea ’s most sacred mountain , Mt. Paekdu .
At the moment of his birth , a bright star lit up the sky , the seasons spontaneously changed from winter to spring , and rainbows appeared .
This contradicts way less interesting Western accounts of his birth , which state the dictator was born in a guerilla camp in Russia , while his father was on the run from the Japanese .
9 Fashion Forward
The “ Fact ” : He is a fashion trendsetter
According to North Korea ’s newspaper Rodong Sinmun , Kim Jong
Il ’s iconic style has become a global phenomenon .
The inspired look of his zipped up khaki tunics with matching pants has been spreading across the world , an obvious testament to his outstanding image and influence .
The paper did n’t mention the popularity of the 4 inch platform shoes Kim wears , but his oversized shades definitely seem to be a big hit with the women of Hollywood .
8 Loved the World Over
The “ Fact ” :
The world loves him
According to state - run media , Kimg Jong
Il is the most prominent statesman in the present world , and people in countries the whole planet over celebrate his birthday with films and festivals .
In reality , most nations are confused by his erratic foreign policy decisions on important issues such as N. Korea ’s nuclear program .
7 Ratburgers
The “ Fact ” : He invented the hamburger
Since any American influences have long since been banned in his tiny communist country , Kim Jong
Il had no choice but to create some new non-Western food by himself .
North Korean newspaper Minju Joson reported that Kim Jong
Il invented a new sandwich called “ double bread with meat ” in an attempt to provide “ quality ” food to university students .
He then built a plant capable of mass hamburger production to feed his students and teachers , despite the fact that the majority of his citizens battle famine on a daily basis .
6 Golfing Glory
The “ Fact ” : He is the best natural golfer in history
In 1994 , it was reported by Pyongyang media outlets that Kim Jong
Il shot 38 under par on a regulation 18 - hole golf course – including 5 holes in one !
That score is 25 shots better than the best round in history , and is made even more amazing by the fact that it was his first time playing the sport .
It ’s said Kim Jong
Il would routinely sink 3 or 4 holes in one per round of golf , and – lucky for the PGA – he has since given it up .
5 Addiction
The Fact :
If he gets addicted to a drug , everyone else does too
According to a book written by one of Kim Jong
Il ’s ex-staff members , he was once injured by falling off his horse when it slipped on loose rocks .
He was afraid of becoming addicted to the painkillers that his doctors prescribed him , so he had members of his administrative staff injected daily with the same dosages he had to take .
He did this so he would n’t be the only one hooked on the drug .
4 In the Movies
The Fact :
He once kidnapped a prominent director to film a Godzilla ripoff for him
Shin Sang-ok , a South Korean filmmaker , was kidnapped by Kim Jong
Il , sent to prison , and eventually forced to make a film called Pulgasari that was basically a communist propaganda version of Godzilla .
After Shin and his wife managed to escape North Korea while location scouting in Austria , Kim Jong Il shelved Pulgasari and all of Shin ’s other work .
Kim Jong
Il has since given specific instruction to his Ministry of Culture and his communist filmmakers : “ Make more cartoons . ”
3 Hitler Much ?
The Fact :
He had disabled and short people deported from his capital
In preparation for the World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989 , Kim Jong Il had disabled residents removed from Pyongyang .
The government also distributed pamphlets advertising a wonder drug that would increase the height of short people .
Those who responded to the pamphlets were sent away to different uninhabited islands along with the disabled in an attempt to rid the next generation of their supposedly substandard genes .
2 Great Booze
The Fact :
At one time was the world ’s biggest buyer of Hennessy
For a few years in the early 1990s , it was confirmed by Hennessy that Kim Jong
Il was it ’s best customer , spending about $ 600,000 to $ 850,000 annually on the liquor .
He is partial to the Paradis cognac , which can sell for over $ 700 per bottle .
In comparison , the average North Korean makes about $ 1000 per year .
1 City of Dreams
The Fact :
He maintains a city that was built just to be looked at
Kijong - Dong is a propaganda city that was originally built in the 1950s by Kim Jong
Il ’s father right on the border , this was to display the North ’s superiority to the South and also to encourage people to defect .
It has no actual residents , but an extensive effort has been put forth to simulate a functioning city , including lights on set timers , and street sweepers to create an illusion of activity .
The use of modern telescopes has revealed that the units lack window glass , and some buildings are just concrete shells that do n’t even have interior rooms .
The city also houses the world ’s largest flagpole , complete with a 300 lb .
North Korean flag .

CIA Who 's Where in Europe : http://cryptome.org/dirty-work/cia-who-where.htm
How to Spot a Spook by John Marks From : Dirty Work : The CIA in Western Europe , by Philip Agee and Louis Wolf , 1978 , pp. 29-39 .
Footnote : [ This article first appeared in the November 1974 issue of Washington Monthly , Washington , D.C. ]
Both the Soviet and American intelligence establishments seem to share the obsession that the other side is always trying to bug them .
Since the other side is , in fact , usually trying , our technicians and their technicians are constantly sweeping military installations and embassies to make sure no enemy , real or imagined , has succeeded .
One night about ten years ago , a State Department security officer , prowling through the American embassy in Santiago , Chile , in search of Communist microphones , found a listening device carefully hidden in the office of a senior " political officer . "
The security man , along with everyone else in the embassy , knew that this particular " political officer " was actually the Central Intelligence Agency 's " Station Chief , " or principal operative in Chile .
Bugging his office would have indeed been a major coup for the opposition .
Triumphantly .
the security man ripped the microphone out of the wall - only to discover later that it had been installed hy the CIA station chief himself .
The reason the CIA office was located in the embassy - as it is in most of the other countries in the world - is that by presidential order the State Department is responsible for hiding and housing the CIA .
Like the intelligence services of most other countries , the CI A has been unwilling to set up foreign offices under its own name .
So American embassies - and , less frequently .
military bases - provide the needed cover .
State confers respectability on the Agency 's operatives , dressing them up with the same titles and calling cards that give legitimate diplomats entree into foreign government circles .
Protected by diplomatic immunity , the operatives recruit local officials as CIA agents to supply secret intelligence and , especially in the Third World , to help in the Agency 's manipulation of a country 's internal affairs .
The CIA moves its men off the diplomatic lists only in Germany , Japan , and other countries where large numbers of American soldiers are stationed .
In those countries , the CIA 's command post is still in the U.S. Embassy , but most of the CIA personnel are under military cover .
With nearly 500,000 U.S. troops scattered around the world , the CIA " units " buried among them do not attract undue attention .
In contrast , it is difficult for the CIA to dwell inconspicuously within the American diplomatic corps , since more than a quarter of the 5,435 employees who purportedly work for State overseas are actually with the CIA .
In places such as Argentina , Bolivia , Burma , and Guyana , where the Agency has special interests and projects , there are about as many CIA operatives under cover of substantive embassy jobs as there are legitimate State employees .
The CIA also places smaller contingents in the ranks of other U.S. government agencies which operate overseas , particularly AID 's police training program in Latin America .
[ EDITORS ' NOTE : After much public outcry about U.S. exportation of repression via massive supplying of police equipment and training foreign police in methods of interrogation and torture since 1961 , AID 's Office of Public Safety was closed down by Congress in July 1975 . ]
What is surprising is that the CIA even bothers to camouflage its agents .
since they are still easily identifiable .
Let us see why the embassy cover is so transparent :
The CIA usually has a separate set of offices in the Embassy , often with an exotic - looking cipher lock on the outside door .
In Madrid , for example , a State Department source reports that the Agency occupied the whole sixth floor of the Embassy .
About 30 people worked there ; half were disguised as " Air Force personnel " and half as State " political officers . "
The source says that all the local Spanish employees knew who worked on what floor of the Embassy and that visitors could figure out the same thing .
CIA personnel usually stick together .
When they go to lunch or to a cocktail party or meet a plane from Washington , they are much more likely to go with each other than with legitimate diplomats .
Once you have identified one , you can quickly figure out the rest .
The CIA has a different health insurance plan from the State Department .
The premium records , which are unclassified and usually available to local employees , are a dead giveaway .
The Agency operative is taught early in training that loud background sounds interfere with bugging .
You can be pretty sure the CIA man in the Embassy is the one who leaves his radio on all the time .
Ironically , despite the State Department 's total refusal to comment on anything concerning the CIA , the Department regularly publishes two documents , the Foreign Service List and the Biographic Register , which , when cross-checked , yield the names of most CIA operatives under embassy cover .
Here is how it works : America 's real diplomats have insisted on one thing in dealing with the CIA : that the corps of Foreign Service Officers ( FSO ) remain pure .
Although there are rumors of exceptions .
CIA personnel abroad are always given the cover rank of Foreign Service Reserve ( FSR ) or Staff ( FSS ) officers - not FSO .
Of course , there are some legitimate officials from the State Department , AID , and USIA who hold FSR and FSS ratings , so care must he taken to avoid confusing these people with the spooks .
To winnow out the spooks , you start by looking up in the Foreign Service List under the country in question - for example , China .
The letters in the third column from the left signify the man or woman 's personnel status and the number denotes his or her rank .
On the China list , David Bruce is an " R - 1 , " or Reserve Officer of class 1 , . the highest rank .
John Holdridge is a regular Foreign Service Officer ( FSO ) of the same grade , and secretary Barbara Brooks is a Staff Officer , class 4 . PEKING ( U.S. LIAISON OFFICE ) ( LO ) Bruce David KE ...............

5 - 73 Now Holdridge almost certainly can be ruled out as an operative , simply because he is an FSO .
Not much can be told one way or the other about FSS Brooks because , as is the case with most secretaries , the State Department does not publish much information about her .
David Bruce might be suspect because of his " R " status , but a quick glance at the Biographic Register , which gives a brief curriculum vitae of all State Department personnel , shows him to be one of the high - level political appointees who have " R " status because they are not members of the regular Foreign Service .
Similarly , the Register report on FSR Jenkins shows that he had a long career as an FSO before taking on the State Department 's special assignment in Peking as an FSR : Bruce , David KE --b Md 2/21/98 , m ( Evangeline Bell ) .

The Foreign Service List provides another clue , in the form of diplomats ' official assignments .
Of all the jobs real State Department representatives perform , political reporting is generally considered to be the most important .
Although genuine FSRs frequently hold administrative and consular slots , they are almost never given the important political jobs .
So where an FSR does appear in the listing with a political job , it is most likely that the CIA is using the position for cover .
There is an exception to this rule :
A comparatively few minority - group members who have been brought into the Foreign Service as Reserve Officers under a special program .
They are found exclusively in the junior ranks , and their biographic data is complete in the way the CIA people 's is not .
Finally there is another almost certain tipoff .
If an agent is listed in the Biographic Register as having been an " analyst " for the Department of the Army ( or Navy or Air Force ) , you can bet that he or she is really working for the CIA .
A search of hundreds of names found no legitimate State Department personnel listed as ever having held such a job .
In an embassy like the one in Santo Domingo , the spooks in the political section outnumber the real FSOs by at least seven to three : Political Section

7 -73 While Donald Ryan is an " R " in the political section , there is not sufficient data published about him to verify his status .
It was by studying these documents that I learned that the CIA has sent an operative to Peking .
For confirmation , I called the State Department 's ranking China expert , Acting Assistant Secretary of State Arthur Hummel .
After I identified myself as a reporter working on a magazine article and explained where I had gotten my information , Hummel shouted , " I know what you 're up to and I do n't want to contribute .
Thank you very much ! " and slammed down the phone .
Another State official confirmed that the decision to send an operative to Peking was made in early 1973 , but declared that making public the operative 's existence could " jeopardize " Chinese - American relations .
Neither this official nor any of his colleagues seemed willing to consider the notion that the U.S. government was under no obligation to assign a CIA man there - or anywhere else , for that matter .
The first American mission to China since 1949 certainly could have been staffed exclusively with real diplomats if concern about damaging relations were so high .
To have excluded the Agency from Peking , however , would have gone against a basic axiom of the post - World War II foreign policy establishment : the CIA follows the flag into American embassies .
The Chinese government is presumably clever enough to identify the operative by sifting through the public documents available .
In fact , his arrival may well have been cleared with the Chinese , who probably wanted reciprocal privileges for their secret service in Washington .
Such are the arrangements the world 's spooks are so fond of working out with each other - the Soviet KGB and the CIA even exchange names of intelligence analysts assigned to the other 's capital .
Sacrificing " State " Much to the alarm of a few high State Department officials , the proportion of CIA to State personnel abroad has been steadily rising in recent years .
The precise figures are zealously guarded , but several State sources confirm the trend .
They cite as the main reason for this tilt toward the CIA a series of government - wide cutbacks that have hit State proportionately harder than the CIA .
What troubles State is not , as one career diplomat put it , " the principle " that State should provide the CIA with cover .
That is unquestioned , he says .
Rather , most legitimate diplomats do not like being a minority within their own profession or having the rest of the world confuse them with the CIA 's dirty tricksters .
They generally regard themselves as working at a higher calling .
While the State Department has been comparatively honest in accepting the personnel cuts ordered by the Johnson and Nixon administrations , two sources familiar with the CIA budget report that the Agency has done everything possible to escape the reductions .
Traditionally , when outsiders - even Presidents - have tried to meddle with the Agency 's personnel allotment , the CIA has resisted on " national security " grounds .
And when that argument failed , the CIA resorted to bureaucratic ruses : cutting out a job and then replacing the person eliminated with a " contract " or " local " employee , who would not show up on the personnel roster ; or sending home a clandestine support officer - a specialist in things like renting " safe houses , " " laundering " money , and installing phone taps - and then having the same work done by experts sent out from Washington on " temporary duty .
"
Not only does the State Department provide the CIA with cover , but the Senate - and especially its Foreign Relations Committee - encourages the current practice of sending over 25 % of our " diplomatic " corps abroad under false pretenses .
Every year the Foreign Relations Committee routinely approves and sends to the full Senate for its advice and consent lists of " Foreign Service Reserve Officers to be consular officers and secretaries in the Diplomatic Service of the United States of America . "
In 1973 , of the 121 names submitted by the State Department , more than 70 were CIA operatives .
According to a knowledgeable source , the committee is informally told the number of CIA people on the lists , but " not who they are . "
No Senator in memory has publicly objected to being an accomplice to this cover - building for the CIA .
Just this spring [ 1974 ] , the State Department took official , if secret , notice of its declining presence overseas compared to the CIA when Secretary Henry Kissinger authorized a high - level study of State - CIA staffing .
The Department 's top administrator , L. Dean Brown , who had urged the study be made in the first place , gave the job to Malcolm Toon , a career diplomat serving as U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia .
Toon returned to Washington to compile the top - secret report .
Asking not to be named and refusing to provide the specific figures , a source close to Kissinger says that Toon 's report calls for a substantial reduction in the number of CIA operatives abroad under State cover .
The source adds that Kissinger has not made up his mind on the issue .
Kissinger has always acted very carefully where the CIA is concerned .
One of his former aides notes that the Secretary has regularly treated the Agency with great deference at government meetings , although he has often been privately scornful of it afterward .
In any case , Kissinger is unquestionably a believer in the need for the CIA to intervene covertly in other countries ' internal affairs - he was the prime mover behind the Agency 's work against Salvador Allende in Chile .
The question of how much cover State should provide the CIA , however , is chiefly a bureaucratic one , and is not basic to Kissinger 's foreign policy .
The Secretary therefore will probably not take a definite position until he sees how much opposition the CIA will be able to stir up in the White House and in the congressional subcommittees that supposedly oversee the Agency .
The CIA has lost no time in launching its counteroffensive .
At a July 19 off - the - record session with key Democratic congressional aides , Carl Duckett , the CIA 's Deputy Director for Intelligence , complained about the reductions recommended by the Toon report .
According to a source who was present , Duckett said that , even without further embassy cuts , the CIA now does n't have enough people overseas .
CIA officials must be especially concerned about Toon 's recommendations , since in countries where there are no U.S. military bases , the only alternative to embassy cover is " deep , " or nonofficial , cover .
American corporations operating overseas have long cooperated in making jobs available to the CIA and would probably continue to do so .
Also , the Agency would probably have to make more use of smaller firms where fewer people would know of the clandestine connection .
Two examples of this type are :
Robert Mullen and Company , the Washington - based public relations concern for which E. Howard Hunt worked after he left the CIA and before the break - in at Democratic National Headquarters .
Mullen provided CIA operatives with cover in Stockholm , Mexico City , and Singapore , and in 1971 set up a subsidiary in cooperation with the CIA called Interprogres , Ltd. According to a secret Agency document released with the House Judiciary Committee 's impeachment evidence , " At least two [ CIA ] overseas assets have tangential tasks of promoting the acceptance of this company as a Mullen subsidiary . "
Psychological Assessment Associates , Inc. , a Washington psychological consulting firm specializing in behavioral research and analysis .
By the admission of its president John Gittinger , most of the company 's business since it was founded in 1957 by three ex-CIA psychologists has come from Agency contracts .
The firm had two " representatives " in Hong Kong , at least until June of this year [ 1974 ] .
Unless their cover is blown , companies of this sort and operatives who work for them cannot be linked to the U.S. government .
But the Agency has learned over the years that it is much more difficult and expensive to set up an operative as a businessman ( or as a missionary or newsman ) than to put him in an embassy .
As a " private " citizen , the operative is not automatically exposed to the host country 's key officials and to foreign diplomats , nor does he have direct access to the CIA communications and support facilities which are normally housed in embassies .
Moreover , as an ex-CIA official explains , " The deep cover guy has no mobility .
He does n't have the right passport .
He is subject to local laws and has to pay local taxes .
If you try to put him in an influential business job , you 've got to go through all the arrangements with the Company .
" Who Needs Gumshoes ?
Everything argues for having the intelligence agent in the embassy - everything , that is , except the need to keep his existence secret .
The question then becomes whether it is really that important to keep his existence secret - which , in turn , depends on how important his clandestine activities are .
Could any rational person , after surveying the history of the last 20 years , from Guatemala to Cuba to Vietnam - and now Chile - contend that the CIA 's clandestine activities have yielded anything but a steady stream of disaster ?
The time has come to abolish them .
Most of the military and economic intelligence we need we can get from our satellites and sensors ( which already provide nearly all our information about Russia 's nuclear weaponry ) and from reading the newspapers and the superabundant files of open reports .
As for political intelligence - which is actually an assessment of the intentions of foreign leaders - we do n't really need this kind of information from Third World countries unless we intend to muck about in their internal affairs .
With the Soviet Union or China - countries powerful enough to really threaten our national security - timely political intelligence could be a great help .
But for the past 25 years we have relied on open sources and machine - collected intelligence because our agents have proven incapable of penetrating these closed societies .
There is not enough practical benefit gained from the CIA 's espionage activities to compensate for our nation 's moral and legal liability in maintaining thousands of highly trained bribers , subverters , and burglars overseas as " representatives " of our government .
The problem of getting good , accurate , reliable information from abroad is a complicated one , beyond the scope of this article , but , to paraphrase Mae West , covert has nothing to do with it .

Bill abolishing ID cards and national identity register will be first piece of legislation introduced to parliament by the new government , says Theresa May
The £ 4.5 bn national identity card scheme is to be scrapped within 100 days , the home secretary , Theresa May , announced today .
The 15,000 identity cards already issued are to be cancelled without any refund of the £ 30 fee to holders within a month of the legislation reaching the statute book .
Abolishing the cards and associated register will be the first piece of legislation introduced to parliament by the new government .
May said the identity documents bill will invalidate all existing cards .
The role of the identity commissioner , created in an effort to prevent data blunders and leaks , will be abolished .
The government said the move will save £ 86 m over four years and avoid £ 800 m in costs over the next 10 years that would have been raised by increased charges .
An allied decision to cancel the next generation of biometric fingerprint passports will save a further £ 134 m over four years .
Savings to the public under the whole package will total £ 1bn .
The publication of the identity documents bill today marks the end of an eight - year Whitehall struggle over compulsory identity cards since they were first floated by the then - home secretary David Blunkett in the aftermath of 9/11 .
More than 5.4 m combined passport and identity cards were due to be issued when the scheme was started in earnest next year .
This was projected to rise to 10 m ID cards / passports being issued ever year from 2016 onwards .
A separate scheme under which identity cards are issued to all foreign nationals resident in Britain by 2015 run by the United Kingdom Border Agency is still to go ahead .
Home Office ministers said yesterday this was a separate scheme for biometric residence permits for foreign nationals that was required by European Union legislation .
May said : " This bill is the first step of many that this government is taking to reduce the control of the state over decent , law - abiding people and hand power back to them .
" With swift parliamentary approval , we aim to consign identity cards and the intrusive ID card scheme to history within 100 days . "
The deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg , said : " The wasteful , bureaucratic and intrusive ID card system represents everything that has been wrong with government in recent years . "
The legislation published today will give the Home Office the power to scrap ID cards within a month of its reaching the statute book and to cancel its underlying database , the national identity register .
All the data currently held on the national identity register will also be destroyed within a month of royal assent .
The next generation of " biometric " passports is also due to be cancelled .
They were due to include electronic fingerprints alongside the existing digitised photograph already included in chips in the latest passports .
The standalone identity card had recently been marketed as valid for travel in Europe but a cheaper alternative to a full passport and as a handy way for young adults to prove their age in pubs and clubs .
Although the Labour government insisted it had become a " voluntary " identity card scheme , anybody who applied for an ID card or renewed their passport had their personal details automatically logged on the national identity register .
The Labour government spent £ 257 m developing the scheme and signed four key contracts to produce the cards and introduce the next generation of biometric passports .
The difficulty facing officials in the Identity and Passport Service – a specially set up Home Office agency – will be how to disentangle the ID card scheme from the system for issuing passports .
The compensation arrangements for cancelling the four contracts , worth more than £ 1bn , will be complex because they included the design and production of the combined ID / passports from this October .
One of the four contracts , which was awarded to IBM , is for the establishment of a national biometric identity service to store and match biometric information ( such as fingerprints ) in passports and identity cards .
The decision was welcomed by privacy campaigners .
Phil Booth , the national coordinator of the NO2ID group , said : " That the very first bill to be presented by the coalition government will repeal the Identity Cards Act 2006 is a sign that the tide has turned .
" NO2ID will not be going away just yet : there is work to be done against a deeply entrenched database state .
But we hope that , as it has listened to our case against the national identity register , the new administration will also be persuaded in the name of privacy and liberty to tackle other mass - surveillance schemes . "
Brendan Barber of the TUC also welcomed the decision : " Scrapping identity cards is an important sign that the new government is committed to safeguarding civil liberties .
" With public spending under close scrutiny , identity cards were a costly folly that would have done nothing in reality to assist the fight against terrorism and would have been an unwelcome intrusion into people 's personal liberty , with a likely disproportionate impact on black and ethnic minority citizens , " he said .

It ’s hard to grasp the magnitude of the ecological catastrophe unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon / BP oil spill .
At this point no one is certain how much oil is pouring from the well into the surrounding ocean .
BP , adopting an early government estimate , has claimed that it amounts to a mere 5,000 barrels a day , but some scientists say the amount is closer to 60,000 or 70,000 barrels .
Taking the lesser of these estimates , that would translate into the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every four days .
Given that this has been going on for five weeks at the time of this writing , the gulf has by now absorbed nine such spill equivalents , with more to come .
But picturing the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill — until now the largest in US waters — and multiplying by nine does not begin to convey the scale of the disaster .
For the first time in history , oil is pouring into the deep currents of a semi- enclosed sea , poisoning the water and depriving it of oxygen so that entire classes of marine species are at risk of annihilation .
It is as if an underwater neutron bomb has struck the Gulf of Mexico , causing little apparent damage on the surface but destroying the living creatures below .
Ad Policy
Who bears responsibility for this unmitigated catastrophe ?
What should be done in response ?
Beginning with the first question , it is evident that a host of actors bear responsibility , from the drilling managers aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig to the BP officials who oversaw their work to the government regulators who awarded the corporations blanket waivers to ignore required environmental assessments .
But , as in all matters that derive from broad strokes of policy , this disaster bears the imprint of the ultimate deciders : presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
What can be determined from the information available is that the April 20 explosion occurred because BP managers were in a hurry to seal off the well so they could move the rig ( which BP leased from Transocean for $ 500,000 per day ) to another drilling location .
To speed up the move , BP ’s managers evidently approved the risky exit procedure that led to the lethal explosion .
At one level , then , responsibility can be laid at the feet of the managers involved in that decision as well as of Cameron International , the manufacturer of the rig ’s blowout preventer , which appears to have been defective .
These managers operated in a corporate culture that favored productivity and profit over safety and environmental protection .
BP , which has boasted of its success in boosting oil production in the gulf , has a sordid history when it comes to safety .
Last October it was fined $ 87 million by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for failing to correct safety problems discovered after a 2005 explosion that killed fifteen workers at BP ’s Texas City refinery — the largest such fine ever levied by OSHA .
Like other firms operating in the gulf , BP has also sought a blanket exemption from requirements that it conduct an environmental impact assessment for each new offshore well it drills .
But corporate officials and their parent companies did not operate in a political vacuum .
BP and its subcontractors were able to drill in this location , some forty miles off the Louisiana shore , because the government , first under Bush and then under Obama , has been keen to increase production in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ever since it became clear , in the 1990s , that oil output at Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska was in irreversible decline and that no other onshore location in the continental United States could provide increased levels of petroleum , the government has sought to boost output from the deepwater gulf to moderate the nation ’s growing dependence on imported energy .
To that end , the Bush administration proposed to open up new areas for drilling , including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) and the Outer Continental Shelf , and to facilitate the efforts of giant energy firms to exploit these resources .
Bush was never able to persuade Congress to approve drilling in ANWR .
But he did succeed in expanding drilling in other areas , including the deepwater gulf .
Bush ’s principal instrument in these endeavors was the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , the branch of the Interior Department responsible for providing leases for offshore drilling as well as collecting the fees and royalties the companies paid for operating in federal waters .
Intended largely to promote offshore drilling , the MMS was also responsible for ensuring that all such operations complied with the National Environmental Policy Act , the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws .
Full adherence to these laws could have slowed the expansion of drilling or blocked it altogether — but the MMS provided the leases without making the companies , including BP , obtain required environmental permits .
MMS officials routinely ignored warnings from the agency ’s own scientists and from those at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that this sort of deepwater drilling posed a risk of massive oil spills with devastating consequences for protected marine species .
Such preferential treatment for industry is hardly surprising , given the cozy — in some cases criminal — relationships that developed between senior MMS officials and their corporate counterparts .
Enter the Obama administration .
Obama has been deeply critical of his predecessor ’s environmental policies and has promised to place fresh emphasis on developing alternative fuels — but he has shown little inclination to reverse the nation ’s growing reliance on offshore oil .
As it did under Bush , the MMS has continued to award leases for offshore drilling in the gulf without requiring environmental scrutiny .
In October the agency gave Shell Oil preliminary approval to drill in the Beaufort Sea , off Alaska ’s northern coast , despite warnings from scientists within and outside the agency that any spill in these far northern waters would have catastrophic environmental repercussions .
Then on March 30 — three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon disaster — Obama announced he would permit offshore drilling in additional areas of the gulf as well as in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas above Alaska and off the East Coast .
Although Obama supposedly took this step in part to win support from Senate Republicans for the proposed climate - protection bill , it also reflects his belief , inherited from Bush , that the United States must produce more domestic oil to reduce its reliance on imports .
Since the gulf explosion , the administration has taken several halfhearted steps to slow the drive for increased deepwater drilling .
It placed a moratorium on awarding new offshore leases , although the MMS reportedly has continued to give these away .
It has also announced plans to break up the MMS into several independent agencies — with separate bodies responsible for awarding leases , collecting revenues and providing environmental oversight — in order to prevent a future conflict of interest .
All these bodies , however , will remain within the Interior Department , and it is unclear if the White House really has the will to curb risky offshore drilling .
What can we learn from all this ?
It should be obvious that merely tightening safety and environmental procedures on offshore rigs will not be enough to prevent further environmental ruin .
As long as the major energy firms continue to rest future profits on wells in ever - deeper waters — and government regulators collude with them in this — more catastrophes are inevitable .
Clearly , it ’s policy that has to change , not its implementation .
To prevent more ecological disasters , President Obama has to acknowledge the fallacy of his offshore - drilling plan and place a moratorium on all drilling in the Arctic , the Atlantic and new areas of the Gulf of Mexico while the government and industry determine whether it will ever be safe to operate in these waters .
As BP ’s inept response to the crisis shows , the giant firms lack the capacity to control leaks in deep offshore waters , and so any approval of new wells in the gulf must be contingent on developing safety and cleanup technologies equal to the task .
In the meantime , every effort must be made to speed the introduction of alternative fuels that pose fewer threats to the natural environment .

When Abdelaziz Aouragh first thought up the idea of an online sex shop for Muslim couples , I bet he did n't imagine for a moment the amount of interest his new venture would generate .
But the site actually attracted so many visitors ( 70,000 hits within the first four days ) that eventually it crashed , and Aouragh was forced to find a new web host to deal with the volume of traffic he was getting .
El Asira , as Aouragh 's sex - shop - that 's - not - really - a - sex - shop is called , is back up and running now , but I would n't bother going there if you 're after anything racier than massage oils or herbal potions .
Because everything Aouragh sells is strictly halal , and as you can imagine that leaves a lot of things out .
You wo n't find any vibrators at El Asira for instance , or indeed anything that requires batteries ; and you wo n't find any porn or any depictions of bare naked flesh there either .
What the instant success of a site like El Asira has shown though is that there 's obviously a gap in the market for this kind of thing – marital aids for couples of faith .
Indeed , this is something that Christians have been aware of for some time now ; hence the proliferation of online Christian sex shops .
But Christian sex shops are an entirely different beast from the tame , sharia - compliant business that Aouragh has just set up .
In fact let 's be honest , if it was n't for the absence of naked models on these sites , and if was n't for the constant reminders that the items on sale are for the enjoyment of married couples and married couples only , you'd be hard pushed to work out what exactly it is that makes these places Christian at all .
I do n't remember reading anything in the Bible about anal beads or rubber ticklers for instance , but then theologians have always been adept at interpreting the text to fit their arguments , so if the vicar says they 're okay then who am I to question otherwise ?
If you 're confused as to why Christians or other people of faith feel the need to have their own , separate sex shops , the people behind ChristianLoveToys.com offer this explanation on their site :
" Traditionally , married couples may only purchase fun and spicy marital toys from stores that sell a plethora of pornographic and inappropriate products .
The experience of shopping in these stores is awkward , uncomfortable , embarrassing , ' dirty ' , and spiritually overwhelming .
It is extremely difficult to serve God , serve your spouse , and appropriately guard your mind and heart while browsing these stores . "
They go on to explain that their store provides " a safe place for couples to browse " , as well as offering assurances that " your order will be shipped in a confidential , indiscriminate , plain and simple box ! "
Meanwhile , the Kama Sutra , that Bible of sex fans everywhere , is strictly forbidden , as it allegedly originates " from ancient polytheistic pseudo - religious Hindi spiritual teaching " .
But all is not lost , because God apparently " has some really exciting things to say about sex for married couples , " so you can find advice on how to get hold of a free Bible , as well as links to other Christian resources , instead .
Despite their predictable emphasis on sex being acceptable only within the confines of a purely heterosexual marriage , and their balking at putting so much as a belly button on display , Christian sex sites are nonetheless a world removed from the staid and repressed image of Christianity that some of us grew up with .
In fact in researching for this piece I was amazed to learn that Christians not only believe that women are as entitled to orgasms as men , but they believe in the existence of the G - Spot , too .
And if you do n't believe me , there 's an anatomically correct Christian diagram that pinpoints its exact location : hallelujah sisters , someone 's finally found the Holy Grail !
The Hobbit house is now in Chambers 's spare room , and she is hoping to sell it to a Tolkien fan who would make good use of it .
' My boys are too young to play with it and I am running out of space to make my new projects , ' she says .
' I put so much love into it though , that it would be very hard to see it go . '
She 's already started her next project , a miniature recreation of The Prancing Pony , an inn the hobbits visit on their journey through Middle - earth .
' I would like to make a series of miniatures from Middle - earth , but I will definitely need to find some more storage space somewhere to fit them , ' she says .

Welcome to the official site of The Butties !
Keeping the Beatles live since 1983 ...
Editor 's note : Michael Brune is executive director of the Sierra Club and former director of the Rainforest Action Network .
( CNN ) --
The oil disaster plaguing the Gulf of Mexico and our coastal states puts our desperate need for a new clean energy economy in stark relief .
We need to move away from dirty , dangerous and deadly energy sources .
We are pleased that the White House is now saying it will suspend any new offshore drilling while the explosion and spill are investigated , but there should be no doubt left that drilling will only harm our coasts and the people who live there .
Taking a temporary break from offshore drilling is an important step , but it 's not enough .
We need to stop new offshore drilling for good , now .
And then we need an aggressive plan to wean America from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades .
This BP offshore rig that exploded was supposed to be state - of - the - art .
We 've also been assured again and again that the hundreds of offshore drilling rigs along our beaches are completely safe .
Now , we 've seen workers tragically killed .
We 've seen our ocean lit on fire , and now we 're watching hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic oil seep toward wetlands and wildlife habitat .
This rig's well is leaking 210,000 gallons of crude every day , wiping out aquatic life and smothering the coastal wetlands of Louisiana and Mississippi .
As the reeking slick spreads over thousands of square miles of ocean , it rapidly approaches the title of worst environmental disaster in U.S. history , even worse than 1989's Exxon Valdez oil spill .
The well is under 5,000 feet of water , and it could take weeks or even months to cap it .
This disaster could unfortunately happen at any one of the hundreds of drilling platforms off our coasts , at any moment .
It could happen at the drilling sites that the oil industry has proposed opening along the beaches of the Atlantic Coast .
Indeed , even before this spill , the oil and gas industry had torn apart the coastal wetlands of the Louisiana Bayou over the years .
These drilling operations have caused Louisiana to lose 25 square miles of coastal wetlands , which are natural storm barriers , each year .
Another view :
Why it wo n't be easy to replace fossil fuels
And it 's hardly just the environmental costs of oil spills that we have to worry about with offshore drilling .
The threat to the people who work on these platforms has again become terribly clear .
In fact , more than 500 fires on oil platforms in the Gulf have injured or killed dozens of workers in just the past four years , according to the federal Minerals Management Service .
We do n't need to pay this price for energy .
We have plenty of clean energy solutions in place that will end our dependence on dirty fossil fuels , create good , safe jobs and breathe new life into our economy .
One huge example came Thursday , when the Obama administration approved our country 's first offshore wind farm .
Our country has huge solar power potential as well .
We can also save more oil through simple efficiency measures than could be recovered by new drilling on our coastlines .
This oil spill changes everything .
We have hit rock - bottom in our fossil fuel addiction .
This tragedy should be a wake - up call .
It 's time to take offshore drilling off the table for good .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Brune .

Image caption Dubai World 's property businesses are heavily indebted
Dubai World , the state - owned investment vehicle , says it has reached an agreement " in principle " with most of its bank lenders to restructure debt worth $ 23.5 bn ( £ 16.4bn ) .
It added it would be left with debts of $ 14.4bn after the restructuring .
But the deal must still be approved by other banks that were not involved in the negotiations .
Dubai World stunned global markets in November last year when it asked for a six - month delay on debt repayments .
The terms of the restructuring include converting $ 8.9bn of government debt into equity .
Analysis
How do you pay back $ 24bn ?
That 's been the big question here for the past six months .
Across the city , it 's been hotly debated , but few have an answer .
Today 's news could mean they have finally found it .
Negotiating with creditors has been a long and tedious process .
The government bail - out in March reassured many , especially when it put itself at the back of the queue for repayment .
But convincing local banks was n't so easy .
They were critical of what they saw as the preferential treatment given to foreign lenders .
The agreement is a step in the right direction , but it is n't yet a done deal .
It involves just 60 % of Dubai World 's creditors .
The rest still need convincing .
Many suggest they could now sign up to the deal , wanting to draw a line under the whole affair .
But Dubai 's financial crisis is far from over .
Almost six months to the day that Dubai sent shockwaves around the world , there 's still little confidence .
There 's also the matter of Dubai 's overall debt burden .
That currently stands at whopping $ 109bn .
The government of Dubai and Dubai World had tabled this offer to a committee representing its bank lenders in March after three months of negotiations .
" We are pleased that we have received unanimous support in principle ... on the headline economic terms to our restructuring proposal , " said Aidan Birkett , chief restructuring officer of Dubai World .
" This is an important milestone and reflects our efforts to achieve the best possible solution for all stakeholders .
" The proposal puts the company on a sound financial footing and reflects the continued support of the government of Dubai and its lenders . "
Exposure
The Royal Bank of Scotland was the lead bank in a seven - strong co-ordinating committee negotiating Dubai World 's debts .
There are a further 90 lenders exposed to the risk of default .
It is understood some of smaller banks , under pressure to call in their loans , may take only a share of the sum borrowed by Dubai World .
The larger banks , including RBS and HSBC , have not written off loans , but negotiated a deal which would extend them over a longer time .
Bond sale
The problems at Dubai World stemmed largely from its property development operation , Nakheel , which needed money to pay investors an Islamic bond .
The request for a halt of debt repayments stoked fears of a state default over sovereign debt .
But since February , Dubai has issued bonds worth $ 20 bn to raise finance to support struggling firms .
These were fully subscribed by neighbouring Abu Dhabi and the UAE central bank .
There are a lot of bizarre things in this Der Spiegel intervew with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi , which focuses largely on his ongoing feud with the country of Switzerland , including the hard - to - believe claim that he ’s only now hearing that his son Hannibal was accused of assault in Geneva in 2008 .
But Qaddafi ’s most over - the - top claim may be that Switzerland ’s legalized assisted suicide facilities are actually some kind of secret death camp :
SPIEGEL : Do n’t Libyans also have secret accounts in Switzerland ?
Gadhafi : Yes , there are also Libyans who have such accounts , and many of them have also died in unexplained ways .
All around the world , the families of these people are going to sue Switzerland .
And one more thing : Switzerland is the only country that allows euthanasia .
Why does only Switzerland do that ?
SPIEGEL : Medical euthanasia is also legal in the Netherlands .
And , it cannot go unmentioned that Libya has previously had citizens killed abroad who were said to be disloyal .
Gadhafi :
But we are talking now about Switzerland .
It is possible that among the Libyans who you are asking about — and who died abroad — there were also some who died because they had secret accounts in Switzerland .
SPIEGEL : And you are seriously maintaining that Switzerland as a state ordered the killing of these people ?
Gadhafi :
The investigations will show this .
And this brings me back once again to the phenomenon of assisted suicide .
A large number of people have been deliberately eliminated under this pretext .
Switzerland maintains that these individuals expressed the desire to take their lives .
But in reality it was done to get at their money .
More than 7,000 people have died like this .
I am thus calling for Switzerland to be dissolved as a state .
The French part should go to France , the Italian part to Italy and the German part to Germany .
We might as well admit that American politics is insane .
Where else could selection for the nation ’s highest court involve debate over a photograph of the nominee playing softball ?
Really incriminating , is n’t it ?
Do we really want a Justice who bats right ?
But wait : if justices , in the immortal words of Chief Justice Roberts , are supposed to call the balls and strikes , then Elena Kagan ’s experience at the plate might prove to be an important–dare we say empathic ?
–resource when on the federal bench .
Jokes aside , this snapshot is being used to raise the question of Kagan ’s sexual orientation .
Softball + short hair = lesbian ; did n’t you know that ?
The use of this image is indicative of how easily photographs can be coded strategically .
Were it a photo of a male nominee , for example , it could be a sign of his being an ordinary guy who has not lost touch with the common life .
Were Kagan married , it might have been used to show that she is a team player .
And keep in mind that millions of American women have participated in pickup softball games , often as part of teams organized at the office or at church picnics ; in short , it really should n’t mean much at all .
Instead , and thanks to the Wall Street Journal , the picture has become the excuse for public discussion of Kagan ’s sexuality .
A topic , one might add , that has about as much relevance as baseball to the job description of a Supreme Court Justice .
What strikes me about the controversy , however , is how it is part of a larger pattern of denial .
Consider how Kagan ’s having to declare her sexual preferences is similar to demanding proof of President Obama ’s citizenship .
A gay justice is almost as unthinkable as a black president , and so the question lurks .
Is she ?
And it gets repeated regardless of the answer she has provided .
And the discussion of whether she looks gay is about as intelligent as asking whether Hawaii is a state , but there it is .
Regardless of Barack Obama ’s manifest qualifications for the presidency , his election continues to be traumatic for those who want to insist that the first citizen has to be white .
( Since they ca n’t deny he is black –although that was tried–they have to deny that he is a citizen . )
Likewise , the selection to the Supreme Court of someone who might be gay is part of the sea change in American life that will never make sense to those who believe that heterosexuality is a principle of American national identity .
And so , despite her superb qualifications for the job , Elena Kagan is being asked to supply her sexual orientation certificate .
The good news is that , whatever is the case regarding Kagan ’s private life–or that of the Senators who will be questioning her–America already has changed for the better .
( For example , a majority would support a gay nominee . )
The attempt to out Kagan or discredit her or continue to keep others outside the charmed circle of citizenship is becoming another lost cause .
To appreciate what that means , I ’d recommend another photograph of the nominee .
We do n’t know her batting stance , but this is an image of youth at its best : bright , joyful , and full of promise , ambition , and hope .
Thus , it also is an image of the American Dream .

In Deep Water : Can we afford to spill any oil ?
The Google I/ O conference launches May 19 and , years later , industry watchers may look back on this instance of this increasingly popular event as a celebration of the open - source Android platform , or perhaps even as the Android Festival .
eWEEK has been tracking the news leading up to this third I/O event and most of the buzz centers around Android .
Google I/O in 2009 brought the world Google Wave , sparking a love affair with real - time collaboration software for the next six months .
Now Wave rarely registers as a blip on most high - tech watchers ' radar despite having more than 1 million users .
One thing that seems certain to launch at Google I/O is Android 2.2 , or " Froyo . "
Android father Andy Rubin said himself Froyo was coming and Adobe Systems confirmed that Flash 10.1 would be featured on Froyo phones .
Adobe has been offering reporters Nexus One devices loaded with Android 2.2 and Flash 10.1 to test ahead of the event .
Android 2.2 is already turning heads for its blazing fast speed on the Linpack benchmark , and for features such as data tethering and a WiFi hot spot .
Moreover , it is believed that Froyo will help with the fragmentation problem plaguing the Android platform by decoupling some of the core applications from the operating system and making them accessible in the Android Market .
Another big rumor is that Google TV , or at least a flavor of Android running on set - top boxes , will make its debut at Google I/O .
Google TV , as it is currently known , is a platform and service that will run Web applications on televisions thanks to set - top boxes .
The Google TV set - top box is said to run Android and be powered by Intel chips , and will make Sony televisions and even Blu-ray DVD players function like computers , running Google search , the Chrome Web browser , and YouTube and other programs .
“ Making the world ’s available resources serve one hundred percent of an exploding population can only be accomplished by a boldly accelerated design revolution . ”
There are few men who can justly claim to have revolutionized their discipline .
R. Buckminster Fuller revolutionized many .
“ Bucky , ” as he was known to most , was a designer , architect , poet , educator , engineer , philosopher , environmentalist , and , above all , humanitarian .
Driven by the belief that humanity ’s major problems were hunger and homelessness he dedicated his life to solving those problems through inexpensive and efficient design .
The grandnephew of the American Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller , Bucky was born on July 12 , 1895 in Milton , Massachusetts .
He was twice expelled from Harvard .
Later , Bucky married Anne Hewlett in 1917 and went into the construction business with her father .
A decade later he witnessed the first of many business failures , when , due to economic difficulties , he was forced out of the company .
Despondent over these failures and family problems , he resolved to focus his energies on a search for socially responsible answers to the major design problems of his time .
Recognizing the inefficiency of the automobile , Bucky spent the late twenties designing a car that would incorporate the engineering advances of the airplane .
In 1933 , he presented the first prototype of the Dymaxion car .
The Dymaxion car could hold twelve passengers , go 120 miles per hour and used half the gas of the standard car , utilizing aerodynamics construction and only three wheels .
While demonstrating the car to investors , it crashed , taking one life .
Though the crash was later determined not to be the fault of the car , he was never able to find adequate funding .
As World War II ended and housing crises in America became more acute , he turned his sights to what would remain his life - long dream .
Using airplane construction methods and materials , Bucky set out to create a pre-fabricated house that could be easily delivered to any location .
It would be fireproof and inexpensive and constructed out of light weight materials .
In 1945 however , with thousands of orders in place for his new Dymaxion House , Fuller once again ran into difficulties with investors and had to end the project .
Unsure of his next step and without a job , Bucky accepted a position at a small college in North Carolina , Black Mountain College .
There , with the support of an amazing group of professors and students , he began work on the project that was to make him famous and revolutionize the field of engineering .
Using lightweight plastics in the simple form of a tetrahedron ( a triangular pyramid ) he created a small dome .
As his work continued it became clear that he had made the first building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits .
The U.S. government recognized the importance of the discovery and employed him to make small domes for the army .
Within a few years there were thousands of these domes around the world .
Having finally received recognition for his endeavors , Buckminster Fuller spent the final fifteen years of his life traveling around the world lecturing on ways to better use the world ’s resources .
A favorite of the radical youth of the late 60’s and 70’s , Fuller worked to expand social activism to an international scope .
Among his most famous books were NO MORE SECONDHAND GOD ( 1963 ) OPERATING MANUAL FOR THE SPACESHIP EARTH ( 1969 ) , and EARTH , INC . ( 1973 ) in which he writes “ In reality , the Sun , the Earth , and the Moon are nothing else than a most fantastically well - designed and space - programmed team of vehicles .
All of us are , always have been , and so long as we exist , always will be–nothing else but–astronauts . ”

[ digg - reddit - me ] I ’m impressed with Jake Tapper ’s handling of This Week in the interim before Christiane Amanpour takes over in August .
Tapper seems committed to widening the opinions voiced on the show from the typical “ Beltway ” crowd to some of those voices most influential in the Beltway who are critical of it .
Which means bringing on Glenn Greenwald and Bill Maher .
I ’m still waiting on his bringing in some conservatives similarly positioned as “ outsiders ” while being very influential in the Beltway .
Maher and Greenwald substantially influence our political conversation while never before being given the opportunity to intrude on the polite Sunday morning territory and confront the people they so regularly criticize .
In the same spirit , Tapper has added a fact check component to his show — in which Politifact evaluates the truthfulness of factual claims made in his interviews .
This is a huge improvement given the churning of misinformation that seems to be the main purpose some leaders use it for .
The quality of Tapper ’s program was brought to mind watching this clip of Mike Murphy , a Republican political operative and frequent guest on Meet the Press .
( For what it ’s worth , Mike Murphy seems a genuinely likable guy and often , even a straight - shooter — and I do n’t mean this as an attack on him personally . )
If David Gregory allowed a fact checker to go over the claims of his guests , then perhaps the above - moment with the very inside - the - Beltway figure of Mike Murphy would not have happened .
Because you see that moment was entirely fact - free .
Entirely .
Yet , Mike Murphy ’s statement represents an oft - repeated “ fact ” in the opinion media — especially on the right .
And it is driving the actual policy of the state of Arizona .
Let ’s look at Mike Murphy ’s claims and the facts :
It ’s a lawless frontier because of the failure of the Obama administration to protect the American border .
People are getting killed and murdered .
It has become really bad in Arizona .
Describing illegal immigration in partisan terms as a “ failure of the Obama administration ” seems best explained as a fudge rather than a blatant lie .
It ’s been an ongoing problem that as a nation we do not control our borders and maintain a law which can not be enforced .
Gregory interjects as Murphy is speaking , “ This goes back before Obama , though , to be fair . ”
However , by stating such , Gregory seems to be conceding Murphy ’s general point .
But look at the stats on this “ People are getting killed and murdered ” bit — which “ has become really bad in Arizona , ” according to Murphy , as he voices the “ Conventional Wisdom ” accepted by David Gregory as well .
Yet there have been exactly four ( 4 ) murders along this supposedly lawless frontier in the past year .
One of them generated thousands of headlines about the scourge of illegal immigration , the death of the rancher Robert Krentz .
These anti-immigrant activists who talk casually of “ People getting killed and murdered ” ( as if to double the impact of each homicide ) — of the overall situation being “ really bad ” — even of , specifically , many ranchers being killed — always seem to point to this single example — Robert Krentz .
I ’ve seen no news story or other evidence linking more than this one death to border crossing .
I ’ve asked a number of people who have said this to point to some statistic — and instead I get the story of Robert Krentz , being exploited for politics .
Remember : Arizona ’s border is supposed to be the worst example of a lawless border and yet there is this single example which is always pointed to in order to justify the claim of plural murders — and even huge amounts of violence .
I do not doubt there are other deaths along the border — perhaps on the Mexican side — of people trying to make the illegal crossing themselves and dying of thirst or other privation .
Mike Murphy follows this up by doubling down on his above false claim in an attempt to both place the blame for this historic problem on the Obama administration and make the case that Arizona ’s very violent crime rate along the border is getting worse :
[ I ]t ’s gotten , it ’s gotten worse and worse .
To be fair to Murphy , one could consider that he means that any level of violence is bad — and that it is getting worse .
So , let ’s take this as a separate claim — that Murphy is instead claiming that violence along the border is increasing .
CNN reported :
According to FBI statistics , violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008 .
Reported property crimes also fell , from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000 in the same period .
These decreases are accentuated by the fact that Arizona ’s population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008 .
Let ’s give Mike Murphy the benefit of the doubt and assume he meant that the overall problem of illegal immigration into Arizona has “ gotten worse and worse ” under the Obama administration .
Homeland Security helpfully provides statistics on this which I have compiled into this chart :
This drop in illegal immigration is n’t due to any Bush , Obama , or local level actions .
It ’s due to the recession .
However , another consequence of a recession is a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment .
Which explains why Mike Murphy along with much of the Republican establishment is out there demagoguing illegal immigrants by making false claims about all these murders and violence :
Because during times of economic trouble , people look to scapegoat someone for their troubles — and immigrants , especially illegal ones , get some of the blame .
But let ’s stop with this pretense of “ violent illegal immigrants . ”
That is the stuff of demagogues and prejudice as it simply is not based on facts .
Instead , let us acknowledge forthrightly that the excitement over this issue is being drive by cultural and economic resentment rather than “ violence . ”

The FBI and Department of Justice said they were going to go hard after intellectual property crimes this year and so far they seem to be keeping their word as today the agencies appointed 15 new Assistant US Attorney ( AUSA ) positions and 20 FBI Special Agents dedicated to fighting domestic and international IP crimes .
The 15 new AUSA 's will work closely with the Criminal Division 's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section to aggressively pursue high tech crime , including computer crime and intellectual property offenses .
The new positions will be located in California , the District of Columbia , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , Virginia and Washington , the DoJ stated .
FBI details most difficult Internet scams
The 20 FBI Special Agents will be deployed to specifically boost four geographic areas with intellectual property squads , and increase investigative capacity in other locations around the country where intellectual property crimes are of particular concern , the FBI said .
The four squads will be located in New York , San Francisco , Los Angeles and the District of Columbia .
The squads will allow for more focused efforts in particular hot spot areas and increased contact and coordination with our state and local law enforcement partners .
The 20 new agents will join 31 agents already devoted to investigating intellectual property crimes , the FBI stated .
The additional personnel bolster the DoJ 's newly minted Task Force on Intellectual Property set up earlier this year to focus on battling US and international intellectual property crimes .
The Task Force works across a number of agencies including the FBI and will focus on bolstering efforts to combat intellectual property crimes through close coordination with state and local law enforcement partners as well as international counterparts , the DoJ stated .
It will also monitor and coordinate overall intellectual property enforcement efforts at the DoJ , with an increased focus on the international IP enforcement , including the links between IP crime and international organized crime .
The Task Force will also develop policies to address what the DoJ called evolving technological and legal landscape of this area of law enforcement .
Critics have long said the US needs to do something to put a crimp in the over $ 200 billion counterfeit and pirated goods industry with better enforcement and increased penalties for violations .
The Government Accountability Office noted that a broad range of IP - protected products are subject to being counterfeited or pirated , from luxury goods and brand name apparel to computer software and digital media to food and medicine .
Evidence of counterfeiting in industries whose products have a public health or safety component , such as auto and airline parts ; electrical , health , and beauty products ; batteries ; pharmaceuticals ; and infant formula , presents a significant concern .
The World Health Organization estimates that as much as 10 % of medicines sold worldwide are believed to be counterfeit .
Industries that rely on IP protection - including the aerospace , automotive , computer , pharmaceutical , semiconductor , motion picture , and recording industries - are estimated to have accounted for 26 % of the annual gross domestic product growth rate during this period and about 40 % of U.S. exports of goods and services in 2003 through 2004 .
Further , they are among the highest - paying employers in the country , representing an estimated 18 million workers or 13 % of the labor force , as of 2008 , according to the GAO .
The GAO issued another report in intellectual property recently and found a number of interesting facts :
According to Customs and Border Protection data from 2004 through 2009 , China accounted for about 77 % of the aggregate value of goods seized in the United States .
Hong Kong , India , and Taiwan followed China , accounting for 7 , 2 , and 1 % of the seized value , respectively .
CBP data indicate certain concentrations of counterfeit production among these countries : in 2009 , about 58 % of the seized goods from China were footwear and handbags ; 69 % of the seized goods from Hong Kong were consumer electronics and watch parts ; 91 % of the seized goods from India were pharmaceuticals and perfume ; and 85 % of seized goods from Taiwan were computers and consumer electronics .
Digital products can be reproduced at very low cost , and have the potential for immediate delivery through the Internet across virtually unlimited geographic markets .
Digital piracy impacts most the music , motion picture , television , publishing , and software industries .
Piracy of these products over the Internet can occur through methods including peer - to - peer networks , streaming sites , and one - click hosting services .
There is no government agency that systematically collects or tracks data on the extent of digital copyright piracy .
According to a recent Commerce department report , counterfeit electronics parts have infiltrated U.S. defense and industrial supply chains and almost 40 % of companies and organizations - including the Department of Defense - surveyed for the report have encountered counterfeit electronics .
Commerce reported that the infiltration of counterfeit parts into the supply chain was exacerbated by weaknesses in inventory management , procurement procedures , and inspection protocols , among other factors .
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) tracks and posts notifications of incidents of counterfeit or improperly maintained parts entering airline industry supply chains through its Suspected Unapproved Parts Program in an effort to improve flight safety .
The FAA program has identified instances of counterfeit aviation parts , as well as fake data plates and history cards to make old parts look new .
FAA 's program highlights the risks that counterfeit parts pose to the safety of commercial aircraft .
Counterfeit or pirated software may threaten consumers ' computer security .
The illegitimate software , for example , may contain malicious programming code that could interfere with computers ' operations or violates users ' privacy .

Radioactive water that leaked from the nation ’s oldest nuclear power plant has now reached a major underground aquifer that supplies drinking water to much of southern New Jersey , the state ’s environmental chief said Friday .
The state Department of Environmental Protection has ordered the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station to halt the spread of contaminated water underground , even as it said there was no imminent threat to drinking water supplies .
The department launched a new investigation Friday into the April 2009 spill and said the actions of plant owner Exelon Corp. have not been sufficient to contain water contaminated with tritium .
Tritium is found naturally in tiny amounts and is a product of nuclear fission .
It has been linked to cancer if ingested , inhaled or absorbed through the skin in large amounts .
“ There is a problem here , ” said environmental Commissioner Bob Martin .
“ I am worried about the continuing spread of the tritium into the groundwater and its gradual moving toward wells in the area .
This is not something that can wait .
That would be unacceptable . ”
The tritium leaked from underground pipes at the plant on April 9 , 2009 , and has been slowly spreading underground at 1 to 3 feet a day .
At the current rate , it would be 14 or 15 years before the tainted water reaches the nearest private or commercial drinking water wells about two miles away .
But the mere fact that the radioactive water — at concentrations 50 times higher than those allowed by law — has reached southern New Jersey ’s main source of drinking water calls for urgent action , Martin said .

Node.js is all the buzz at the moment , and makes creating high performance , real - time web applications easy .
It allows JavaScript to be used end to end , both on the server and on the client .
This tutorial will walk you through the installation of Node and your first " Hello World " program , to building a scalable streaming Twitter server .
What is Node.js ?
JavaScript has traditionally only run in the web browser , but recently there has been considerable interest in bringing it to the server side as well , thanks to the CommonJS project .
Other server - side JavaScript environments include Jaxer and Narwhal .
However , Node.js is a bit different from these solutions , because it is event - based rather than thread based .
Web servers like Apache that are used to serve PHP and other CGI scripts are thread based because they spawn a system thread for every incoming request .
While this is fine for many applications , the thread based model does not scale well with many long - lived connections like you would need in order to serve real - time applications like Friendfeed or Google Wave .
" Every I /O operation in Node.js is asynchronous ... "
Node.js , uses an event loop instead of threads , and is able to scale to millions of concurrent connections .
It takes advantage of the fact that servers spend most of their time waiting for I/O operations , like reading a file from a hard drive , accessing an external web service or waiting for a file to finish being uploaded , because these operations are much slower than in memory operations .
Every I/O operation in Node.js is asynchronous , meaning that the server can continue to process incoming requests while the I/O operation is taking place .
JavaScript is extremely well suited to event - based programming because it has anonymous functions and closures which make defining inline callbacks a cinch , and JavaScript developers already know how to program in this way .
This event - based model makes Node .js very fast , and makes scaling real - time applications very easy .
Step 1 Installation
Node.js runs on Unix based systems , such as Mac OS X , Linux , and FreeBSD .
Unfortunately , Windows is not yet supported , so if you are a Windows user , you can install it on Ubuntu Linux using Virtualbox .
To do so , follow this tutorial .
You will need to use the terminal to install and run Node.js .
Download the latest release of Node.js from nodejs.org ( the latest version at the time of this writing is 0.1.31 ) and unzip it .
Open the terminal , and run the following commands .
A lot of messages will be outputted to the terminal as Node.js is compiled and installed .
Step 2 Hello World !
Every new technology starts with a " Hello World ! " tutorial , so we will create a simple HTTP server that serves up that message .
First , however , you have to understand the Node .js module system .
In Node , functionality is encapsulated in modules which must be loaded in order to be used .
There are many modules listed in the Node .js documentation .
You load these modules by using the require function like so :
This loads the sys module , which contains functions for dealing with system level tasks like printing output to the terminal .
To use a function in a module , you call it on the variable that you stored the module in , in our case sys .
Running these two lines is as simple as running the node command with the filename of the javascript file as an argument .
This will output " Hello World ! " to the command line when run .
To create an HTTP server , you must require the http module .
This script imports the sys and http modules , and creates an HTTP server .
The anonymous function that is passed into http.createServer will be called whenever a request comes in to the server .
Once the server is created , it is told to listen on port 8080 .
When a request to the server comes in , we first send HTTP headers with the content type and status code of 200 ( successful ) .
Then we send " Hello World ! " and close the connection .
You might notice that we have to explicitly close the connection .
This will make it very easy to stream data to the client without closing the connection .
If you run this script and go to http://localhost:8080 / in your browser , you will see " Hello World ! "
Step 3 A Simple Static File Server
OK , so we have built an HTTP server , but it does n't send anything except for " Hello World , " no matter what URL you go to .
Any HTTP server must be able to send static files such as HTML files , images and other files .
The following code does just that :
We start by requiring all of the modules that we will need in our code .
This includes the sys , http , url , path , and fs or filesystem modules .
Next we create an HTTP server like we did before .
This time , we will use the url module to parse the incoming URL of the request and find the pathname of the file being accessed .
We find the actual filename on the server 's hard drive by using path .
join , which joins process.cwd ( ) , or the current working directory , with the path to the file being requested .
Next , we check if the file exists , which is an asynchronous operation and thus requires a callback .
If the file does not exist , a 404 Not Found message is sent to the user and the function returns .
Otherwise , we read the file using the fs module using the " binary " encoding , and send the file to the user .
If there is an error reading the file , we present the error message to the user , and close the connection .
Because all of this is asynchronous , the server is able to serve other requests while reading the file from the disk no matter how large it is .
If you run this example , and navigate to http://localhost:8080/path/to/file , that file will be shown in your browser .
Step 4 A Real Time Tweet Streamer
Building on our static file server , we will build a server in Node .js that streams tweets to a client that is served through our static file server .
To start , we will need one extra module in this example : the events module .
Node has a concept called an EventEmitter , which is used all over to handle event listeners for asynchronous tasks .
Much like in jQuery or another client side JavaScript framework where you bind event listeners to things like mouse clicks , and AJAX requests , Node allows you to bind event listeners to many things , some of which we have already used .
These include every I/ O operation , such as reading a file , writing a file , checking if a file exists , waiting for HTTP requests , etc .
The EventEmitter abstracts the logic of binding , unbinding , and triggering such event listeners .
We will be using an EventEmitter to notify listeners when new tweets are loaded .
The first few lines of our tweet streamer imports all of the required modules , and defines a function for handling static files , which was taken from our previous example .
We have used the http module to create a server before , but it is also possible to create an HTTP client using the module .
We will be creating an HTTP client to load tweets from Twitter 's public timeline , which is performed by the get_tweets function .
First , we create an HTTP client on port 80 to api.twitter.com , and create a new EventEmitter .
The get_tweets function creates an HTTP " GET " request to Twitter 's public timeline , and adds an event listener that will be triggered when Twitter 's servers respond .
Because Node.js is asynchronous , the data in the body of the response comes in chunks , which are picked up by the response 's " data " listener .
This listener simply appends the chunk to the body variable .
Once all of the chunks have come in , the " end " listener is triggered , and we parse the incoming JSON data .
If more than one tweet is returned , we emit the " tweets " event on our tweet_emitter , and pass in the array of new tweets .
This will trigger all of the event listeners listening for the " tweets " event , and send the new tweets to each client .
We retreive the new tweets every five seconds , by using setInterval .
Finally , we need to create the HTTP server to handle requests .
Just as we did with our static file server , we create an HTTP server that listens on port 8080 .
We parse the requested URL , and if the URL is equal to " / stream " , we will handle it , otherwise we pass the request off to our static file server .
Streaming consists of creating a listener to listen for new tweets on our tweet_emitter , which will be triggered by our get_tweets function .
We also create a timer to kill requests tht last over 10 seconds by sending them an empty array .
When new tweets come in , we send the tweets as JSON data , and clear the timer .
You will see how this works better after seeing the client side code , which is below .
Save it as test .html in the same directory as the server side JavaScript .
Here , we have a simple HTML page that imports the jQuery library and defines an unordered list to put the tweets in .
Our client side JavaScript caches the tweet list , and runs the load_tweets function after one second .
This gives the browser enough time to finish loading the page before we start the AJAX request to the server .
The load_tweets function is very simple :
It uses jQuery 's getJSON function to load / stream .
When a response comes in , we loop through all of the tweets and prepend them to the tweet list .
Then , we call load_tweets again .
This effectively creates a loop that loads new tweets , which times out after ten seconds because of the timeout on the server .
Whenever there are new tweets , they are pushed to the client which maintains a continuous connection to the server .
This technique is called long - polling .
If you run the server using node and go to http://localhost:8080/test.html , you will see the Twitter public timeline stream into your browser .
Next Steps
Node.js is a very exciting technology that makes it easy to create high performance real time applications .
I hope you can see its benefit , and can use it in some of your own applications .
Because of Node 's great module system , it is easy to use prewritten code in your application , and there are many third party modules available for just about everything - including database connection layers , templating engines , mail clients , and even entire frameworks connecting all of these things together .
You can see a complete list of modules on the Node.js wiki , and more Node tutorials can be found on How To Node .
I would also recommend that you watch a video from JSConf , in which Ryan Dahl , the creator of Node , describes the design philosophy behind Node .
That is available .
I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial .

Apparently this was a track originally produced for Alicia Keys by Chad from The Neptunes , which never made the final cut for her 2007 studio album As I Am .
Anyway , Lupe got a hold of it since it was n’t going anywhere fast , and it is rumoured to be a track from his upcoming Lasers album , but to be honest I doubt it will since it features very little of him at all .

Resident Image stylist and market editor Melissa Magsaysay soothes your sartorial woes in the weekly Your Stylist blog column .
Hi Your Stylist -
I recently turned 30 and realized it ’s probably time I ditched the worn out H&M or Aldo bags and got myself a grown - up bag with a real designer .
My friend at work recently bought a used Louis Vuitton Speedy off EBay .
While I like the size of her purse and that there ’s a “ green ” factor that helps both the environment and my pocketbook , I do n’t want the same thing .
I also know this is weird , but I have a strong phobia of snakes , and even snake - skin bags and shoes kind of weird me out .
I ’m somewhat flexible on price if it means I ’ll have the purse for years .
Keeping these stipulations in mind , do you have any suggestions ?
KW , Los Angeles
There ’s nothing quite like the first grown - up bag that will hang from your arm making you feel polished , put - together and confident :
Your new best friend that comes with the price tag of about $ 1,000 .
But because you ’re ready to take the plunge and replace all of those disposable bags with something that you will keep and use for years to come , there are several designer styles to consider .
Your friend ’s Speedy bag is a classic shape , and of course , you ca n’t really go wrong with the brown - and - beige LV logo leather .
If you like that shape , take a look at the Bayswater bag from Mulberry .
It ’s a solid rectangle with a top flap and turn closure .
It ’s a classic and truly grown - up bag , but not something all your friends already have .
The Downtown bag from YSL is another iconic style that will serve you well for years to come .
I love the angular shape of this one and the zippers and hardware add some edge .
For something that looks more vintage and down to earth , the Paraty bag from Chloe is another style that will transcend several seasons .
The cognac - colored leather will work in both the summer and a California fall , and the long and short straps give you options to hand - carry or throw it on your shoulder .
One of my favorite new bag lines is Jerome Dreyfuss -- especially if you want a bag that not everyone is going to be toting around .
The Parisian designer makes buttery leather bags in interesting and vivid colors as well as several neutral shades such as this luggage leather hobo .
If the eco-friendly aspect still intrigues you , a Southern California - based label called Novella Royale makes high - end bags from recycled leather jackets .
The styles here are trendier , with studs , fringe and smaller sizes , but the Clover and Van bags are on the more classic side .
Plus you have the peace of mind about carrying re-purposed leather .
Whichever bag you choose , congratulations on making this important step in stocking your closet with big - girl bags .
Each one is an investment , but remember that a beautiful bag can transform the simplest outfit into something really special .

Peter watched the Newton 's Cradle clack away on his desk while contemplating this most recent problem .
HR had just handed him a resume for a C# developer named Bobbie .
The resume was stellar , her references glowing , And thanks to the negotiations with the placement company , she could start on Monday .
Bobbie was n't just qualified , she was over - qualified .
She could do Peter 's job in a snap .
He tossed the resume in the trash and stepped out into the row of cubes dedicated to his small staff .
" Hey guys , circle up , " he said .
His three staff shuffled to their cube entrances and stared blankly in his general direction .
" This tardiness problem is getting out of hand .
The day starts at 8 AM , not 8:05 .
And do n't think I have n't noticed the long lunches .
If this keeps up , there may have to be some changes around here . "
It did n't matter that their " long lunches " were just an hour .
It did n't matter that he had no power to fire anyone .
On Monday , they'd be wondering if Bobbie was one of those ominous " changes " .
The first landmine had been laid , and Peter had vented his spleen on his staff .
He felt much better .
Bobbie arrived before 8 AM on Monday , bubbly and excited to be working in her new job .
Peter lurked as HR showed her around .
The tour ended in his office .
After the small talk , he planted the next mine .
" I 'm going to need you to take over the AS / 400 system . "
Peter surveyed Bobbie for her reaction , any sign of weakness .
" That 's not really my background , " Bobbie said .
" Well , around here , we 're not too concerned with job descriptions .
I really need someone to step up and be a team player , and I want that person to be you . "
He pointed at the motivational poster on the back wall , labeled " TEAMWORK " .
Bobbie toddled off with a " Can do " smile , bound to tackle a project for which she was woefully underqualified .
Peter added a note to her file , commenting on the negative attitude she displayed .
Situation managed .
Peter was perfectly content for the next few days .
He heard nothing from Bobbie , and assumed that she was drowning .
Until Jacob , his boss , stopped by .
" That 's a good eye , putting Bobbie on the AS / 400 project , Peter .
Who would have thought a .NET programmer could just step up and hit a home - run like that ? "
Peter simpered .
Around his teeth , he said , " Well , I really want to encourage my staff to expand their horizons .
I worked very hard to make sure that she had all of the resources she needed to get started . "
The smile hung on his face even after Jacob left .
He swatted at his desk , knocking the Newton 's Cradle to the floor .
Peter ambushed Bobbie in the breakroom .
" I need to take you off the AS / 400 and put you on XTROS .
Fix it . "
He had no idea what XTROS was , other than an obscure , half - dead application that handled scheduling and had a nasty habit of making programmers cry .
Peter provided no further instructions .
He dedicated 20 minutes a day to berate Bobbie for not learning the business fast enough .
" I would n't have given you XTROS if I realized I had to hold your hand all day !
Get those fixes done . "
Two months later , Peter got an email from the XTROS custodian .
The users were " ecstatic " .
" Bobbie worked extremely hard to help us evaluate our requirements and prioritize bugs , and the end result meets user needs perfectly . "
Even worse , they CCed Jacob as well .
The Newton 's Cradle landed with a clatter on the opposite side of the office .
" Peter , " Jacob called from Peter 's doorway .
" That work - request for the new AS / 400 project was approved . "
Peter nodded ; it was a " Big Deal " project , high visibility .
" Well , " Jacob said , " business users are demanding that Bobbie heads up the effort .
Put at least 60 % of her time on this , because we have to finish this fiscal year .
Budgets , you know . "
Minutes later , Bobbie stood before Peter 's desk , a perplexed gaze on the tangled pile of wire that once was a Newton 's Cradle .
" I 'm going to manage this project very closely , " Peter said .
" I 'll need regular status reports . "
He went on , at length , about all of the things she 'd need to do to appease him .
Jacob wanted the status reports ,
Peter just wanted to make sure they came through his hands .
When Bobbie 's first status report arrived in his inbox , he deleted it , unread .
A few days later , he sent her a nasty note complaining that she had n't turned it in on time , and BCCed Jacob .
She sent again .
A month later , he " touched up " the document and then sent it back to her , demanding corrections .
When Bobbie submitted the corrected version , Peter rejected it again .
Mid-December , Peter sent an apology to Jacob , explaining that Bobbie just could n't get the project done by year - end .
Jacob demanded a meeting with all of the stakeholders , so that Peter could explain what had gone wrong .
His explanation ended , " Bobbie , unfortunately , could n't complete it on schedule . "
" Actually , " Bobbie piped up , an evil gleam in her eye , " I could .
And did .
Twice , because I was n't satisfied with my first attempt .
UAT is nearly complete and we 're on track for deployment before the holidays .
And I did come prepared with a demo . "
Peter felt his pulse erupt while Bobbie set up her laptop .
This was bad .
This was very bad .
When the meeting ended , the upper - managers smelled his blood in the water .
He could see it in their eyes .
There was a surprise waiting for Peter in his office .
Bobbie , who had weathered a year under his supervision , had collected her signing bonus and was officially done with his department .
Her resignation letter was terse , and ended with , " I will not be requiring a reference , as I 've already found new employment . "
Peter sighed , content .
Victory !
OTTAWA
It is not often that a Parliament Hill rally turns into a bit of love - in for the government of the day or that the latter is reluctant to allow itself to be showered with unrequited public affection .
Such was the case last week as thousands of anti-abortion activists used their annual Parliament Hill rally to celebrate Stephen Harper ’s maternal health initiative .
Not one of the Prime Minister ’s many social conservative ministers was on hand for the event .
But the crowd ’s message that it likes the government ’s recent activism on the anti-abortion front and wants more of it was heard loud and clear by every politician who toils in Parliament .
That was the latest signal that events have overtaken Harper ’s stated objective of keeping the abortion issue off the radar .
After years of shadow boxing around the notion that the Conservatives have a hidden social - conservative agenda , the opposition parties are not about to let the matter rest now that they feel they have something solid to sustain their narrative .
Just as importantly from the government ’s perspective , a vocal section of the Conservative base has been galvanized by the federal decision to not fund international development initiatives that include helping women secure safe abortions .
The question is no longer whether the Conservative approach to abortion rights will be in the picture of the next federal campaign but rather what Harper will do about it .
His political future may ride on his handling of the issue and yet there is not even a consensus as to whether the current alignment of the ideological stars is Harper ’s worst nightmare or a dream come true .
There is no doubt the Prime Minister pushed the play button on the dormant debate on abortion rights when he unveiled his plans for a maternal health initiative last winter .
But there is no agreement as to whether that was deliberate or accidental .
Those who subscribe to the first school point to the increasingly visible social - conservative influence within Harper ’s government .
It stretches all the way up to the cabinet front - line and Harper ’s own team of tacticians .
In a timely book on the religious right in Canada , titled The Armageddon Factor , journalist Marci McDonald documents the unprecedented access various militant religious lobbies have come to enjoy in Harper ’s Ottawa .
Proponents of the big - plan theory also make a case that Harper , who had until recently acted as a buffer between the social - conservative movement and his government , is changing tack ; that he is transforming himself into a social - conservatism facilitator as part of a last - ditch strategy to craft a Conservative majority .
Arguing for the other side and the law of unintended consequences — many analysts point to the fact that Harper and his Reform / Alliance predecessors were always hobbled , not helped , by the perception that their parties were vehicles for the social conservative agenda .
Based on past trends , playing the social - conservatism card would be a losing gambit .
The ranks of those who feel the government has not so much set a new strategic course for itself as somehow lost its way include some Conservative insiders .
Last week , former Harper adviser Tom Flanagan used the word “ atrocious ” to describe the government ’s current political management .
Other contrarians offer an alternative explanation for the prominence of the social conservatives in the government , arguing that they may have risen by default rather than by design .
Stockwell Day and Jason Kenney — the top social - conservative figures in the cabinet — also happen to be two of Harper ’s few solid ministers .
Finally , in support of the notion that Harper accidentally strayed onto the abortion minefield , there is the matter of his failed effort to convince his caucus to support a recent Liberal motion that spelled out that the maternal health initiative covered the full range of contraception options .
If the motion had been adopted , especially with Conservative support , it would have put the matter to rest .
But since it was defeated , the government has endeavoured to showcase its anti-abortion creed .

And it has set out to put its aggressive social - conservatism stamp on other high - profile decisions — including moves to cut funding to a host of women advocacy groups and the Toronto Gay Pride Parade .
Having let the social conservatism genie out of the bottle , Harper now does seem inclined to embrace it .

Police have arrested two teenagers accused of driving past a woman and pushing her from her bike causing serious injuries .
The two males accused of the attack turned up at their local police station afterwards claiming there had been an accident but they were arrested .
The woman was hospitalised following the incident in which she told police she was pushed from her bike by a passing car at Officer , in Melbourne ’s outer southeast , about 12.30 pm .
The 53 - year - old woman from Berwick was allegedly riding west on the Princes Highway when a white Commodore travelling in the same direction changed lanes and slowed before the front seat passenger leant out of the window and pushed her .
The rider fell from her bike and onto the road surface as the Commodore sped off .
What It ’s Like To Drive On A Dubai Highway
Dubai ’s reputation as a playground for the rich and obnoxious is well known , but I did n’t realize that the government ’s willingness to look the other way applies to its roads as well .
This video features a typical afternoon drive on a Dubai highway – and by “ typical , ” I mean there ’s a jeep riding on two wheels and a truck doing figure eights across all four lanes of the highway in the middle of traffic .

While mulling through the amazing Lost prop auction in NYC's Vilcek Foundation , and debating how much rent money could we go with out to get our hands on Daniel Faraday 's journal , we got the opportunity to chat up Lost 's own Hurley , Jorge Garcia and executive producer , Carlton Cruse .
After Hurley explained that he was n't too upset that he was n't picked to be the next Jacob — " Nah " was the actual word Garcia used — and confiding that the only things he allegedly took home from the Lost set were fruit roll - up wrappers and his watercolor paintings , we got talking about the finale , and the inevitable fan backlash , such is the way with most genre shows .
What is the one thing you can't wait for everyone to see on the DVDs that they did n't show in the series ?

Jorge Garcia : I can't talk about the one thing that I can't wait .
Because I do n't know if it 's something that they are doing yet .
However , they are doing a bit on the writing of the finale and they came to my house to watch me read it .
There 's a moment where you see me get very emotional , that I 'm curious to see it myself .
Was it emotional for you just being a part of the cast for so long [ and reading the finale ] or was it emotional for you because you were going through what your character was going through ?

Jorge Garcia :
Um , I would give it a mix of both .
Working on a genre show , no matter what , there 's going to be backlash .
Are you ready for the backlash at the end , either because people are upset that it 's over or because they 're angry with the way it ended ?

Jorge Garcia : I 'm ready for it .
It was kind of great , in a sense , to have the " Across The Sea " episode come out , to kind of give us a little test run on that .
And so , I think I 'm ready for it .
We know what 's going to happen , just because you can't have this level of passion for a show without disappointing people when you make a bold choice .
So it 's going to happen .
And I 'm sure there will be people that will love the ending as well , so that will help make up for it .
Are you done being the " voice of the viewer " now , or will you miss that role ?
Jorge Garcia :
There 's a lot of aspects of the part that I 'm going to miss .
This was definitely a dream role for me .
And I did n't even know that going in , how great the part was going to evolve .
So yeah , there 's definitely going to be a transition .
There 's going to be kind of a moment where I 'm going to have to put Hurley to bed for good .
But it has n't quite happened yet .

Carlton Cuse :
A lot of people have been remarking that Lost has been doing a lot of showing and not telling , like with the glowing cave and other examples , you kind of have to figure it out for yourself .
Do you think that is accurate ?

Carlton Cuse : I think that we always feel as storytellers it 's better to show than to tell .
For instance , when our characters were in Dharma time , it 's much more interesting to have our characters exist in Dharma time than to have some old raggy Dharma character come stumbling out and say , " This is what it is like in 1977 Dharma time . "
We feel just as dramatists that 's the better way to go .
I think that you should expect that of the finale as well .
It 's a genre show , there 's always going to be backlash , you will never be able to make all the fans happy on a passionate show , there will always be backlash , how have you prepared for it ?

Carlton Cuse : Yeah I mean absolutely .
It would be impossible to write a finale that would make everybody happy .
We just did the best that we could .
We like it .
We hope that a lot of people like it .
But we understand that there will be people that wo n't .
And all we can say is that is we did our best and we ended the show the way we wanted to .
That was what we felt was the right thing to do .
Is there anything that you can't wait for people to see that will be on the DVD 's that was never aired ?

Carlton Cuse :
There are a lot of cool DVD features that are going to be a part of the end of the show .
Because we knew the show was ending and that gave the DVD people a chance to prepare and do things that you can't do if you 're show is sort of on the bubble and might get canceled .
So there is a real sense of conclusion and finality to it that 's very satisfying .
Is there anything , over the many years , that you would have done differently ?
Carlton Cuse : No .
I mean look , there are high water marks and low water marks in the show , and that happens with every television series .
We learned from the things that did n't work out as well as we would have liked .
I think that you can't throw out those things because they are learning experiences that ultimately helped shape the show .
So we 're not ending the show with any regrets .

What 's your favorite meme that 's happened because of the show ?
[ Edit note : I think he heard memory instead of meme , it was loud ]
Carlton Cuse :
There are many , but the most recent one was just being on the scoring stage for the final day of music recording for the finale .
That was one of the most emotional experiences of my life .
Listening to Michael Giacchino 's amazing music as it finished the scenes that we had written for the finale was just kind of profoundly emotional and something I 'll never forget .

Three family members have pleaded no contest in a Northern California car - towing scam in which authorities say they towed hundreds of cars , sold them without telling the owners , then sued them for the towing and storage fees .
Paul Greer , 33 , owner of the now - defunct B&C Towing , entered his plea Friday to 59 felony counts , including grand theft , perjury and embezzlement .
B&C Towing , whose trucks operated in Gilroy , Hollister and Clovis , would successfully sue car owners in small claims court because the company would provide false documentation that it notified the owners before they sold their vehicles , according to Santa Clara County prosecutors , who said the scam lasted nearly a decade .
" They were basically running a lawsuit mill , " Deputy District Attorney Dale Lohman said .
" It was a very complicated and elaborate fraud . "
Under terms of the plea deal , Greer will be sentenced to eight years in prison .
His sister , Rosemary Ball , also agreed to plead no contest Friday to obstruction of justice , attempted grand theft and perjury , and faces a sentence of four to six months in jail .
Her husband , Michael Ball , pleaded no contest to attempted grand theft and faces 150 days of electronic monitoring .
Greer 's father , Vincent Cardinalli , 67 , is the only family member still headed for trial .
He faces 99 felony counts in the case when the trial begins Aug. 16 .
If convicted , Cardinalli faces 186 years in prison .
Greer 's attorney , Eben Kurtzman , was not available for comment , and a message left at Cardinalli 's home was not returned .
Prosecutors said Greer sometimes sued people who were n't even the car owners but had a name similar to the owner .
He also sometimes failed to give notice of the lawsuits to win quick default judgments against the defendants , they said .
Greer persuaded at least three process servers to falsify court documents that would inflate the amount of his claims , according to prosecutors .
One of them , Jeffrey Horan , pleaded no contest in June 2008 to conspiracy and perjury .
“ Relevance has to be figured out on top of timeliness . ”

That 's an understatement .
The one thing common to feedreaders , Twitter and Friendfeed : they order articles by time , and so incent people to post often .
Keep posting , and your stuff is more likely to show up on people 's screens .
They become more likely to click on it , retweet it , share it on google reader , like it on friendfeed .
It can't be complete junk , of course ; if you spam people they 'll unsubscribe .
But keep posting mediocre stuff and they wo n't .
In fact , people grow more tolerant of mediocrity in their feedreaders .
Subscriptions have a way of getting out of control .
Past half a dozen sources people lose track of what they 're reading , and of who they 've subscribed to .
You can slip lots of crap by their eyeballs before they take the time to reorganize .
Some of your readers will give up on the medium for a time .
They 'll jump to the next great thing , somewhere along the facebook - twitter - friendfeed trajectory , and they 'll find it works so much better !
They 'll think it 's because of some shiny new feature in the new tool .
They 'll never realize it 's just that they 're subscribed to less crap .
So they 'll start subscribing to crap again , and the cycle will repeat .
A cynical strategy to game this world : write one smashing post every week or two , use it to get new readers .
Interleave the smashing posts with hundreds of short , simple , unique pieces .
They will keep you in the eyes of your readers once they 've subscribed .
Even if you are n't this cynical , these are powerful and subtle forces .
Most of us are n't pushing a brand or an agenda , and may not think we care much about clicks and links and shares .
But we respond to social feedback .
If more frequent posts yield more feedback , we post more frequently .
It 's easy to see the benefits , harder to see the ill - effects .
And ill - effects there are .
When our reading is sorted by time , nobody reads .
A conversational medium requires that its participants be good listeners .
The alternative is monologuing , the realm of exhibitionists , clueless advertisers , and spam .
When we 're incented to post more frequently , the world gradually degrades to an advertising free - for - all .
A garbage - in garbage - out world ; fewer people saying interesting things ; less diversity in what we read and who we read .
By shirking our reading we 're poisoning the well for ourselves .
Things must improve .
Improvements
It 's amazing how settled time - order has been in Web 2.0 .
Twitter is entirely realtime .
Facebook has lots of filtering options ; it 's unclear who uses them .
Friendfeed 's ' best of day ' view is a big improvement , but it is hamstrung in two ways .
First , it is n't the default , so most people never see it .
Second , it changes slowly and you can't page past the first page , so there is n't as much to read .
If you read a lot of stuff you will find yourself returning to the time - ordered view .
Friendfeed has a second mechanism to manage volume : it allows you to organize your subscriptions into ' lists ' .
Google Reader 's folders are analogous .
Folders help manage the volume / value tradeoff ; make sure you read the low volume feeds , then dip your toes into the torrent to taste .
They 're still a static organization , though .
Removing a feed from a folder is n't easy to do while reading , so we put it off , and our folders pile up cruft ( if we ever bother cleaning them up ) .
The cynical blogger gaming the system to stay in his reader 's feedreaders need change nothing when feedreaders get folders .
For the reader , removing a feed from a folder is as static and as hard as unsubscribing .
The good news is that things are easy to improve .
When I built my own feedreader , it was amazing how quickly I preferred it to Google reader .
A simple policy of fairness — I never show two stories from the same source — sufficed to compensate for nifty UI features , search , and social recommendations .
One can do much more .

KLIN , Russia —
The journalist sat before the investigators last month as they barraged him with questions :
Is n’t it true that you provoked police officers to attack you at an opposition rally ?
Is n’t it true that you wanted to lead protestors to storm government buildings ?
“ Did n’t you realize that by your actions , you were breaking the law ? ” one demanded .
The journalist , Pyotr Lipatov , would not budge , but he said he later realized what the investigators were seeking : for him to help them justify his severe beating at the hands of plainclothes police officers at the rally in this Moscow suburb .
The interrogation occurred more than a year after the beating in March 2009 .
The investigators tried to make Mr. Lipatov confess that he was responsible soon after The New York Times asked them why they had not charged the police officers .
Mr. Lipatov secretly taped the interrogation , which lasted more than six hours , and the recording represents a telling example of the way the authorities put intense pressure on journalists .
Mike Richards ’ physical play is getting under the skin of the Boston Bruins .
In particular — Marc Savard .
“ I mean , I do n’t know , ” said Savard about Richards after his team ’s Eastern Conference semifinal game 5 home loss to the Flyers .
“ That ’s the way he plays .
It ’s part of his demeanor .
He ’ll never change .
So I do n’t know . ”
Late in the third period of Monday ’s 4 - 0 Flyers victory , Richards cleanly wiped Savard out of the play on the corner boards .
Savard took exception to the hit and went back after Richards by cross checking him in the mouth and throwing a flurry of weak , gloved punches and head grabs .
Milan Lucic joined the fray by taking a couple of shots until the rest of the players came in relief .
Richards was left bleeding after the play and the Flyers received a power play .
“ I just got fired up , ” Savard told the Boston media .
“ I got one the other night in Philly from behind [ a boarding call on Darroll Powe ] , and then I was facing the glass again in the same situation and then I look back at [ David ] Booth , [ David ] Krejci , those guys … I mean , enough ’s enough .
I mean , I do n’t know .
That ’s all . ”
In game 3 , Richards knocked Boston forward David Krejci out with a hard but clean open - ice hit .
The force dislocated Krejci ’s wrist , which needed to be surgically repaired .
His season was ended .
If Savard thinks the physical play on him was bad before , complaining about it is only going to make it worse .
The Flyers have won back - to - back games and their dirty work is now showing its effectiveness over a long series .
The following infograph will change the way that you will think about bottled water for the rest of your life .
Tweet it | Facebook it
Other truths exposed
It ’s kind of crazy .
I ’ve been playing with Facebook ’s “ Posts By Everyone ” search feature recently , and many people who hide their profile information have no problem sharing sometimes really personal updates with the world .
Are there people on Facebook who do n’t understand how to keep their updates out of the public eye ?
And why does n’t Facebook allow for mobile updates to be private ?
Searching Everyone ’s Updates
You might have missed Facebook ’s “ Posts By Everyone ” feature .
It ’s easy to overlook because search results are n’t shown by default .
Consider this search for hungover :
When you start typing , Facebook suggests some options right within the search box .
Pick any of those , and you go directly to a person , page or application , rather than overall search results .
It ’s easy to do this by hitting enter , so that you never get the search results at all .
If you go to the very bottom , there ’s a “ More Results ” option as highlighted above .
Click that , and a broader set of results appears :
Notice on the left - hand side of the results , there are options to get results back from all these categories :
All Results
People
Pages
Groups
Applications
Events
Web Results
Posts By Friends
Posts By Everyone
In the search results above , you can see that “ All Results ” is highlighted , so I should be getting back results from all these categories .
However , that ’s not what happens .
Instead , Facebook only brings back results from matching Pages , Posts By Friends and Web Results .
That ’s it .
( This , by the way , is just one example of why I often joke to people who warn that Facebook will beat Google in search that Facebook has enough problems searching Facebook itself , much less the entire web . )
Now look what happens if I drill in to the “ Posts By Everyone ” category :
Suddenly I see what Facebook failed to show me before , all the people on Facebook telling the world about their hangovers .
Sharing Hangovers On Facebook & Twitter
Do these people all mean to share this way ?
Well , it ’s not like people on Twitter do n’t share about having hangovers :
They key difference between Facebook and Twitter is that at Twitter , by default you ’re sharing with the world .
At Facebook , the default for updates is to share only with your friends .
In other words , post to Twitter , and most people probably realize they ’re telling something to the world .
Post at Facebook , and many people might think they ’re only sharing with their friends .
Facebook ’s Warnings About Sharing To The World
Indeed , Facebook deserves credit in really making you jump through hoops before you can share an update to the world .
For example , here ’s what you get in a brand new account , before you ’ve ever even posted something :
That links over to a privacy FAQ page , and the only way the message disappears is if you manually click to close it .
If you do n’t close it , the message reappears each time you come back to the status area .
Beyond that , if you make an update and change from the default “ Only Friends ” option :
To the “ Everyone ” option , you get another warning :
After doing a post to everyone , your default remains stuck on “ Only Friends . ”
Facebook does n’t shift it to “ Everyone , ” something it could do if it wanted to try and get people to be more public about what they ’re sharing , something many people — including myself — suspect them of wanting to do .
You Hide Your Profile , But Not Your Updates ?
So why would I think some people do n’t understand the Facebook privacy settings , when it comes to updates , especially when they have so many hoops to jump through ?
Consider a search for hate my boss .
I ’m not going to put up a screenshot , because I do n’t want to immortalize anyone and get them in trouble .
But do that search , and you get posts like :
hate my job .
hate my boss .
i hate my job .
talked to my managers and boss did n’t help and made it worse
Do people saying these things realize that their bosses might also see the updates ?
To test , I went to the profiles of 10 people who each appeared in that “ hate my boss ” search .
Here ’s what I saw for all 10 of them ( I ’ve blanked out the name for the example shown ) :
The message tells me that this person is sharing only some of his info with everyone , right ?
And yet , I can see their updates .
In fact , if I select the “ Wall ” tab , I see all their updates nicely displayed .
If someone ’s boss found them by name on Facebook — which is n’t hard to do — they could do the same .
Why would all these people who keep their profiles locked down still share updates ?
One issue might be that by default , Facebook displays the “ this person shares only some things ” message to anyone who is n’t someone ’s friend , because chances are everyone has some tiny bit of information that by default is n’t shared on Facebook .
NOTE : See the postscript below about the next section .
In short , if your default settings are set to share with “ Only Friends , ” then posting via mobile does n’t change that , as I originally wrote .
I ’ve left the original section below in italics for the curious , but that ’s now how the situation currently operates .
Facebook ’s Mobile Free-For-All
Another reason is mobile .
I fired up the Facebook application for the iPhone .
There ’s a big “ What ’s on your mind ” box that appears at the top .
Enter something , like “ I hate my boss , ” and that message goes to your Wall — and to the world .
Unlike Facebook itself , there are no privacy settings that I can find in the application , no share with “ Only Friends ” choice .
If you share via the iPhone — and perhaps other mobile devices — you share with the world .
That ’s also true if you use Facebook ’s mobile site on the web .
There ’s no option there other than to share with the world .
Going back to those 10 people I reviewed ?
I can also see that 6 of them in the search results are tagged as sharing “ via the Mobile Web . ”
In contrast , for 10 people I looked at who said hate my boss on Twitter , only one seemed to do it via mobile .
Maybe some of those people on Facebook did n’t mean for their updates to go public .
Or , maybe they ’re just stupid or do n’t care .
I ca n’t fault Facebook for how it handles things on its full web site , in terms of highlighting privacy issues with updates .
On the mobile front , they look to be screwing up big time .
Advice For The Concerned
By the way , as Facebook ’s privacy issues ramp up , I read about more and more people wondering if they should cancel their Facebook accounts .
I went through a similar struggle last December ( see Now Is It Facebook ’s Microsoft Moment ? ) .
As a marketer , I ultimately decided I still needed to be on the Facebook platform .
But I also shifted to primarily sharing information through my fan page , where everything is public , by default .
I highly recommend fan pages to anyone .
It may be a way for you to feel you have more control on Facebook at a time when it ’s difficult to understand what Facebook is likely to change next .
Do n’t be put off on the weirdness of having a “ fan ” page .
Just think of it as a way to have a place on Facebook where you know everything is public , a constant reminder that what you say is being said to the world overtly — rather than a constant fear that what you say or do might get shared to the world without you realizing that .
Alternatively , just assume that all you do on Facebook is public , that there is no privacy .
Make that assumption , and you ’ll be relatively safe — assuming that apps do n’t start tracking all your web surfing habits and reporting back to the Facebook mothership or the world .
To be really safe , always log out of Facebook .
Advice For Facebook
To Facebook , my advice is more blunt .
Get your shit together .
Enough explanations that the web is more comfortable being public or everyone has “ granular ” privacy controls and other platitudes .
Each day , there seems to be some worry — just do a search for Facebook on Techmeme for a summary .
This week , we ’ve had everything from private chats being exposed to applications that add themselves to your profile .
Today , it ’s how people might be sharing to the world stuff they believe is private through your mobile applications .
Someone over there , anyone — stand up and scream that your company is screwing up big time on the privacy front .
You keep getting away with it so far , but that might not continue .
Postscript ( 5 pm Pacific ) : I ’ve been asked about whether your global profile settings in Facebook have any impact on what shows when you do a post .
It does .
Here ’s the rundown .
The appropriate setting can be found by selecting Account > Privacy >
Profile Information and then going to the “ Posts by Me ” option .
There , you can change things so that any posts are shared with :
Everyone
Friends Of Friends
Only Friends
Custom
If you select “ Everyone , ” then in addition to having an “ Info ” tab on your Facebook page , you ’ll also have a “ Wall ” tab that ANYONE can see , like this :
The Wall tab will have any of the posts you ’ve made and which were tagged as being shared with everyone .
I ’m not sure what happens if you had some “ Only Friends ” posts and then later opened up your wall , whether those get retagged for everyone or not .
If you select the “ Only Friends ” option , then that DOES seem to provide you protection on Facebook ’s mobile sites .
To test this , I ensured my default post settings were marked as “ Only Friends , ” then posted using both Facebook Mobile and via my iPhone app .
As described above , you ca n’t select any privacy option when posting this way .
But the good news is that your default privacy option is used .
Now , I could have sworn I ’d tested this before and found that it was sharing with Everyone , even if though my default was to share with “ Only Friends . ”
But it looks like I got that wrong .
I ’ve also switched back to my original headline of Facebook ’s “ Posts By Everyone ” Feature : Do People Realize They ’re Sharing To The World ?
which I used for several hours before switching to Posting To Facebook Via Mobile ?
No Update Privacy For You !
Keep in mind that you can override your default setting on a per post basis .
So if your default is “ Only Friends , ” you can choose to share a particular post with “ Everyone . ”
That wo n’t show on your Wall , because as explained , “ Only Friends ” as your default prevents your Wall tab from appearing .
However , it WILL be available within Facebook ’s “ Post By Everyone ” search .
Eventually , I expect to hear back from Facebook on this issue .
FYI , I put in a request to them to talk about these matters on Thursday , but I remain waiting to be connected with the right person .
Meanwhile , it ’s still a confusing issue to me why so many people might seem to be sharing personal things and yet have private profiles .
One answer may come from my post last December , Facebook ’s Privacy Upgrade Recommends I Be Less Private .
The covers how Facebook presented an “ update your privacy settings ” screen like this :
That change suggested that people make their posts public , by default .
Maybe many were happy to do this .
Perhaps some did this without realizing that this meant they would be sharing more widely .
Postscript 2 ( 5:10 pm Pacific ) : I ’m not losing my mind .
I figured out why my test failed .
It appears that if you do a post tagged for “ Only Friends , ” Facebook will let that post show - up in the “ Posts By Everyone ” results even though it ’s not a post that was made to everyone .
It should n’t be showing up there .
But it does — only for you .
That ’s why when I tested , I could see my “ private ” posts apparently being shown to the world if I posted using the mobile interfaces .
Defence Minister Peter MacKay on Saturday repeated the government 's official line that the country 's soldiers would be withdrawn from combat in Afghanistan next year , but he also suggested some Canadians might stay .
Canada is willing to continue mentoring Afghan police after the troop disengagement begins in summer 2011 , MacKay said as he wrapped up a three - day trip to the Central Asian country .
Canada currently has 48 civilian police — RCMP and municipal officers — and 40 military police mentoring Afghan police officers in Kandahar .
On Thursday , MacKay announced 90 more troops would be sent to help train local police and the national army , but at the time he said those new trainers would be brought home in 2011 .
" After 2011 , the military mission will end , " MacKay said Saturday .
" What we will do beyond that point in the area of training will predominantly be in the area of policing . "
Keeping up the police - training role might alleviate pressure from the United States , which has pressed Ottawa to extend its military commitment .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CBC last month that " I 'm not going to sit here and tell you we 're happy " with Canada 's plans to bring its forces home next year .
But she also said the Afghan mission needs countries willing to commit to non-combat work .
" We do need non -combat forces , for example , for training and logistical work , " Clinton said .
MacKay would n't unequivocally say Saturday whether troops might remain deployed past the withdrawal deadline to train the Afghan National Army — in addition to whatever civilians or soldiers stay behind to instruct police — but he strongly intimated it was unlikely .
" Let 's be clear , it 's speculation at this point .
We 're talking over a year before Canada 's military mission will end , " the defence minister said .
A parliamentary motion passed March 13 , 2008 , calls for Canada to " end its presence in Kandahar as of July 2011 " and for all forces to have left by the following December .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper subsequently said that the vast majority of troops would be out of Afghanistan , and not just Kandahar , by the deadline .
About 2,830 Canadian troops are deployed in Afghanistan , mostly in the southern province of Kandahar , as part of NATO 's International Security Assistance Force .
Since 2002 , when the mission began , 141 Canadian soldiers have been killed .
Four Canadian civilians have also been killed .
Never before in the history of the Idiot of the Week awards have I missed something so egregious that a special announcement during the week is required .
This , dear readers , is truly a first .
I just wish this one was a bit more fun and far less stomach - turning .
It seems that the Catholic League 's Bill Donohue has decided to weigh into the growing Catholic child rape scandal yet again .
After blaming the Catholic abuse scandal on homosexuality and arguing that we should n't call it pedophillia because some of the victims were 12 or 13 , you probably did n't think Donohue could possibly top himself .
You 'd be wrong .
He is now insisting that not all child rape is abusive because some victims have a difficult time separating from their abusers .
Think Progress does a good job of explaining what makes this claim so absurd .
I have to assume that Donohue would blame women and children who found themselves trapped in a domestically abusive relationship too .
I wonder if he'd blame all crime victims .
Surely they must have done something wrong if his god was n't protecting them , right ?
I can think of few things more despicable than this sort of victim blaming .
The evidence is clear that the Catholic church has been enabling continued child rape by members of their clergy .
The lengths to which Bill Donohue will go to defend a fairytale and an institution built on exploiting others through this fairytale speaks volumes about the evil of which men are capable .
Opera Mini , the worlds most popular mobile Web browser , was submitted to Apple App store more than 16 days ago and theres still no news from Apple whether Opera Mini will be accepted or not .
According to iPhone Dev Center 95 % of new Apps are reviewed in the last 7 days , which makes Opera Mini a special case where Apple needs more than double their average review time to come up with a decision .
Opera made a compelling case for Opera Mini on iPhone by demonstrating how Opera is six times faster than Safari on iPhone and uses less bandwidth by compressing 90 % of the data sent to your mobile device .
Apple has a history of not approving apps that duplicate core functionality of the iPhone but is some special cases Apple breaks its own rules .
Another possibility that Opera Mini might be rejected is the fact that Opera doesnt use webkit as their rendering engine which all third party browsers are required to use in order to be accepted .
( There is a possibility that Chrome might me ported to iPhone because it also relies on Webkit rendering engine . )
Opera using webkit would nullify the whole point of Opera Minis selling point that it is faster than Safari .
Although Opera Minis beautiful and intuitive UI is compelling enough reason , it is highly unlike that Opera will rewrite their browser so that it can use webkit rendering engine .
Specially now that Opera did a massive amount of performance improvements to its new rendering engine Presto and new JavaScript engine Carakan , which is currently the fastest JavaScript engine around according to Sunspider JavaScript Benchmark .
Whatever decision comes from Apple App review it will have an impact on the possibility of other non-webkit browsers being ported to iPhone OS .
As for Opera , they continues to lead the way with browser innovations .
Conservation attention notice .
What definitions from the Haskell 98 Prelude tend to get hidden ?
I informally take a go over the Prelude and mention some candidates .
(. ) in the Prelude is function composition , that is , ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> b ) -> a -> c .
But the denizens of #haskell know it can be much more than that : the function a -> b is really just the functor , so a more general type is Functor f => ( b -> c ) -> f b -> f c , i.e. fmap .
Even more generally , (. ) can indicate morphism composition , as it does in Control .
Category .
all , and , any , concat , concatMap , elem , foldl , foldl1 , foldr , foldr1 , mapM_ , maximum , minimum , or , product , sequence_ .
These are all functions that operate on lists , that easily generalize to the Foldable type class ; just replace [ a ] with Foldable t => t a .
They can be found in Data .
Foldable .
mapM , sequence .
These functions generalize to the Traversable type class .
They can be found in Data .
Traversable .
Any numeric function or type class .
Thurston , Thielemann and Johansson wrote numeric - prelude , which dramatically reorganized the hierarchy of numeric classes and generally moved things much closer to their mathematical roots .
While dubbed experimental , it 's seen airplay in more mathematics oriented Haskell modules such as Yorgey 's species package .
Any list function .
Many data structures look and smell like lists , and support some set of the operations analogous to those on lists .
Most modules rely on naming convention , and as a result , list - like constructs like vectors , streams , bytestrings and others ask you to import themselves qualified .
However , there is Data .
ListLike which attempts to encode similarities between these .
Prelude .
Listless offers a version of the Prelude minus list functions .
Monad , Functor .
It is widely believed that Monad should probably be an instance of Applicative ( and the category theorists might also have you insert Pointed functors in the hierarchy too . )
The Other Prelude contains this other organization , although it is cumbersome to use in practice since the new class means most existing monad libraries are not usable .
repeat , until .
There is an admittedly oddball generalization for these two functions in Control .
Monad .HT .
In particular , repeat generalizes the identity monad ( explicit ( un ) wrapping necessary ) , and until generalizes the ( -> ) a monad .
map .
It 's fmap for lists .
zip , zipWith , zipWith3 , unzip .
Conal 's Data .
Zip generalize zipping into the Zip type class .
IO .
By far you 'll see the most variation here , with a multitude of modules working on many different levels to give extra functionality .
( Unfortunately , they 're not really composable ... )

「 グーグルのエンジニアがSafariのためにコードを書くこともあるんですよ。WebKitコミュニティの中では、そのほうが物事の進みが速いという不文律のようなものがあるんです」
こう語るのは、グーグル でChrome開発に携わるソフトウェア・エンジニアの鵜飼文敏氏だ。鵜飼氏はChromeに機能を追加するために、WebKitコミュニティでWebSocketの設計、実装なども行なっている。

WebKitは不思議なプロジェクトだ。よく知られているように、Google Chrome とApple Safari（およびiPhoneやiPadに搭載されるそのモバイル版のMobile Safari）は、オープンソースベースで開発が進む「WebKit」というコードベースを共有している。ここにさらに、WebKitを統合したGUI開発フレームワーク「Qt」を抱えるノキアや、搭載ブラウザをWebKitベースのものに置き換えようとしているBlackBerryのRIMが加わり、WebKitチームは今やアップル、グーグル、ノキア、RIMなどのベンダに所属するエンジニアたち（リスト）が、同居するプロジェクトとなっている。各ベンダが提供する最終的なWebブラウザを詳しくみていけば、レンダリングエンジン以外の部分、例えばJavaScriptエンジンやグラフィックスライブラリで違いはあるが、これらのブラウザは基本となるコア部分を共有している。
WebKitプロジェクト
標準化の舞台は、大手ベンダの駆け引きや政治の場となることが多いが、WebKitの開発コミュニティでは、そうしたベンダの思惑が絡むことはないのだろうか？
「 それはありません。技術的な理由で、誰かが特定の提案に対してイヤだというようなことはありますが、それは所属組織というよりも、エンジニア個人個人の判断ですね」（鵜飼氏）
WebKitコミュニティは、ほかのオープンソースコミュニティと大きな違いはなく、レビュワー、コミッター、コントリビューターと呼ばれる人々が、それまでの貢献実績やコードの品質によって選ばれる仕組みになっているという。
レビュワー はWebKitプロジェクトの門番のような人々で、どういうコードをWebKitに入れるか、入れないかを決めている。
レビュワーになれるのは、大量のパッチをコミットしているか、ある程度レビューの実績がある人。WebKitの全体像やコードの書き方が分かっているということで推薦されて、反対意見がない場合にレビュワーとなれる。
コミッターは文字通り、コードをレポジトリにコミットできる権限を持つ人。コミッターはレビュワーが選ぶ。
民主的で実力主義的な仕組みは、ほかのオープンソースと変わらない。人間臭い組織である点も同様だ。
「 レビューの通し方として、IRCでいかに（担当となるレビュワーを）捕まえて話すかとか、何か困っていることがあれば、それを助けるなどしていかに自分のvisibilityを高めていくかも、案外重要です」（鵜飼氏）
WebKitはマルチプラットフォーム対応で、プラットフォームに依存する部分とそうでない部分が分かれている。依存部分は、Mac OS X、Qt、GTK、Windowsなどのそれぞれで、Xcode、Qmake、autoconf、Visual Studioなどの関連ファイルが存在していて、それぞれ異なるビルドシステムに対応している。現在、WebKitコミュニティで、この煩雑さを解決しようという話も出てきているというが、現状では1つのファイルを追加するだけでも非常に面倒な作業が発生しているという。
このため、何か新機能を実装したら、まずプラットフォーム依存部分としてSafari対応を優先的に行うことで、アップル在籍者が多くを占めるWebKitチーム内で物事が進みやすくなる。それが冒頭の発言で、グーグルのエンジニアがSafariのコードを書くことがあるという理由だ。
企業のカルチャーの違いも
WebKitチームでは、それぞれの参加者の所属組織が持つワークフローやコーディングスタイル、テストに対する考え方の違いなどが感じられることもあるという。
タブ幅をスペース2つとするか4つとするかなど細かなコーディングスタイルの違いが意外に面倒なこともあるというが、より興味深いのは仕事の進め方の違いのほうだ。
鵜飼氏はHTML5関連規格のWebSocketの設計文書（design doc）を起こし、実際に実装も行ったが、これはグーグルのやり方だという。
「 何か解決すべき課題があるとき、過去にこういう経緯があって、こういう問題があるので、こういう機能を実装したい、というのをdesign docという形で文書化するんですね。グーグルでは、それをレビューして仕様や実装を決めていく。ところがWebKitにはそういう文化がなくて、せっかく書いてもまず反応が返ってくることはありませんね（笑）」（鵜飼氏）
コメントの書き方でも、かなり違いがあるという。
「グーグルは非常にコメントを好みます。ソースコードのヘッダや、メソッドごとに詳細に何をしているかを書きたがります。WebKitのほうは、ソースコード中にはあまり書かず、みんながChangelogに追記していく感じです。誰もがChangelogを更新するため、面倒な衝突の問題があるのですが……」（鵜飼氏）
WebKitにユニットテストがあまりないのも、グーグルの文化と異なるところだという。
「 WebKitに はDump Renderer Treeというテスト用アプリがあって、それにHTMLを食わせるんです。それぞれのコンポーネントにユニットテストというものは用意されていません。ユニットテストをやろうという人もWebKitの中にはいるので、これは単に歴史的経緯ではないかとも思いますが」（鵜飼氏）
もう1つ、実装の進め方でグーグルのエンジニアが戸惑いを感じるのが、レビューのワークフローだという。HTML5で大幅に機能強化されるWeb Forms関連の実装を行っているグーグルのソフトウェア・エンジニア、田村健人氏は、こう述べる。
グーグル ソフトウェア・エンジニア、田村健人 氏
「 グーグル社 内 やChromiumの場合、コードを書いた人がレビュワーを指定するんですが、WebKitのほうは単にバグトラッカーにパッチを出すだけ。誰にもレビューされずに放置されることもあります。レビュワーにはそれぞれ専門分野があって、それぞれの分野ごとのレビュワーの数が少ない、という問題もあるんだと思います」（田村氏）
実際、田村氏 はWeb Forms関連のコードを2009年秋ごろにはバグトラッカーに登録していたが、半年ほど放置状態だったという。
Google Chromeは確実に進歩している
さまざまなバックグラウンドを持つ開発者が集まるWebKitチームには、やや同床異夢の趣きが感じられなくもないが、ともあれ、現在OperaやFirefoxと並んでWebの世界を強力に進化させる推進力の1つとなっていることは間違いない。
WebKitの進化とも歩調を合わせるかのように、Google Chromeも登場以来2年足らずでずいぶん進歩を遂げているようだ。シニア エンジニアリング マネージャーの及川卓也氏は「 Google Chromeは、そのときどきで開発が進んで行っていて、確実に進歩しています」と言う。
グーグル シニア エンジニアリング マネージャー 及川卓也 氏
バージョンアップが細かで頻繁なため、1つ1つは見逃してしまいそうなこともあるが、過去半年程度でChromeは大幅に機能が強化されている。Google Chromeのリリース実績は以下の通り。
Chrome beta 2008/9 Chrome 1 2008 /12 Chrome 2 2009 /5 Chrome 3 2009/10 Chrome 4 2010 /1 Chrome 5 beta 2010 / 5 Google Chromeの各バージョンのリリース時期
単純なバージョン比較には意味がないが、例えばIEのバージョン1が出てから5が出るまでに5年、5が出てから8が出るまでに9年かかっている。Google Chromeは、登場初期のIEを上回るペースで頻繁にメジャーバージョンアップしている。
Chromeに入りつつあるHTML5関連の新機能
以下、及川氏らの説明を元に、現在Chromeの開発版に入っていて、まもなく安定版にも順次搭載されることになるものを中心に、HTML5関連の新機能を紹介したい（Chromiumプロジェクトが公開している2010年3月時点での機能リスト）。canvas、video/audioなど、すでに良く知られていて動きの少ないものは省略する。
Dedicated Workers
すで にChrome 3から入っているが、JavaScriptを使って 「 Web Wokers」と名付けられた別プロセスによる処理が可能になっている。Web Workersには、複数のページやWorkerから共有するShared Workersと、生成元ページからのみ参照できるDedicated Workersがある。Worker同士はMessagePortsを使ってデータのやりとりができるが、これもChrome 4に搭載済みという。
LocalStorage
Web Storageの一部 でChrome 4から搭載されている 。Coockieに代わってクライアント側に構造化されたデータ（キー・値のペア）を保存できる仕様。例えば、textareaに入力された文字をキーイベンドが発生するたびにlocalStorageに保存するようにしておけば、ブラウザのタブを閉じたり、クラッシュしても、再び同じページを開けば書きかけの文字列がtextareaに表示されるというUIを実装できる（Mozillaのサンプルページ）。LocalStorageには、sessionStorageと呼ばれるもう1つの仕様があるが、これはChrome 5に搭載予定。こちらは、複数のタブで同一サイトのページを利用しているとき、Cookieで起こり得る問題を解決するものだという。
LocalStorageに似た仕様に、Web SQL Databaseと呼ばれるものもあるが、これは仕様策定自体がストップしてしまっている。クライアント側に保存したデータのソートや検索といった簡単なことができる仕様だったが、「SQLiteに依存しすぎていたのが問題。実装に左右されるのがおかしい」（及川氏）という議論の結果だという。ただ、一度実装したWeb SQL DatabaseはWebKitから取り除かれることは将来的にもないので、「iPhoneやGoogle Chromeのextensionではどうぞ自信を持って使ってくださいとお話させていただいています」（及川氏）という。
WebSocket
正式な名称 が 「 Web Sockets 」だった り 「 WebSocket」だったり、半角スペースや単数複数で揺れている感じもする仕様だが、「WebSocket」ということで、ようやく仕様も固まりつつあるようだ。すでにChrome 4に実装されているほか、「 Chrome 5に向けて、Web WorkerでWebSocketを使えるようにしました」（鵜飼氏）という。
WebSocketはサーバとクライアントがTCP/IPのソケット通信に似たようなインターフェイスで双方向通信ができる仕組み。HTTPと異なり、毎回セッションが切れるのではなく、つなぎっぱなしにしてリアルタイム性の高い通信ができる。
ただ、WebSocketは今年（2010年）に入ってからも、まだプロトコルが変わっているという段階。例えばHTTPからWebSocketプロトコルにupgradeするときのハンドシェークの方法などが変更になっている。「もともとアマチュアプログラマでもサーバを作れるようにとシンプルにしたんですが、既存のHTTPサーバでかえって実装が難しいという問題がありました」（鵜飼氏）。ハンドシェークは、チャレンジ・レスポンスで“nouce”の授受を行う方式に変更されたが、これは「 Cross Protocol Attack」と呼ばれる攻撃を防ぐセキュリティ上の意味もあるという。ほかにも、ソケットを閉じる際に“フレームバイト”と呼ばれる2バイトの終端記号を受け取ってからクローズして、oncloseでイベントが飛ぶときに、正常closeと異常closeの区別がつくようになるなど、よりキッチリした仕様となっている印象だ。
WebSocketはセッションを張りっぱなしにできるため、クライアント側からのポーリングやXHRを使うことなくリアルタイム性を上げられる。このため、グーグルでは「インフラ部分を含めてプロダクトでの実装を進めている」（鵜飼氏）という。具体的なプロダクトは未公表というが、WebSocket採用でメリットが大きそうなものとして、Google Docs、Google Talk 、Google Waveなど、多くのアプリケーションが思い浮かぶ。
WebSocketはHTTPで実現するCometなどに比べて、ヘッダーが不要となる分、はるかに効率が良い。このためサーバの負荷は下がると予想されるが、実際にはロードバランサの設計を変える必要が出てくるなど、まだ議論の最中という。また、現状ではWebSocketを使ったアプリケーションはデバッグが大変なので、今後はWebKit InspectorにもWebSocketを統合しようとしているところだという。
ほかのブラウザベンダでは、WebSocketの実装はどうなっているのだろか？
「 Mozillaは昔からパッチがあります。ただ、延々と（Firefox本体には）入っていません。Operaからは、われわれのところにどうやってテストしているのかという質問が来ていたり、仕様にコメントを出してきているので実装を検討していると思います」（鵜飼氏）
Rubyタグ
Chrome 4で基本的なルビ（ふりがな）をサポート。RubyタグはIEではかなり以前から実装されているが、互換性を持っているという。CSS3ではルビのネストができたり、複雑な仕様もあるが、現在ChromeがサポートするのはシンプルなRubyという。
例えば日本国際教育支援協会の「日本語能力試験」のページ（http://www.jees.or.jp/jlpt/）ではrubyタグが使われていて、Chromeではこのように表示される
Web Fonts
クライアント側にインストールされているフォントではなく、Webページ製作者がサーバ上にフォントファイルを置いておいてクライアントにダウンロード、表示させる「
Web Fonts」の仕組み がChrome 4で実装されている。これにより、Webデザインの幅が大きく広がる（例えば、Mozilla JapanのJohn Daggett氏が公開しているサンプルページは、フリーのM+フォントを使っていて、Web Fonts対応ブラウザで見ればクライアントにインストールされていないフォントであるにも関わらず、正しく表示されるのが確認できるはずだ）。
Web Fonts は、CSS3 のFonts Moduleに含まれていて、 「 ＠font- face」という指定で外部リソースをURLで指定できる。IE、Safari、Opera、Firefoxなども対応しているほか、新たに2009年10月にMozillaがFirefox 3.6で実装した「 Web Open Font Format 」 （WOFF ）が、IE9 やChrome 、Operaを含むブラウザベンダをはじめ、フォントデザインなどの支持を集めつつあるようだ。WOFFは、既存のTrueType、OpenTypeなどのフォントファイルを圧縮し、著作権者や利用許諾に関するメタ情報を1つにまとめるアーカイブ形式。ダウンロードに適している。実はWeb FontsはIE4の時代にも1度注目を集めているが、利用が進まなかった過去がある。Webデザインや電子書籍への関心がかつてより高いこと、ネットワーク帯域が改善されたこと、合意が得られるフォント配布形式が登場しつつあることなどから、今回は普及の見通しがあるのかもしれない。
Web Fontsはサーバから送られてくるフォントのレンダリングを行うので、セキュリティ上の懸念がある。このため、Chromeではサニタイズライブラリ「 Sanitiser for OpenType」（ots）を開発したという。lengthやoffsetなど、攻撃に使われそうなプロパティもチェックしている。ちなみに、同じWebKitベースのブラウザを持つアップルは、サニタイズはOSがやるべき仕事ということで、Safariにはこうしたコードは入っていないという。
Web Forms 2
多くの制限があるにも関わらずWebアプリケーションが台頭した理由の1つは、HTMLにフォーム（formタグ）が用意されていたことだろう。クライアントからテキストによる入力や、ラジオボタンによる選択結果を受け取り、サーバで処理をして、その結果何かを表示するといったシンプルなモデルが、非常に多くの応用を生んだ。
一方で 、Webアプリケーションが多様化してくるにつれて、既存のフォームの限界も明らかになってきた。
例えば、入力されたメールアドレスの形式が正しいかどうかの検証をサーバにデータを送信する前にブラウザで行うとか、ある範囲に収まるようスライダーバーで数値を利用者に選択してもらう、あるいは日時を選択する際にカレンダーを表示して選択を促すといったことは、HTMLだけで行うことはできず、多くのWebサイトはJavaScriptライブラリやFlashによる実装を行って来た。
気が利い たWebサービスを複数使っていればすぐに気づくことだが、苦労して実装している機能はどこのサイトも似たり寄ったり。こうしたことから、フォームに必要とされる高度な機能を取り込んで進化したのがHTML5に含まれるWeb Forms 2だ 。
「 Formsは、とて もHTML5の考え方が表れている仕様です。JavaScriptでやれば凝ったこともできるけど、HTMLだけで手軽に、簡単なことだけをやりたいということを実現したもの、それがHTML5です」（及川氏）
WebKit （Chromium） でForms 2を実装している田村氏によれば、Formsの実装は「 Operaが進んでいて、WebKitやChromiumも比較的進んでいる状態」という。例えば、Operaでは「input type=datatime」と指定すれば、カレンダーが表示され「今日」ボタンを押して選択するようなこともできる。
現在はブラウザの実装が追いついていないものの「#ffcc88」などのRGB値を入力する際に使える、いわゆるカラーピッカーも、「input type=color」というHTMLのformだけで、使えるようになるという。
新た にFormには検索用の「 search」や範囲指定の「range」を指定するUIが加わった。検索専用のUIでは「×」をクリックすることで入力済みの文字を全消去できるなどブラウザ側でユースケースに応じた実装をするようだ。Rangeのほうはスライダーバーで数値などを直感的に指定できる。
「 : invalid」というCSSの擬似セレクタを使うことで、入力データのバリデーションをブラウザで行った結果をformのスタイルに適用できるようになった。上の欄は未入力のため赤く光っている。下は入力文字列がEmail形式に従っていないため赤くなっているが、この後に1文字入れれば赤が消えて形式チェックに適合したことユーザーに分かるようになっている。こうしたことは従来JavaScriptで書く処理だったが、HTMLとCSSだけで実現できるようになる。ちなみにメールアドレスの形式は、日本国内の携帯電話でしか使われていないピリオドの連続なども受け付けるよう実装しているという。
inputタグの属性としてプレースホルダ（placeholder）が使えるようになった。仮に入力されたように見える文字列を表示できる。従来、こうした処理は、淡い色でテキストを事前に表示しておき、キーイベントに応じて動的に消すという処理をJavaScriptで実現する必要があった。HTML5のForm対応ブラウザであれば、こうした処理は手軽に実現できる。また、HTML5非対応であっても、こうした属性は無視されるだけなので互換性の問題も小さく済むよう考えられている。
上は入力文字数制限ができる様子のデモ。下は複数ファイル選択を可能とするデモ。「input type=file multiple」と書くことで、非対応ブラウザでも単一ファイル選択のダイアログが出るよう互換性に配慮されている。
Formには、さまざまな新タイプが用意されている。バリデーションだけでなく、入力の補助となるUIをブラウザ側で実装していくことになり、色であればカラーピッカーをその場で表示する、日付選択ならカレンダーを表示するといったことを実現していくという。
最新版 のOperaなら、上記のFormにある日付入力の場所でカレンダーが表示される。これはJavaScriptによる表示ではなく、ブラウザ側の機能。
その他
このほ かChromeに入りつつあるHTML5関連の新機能としては、「 Application Cache 」 （Webアプリケーションを構成するファイルをローカルに保存して実行できるようにする仕様）、「 Geolocation API 」（経度・緯度情報をJavaScriptで取得するAPI。実際の位置情報の取得方法はブラウザごとに異なる）、「ドラッグ＆ドロップの強化」（ブラウザ外部からブラウザへのファイルのドロップ対応。一部機能は実装済み）、「
File API 」（ローカルのファイルを読み出すためのAPI）、「デスクトップ・ノーティフィケーション」（ブラウザや特定のタブにフォーカスがないときにでもメッセージを表示する小ウィンドウが出せる仕様）などがある。
また、その先 のChrome 6に向けては、「 WebGL 」 （3Dグラフィックス）、「 3D Transforms 」 （CSSで3次元的なアニメーションを行う仕様）、「registerProtocolHandler」（mailto:などのURLプロトコルからWebアプリを呼び出す仕様）、「リッチテキスト編集」（装飾のあるテキストの編集を標準化した仕様。現在は仕様検討のためのドキュメントの段階）、「CSS3 paged media 」 （HTMLでページ分割を想定したメディア向けのCSS仕様）、「ディレクトリ・アップロード」（ファイル単位ではなく、ディレクトリ単位で複数ファイルをアップロードする仕様）などがある。

" I am Mohammed and I taste good , " says the pasta box in the cartoon .
On top of the cartoon images ( but no longer on her website ) was an announcement explaining the rationale behind the event .
In declaring May 20th to be " Everybody Draw Muhammad Day , " Seattle artist Molly Norris created a poster - like cartoon showing many objects -- from a cup of coffee to a box of pasta to a tomato -- all claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad .
The outcry from Comedy Central 's decision to censor an episode of South Park with depictions of Muhammad last week led a cartoonist and a Facebook user to fight back .
That is until they realized it might be controversial , apparently .
... television show South Park ( for depicting Mohammed in a bear suit ) by bloggers on Revolution Muslim 's website , we hereby deemed May 20 , 2010 as the first annual " Everybody Draw Mohammed Day , " the original artwork reads .
On Friday , Norris told a radio talk show host in Seattle that she came up with the idea because " as a cartoonist , I just felt so much passion about what had happened ... " noting that " it 's a cartoonist 's job to be non -PC . "
That passion , it appears , has lessened .
And fast .
Her stark website today reads : " " I am NOT involved in " Everybody Draw Mohammd [ sic ] Day ! "
" I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it .
Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites , etc .
Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff , " she writes .
It went viral , however , because she was the one who passed it around .
Sending it to people like , a popular Seattle - based blogger and nationally syndicated sex advice columnist .
Once it became a national story she reeled back , asking Savage -- in an email he provided to The Ticket -- if he would " be kind enough to switch out my poster " with another one -- a much tamer version which has no images attributed to Muhammad .
" I am sort of freaked out about my name / image being all over the place , " her e-mail reads .
He did n't change it , nor did he post the tamer version .
Besides , after Savage posted it , many other sites picked it up including The Atlantic and Reason
When asked about her change of heart , Norris told The Ticket that she did n't intend for the cartoon " to go viral . "
Then why did she send the cartoon to the media in the first place ?
" Because I 'm an idiot , " Norris replied .
" This particular cartoon of a ' poster ' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve , something I was totally unprepared for , " she said .
She does n't appear to be alone .
The creator of a Facebook page dedicated to the day has bowed out as well .
told the Washington Post ( before abandoning ship ) that he created the page because he " loved [ Norris 's ] creative approach to the whole thing -- whimsical and nonjudgmental .
" While he was still associated with his own event he said : " To me , this is all about freedom of expression and tolerance of other viewpoints , so I hope you 'll help make this a sandbox that anyone can play in , if they want .
I do n't think it'd be right under the circumstances for me ( or anyone ) to censor inflammatory posts * ahem * , but let 's be welcoming and inclusive , mmkay ?
" Apparently the posts were n't " welcoming " enough , as on Sunday morning he announced his departure from the cause .
" I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet , " he writes .
" Y'all go ahead if that 's your bag , but count me out .
" Did he think people were going to post flattering images ?
That 's what Facebook user Douglas Armstrong wondered too .
" You created an event inviting people to submit pictures of Mohammed , " Armstrong wrote .
" And apparently you 're so new to the Internet that you did n't foresee what would happen ?
" Although Wellington had abandoned his cause , he apparently was sticking around to answer questions .
To Armstrong 's question , Wellington responded : " I guess I had more faith in human nature than was warranted . "
Another user , Paul St. George , had little patience for Wellington .
" If you 're not going to attend your own event then take it down dumbass and quit boring us . "

May 3 , 2010  --
Remember when reporters had guts ?
In the late ' 70s , when I was just out of college , and even before I began my career as a journalist , I worked in public relations at Hewlett - Packard Co .
These were the final years of HP as " the world 's greatest company " under its two founders .
...
And being in such comfortable and friendly surroundings and working for such an enlightened employer basically spoiled me for any other job thereafter .
Indeed , there were only two problems with that job :
1 . I did n't want to be a PR man ;
2. Mark Simon .
As it happened , the two were closely related .
Simon was a great big , linebacker - sized guy who was both whip - smart and tough .
He was a few years older than me and was working for a weekly industry newsprint tabloid called Electronic News .
EN was notorious for underpaying its reporters ( which was why they were usually young and destined to quickly move on ) and for having neither the time nor inclination to do much more editorially than rewrite corporate press releases .
That is , until Mark Simon came along .
He was as young and transient as the rest of EN 's reporters ; but he was also clever and fearless .
Suddenly , under his byline , stories started appearing the likes of which the electronics trade press , notoriously deferential to the giant companies of the tech world , had never seen .
Simon broke insider stories , published internal strategy memos and pre-introduced secret projects , all with seeming abandon ... leaving corporate PR departments , like us at HP , scrambling to do damage control and plug the leaks .
As the kid in HP corporate PR department , I both feared Simon for the damage he could do with his breaking stories -- my turf was hugely successful calculator business -- and was in awe of his reporting skills .
I also was n't allowed to talk much with him when he came into our offices for fear I would slip up and accidentally give my counterpart another news hook .
It was n't until years later , when I was a reporter myself ( and talked with Mark ) that I came to realize that all Simon was doing was just good hard reporting .
His techniques ranged from learning to read upside down the memos on executives ' desks while conducting interviews , cold calling low - level employees who did n't know better than to talk with the press , pretending to know information to get official confirmation , and the whole rest of the toolkit of good investigative reporting .
Mark also told me that the biggest source for his insider information was , in fact , the rising golden boy executive at HP , who got a kick out of making controlled leaks to manipulate the press and his counterparts at the company .
Publishing iPhone Prototype Pics : Was What Jason Chen Did Illegal ?
Mark went on to become a distinguished political reporter in Sacramento for the San Francisco Chronicle .
And , having seen him in action , I redoubled my efforts to become a newspaperman myself -- which I accomplished a couple years later .
And in those first years in the newsroom , I tried to pattern myself on what I had seen of Simon in action .
He was my gold standard .
That was a long time ago .
But what 's important today about that story is that no matter how furious HP was at Mark Simon 's ability to pre-announce its products and expose internal company documents , it never once crossed anyone 's mind to call the cops on him .
Sure , the company complained to the top editors at EN .
They threatened leakers with being fired if they were exposed ( ironically , that order came from the chief leaker himself -- which should serve as a warning to those who immediately assume that all insider information is , by definition , stolen ) .
And they tried to cut off all access by Simon to the company ( he kept publishing leaks anyway ) .
But no one at Hewlett - Packard ever thought that what Mark Simon was doing was illegal .
No one thought he did n't have the right , as a reporter , to publish that insider information he had .
Indeed , even when he pre-announced a $ 1 billion new product and completely screwed up our plans for a press conference and elaborate media roll - out , no one ever considered it a crime .
Only that he was just an infuriatingly good reporter , and that we needed to do a better job of security on our side .
Now , roll forward 35 years .
A couple weeks ago , Jason Chen , an editor / blogger at the tech site Gizmodo ( part of the large gossip blog family Gawker Media ) found himself in possession of a prototype of the new Apple G4 iPhone and proceeded to post photos of it on the site .
As you can imagine , all hell broke loose as the Web buzzed with speculation about the source of the images , whether the device was stolen , and whether it really was Apple 's newest super - product .
What we now know is that the device was indeed a G4 iPhone , not scheduled for formal introduction for weeks hence ; and that it was n't stolen , but accidentally left by an Apple employee in a Silicon Valley beer garden .
Whoever found it was knowledgeable enough to know what it was -- and proceeded to sell it to Gawker for a purported $ 5,000 .
Does California 's Shield Law Protect Bloggers Like Chen ?
So far , it 's a classic story : idiot employee , who will no doubt soon be fired , leaves a valuable piece of insider information in a bar ... and it eventually makes its way to an enterprising journalist .
The money changing hands is a little distressing , but not without precedent .
At this point , the publication should be crowing about its scoop and the company should be chagrined and doubling up on its security .
But we live in a different world now , far removed from the rough and tumble world of " The Front Page . "
In the interregnum between the death of old media and the rise of the new , journalism has temporarily lost most of its muscle -- a dangerous situation in a nation built on a powerful free press .
So , what happened ?
This week , Chen 's house was raided by officers from California 's Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team ( REACT ) , a special task force of police officers and federal agents created to combat computer - related crimes -- and which just happens to have Apple on its steering committee .
The cops took all of Chen 's computer equipment .
Meanwhile , the San Mateo County district attorney is considering whether to bring charges against Chen .
It all hinges around whether California 's journalist shield law covers bloggers .
Well , speaking as someone who was an investigative reporter for one of the nation 's top 10 newspapers :
Of course it does .
This is appalling .
As Instapundit uber - blogger Glenn Reynolds has rightly noted , this is basically " gangland politics , " with one side getting to use to the police as its muscle .
He 's also correct in noting that neither the police nor Apple would ever have tried this against , say , the San Jose Mercury - News ( I know because I worked there ) .
As for Apple , it has been unquestionably the most important and exciting technology company of the last dreary decade in tech , and bless it for that .
But big companies are inherently totalitarian ( which should give pause to boosters of the current administration 's corporatist leanings ) and none more so than Apple .
The contempt that Apple ( and Steve Jobs in particular ) holds toward the media -- and its willingness to manipulate the press for its own ends -- should have produced a media backlash .
There should be inside - Apple scoops in the press every week as intrepid reporters go over , under and around every arbitrary barrier Apple puts in front of them .
Reporters Become Apple Promoters
Instead , fearful of being blackballed and missing the big story , and afraid of being swarm attacked by the legions of Apple fanatics who act as unpaid flacks to anyone who dares to challenge the perfection of the company or the divinity of its founder -- and most of all , not having the muscle of the old - time media empires -- today 's press largely has turned into the company 's full - time lapdog and lickspittle .
Some well - known reporters have built entire careers out of being Apple promoters -- and thus being given insider access .
The latest word is that Chen and Gizmodo have lawyered up and are considering suing the police .
Good .
And they should go after REACT as well , to the point that it is disbanded and replaced by another entity that is n't a tool of big corporations .
Meanwhile , those Apple fanatics out there ( including a few big - name bloggers ) that are defending this assault on liberty should be deeply ashamed of themselves for being willing to trade the First Amendment for a few cool techno - baubles .

Whatever camp you are a part of , it is safe to say that most find the cookie delicious .

From Oreo - based dessert recipes spreading on the internet to festival favorites featuring the beloved cookie , it is clear that the world has a soft spot for this famous snack , and the cookie has only grown in popularity since it was invented in 1912 , propelling it to the rank of best - selling cookie in the United States .
Oreos Are Introduced
In 1898 , several baking companies merged to form the National Biscuit Company , also called Nabisco .
This was the beginning of the corporation that would create the Oreo cookie .
In 1902 , Nabisco rolled out Barnum 's Animal Crackers for the first time , making them famous by selling them in a little box designed like a circus animal cage that featured an attached string so that the box could be hung on Christmas trees .
In 1912 , Nabisco had an idea for a new cookie , though it was n't exactly its own — two chocolate disks with a creme filling in between had been done already by the Sunshine Biscuits company in 1908 , which called the cookie Hydrox .
While Nabisco has never named Hydrox as its inspiration , the Oreo cookie invented four years after the world was introduced to Hydrox closely resembled the biscuit that preceded it : two decorated chocolate discs with white creme sandwiched between them .
Despite its potentially suspicious origination , the Oreo made a name for itself and quickly surpassed the popularity of its competitor .
Nabisco made sure to file for a trademark on the new cookie soon after its creation on March 14 , 1912 .
The request was granted on August 12 , 1913 .
The Mysterious Name
When the cookie was first introduced in 1912 , it appeared as an Oreo Biscuit , which changed in 1921 to an Oreo Sandwich .
There was another name change in 1937 to Oreo Creme Sandwich before the company settled on the name that was decided upon in 1974 : Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie .
Despite the roller coaster of official name changes , most people have always referred to the cookie simply as an " Oreo . "
So where did the " Oreo " part even come from ?
The people at Nabisco are n't quite sure anymore .
Some believe that the cookie 's name was taken from the French word for gold , or ( the main color on early Oreo packaging ) .
Others claim the name stemmed from the hill - shaped test version that never even made it to store shelves , inspiring the cookie prototype to be named the Greek word for mountain , oreo .
Some speculate that the name is a combination of taking the " re " from " cream " and sandwiching it , just like the cookie , between the two " o "s in " chocolate " — making " o - re-o . "
Still others offer the bare explanation that the cookie was named Oreo because it was short , fun , and easy to pronounce .
Though the true naming process may never be revealed , that has not affected Oreo sales .
As of 2019 , it was estimated that 450 billion Oreo cookies have been sold since 1912 , planting it firmly at the top of cookie sales and winning over the hearts of millions .
Changes to the Oreo
The original recipe and signature look of the Oreo has not changed much , but Nabisco has been pumping out limited new looks and flavors for years , right beside the classic .
The company started selling various versions of the cookie as its popularity grew .
In 1975 , Nabisco released its celebrated Double Stuf Oreos .
A few of the other most welcomed varieties and themes created over the years include :
1987 : Fudge covered Oreos introduced
1991 : Halloween Oreos introduced
1995 : Christmas Oreos introduced
Through ambitious new flavors of the cookie , the design of the chocolate discs has been a constant , outside of color changes .
The wafer design that has stuck around for the longest and was brought into existence in 1952 has remained much the same since then .
As far as the recipe of the Oreo goes , the delicious filling that has contributed to the success of the cookie has evolved very little .
It was created by Nabisco 's " principal scientist " Sam Porcello , who is often referred to as " Mr. Oreo . "
His recipe for the classic creme has been only slightly altered since 1912 , outside of primarily limited - edition flavors .
Nabisco and the world agree that the Oreo recipe and design are far from broken , so there is no need to fix them .
Oreos are well - loved just as they are and are sure to be around for many years to come .

In a groundbreaking study , University of Toronto researchers have unveiled an “ Enigma machine ” program that can decode the messages of our very genes .
Like the German decoding device captured by the Allies during WW II , the U of T program can unlock the meaning of a garbled language – in this case , the cryptic orders that direct our genetic machinery .
“ We are the first people to actually make predictions about which genetic message will be produced in different tissues , ” said Brendan Frey , one of the paper ’s senior authors .
“ Prior to this , there was no way to predict that actually , ” said Frey , who has a joint appointment in engineering and medicine at the school .
The paper was featured Wednesday on the cover of Nature , the world ’s most prestigious science journal .
It introduces a readily accessible chart that can decode the messages that a gene will send out in any given type of cell .
The work helps explain the critical genetic process known as “ alternative splicing ” that accounts for the phenomenal complexity of human biology .
It also opens the door to a host of potential medical advancements , including deeper understandings of genetic diseases and the creation of replacement organs and tissues .
“ From now on , it will be possible to predict the true meaning of a gene in a particular type of cell , “ said Spanish geneticist Juan Valcarel , one of several leading scientists already stepping up to praise the Toronto work .
“ This will obviously be of great interest to understand how tissues work , i.e. , what makes a muscle cell contract , an intestinal cell absorb nutrients , or a cell of the nervous system communicate with others through electrical signals , ” said Valcarel , a researcher with the European Alternative Splicing Network .
Frey compared his computer decoder to the German Enigma encryption device , which helped the Allies defeat the Nazis after it fell into their hands .
“ Just like in the old cryptographic systems in World War II , you ’d have the Enigma machine … which would take an instruction and encode it in a complicated set of symbols , ” he said .
“ Well , biology works the same way .
It turns out to control genetic messaging it makes use of a complicated set of symbols that are hidden in DNA . ”
That genes had hidden messages that needed decoding only became apparent in the past decade .
Of all the genetic revelations produced by the human genome project , the most astonishing and vexing was surely this : we had far fewer genes than anyone had imagined .
Given the number of biological activities needed to grow and govern our bodies , scientists had believed humans must have 100,000 genes or more to direct those myriad functions .
But that genomic search of the 3 billion base pairs that make up the rungs of our twisting DNA ladders revealed a meagre 20,000 genes , about the same number as the lowly nematode worm boasts .
“ The nematode has about 1,000 cells , and we have at least 1,000 different neuron ( cells ) in our brains alone , ” said Benjamin Blencowe , a U of T biochemist and the study ’s co-senior author .
To achieve this huge complexity , our genes must be monumental multi-taskers , with each one having the potential to do dozens or even hundreds of different things in different parts of the body .
And to be such adroit role switchers , each gene must have an immensely complex set of instructions – or a code – to tell them what to do in any of the different tissues they need to perform in .
Basically , the U of T team has broken that code – and proven their decryption works in four types of tissues .
Looking at central nervous system , muscle , embryonic and digestive system cells , the researchers showed they could predict which message the same genes would make in each of the different tissue types .
Here ’s how it works :
Genes reside within the nucleus of a cell and do their work by acting as a template , throwing open their encoding DNA sequences as an assembly point for strands of messenger RNA .
This messenger strand then goes out into the cell and creates a protein , plucking out the correct , amino acid ingredients and stitching them together according to its genetically encoded instructions .
The resulting protein will then help to build an organ or direct a bodily function .

Scientists had long thought that this messenger RNA building would occur along a continuous segment of a gene .
And if this had been the case , discovering what message a gene would make would be relatively simple .
“ But it turns out that that view is actually wrong for over 95 per cent of genes , ” Frey said .
What genes do instead , he says , is use different segments of their encoding surfaces to build separate segments of messenger RNA .
Then they “ splice ” those segments together .
Different segments of the same gene would be spliced in different patterns in accordance to the needs of each different tissue .
These “ alternative splicing ” activities are directed by “ code words ” – short DNA sequences embedded along other parts of the gene – that dictate which segments will be used and how the messenger strand will be arranged .
Using about 400 code words , most of which they discovered themselves , the U of T team built up a computational algorithm that would determine which of those words would be used in any given tissue .
More importantly , the program was able to predict what message those code words would create in the form of the messenger RNA for each of the different tissues .
Frey says the code can be adapted to include all the body ’s tissues once the relevant code words are found for them .
“ Now that we have that framework in place , people can take that framework and they can expand it , ” he said .
“ Then they will be able to make predictions about what ’s going to happen in terms of splicing in those other tissues . ”
The code as it stands can only predict what the messenger RNA will look like , and the study does not look at the protein products those strands will actually assemble .
And while the code allows a deep understanding of a fundamental aspect of human biology – alternative splicing – its real value will come from the insight it can give into gene products .
“ Now that we have the splicing code , doctors can actually dig in there and find out what ’s going on with the actual proteins , ” Frey said .
Chris Smith , a University of Cambridge geneticist , says many genetic diseases have been associated with splicing errors and that being able to predict what a message should look like will help medical researchers spot genetic errors that can lead to those ailments .
“ It turns out that a large portion of complex human diseases have been associated with errors in splicing , ” Frey said .
Also , any attempt to create replacement organs or tissues would need a deep understanding of the ways genes would splice during the creation of those parts , he said .

It ’s Impossible to “ Get By ” In the US
While the market cheers on the fantastic job “ growth ” of March 2010 , the more astute of us are concerned with a growing tide of personal bankruptcies .
March 2010 saw 158,000 bankruptcy filings .
David Rosenberg of Gluskin - Sheff notes that this is an astounding 6,900 filings per day .
This latest filing is up 19 % from March 2009 ’s number which occurred at the absolute nadir of the economic decline , when everyone thought the world was ending .
It ’s also up 35 % from last month ’s ( February 2010 ) number .
Given the significance of this , I thought today we ’d spend some time delving into numbers for the “ median ” American ’s experience in the US today .
Regrettably , much of the data is not up to date so we ’ve got to go by 2008 numbers .
In 2008 , the median US household income was $ 50,300 .
Assuming that the person filing is the “ head of household ” and has two children ( dependents ) , this means a 1040 tax bill of $ 4,100 , which leaves about $ 45 K in income after taxes ( we ’re not bothering with state taxes ) .
I realize this is a simplistic calculation , but it ’s a decent proxy for income in the US in 2008 .
Now , $ 45 K in income spread out over 26 pay periods ( every two weeks ) , means a bi-weekly paycheck of $ 1,730 and monthly income of $ 3,460 .
This is the money “ Joe America ” and his family to live off of in 2008 .
Now , in 2008 , the median home value was roughly $ 225 K .
Assuming our “ median ” household put down 20 % on their home ( unlikely , but it used to be considered the norm ) , this means a $ 180 K mortgage .
Using a 5.5 % fixed rate 30 - year mortgage , this means Joe America ’s 2008 monthly mortgage payments were roughly $ 1,022 .
So , right off the bat , Joe ’s monthly income is cut to $ 2,438 .
According to the US Department of Agriculture , the average 2008 monthly food bill for a family of four ranged from $ 512 - $ 986 depending on how “ liberal ” you are with your purchases .
For simplicity ’s sake we ’ll take the mid-point of this range ( $ 750 ) as a monthly food bill .
This brings Joe ’s monthly income to $ 1,688 .
Now , Joe needs light , energy , heat , and air conditioning to run his home .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the average US household used about 920 kilowatt - hours per month in 2008 .
At a national average price of 11 cents per kilowatt - hour this comes to a monthly electrical bill of $ 101.20 .
Joe ’s now down to $ 1,587 .
Now Joe needs to drive to work to make a living .
Similarly , he needs to be able to drive to the grocery store , doctor , etc .
According to AAA , the average cost per mile of driving a minivan ( Joe ’s a family man ) in 2008 was 57 cents per mile .
This cost is based on average fuel consumption , tires , maintenance , insurance , license and registration , and average loan finance charges .
Multiply this cost by 15,000 miles per year and you ’ve got an annual driving bill of $ 8,550 .
Divide this into months ( by 12 ) and you ’ve got a monthly driving bill of $ 712 .
Joe ’s now down to $ 877 ( I ’m also assuming Joe ’s family only has ONE car ) .
Indeed , if Joe ’s family has two cars ( one minivan and one sedan ) he ’s already run out of money for the month .
Now , assuming Joe ’s family is one of the lucky ones ( depending on your perspective ) they ’ve got medical insurance .
Trying to find an average monthly medical insurance premium for a family in the US is extremely difficult because insurance plans have a wide range in deductibles , premiums , and co-pays .
But according to eHealth Insurance , the average monthly premium for family policies in February 2008 was $ 369 .
So if Joe has medical insurance on his family , he ’s now down to $ 508 .
Throw in cell phone bills , cable TV and Internet bills , and the like , and he ’s maybe got $ 100 - 200 discretionary income left at the end of the month .
This analysis covers all of the basic necessities of the average American household : mortgage payments , food , energy , gas , driving expenses , and medical insurance .
It also assumes that Joe :
1 ) Did n’t overpay for his house
2 ) Made a 20 % down - payment of $ 45 K on his home purchase
3 ) Has no debt aside from his mortgage ( so no credit card debt , student loans , etc )
4 ) Only has one car in the family and drives 15,000 miles per year
5 ) Keeps his energy bill reasonable
6 ) Does not eat out at restaurants ever / keeps food expenses moderate
7 ) Has no pets
8 ) Pays for health insurance but has no monthly medical expenses ( unlikely with two kids )
9 ) Keeps his personal budget under control regarding cable TV , Internet , and the like
10 ) Does n’t spoil his kids with toys , gadgets , trips to the movies , etc .
11 ) Does n’t take vacations .
Suffice to say , I am assuming Joe maintains EXTREMELY conservative spending habits .
Personally , I know NO ONE who meets all of the above criteria .
However , even if the above assumptions applied to the average American , you ’re still only looking at $ 100 - 200 in “ wiggle ” room for spending per month !
If Joe :
1 ) Overpaid on his house
2 ) Did n’t have a full 20 % down payment
3 ) Owns two cars
4 ) Eats at restaurants
5 ) Splurges on heating & A/C bills
6 ) Has any medical expenses aside from monthly premiums …
… he is running into the red EVERY month .
I also wish to note that my analysis did n’t include real estate taxes and numerous other expenses that most folks have to pay .
So even if you are extremely frugal and careful with your money , it is impossible to “ get by ” in the US without using credit cards , home equity lines of credit or burning through savings .
The cost of living is simply TOO high relative to incomes .
This is why there simply cannot be a sustainable recovery in the US economy .
Because we outsourced our jobs , incomes fell .
Because incomes fell and savers were punished ( thanks to abysmal returns on savings rates ) we pulled future demand forward by splurging on credit .
Because we splurged on credit , prices in every asset under the sun rose in value .
Because prices rose while incomes fell , we had to use more credit to cover our costs , which in turn meant taking on more debt ( a net drag on incomes ) .
And on and on .
Does this mean the market is about to tank ?
Not necessarily , stocks have been disconnected from reality since November if not July .
Bubbles ( and we ARE in a bubble ) take time to pop and this time around will be no different .
Best Regards ,
Graham Summers
Below is part one of a series which includes Part 2 and Part 3 .
By Mark Blaxill
“ Perhaps no other recent product on the market demonstrates successful health care technology transfer better than the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine , Gardasil , produced by Merck & Co. and approved by the FDA in June 2006 , ” proclaimed a recent National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) newsletter .
In a February 23 , 2007 article entitled “ From Lab to Market : The HPV Vaccine ” , the NIH Record celebrated the pivotal role of government researchers in developing Merck ’s Gardasil product .
“ Based largely on technology developed at NIH , ” the newsletter reported , “ the vaccine works to prevent four types of the sexually transmitted HPV that together cause 70 percent of all cervical cancer and 90 percent of genital warts ( HERE ) .
The occasion motivating this celebratory article was the “ Philip S. Chen , Jr. Distinguished Lecture on Innovation and Technology Transfer ” given by Douglas T. Lowy , one of the NIH scientists involved in developing the HPV vaccine .
In the ceremony pictured above , Lowy is receiving an honorary poster from the head of NIH at the time , Elias Zerhouni , who took advantage of the occasion to shower praise on his team ’s work , one he viewed as a model for future efforts .
“ It ’s a ‘ heroic ’ story about the effort to fight cervical cancer , the second most deadly cancer for women worldwide , said NIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni , ” in the NIH Record ’s account .
“ He noted that he has talked about the vaccine ’s creation to Congress and with the President on his recent visit to NIH .
How researchers took the technology ‘ from the lab to the marketplace is a journey we can learn from , ’ Zerhouni said . ”
While Zerhouni was bragging to anyone in Washington D.C. who would listen about the NIH team ’s role in this historic accomplishment , the vaccine 's developers were actively spreading the news of their achievement in scientific circles .
It ’s hard to blame them , because at the time Lowy and his colleague John T. Schiller , leaders of the team that had invented the technology for the “ virus - like particles ” ( or VLPs ) that made Gardasil possible , were in some pretty heady company .
In 2008 , Harald zur Hausen , the scientist who discovered the role of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) in cervical cancer during the 1980s , received one half of the Nobel Prize in Medicine ; the two researchers at the Pasteur Institute who had discovered the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) had to share the other half .
Perhaps campaigning for their own place in the pantheon of medical heroes , Lowy and Schiller described their VLP technology in several review articles on the history and development of the Merck vaccine .
These treatments were studiously scientific in tone and at points openly critical of their commercial partner , as the authors commented with disapproval on the high price Merck was charging for Gardasil .
But in one May 2006 review in The Journal of Clinical Investigation , the pair also made the following disclosure about their own commercial interests : “ Conflict of interest :
The authors , as employees of the National Cancer Institute , NIH , are inventors of the HPV VLP vaccine technology described in this Review .
The technology has been licensed by the NIH to the 2 companies , Merck and GlaxoSmithKline , that are developing the commercial HPV vaccines described herein . ”
Attached to an otherwise heroic narrative of the triumph of technology over cancer , this disclosure struck a discordant note .
Conflict of interest ?
Inventors ?
Vaccine technology ?
Licenses ?
Pharmaceutical companies ?
Commercial vaccines ?
This is n’t scientific language , but rather the language of money and commerce .
What was this unusual concession doing there in the fine print ?
Creating the market for Gardasil by funding commercial research , supervising the conduct of clinical trials , judging the outcome of those trials and promoting a policy of universal vaccination ;
Collecting the license fees that result from Gardasil revenues from Merck and other vaccine manufacturers and then distributing these financial benefits to Federal employees ; and Deciding whether or not to protect the policy decisions and profit streams of their sister DHHS agencies through postlicensure safety monitoring and vaccine injury compensation rulings .
This is not an idle question , for Lowy and Schiller ’s conflict disclosure forms the basis for an alternative to Zerhouni ’s narrative , one that spotlights the unusually self - contained set of Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) activities that surrounded HPV vaccine development .
This alternative narrative is more of a business story than a scientific one , a narrative in which commercial interests were inextricably linked to matters of life and death .
In this narrative , Gardasil is perhaps the leading example of a new form of unconstrained government self - dealing , in arrangements whereby DHHS can transfer technology to pharmaceutical partners , simultaneously both approve and protect their partners ’ technology licenses while also taking a cut of the profits .
Literally and figuratively , DHHS has the authority in such situations to allow its business partners to get away with murder for the greater good , effectively granting its private business partners a license to kill .
DHHS officials have their own language for such arrangements .
They call them public - private partnerships , and DHHS agencies have gotten progressively more aggressive about pursuing them .
NIH , for example , launched its own “ Program on Public - Private Partnerships ” in 2005 , shortly before Gardasil ’s launch .
On the web - site describing this program , the NIH program managers concede that the kind of technology transfer involved with Gardasil carries unavoidable ethical risks , acknowledging that “ The potential for conflict of interest exists any time the NIH and NIH staff engage with non-Federal entities to achieve mutual goals . ”
They provide little more than a pro forma solution for such conflicts , however : any concerned NIH staffers are encouraged to “ contact their Deputy Ethics Counselor .
” It ’s important to shed light on this alternative narrative as a counterpoint to the heroic story promoted by Gardasil ’s many sponsors .
An uninformed observer might like to assume that the responsible agencies of DHHS care not at all about commercial opportunities and exclusively attend in a disinterested fashion to the issues of health and safety that would naturally concern any consumer of vaccine products .
But that assumption would be incorrect .
By taking a commercial perspective on Gardasil ’s development and regulation , one is forced to confront a new and disturbing question .
How is disinterested vaccine safety governance even remotely possible when DHHS employees stand as heroes at the head of the parade when a new vaccine is invented within its walls , while agency leaders are leading the cheering section , approving the new product ’s launch , making the market for the product with its recommendations and then turning around to cash multi-million dollar checks ?
In order to better understand the real lessons of Gardasil under the harsh light of the business interests at work , let ’s take a closer look at how the Merck - NIH partnership on Gardasil was forged .
As the world ’s largest single sponsor of biological research , NIH frequently funds research with commercially valuable outcomes .
When that R&D generates potentially valuable inventions , NIH submits patent applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) and actively pursues the approval of those patents , which when granted become valuable commercial property for DHHS , the patents ’ owner .
Since NIH has neither the authority nor the capability to pursue product commercialization efforts , in order to encourage private companies to invest in conducting the necessary clinical trials , NIH ’s Office of Technology Transfer ( OTT ) was created to grant commercial licenses for such DHHS patents to commercial partners , including vaccine manufacturers .
When new products invented at NIH clear the requisite regulatory hurdles at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and reach the market , OTT then shares in the profits .
They also distribute the rewards back to the scientific teams whose products have succeeded in reaching the commercial stage : when license fees flow into OTT ’s coffers , the Federal employees who invented the technology are entitled by NIH policy to a share of the royalties .
From a technology development standpoint , such commercial arrangements are the result of an intentional public policy ; in fact they resulted from an Act of Congress .
The Bayh - Dole Act of 1980 was written with the express purpose of making it easier for federally - funded academic research to receive patent protection that would allow the ready licensing of the fruits of commercially valuable R&D to private businesses .
At the time , the concern of Congress was that federally funded inventions too often languished within the academy because businesses had insufficient incentive to invest in clinical trials , since these inventions were often unsupported by the powerful competitive protection afforded by an exclusive patent license .
The policy worked .
Within the research universities that receive the vast majority of federal funding , Bayh - Dole has had the desired effect and has enabled university technology transfer offices all over the world to generate billions of dollars of licensing revenue in the last few decades -- especially in the life sciences -- by licensing patents from federally - funded university research to corporate partners .
Bayh - Dole has effectively turned research into big business for many universities and transformed technology transfer offices into important profit centers at academic institutions all over the world .
But when technology licensing takes place within federal agencies , Bayh - Dole creates an entirely different problem : an unprecedented web of conflict , one in which the same departments that are tasked with regulating the health and safety of medical products are also profiting from them .
As Lowy and Schiller conceded in their review article disclosure , this conflict of interest came into play directly on Gardasil : both men are named inventors on the technology that makes Gardasil possible ; NIH filed for and received patents on their invention of the VLP technology ; DHHS is the owner of the patent family that protects the commercial rights to the invention ; in order to bring the product to market , OTT licensed the vaccine technology to Merck ; and as Merck has generated billions in Gardasil revenue , OTT has received millions in Gardasil profits .
But DHHS is also responsible for regulating Gardasil in numerous ways .
The FDA reviewed the clinical trials in which Gardasil was tested in human populations and passed judgment on Gardasil ’s safety .
An Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) decided whether or not to recommend Gardasil for young women and children .
The FDA and CDC together now conduct the surveillance to decide whether or not Gardasil is proving safe in larger populations .
And as some families are now beginning to seek compensation based on claims that Gardasil caused injury in some of its recipients , the division of the Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA ) that oversees the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) will soon sit in judgment as to whether , to whom , and how much compensation will be provided to Gardasil ’s victims .
As you can see in the chart below , all of this activity is supervised in a single department by one Cabinet official , the Secretary of Health and Human Services .
The sole non-governmental agency involved in this commercial enterprise is Merck ’s Vaccine Division .
In effect , the Merck - DHHS partnership leaves the business side to Merck while DHHS is solely responsible for
Is this good government at work or an example of the medical - industrial complex run amok ?
In this investigative series , Age of Autism will take a look at how DHHS agencies have managed Gardasil in all three of these sequences .
We ’ll start by taking a closer look at the NIH patent portfolio and the associated license fees that have been flowing into NIH coffers since 2006 .

Celebrating the invention of a new market
Lowy and Schiller are both employed by the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) .
One of the largest of the NIH institutes , NCI was established in 1937 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
For many decades , NCI has been the agency at the forefront of the so - called “ War on Cancer . ”
Perhaps the earliest inspiration for the both the Cancer War and the Gardasil program began during the 1960s , when NCI researchers first began looking in earnest at viruses as a potential cause for cancer .
In 1961 , NCI leaders created the Laboratory of Viral Oncology to begin the search for cancer - causing viruses ; in 1962 the Human Cancer Virus Task Force was first convened ; and by the end of the decade , enthusiasm over this research was part of the scientific momentum that persuaded President Richard Nixon to launch the War on Cancer in 1971 .
Unfortunately for Nixon ’s legacy , and for most subsequent cancer victims , the War on Cancer has famously failed to find a cure for cancer or to validate theories of viral causation in the vast majority of human cancers .
But starting in the 1980s , the two exceptions to this litany of failure — hepatitis B virus and the human papillomavirus - - led to the launch of two blockbuster new vaccine products .
The infant hepatitis B vaccine was developed in the 1980s and launched in 1991 with an ACIP recommendation that all American infants be vaccinated on the first day of life .
And after 1984 , when Harald zur Hausen first pinpointed the role of certain strains of human papillomavirus in cervical cancer , the work on another anti-cancer vaccine could begin .
By the early 1990s , laboratories all over the world were racing to develop the first HPV vaccine .
Lowy and Schiller ’s NCI team were among the four most active research teams in this race , all of whom were aggressively filing patents on their HPV inventions .
Along with a third NCI colleague , Reinhard Kirnbauer , Lowy and Schiller filed their first application for a patent entitled “ Self - assembling recombinant papillomavirus capsid proteins ” on September 3 , 1992 .
Since then -- and after splitting the original application into 29 “ children ” in the form of numerous “ divisionals ” , “ continuations ” and “ continuations - in - part ” -- nine patents from that family have been granted , as well as four from a branch of the family tree entitled “ chimeric papillomavirus - like particles . ”
The ability of the novel “ L1 proteins ” described in their patent to “ self - assemble ” into virus - like structures , which when deployed in a vaccine solution could stimulate a protective immune response against HPV , formed the essence of their invention .
Although OTT does n’t specify the royalty - bearing patents , the commercially valuable technology that Merck has licensed likely comes from this group of nine “ self - assembling recombinant papillomavirus capsid proteins ” patents : US5437951 , US5709996 , US5716620 , US5744142 , US5756284 , US5871998 , US5985610 , US7220419 , and US7361356 .
The NCI team was among the leaders in HPV technology , but the race to make a commercially viable HPV vaccine involved several other research teams from all over the world .
Most notable among these were the University of Queensland in Australia , Georgetown University and the University of Rochester .
In addition to NCI ’s filings , each of these university - based research teams filed their own patents ; eventually , Merck and GSK got into the act as well .
Like many promising areas of technology , the HPV patent landscape became large and crowded in a short period of time .
Amid this blizzard of activity , the USPTO ’s Bureau of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( BPAI ) had to step in to sort out whether these competing patent applications interfered with each other and to distribute the credit , making a series of hotly contested decisions that were ultimately appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) , the nation ’s most powerful patent court .
By 2007 , all the BPAI and CAFC rulings had come in and the respective contributions of all four groups were conclusively allocated for commercial purposes .
The team led by Ian Frazer at the University of Queensland received credit for the being the first to propose the idea of using VLP technology for a vaccine , since their application was filed on July 20 , 1992 , just six weeks earlier than the NCI team’s .
But thanks to their unique technology of “ self - assembly , ” most of the invention claims of the NCI patent family remained intact as well ; Lowy and Schiller ’s invention has since been generally accepted as a critical advance in the wave of new technology that made Gardasil possible .
In terms of the distribution of financial reward , both Rochester and Queensland have reported receiving royalty income for their HPV inventions ( in undisclosed amounts ) in addition to the revenues reported by OTT .
As the technology transfer officials at OTT were paving the way for the financial benefits from Gardasil to flow back to NIH , Lowy and Schiller were benefiting in other ways as well , especially when it came to scientific credit .
Throughout much of 2006 and 2007 , they received awards from many quarters for their role in developing Gardasil ’s “ virus - like particles . ”
Their joint awards included the Dorothy P. Landon - AACR Prize for Translational Cancer Research in April 2007 and the 2007 Novartis Prize for Clinical Immunology .
In addition , Lowy by himself received the Daniel Nathans Memorial Award in September 2007 and the American Cancer Society ’s Medal of Honor for Basic Research in October 2007 .
In addition to these awards , on September 19 , 2007 , Lowy and Schiller received what was perhaps their crowning honor .
That ’s when the Partnership for Public Service awarded the pair the “ Federal Employees of the Year Service to America Medal . ”
According to its sponsors , “ The Service to America Medals have earned a reputation as one of the most prestigious awards dedicated to celebrating America ’s civil servants .
Often referred to as the ' Oscars ' of government service , " they are more commonly known in government circles as the “ Sammies . ”
Upon receiving his crowning honor , Lowy was interviewed for the NIH Record and professed the requisite modesty in its October 2007 edition , saying “ We are simply symbols of the many people who have made critical contributions to understanding the relationship between papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer . ”
If Lowy was modest , the top brass at NIH could barely conceal their pride over their employees ’ accomplishments .
According to the Partnership for Public Service , “ Lowy and Schiller ’s 20 - year partnership has been a boon to the nation ’s health and for the advancement of scientific discovery . ”
Collecting the licensing fees
Alongside the science and policy celebrations , the business side of the Merck - NIH partnership proceeded with a bit less fanfare and with a different kind of currency .
Once their patent was approved , OTT could then turn to extracting their share of the benefits from their commercial partners ’ new products , which in the case of HPV vaccine included sales first from Merck ’s Gardasil product and later from GlaxoSmithKline ’s Cervarix .
Merck reached the market first in 2006 , but GSK followed shortly thereafter in 2007 .
As each company began collecting revenue from their new vaccines , OTT began collecting royalties .
The table below shows Age of Autism ’s analysis of how Merck and GSK ’s revenues may have flowed into OTT ’s coffers .
Gardasil Revenue ( $ M ) Cervarix revenue ( $ M ) NIH Top 20 Revenues ( $ M ) HPV Rank in NIH Top 20 HPV Revenue : estimated at 1 % license fee ( $ M ) 2006 235 -- NA NR 2007 1,481 20 71 ( est ) # 4 15 2008 1,403 229 77.4 # 2 16 2009 1,108 292 75.7 # 1 14
Both Merck and GSK itemize revenue for Gardasil and Cervarix in their quarterly and annual earnings statements .
Their annual results are summarized in the first two columns of the table .
For Merck , Gardasil has been a blockbuster success , yielding a cumulative total of over $ 4 billion in revenue through year end 2009 .
By contrast , GSK ’s revenues have been growing more slowly and have not yet reached a cumulative total of half a billion dollars .
For their part , OTT does not itemize their HPV license revenues .
However , they do report their total royalty revenue as well as the cumulative revenue from their “ top 20 ” technology licenses since 2007 .
These top 20 licenses have been worth over $ 70 million annually in profits for NIH in the last three years , and HPV licenses have soared to the top of those rankings quickly .
Last year , OTT reported that HPV licensing was its top revenue generator .
OTT does n’t disclose exactly how much the Gardasil and Cervarix royalties contribute to NIH , but if we make the assumption that their patent licenses entitle them to 1 % of the HPV vaccine revenues of their partners ( an assumption that appears reasonable based on the available data ) , then we can safely estimate that OTT has been collecting somewhere in the range of $ 15 million per year from Lowy and Schiller ’s invention .
In addition to their numerous scientific awards for their discoveries , Lowy and Schiller have received cash distributions from NIH based on their patents .
As Federal employees , they are each eligible to receive a share of patent royalties up to $ 150,000 per year and Gardasil ’s success has guaranteed that they would receive the maximum reward .
That means that since FDA ’s approval in 2006 , each man has earned roughly a half million dollars in royalty revenue .* * * This is the DHHS vision of public private partnership at work .
Contrary to the rhetoric , these partnerships are n’t simply a high - minded collaboration of scientific visionaries , but rather a large commercial enterprise with extraordinary profits at stake : an enterprise from which NIH receives credit and money and based on which its corporate partners build multi-billion dollar businesses .
How does such a partnership affect the incentives of regulators whose job it is to make sure the products are safe ?
It ’s not obvious that they do .
Just because DHHS has a financial stake in Gardasil does n’t necessarily mean that every subsequent decision its employees make is corrupt , part of some nefarious conspiracy to kill young women for money .
Indeed , HPV royalty revenues of $ 15 million represent just a small fraction of a DHHS budget that rose to well over $ 700 billion in 2009 .
In the larger scheme of things , DHHS revenues on Gardasil are just a small drop in a very large bucket .
Far more likely to play a role , however , in public - private paternerships like the Gardasil vaccine are the insidious cultural pressures that emerge in a supremely political organization like DHHS .
Can we really expect the Secretary of HHS to take his or her FDA Director to task for implementing lax standards on vaccine approval when the Director of NIH is simultaneously praising the “ heroic ” researchers who invented the product in the first place ?
Is it more likely that CDC will apply extra caution in their vaccine policy recommendations when its sister agency is involved or will they be more likely to activate the fast track in their process of making recommendations for Gardasil ?
What we have observed so far merely suggests the potential for bias in the regulation of products in which DHHS holds a direct stake .
In the next part of our series , Age of Autism will investigate the question of whether or not there have been actual patterns of bias in the ways in which regulators at FDA and CDC have conducted their duties with respect to Gardasil .

Scientists of the DZero collaboration at the Department of Energy 's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory have announced that they have found evidence for significant violation of matter - antimatter symmetry in the behavior of particles containing bottom quarks beyond what is expected in the current theory , the Standard Model of particle physics .
The new result , submitted for publication in Physical Review D by the DZero collaboration , an international team of 500 physicists , indicates a one percent difference between the production of pairs of muons and pairs of antimuons in the decay of B mesons produced in high - energy collisions at Fermilab 's Tevatron particle collider .
The dominance of matter that we observe in the universe is possible only if there are differences in the behavior of particles and antiparticles .
Although physicists have observed such differences ( called " CP violation " ) in particle behavior for decades , these known differences are much too small to explain the observed dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe and are fully consistent with the Standard Model .
If confirmed by further observations and analysis , the effect seen by DZero physicists could represent another step towards understanding the observed matter dominance by pointing to new physics phenomena beyond what we know today .
Using unique features of their precision detector and newly developed analysis methods , the DZero scientists have shown that the probability that this measurement is consistent with any known effect is below 0.1 percent ( 3.2 standard deviations ) .
" This exciting new result provides evidence of deviations from the present theory in the decays of B mesons , in agreement with earlier hints , " said Dmitri Denisov , co-spokesperson of the DZero experiment , one of two collider experiments at the Tevatron collider .
Last year , physicists at both Tevatron experiments , DZero and CDF , observed such hints in studying particles made of a bottom quark and a strange quark .
When matter and anti-matter particles collide in high - energy collisions , they turn into energy and produce new particles and antiparticles .
At the Fermilab proton - antiproton collider , scientists observe hundreds of millions every day .
Similar processes occurring at the beginning of the universe should have left us with a universe with equal amounts of matter and anti-matter .
But the world around is made of matter only and antiparticles can only be produced at colliders , in nuclear reactions or cosmic rays .
" What happened to the antimatter ? " is one of the central questions of 21st - century particle physics .

To obtain the new result , the DZero physicists performed the data analysis " blind , " to avoid any bias based on what they observe .
Only after a long period of verification of the analysis tools , did the DZero physicists look at the full data set .
Experimenters reversed the polarity of their detector 's magnetic field during data collection to cancel instrumental effects .
" Many of us felt goose bumps when we saw the result , " said Stefan Soldner - Rembold , co-spokesperson of DZero .
" We knew we were seeing something beyond what we have seen before and beyond what current theories can explain . "
The precision of the DZero measurements is still limited by the number of collisions recorded so far by the experiment .
Both CDF and DZero therefore continue to collect data and refine analyses to address this and many other fundamental questions .
" The Tevatron collider is operating extremely well , providing Fermilab scientists with unprecedented levels of data from high energy collisions to probe nature 's deepest secrets .
This interesting result underlines the importance and scientific potential of the Tevatron program , " said Dennis Kovar , Associate Director for High Energy Physics in DOE 's Office of Science .
The DZero result is based on data collected over the last eight years by the DZero experiment : over 6 inverse femtobarns in total integrated luminosity , corresponding to hundreds of trillions of collisions between protons and antiprotons in the Tevatron collider .
" Tevatron collider experiments study high energy collisions in every detail , from searches for the Higgs boson , to precision measurement of particle properties , to searches for new and yet unknown laws of nature .
I am delighted to see yet another exciting result from the Tevatron , " said Fermilab Director Pier Oddone .
DZero is an international experiment of about 500 physicists from 86 institutions in 19 countries .
It is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy , the National Science Foundation and a number of international funding agencies .
Fermilab is a national laboratory funded by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy , operated under contract by Fermi Research Alliance , LLC .
The Fist of the North Star series has spanned multiple mediums , and video games are no exception .
On March 25th , 2010 , Hokuto Musou was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan and Western audiences assumed that it would never make it across the Pacific .
Well , SKU ’s straight from Koei have proved otherwise .
With a slated , and probably temporary , release date of September 22nd , 2010 , ‘ Fist of the North Star ’ will soon arrive in the US on the PS3 and 360 , published by Koei .
The SKU ’s are 040198002103 and 040198002110 for the PS3 and 360 , respectively .

WHAT is the difference between a sceptic and a denier ?
When I call myself a sceptic , I mean that I take a scientific approach to the evaluation of claims .
A climate sceptic , for example , examines specific claims one by one , carefully considers the evidence for each , and is willing to follow the facts wherever they lead .
A climate denier has a position staked out in advance , and sorts through the data employing “ confirmation bias ” – the tendency to look for …
The technology can identify anomalies in behaviour and environment Scientists have been testing ground - breaking technologies which it is hoped will help disrupt terrorist activities .
The military research laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire tried out new sensor and data - processing systems in an airborne surveillance experiment .
The aim is to track the movement of terrorists , particularly those using home - made bombs .
It is hoped the technology will help to save lives in war zones such as Afghanistan as well as in the UK .
Home - made bombs - also called IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) - are said to be the preferred weapon of choice for insurgents as they are harder to detect by UK forces .
Ultimate CCTV
Countering the IED threat is one of the Ministry of Defence 's top priorities .
During the last fortnight , planes and helicopters have been flying across the restricted airspace over Porton Down picking up a range of images and data .
Electro - optical cameras that can identify people in unusual poses , such as holding a weapon , were used .
Andrew Seedhouse , from the Defence , Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) , said : " Think of it as the ultimate CCTV system .
" An incident occurs , perhaps an IED goes off , and we can use this host of data to back track over time .
" Who was near the scene and where were they before the incident ?
What buildings or vehicles can we now associate with the incident ? "
He said the research could help scientists to look for anomalies in behaviour and environment and alert appropriate forces before an incident occurred .
During the two - week trial , teams gathered up to 40 terabytes of data - said to be the equivalent of 40,000 copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica .

Rumors about shady practices — unethical , possibly illegal — in the Indian media have circulated for years .
Over the past year or so , and especially since the 2009 parliamentary elections , when the sale of media space was reported to have reached new heights , the issue has drawn more attention .
Questions have been raised in Parliament .
Last July , the Press Council of India , a government - sanctioned monitoring group , formed a two - man committee to look into the allegations .
The committee completed a draft report last week that was due to be released publicly , but that release is on hold after a strong show of opposition from media owners .
Nonetheless , many of the report ’s key findings have been leaked into the public domain , and they make for damning reading .
Though publishers have complained that the evidence presented is weak , the report identifies several publications that are believed to have sold editorial space and it lists scores of instances in which the practice allegedly occurred .
Paranjoy Guha - Thakurta , one of the authors of the report , told me that one of its most disturbing findings was that the practice of paid content had become “ institutionalized . ”
He said that it goes beyond individual editors or publishers , and beyond the occasional paid junket .
“ What started out as an individual aberration has become an illness , an epidemic of sorts , ” he said .
“ This makes the malpractice all the more troubling . ”
The commercialization of the Indian media takes many forms .
It has been known for some time that a few of India ’s leading media conglomerates — including Bennett , Coleman & Co. , the publisher of The Times of India and The Economic Times — offer what that company calls “ innovative ” and “ integrated ” marketing strategies that blur the traditional line between advertising and article content .
Bennett , Coleman ’s Medianet division , for example , lets advertisers place articles on certain pages in the paper without clearly marking them as advertising .
Like everything else in life , learning how to program video games seems slightly difficult and therefore best left to other people .
In reality , you can pick up everything you 'll need in around ten minutes .
Do you have Notepad on your computer ?
Congratulations , you have everything you need .
This powerful text editor doubles as an ideal programming environment because it 's capable of displaying pretty much every character that you can type on your keyboard .
This industry standard does , of course have its drawbacks .
Mac users have to jump through hoops to get the program running , which is why there are so few games for the platform .
As long as you 're using Windows , however , you should be ready to code .
The first line is always used to tell the computer what type of game you 're trying to make .
Open up Notepad and input the following :
As you can see , we 're making a good game .
There are other options such as terrible , decent , amazing and best .
Let 's just stick with good for now .
We do n't want to get too far ahead of ourselves .
Before getting any further , it 's best to decide what genre we have in mind .
First Person Shooters are big sellers , but thoughtful indie games net you way more credibility .
Let 's try to play things safe by combining elements of both :
Graphics probably seem like the most daunting aspect of any project .
Once you realize how simple they are , however , you should be able to approach the rest of the project with confidence .
Piece of cake , right ?
If you 're been paying attention , the code for audio and controls should be familiar - they share many of the techniques that we 've learned so far .
Almost done !
In the last stretch , we 'll address our enemies , their artificial intelligence , and finally the most important part of all modern games :
Believe it or not , the hard part is over .
All that 's left now is to compile your code into a fully - functioning program .
In Notepad , select File > Save
As from the menu , then enter the following in the dialog box that pops up :
Congratulations !
Now that you have a solid programming foundation , the rest comes down to experimentation and creativity .
Keep making games and in no time at all you 'll be a regular John Carmack or the guy that worked on that one Lego game , I think it was either the second Harry Potter game or the fifth Star Wars one .

Software systems could one day analyze everything from blurry war - zone footage to the subtle sarcasm in a written paragraph , thanks to two unassuming scientists who are inspired by biology to make revolutionary strides in intelligent computing .
Yann LeCun and Rob Fergus , both computer science professors at New York University , are the brains behind " Deep Learning , " a program sponsored by Darpa , the Pentagon 's blue - sky research agency .
The idea , ultimately , is to develop code that can teach itself to spot objects in a picture , actions in a video , or voices in a crowd .
LeCun and Fergus have $ 2 million and four years to make it happen .
Existing software programs rely heavily on human assistance to identify objects .
A user extracts key feature sets , like edge statistics ( how many edges an object has , and where they are ) and then feeds the data into a running algorithm , which uses the feature sets to recognize the visual input .
" People spend huge amounts of time building these feature sets , figuring out which are better or more accurate , and then refining them , " LeCun told Danger Room .
" The question we 're asking is whether we can create computers that automatically learn feature sets from data .
The brain can do it , so why not machines ? "
The computer systems will be inspired by biology , but not modeled after it .
That 's because researchers still are n't entirely sure how animals are able to turn inputs – an object , a movement , a sound – into usable information .
Ten years ago , a study at MIT helped answer the question .
Researchers rewired ferret brains , so that the optical nerve fed into the auditory cortex , and vice versa .
But the ferrets still saw and heard normally , leading the team to conclude that brain function depends on the signal – not the area .
Brains also display plenty of abstraction when it comes to identifying specific inputs : LeCun was inspired to create his algorithmic layering approach , called " a convolutional network , " by the 1960s research of David Hubel and Torstein Weisel .
The two used cats to demonstrate how the brain 's visual cortex relies on abstractions to create complex representations of a given visual input .
In other words , LeCun said , " There 's some sort of learning algorithm within the brain .
We just do n't know what it is . "
But the algorithmic talents of the mind , along with its ability to identify visual data by abstraction , will be the key components of the NYU team 's new system .
Right now , an algorithm recognizes objects in one of two ways .
In one , it is shown some representative examples of what , say , a horse looks like .
Then the code tries to match any new creature to the ur-stallion .
( That 's called " supervised " learning . )
In the other way , the software is shown lots and lots of horses , and it builds its own model of what a horse is supposed to resemble .
( That 's " unsupervised " learning . )
What LeCun and Fergus are trying to do is make code that can get it right on a first , unsupervised example – using layer after layer of code to abstract the essential attributes of an object .
This first step is to turn an image into numbers :
For a 100 x 100 pixel image , the software produces a grid of 10,000 numbers ; 9 x 9 " masks " are then applied to that grid , to uncover attributes of the image .
The first feature spotted is an object 's edge .
( The human brain makes a similar initial pass . )
Several more " masks " follow .
The final output ?
A series of 256 numbers that identifies the input .
The two are only six weeks into the project , but they 've already got demos up and running .
The Deep Learning algorithm and I had never met , but with a quick shot by a small webcam on LeCun 's laptop , the layers of code captured my features and could immediately distinguish me from other objects and people in LeCun 's office .
The same thing happens when LeCun introduces the system to two different coffee mugs – it takes mere seconds for the computer to acquaint itself with each , then distinguish one from the other .
And this is only the beginning .
Darpa also wants a system that can spot activities , like running , jumping or getting out of a car .
The final version will operate unsupervised , by being programmed to hold itself accountable for errors – and then auto - correct them at each algorithmic layer .
It should also be able to apply the layered algorithmic technique to text .
Right now , computer systems can parse sentences to categorize them as positive or negative , based on how often different words appear in the text .
By applying layers of analysis , the Deep Learning machine will – LeCun and Fergus hope – spot sarcasm and irony too .
" Ideally , what we 'll come away with is a ' generic learning box ' that can identify every data cue , " Fergus tells Danger Room .

An international team of astrophysicists has just unveiled the most complete atlas of nuclear rings , enormous star - forming ring - shaped regions that circle certain galactic nuclei .
The catalogue , published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , includes 113 such rings in 107 galaxies .
" AINUR ( the Atlas of Images of Nuclear Rings ) is the most complete atlas of nuclear rings created to date , " says Sébastien Comerón , a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands ( IAC ) , and co-author of the joint study with other scientists from the universities of La Laguna , Oulu ( Finland ) and Alabama ( United States ) .
The atlas has just been published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , and covers 113 nuclear rings in 107 different galaxies .
Six are dust rings in elliptical galaxies , while the rest ( the majority ) are star - forming rings in disc galaxies .
The nuclear rings are ring - shaped , star - forming configurations located around galactic nuclei .
They range in size on average from between 500 to 3,000 light years , and they are very bright because they contain an abundance of young stars , including some extremely massive ones .
This kind of star has a short lifetime but shines very brightly before exploding as a supernova .
To find the rings , the astrophysicists used images from around 500 galaxies observed by the Hubble space telescope , which belongs to NASA and the European Space Agency , as well as using other references .
The images were processed using filters , generating various kinds of maps to help identify the rings more easily .
Rings and Lindblad resonances
" The AINUR atlas has also looked for relationships between the properties of the nuclear rings and those of the galaxies in which they are found , " says Comerón , " and we have been able to statistically prove that most rings are associated with Lindblad resonances ( gravitational shoves that push objects out of certain orbits and into others ) . "
The astrophysicists have shown that when the rings are in a barred galaxy ( within disc galaxies , which have a central cylinder or ' cigar ' of stars ) , the maximum radius that a nuclear ring can attain is 25 % of the length of the bar , and that the maximum radius is inversely proportional to the strength of the bar .
This is the behaviour that was predicted for the internal Lindblad resonances , which are determined by the size of the bar and their strength ( how elliptical this is ) .
If the bar is small or very elliptical , the resonance orbit becomes small , but if it is large or not very elliptical , the orbits become bigger .
The researchers also found that , contrary to what had been believed until now , a significant proportion of nuclear rings are to be found in non-barred galaxies ( around 20 % ) .
The resonances needed to form the rings in these galaxies " are probably created by strong spiral arms , weak oval distortions of the disc and some lesser interaction with neighbouring galaxies , " the scientists say .
Steve Jobs has apparently claimed that a patent pool is being assembled to " go after " Ogg Theora , the open source video codec used by the latest browsers from Google , Mozilla , and Opera .
The claim was made in an email the Apple CEO appears to have sent in response to an open source software advocate who questioned Apple 's attachment to the patented H.264 codec .
On Thursday , Hugo Roy , an activist with the Free Software Foundation Europe , sent an email to Steve Jobs in response to the Apple CEO 's much - discussed open letter on Adobe Flash .
The note praised Jobs for his letter - in which he reiterated the company 's commitment to HTML5 and other " open standards " - but Roy also made a point of telling Jobs that such talk of open standards should not include H.264 .
" May I remind you that H.264 is not an open standard ? "
Roy wrote in a missive also posted to the web .
" This video codec is covered by patents ... This is why Mozilla Firefox and Opera have not adopted this video codec for their HTML5 implementation , and decided to choose Theora as a sustainable and open alternative . "
Roy sent his note to what is believed to be Steve Jobs ' email address - sjobs@apple.com - and three hours later , he received a reply .
" All video codecs are covered by patents , " read the reply .
" A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other ' open source ' codecs now .
Unfortunately , just because something is open source , it does n't mean or guarantee that it does n't infringe on others patents .
An open standard is different from being royalty free or open source . "
The email 's headers indicate the message did indeed come from Jobs - the Apple boss has sent several emails of late that have turned up on the web - and Roy tells
The Reg he has no reason to believe that the email is less than genuine .
In the email , Jobs does not say who is assembling the alleged patent pool or what patents are involved or what " other ' open source ' codecs " he 's referring to .
And it 's unclear whether Apple is part of the pool .
But the prospect of such an attack is of grave concern the open source world .
" Multimedia codecs are one of the worst patent minefields out there , enforcement is aggressive and there 's no such thing as a video standard 100 % unencumbered by patents , " Florian Mueller , another open source advocate , says in an email to The Reg .
" There are too many software patents out there to perform reliable clearance and patent offices often grant new patents on old ideas . "
Ogg Theora is based on the VP3 codec , which was released into the public domain by On2 Technologies in 2001 under an irrevocable free license .
Mozilla , Google , and Opera tried to make it part of the HTML5 standard , but they faced hefty opposition from Apple .
As it stands , the HTML5 video standard does not specify a codec , so browser makers are free to use whatever codec they like .
Mozilla , Firefox , and Opera use Ogg. Apple 's Safari uses H.264 .
Google uses both .
And though Internet Explorer 8 does not support the HTML5 video tag , Microsoft will include H.264 - happy HTML5 with IE9 .
Today , with a blog post , Microsoft also argued that the rights to " other codecs are less clear . "
Google recently acquired On2 Technologies , and it's rumored that the company will open source the latest On2 codec , VP8 , to create a license - free codec that offers better performance than Ogg .
Google has said that it has n't adopted Ogg exclusively because it 's not fast enough for a site like YouTube .
H.264 is licensed by MPEG LA , which controls a patent pool around the technology , and Apple is a contributor to the H.264 patent pool .
Presumably , in his email , Jobs is referring to some other pool .
But it 's worth noting that in the past , the MPEG LA has said it " believes " that Ogg infringes at least some of its patents .
Apple has said in the past that it avoids Ogg because of an " uncertain patent landscape . "
But this is the first mention of a pool designed to " go after " the open source codec .
The company has also indicated that it prefers H.264 because Ogg has limited hardware support .
Even if you set the mystery patent pool claim to one side , the alleged Jobs email does n't do much to clarify Apple 's position .
" I 'm completed confused by it , " Roy tells The Reg .
The last sentence of the email - " an open standard is different from being royalty free or open source " - is a truth that does n't really respond to what Roy was trying to say in his original note .
And he questions why Jobs would even respond .
But in recent days , the man has exhibited what would seem to be a compulsive tendency to answer his critics . ®
“ Even though we had built a brand with our existing stations , we decided we could be more efficient , ” said Steve Paulus , who oversees Time Warner Cable ’s local news division .

A consistent name lets the company save money on graphics and marketing .
It encourages more statewide advertising sales .
And it fosters more sharing of news coverage .
“ When they say , ‘ I ’m John Smith for Your News Now , ’ that can play anywhere , ” Mr. Paulus said .
NY1 is exempt because , Mr. Paulus said , it is a 20 - year - old widely recognizable name .
Some staff members in the local newsrooms were reluctant to give up the brand names they had helped build for years .
But Mr. Paulus said “ there was n’t even a blip ” of bad reaction when Rochester ’s channel , formerly called R News , became the first channel to convert last year .
The channels may run on a shoestring , but they are important in Time Warner Cable .
As the primary cable provider in most of the state of New York , its local news channels are a retention tool for cable subscribers ; the channels are not available from competing services like Verizon FiOS .
“ It ’s a hedge against competition , ” Mr. Paulus said .
NY1 is profitable , and the other channels “ are getting there , ” Mr. Paulus said .
The company continues to add local channels , in Buffalo last year and in the Hudson Valley last month .
For the Hudson Valley channel , about 10 employees work in the field while a dozen anchors , producers and technical staff work out of a regional base in Albany .
College student stress is an inevitable part of campus life .
Between studying for final exams , writing papers and giving presentations ( and sometimes working a job on the side ) , you ’re bound to feel stressed out every once in a while .
But do n’t panic .
While having college student stress in your life is pretty much unavoidable , being stressed is something you can control .
Follow these tips when the pressure is on and you need to unwind :
1. Get Enough Sleep
When your body is deprived of sleep , it ’s much more sensitive to the negative effects of college student stress .
Though those early morning classes do not allow for an ideal sleep schedule , you have to make the effort to get in at least seven hours a night .
Getting more sleep helps both mind and body to refocus and recharge .
This will equip you to be more productive in your waking hours , and to stay ahead of stress - causing deadlines .
2. Eat Well
Hectic college schedules make healthy eating difficult for many college students .
Do you eat nothing but cheap , greasy foods at odd hours of the day and night ?
Not only do spotty eating habits in your college meal plan contribute to college student stress levels , they also contribute to your waistline !
Reduce your stress levels by eating simple and healthy meals at appropriate intervals throughout the day .
3. Get Some Exercise
Physical exercise is important for your overall health .
Any time is a good time to be physically active .
Take a 30 - minute walk while listening to your iPod — it ’s relaxing , and helps you stay healthy in college .
A bicycle is a time - honored way to get from one end of campus to another .
And never turn down a chance to use the stairs over an elevator .
Your body needs some movement after a day ’s worth of sitting in lecture halls or doing homework .
It ’ll help relieve college student stress and it will also help you sleep .
4. Take Some Quiet Time
In the midst of your daily schedule , you probably do n’t have much time to yourself .
Living with a college roommate , and spending most of your time on a bustling campus , can be mentally exhausting .
To relieve some college student stress , go out of your way to spend some time alone .
Enjoying some peace and quiet — with no cell phone , roommates , or crowds — will allow you to reflect and recuperate .
5. Ask for Help
College student stress is common , and may occasionally need more attention than simply changing a few lifestyle habits .
Sometimes you just need to vent !
Remember that you ’re not the only one who ’s stressing .
If you ’re having a particularly tough time managing school or dealing with homesickness , do n’t be afraid to ask your friends , family or student health center for help .
Each of these healthy lifestyle choices will help you to manage your college student stress – and remember , you can always ask for help if you need it .
Well it seems like it ’s Kelis day here at Details of my life so far .. today .
I was going to post up Kelis ’s appearance on Radio 1 ’s Live Lounge , but their website has been giving me issues so I decided to give it some time before I go back .
Instead I have managed to source two new leaks from her new album Flesh Tone which gets an exclusive release here in the UK on May 17th ( 6th July for America ) .
I did initially think I was quite quick off the mark with these tracks , but it seems they have been floating around for a while now , never mind , since they are both great songs .
The first track is 4th of July ( Fireworks ) which is produced by DJ Ammo who has worked with the likes of Jordin Sparks , Pitbull and Ke$ha in the past .
It ’s quite a long song , weighing in at nearly nine whole minutes , but it has several catchy and memorable sections to it .
The second is simply called Home .
It ’s shorter , it ’s punchier and definitely more in your face .
No idea who is responsible for the production though , so let me know if you have more information
Kelis – 4th of July ( Fireworks )

As oil from the massive BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico approached the US coastline , a CBS News crew was threatened by the US Coast Guard with arrest if they attempted to film a beach in South Pass , Louisiana .
“ When we tried to reach the beach … a boat of BP contractors with two Coast Guard officers on board told us to turn around under threat of arrest , ” CBS ’s Kelly Cobiella reported on Tuesday .
“ This is BP ’s rules , it ’s not ours , ” an officer can be seen calling from the other boat in the CBS video .
“ We spoke to Coast Guard officials today , ” Cobiella concluded .
“ They say they are looking into it . ”

The fear running through the Greek populace is that the nation ’s government may default on some of its debts .
Since 1965 , the Greek government has imposed restrictions on trading British Sovereign gold coins ( gold content .2354 oz ) .
Despite those restrictions , the Bank of Greece reports that it is selling an average of more than 700 coins per day to worried Greeks .
In the first four months of 2010 , the Greek central bank sold more than 50,000 sovereigns at its main downtown Athens office .
Bank officials estimate that at least 100,000 other coins changed hands on the black market .
The Bank of Greece has received as much as $ 409 per coin , which works out to a price of more than $ 1,700 per ounce of gold !
Prices paid on the black market are reckoned to be even higher .
A popular spot for street vendors to sell their coins is near the Athens Stock Exchange .
There the traders wait for citizens to bring payments received from unloading their paper assets like stocks and bonds .
The US government and some state governments such as California are in financial straits as bad as or even worse than Greece .
How long will it take before American buyers will have to wait in lines to pay outrageous premiums for what are now bullion - priced gold and silver coins ?
More than one analyst thinks those days will come within a few months or sooner .
Where does the US government and its trading partners get their hands on enough physical gold to help suppress gold prices ?
Reg Howe , an analyst who writes at www.goldensextant.com, once sued the Federal Reserve , other central banks and official agencies , and major bullion banks .
He scrutinizes the twice yearly report on derivatives issued by the Bank for International Settlements .
The December 31 , 2009 report was released two weeks ago .
Howe thinks he can trace one means by which physical gold is being leaked onto the market without any apparent source .
A central bank can lend gold to a major bank .
Under IMF rules , the central bank is able to continue to report loaned gold as still being in its vaults .
The bank then can sell its gold to the GLD exchange traded fund in return for shares of GLD .
This way , the bank theoretically has about netted its gold position .
Then GLD can lease the gold , which is authorized under GLD ’s operating documents , which means that GLD can still claim to have all of its gold liabilities covered .
It would be the lessee of the gold that would sell it onto the physical market , thereby putting some downward pressure on prices .
In theory , the central bank , the bank , and GLD all have their positions covered .
However , if the lessee is unable to repay the gold someday , and rising gold prices increase the risk just such an occurrence , then there could potentially be a domino effect of multiple parties suddenly finding out they are in default of their liabilities to produce the physical gold they have reported as being an asset .
As each day passes , the risk is growing that owning any form of “ paper gold ” could turn out to be as worthless as the paper currencies used to purchase it .
While you still can , you should protect yourself by converting such “ assets ” into real physical gold .

Sleep is Death ( Geisterfahrer ) by Jason Rohrer will not require a top - of - the - line graphics card .
It does n’t sport a sleek , bleeding - edge interface .
In fact , boasting a whopping 640×480 screen resolution , Sleep is Death is as bare bones as it gets .
The graphics are reminiscent of Sierra On - Line ’s earliest King ’s Quest titles , and there is no real animation to speak of .
Do n’t let it deter you .
With it latest build v15 , released Friday , May 28 , 2010 , being called the official stable release , Sleep Is Death is ready for prime time .
Created as a commission for the Art History of Games Conference , Sleep is Death was never meant to be a pre-fabricated blockbuster experience .
It is a toy chest overloaded with simple , but well - loved toys : Police badges , Indian headdresses , magnifying glasses , and an array of disguises .
Sleep is Death does away with the notion that game must be shipped in a complete state .
Extensive Q and A sessions are n’t required .
Each game requires two players ; one to create the game , and one to take the created world for a spin .
The player has 30 seconds to make an action happen , either by speaking , or interacting with an object on screen .
The ball is then tossed back to the creator , who has 30 seconds to accommodate or ignore the words or deeds of the player .
The results can be awkward , hilarious , and quite often brilliant .
As the player , I found that kind of freedom to be unsettling at first .
Via text box entry , you have the freedom to make your character say whatever you want , and you ’ll never be met with a “ does not compute ” response from a canned AI .
Click on any item laid out in a room , and type in what you want to do with it .
Maybe you ’d like to climb the tree ?
Maybe you ’ll curl up next to it , and read a book .
Maybe you ’ll propose to it .
Anything you choose to say or do is conveyed to the creator , and it is up to him to decide what to do with your choices .
That , by itself , is a liberating notion .
As the creator , having the freedom and the power to create a world on the fly is thrilling .
Having the ability to jerk around the player in various , inappropriate ways is tempting .
Having a thirty second time limit in which to bring it all to fruition is nerve - wracking !
Whether you are pulling the strings , or having someone yank your chains , Sleep is Death lives up to its name – the player and the creator both need to be on their toes at all times .
Wherein Fly Fishing Naturally Leads To Kafka
In my first play through as a creator ( with my wife filling the role of the player on her PC in another room ) , I threw together a quick setting using the preset farmhouse interior setting .
I decided that my wife would play as the farm boy , and the game started simply enough : Dad asking his son if he wanted to do some fishing .
She grabbed for the rod I had placed in the corner of the room , and we were off .
Once I got past the initial jitters of controlling the game world , I found switching between scenes to be quick and intuitive .
Dad and son went down to the fishing hole .
A young , foul - mouthed neighbor boy arrived to declare that this was HIS fishing hole and he was n’t interested in sharing !
A fishing contest ensued , and after losing , the neighbor boy left in a noticeable huff .
Dad and son triumphantly headed home to cook their catch .
At this point , I decided to shake things up a bit .
Rather than place the farm house interior down as before , I placed an old , run -down version of the same scene .
The farmer was distraught to see what had become of his home !
The boy ( played by my wife ) discovered a small cellar door ( which I had n’t seen upon placing the scene ! ) and decided to open it .
Caught off guard and fumbling with my thirty second time limit , I grabbed for the first scene I could come up with : a crowded court room .
Rather than throw my hands up in disgust , I decided to run with it .
Suddenly , the simple story of a boy and his dad fishing had turned into The Trial by Franz Kafka .
Dad and son were charged with an unnamed crime , and had to defend themselves .
I put all of that together after watching only the first 10 minute instructional video .
It is possible to create your own items , character sprites , tiles sets and background music .
If you have a grand interactive story in mind , the tools give you all you need to lay out a solid framework before opening your vision to visitors .
View the rest of the how - to videos on the site to fine tune your creation abilities if you are determined to be ready for any takers .
Any of your creations can be uploaded to be shared with what is quickly becoming a thriving community fan - base supported by mods ( including a 16 - bit version ) , premade stories and much more in the same way the the Linerider community developed and flourished .
Though the assortment of resources that ship with the game is far from robust , a little poking around on the fan sites will reveal a treasure trove or user - created content .
Sleep Is Death Is Dungeons and Dragons + Flip Books + Music Sequencer ?
Sleep is Death is revolutionary in that it is allowing an interactive storytelling experience much like paper and dice Dungeons and Dragons did between the Dungeon Master and player character and also in a way that Sims creator Will Wright always wished and encouraged of his Sims community but it is doing it very differently .
By permitting almost any variable , object , setting or scenario , making it something that is not only recordable but portable , Sleep is Death serves also as a legitimate idea generation tool that whose utility extends beyond similar games ; even the Sims , with its many expansion packs , somehow always feels like it is locked inside its own universe and its many conditions for survival and success restrict the possibilities for truly imaginative variation .
Another fascinating aspect of this program is the completely self - contained music creation engine , a means to build custom soundtracks by selecting from a wide variety of instruments and timbres as well as entirely editable note sequences .
This element alone is worth ten times the asking price .
And I am certain that the well goes far deeper than even all that we have mentioned above .
Network Is Death
There is a caveat to all this wonderful news , however , and that is that getting the game to connect with someone over a network can be troublesome .
Although it looks to be quite simple , there are many complaints of firewall and router configurations leading to problem actually hosting or joining a friend in - game .
The official site does offer a variety of guides , FAQs and link resources , valiantly attempting to assist as much as possible to get things rolling , so if you have the wherewithal and determination to sort out network issues – you will be in the midst of discovering something truly remarkable .
Fortunately , attempting this on a LAN proved much more reliable .
Currently , the latest build is being offered on a Pay - What - You - Want basis with a $ 1.75 minimum .
One purchase gets you a download code that can be used infinitely on two computers .
Additionally you will receive the Windows build , MacOS build ( 10.2 and later , PPC / Intel ) , full source code bundle ( which can also be compiled on GNU / Linux ) and several resource packs , including one by Spore artist Shannon Galvin .
There are few indie games generating as much buzz in the independent and underground gaming communities as Sleep is Death , and with good reason .
It ’s likely this seemingly stripped - down set of tools will entice players and game designers alike to shake off a long , comfy slumber and bring some real intimacy into the world of video games .
If they can wrap their heads around it .
Get the game and join the community now at the official Sleep Is Death site .

Video : Laser creates clouds
A laser pulse ( red ) ionises air and triggers the condensation of water droplets to create a cloud , which is illuminated by a second , green laser ( Image : Jean - Pierre Wolf / University of Geneva )
A laser has been used to generate small clouds on demand in lab , and real - world experiments suggest this could be a way to call down rain when it ’s needed .
People have experimented with cloud seeding for decades in the hope of boosting rainfall , usually by sprinkling silver iodide crystals into clouds high in the atmosphere .
These crystals encourage large water droplets to form around them , and the droplets then fall as rain – in theory , at least .
“ The efficiency of this technique is controversial , ” says Jérôme Kasparian at the University of Geneva , Switzerland , one member of a research team that think lasers may be a better way to trigger rain on demand .
Advertisement
Kasparian and colleagues have just reported the first successful use of this technique to summon clouds from air both in the lab and in the skies over Berlin , Germany .
Cloud chamber
In the lab the team fired extremely short pulses of infrared laser light into a chamber of water - saturated air at - 24 °C .
Linear clouds could be seen to form in the laser ’s wake , like a miniature airplane contrail .
Kasparian says that the laser pulses generate clouds by stripping electrons from atoms in air , which encourage the formation of hydroxyl radicals .
Those convert sulphur and nitrogen dioxides in air into particles that act as seeds to grow water droplets .
Each laser pulse packs a 220 - millijoule punch into just 60 femtoseconds – an intensity “ equivalent to the power of 1000 power plants , ” says Kasparian .
Natural clouds
Analysis of the air in the chamber after the laser was switched off showed that the total volume of condensed water droplets inside had increased by half , and that within the clouds the volume of condensed water had risen 100 - fold .
However , conditions of extremely high humidity at low temperature like those of the lab experiment are unlike those seen in the atmosphere , says Daniel Rosenfeld , an atmospheric scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel .
“ Whatever has been documented in this experiment is of little relevance to natural clouds , ” he says .
Kasparian counters that results from repeating the experiment in the skies of Berlin suggest the effect can work under natural conditions .
His team sent pulses into the autumn sky , focussed 60 metres up .
Nothing could be seen with the naked eye , but weather LIDAR , which uses lasers to measuring light scattering in the atmosphere , confirmed that the density and size of water droplets spiked when the laser was fired .
“ As in the lab , the effect is clearly detected , ” Kasparian says .
“ It does not require saturation of the atmosphere . ”
His team will now try to boost the effect by optimising the laser wavelength , its focus and the pulse duration , which could produce droplets large enough to fall as rain .

When Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) unveiled their long - awaited American Power
Act last week , it drew two sharply different responses from two collections of activist groups .
Two hundred groups that might be called “ little green ” immediately condemned the climate and energy bill in a joint letter , calling it “ greenwashing in the extreme . ”
The coalition consists of regional environmental , peace , and religious groups — such as Do n’t Waste Arizona , the Snake River Alliance , and the Turtle Island Restoration Network .
“ This bill is just business - as - usual : taxpayer giveaways to giant nuclear and other energy corporations wrapped in the guise of doing something about our climate crisis , ” they wrote .
Big Green issued its own statement the same morning .
It was neither an endorsement nor an attack on the bill .
It was thoroughly — impressively — devoid of any clear opinion of the bill .
“ It is time for America ’s leaders to get serious … the Gulf Coast oil catastrophe is yet another reminder … President Obama and leaders of both parties in Congress must provide the leadership necessary to develop a clean energy and climate solution , ” said the joint letter from 23 larger and more D.C. - centric groups , including Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , the Sierra Club , Audubon , and the League of Conservation Voters .
The Kerry - Lieberman bill is undoubtedly flawed from an environmental perspective ; in addition to giveaways for the nuclear , oil , and coal industries , there are the weak emission - reduction targets and the heavy reliance on carbon offsets .
Every concession to polluter interests was added in hopes of luring enough fossil - fuel - beholden senators to reach the painfully difficult 60 - vote threshold .
That ’s considered the only realistic way to pass a climate bill in 2010 .
Kerry , in a Grist post , implored greens not to slam the bill because it ’s too weak , saying it ’s better to get started with an imperfect bill .
This all puts green groups in the thorny position of having to either endorse flawed , compromise - laden legislation or oppose the closest thing to a decent climate bill we ’re going to see this year , and perhaps for years to come .
Many big green groups will probably end up supporting the bill , but do n’t want to tip their hand while there ’s still a chance to improve it .
Hence the awkward non-comment last week .
Many activist - oriented groups — including the 200 signees and notable big dogs Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth — have already made their opposition known .
Courtesy Climate SOSThis is far from the first inter-movement dispute among green groups .
Last fall I reported on a “ no compromise ” faction of liberal groups that attacked Al Gore , the Waxman - Markey House bill , and carbon markets that allow polluters to buy and sell emissions credits .
They argued that larger environmental groups had given away too much in collaborating with businesses and Democratic lawmakers .
Reps from EDF , the Natural Resources Defense Council , and the Center for American Progress found this , shall we say , annoying .
Two kinds of hope
So which approach is , y’know , better for saving the earth ?
It ’s worth noting that all the groups involved have shown they understand the scientific urgency of an aggressive clean - energy plan .
And they all want President Obama to use his bully pulpit to give the issue more attention .
The disagreement is about political strategy .
At first blush , the left wing of the environmental movement seems to have the more optimistic approach , refusing to settle for a faulty bill and betting that it can create a groundswell of support for more hard - hitting climate legislation over the coming year or two — enough to force members of Congress to turn its way , or force out members of Congress who do n’t .
The Big Green groups look to have the more pessimistic approach by supporting a crappy bill .
They say they do n’t see a path to a better one in the immediate future .
Even getting the Kerry - Lieberman bill passed would be a huge uphill battle .
And with Republicans poised to gain a number of seats in both the House and Senate in November ’s midterm elections , the chances of passing any climate bill at all next year or the year after — let alone a better bill than Kerry - Lieberman — seem even more remote .
Here ’s the counter - argument : Big Green is embracing a different kind of optimism .
They are banking on the notion that building a clean - energy economy will be cheaper and easier than expected , and that once we get started , even with weak half - measures , success will follow upon success .
David Roberts explained this view last week : “ Right now , policy is being made out of fear : fear by the private sector that decarbonization will be a crushing burden ; fear by consumers that their energy prices will skyrocket ; fear by politicians that the project will prove electorally unpopular . ”
But there are “ huge opportunities for low - cost ( or negative - cost ) emission reductions just waiting to be exploited , ” he argues .
If a weak bill gets that process started , it can alleviate fears , begin moving the country in the direction of a clean - energy economy , and make it easier to pass stronger legislation down the line .
So either camp can claim to be more hopeful — one in the short term and one in the long term .
The problem is that by working against each other , they sap enthusiasm for building a popular movement for climate action .
Lots of Americans would like to see the U.S. move toward a clean - energy economy and address the climate threat — 61 percent of respondents said so in a recent poll .
But squabbles among environmentalists risk turning them off .
And building a diverse movement should be goal No. 1 , according to author and 350.org organizer Bill McKibben .
He argues that lawmakers do n’t yet feel pressure from the public to take the climate threat seriously .
“ There are lots and lots and lots of groups lobbying Congress , ” he told Grist in January .
“ But Congress members are good at telling whether there ’s anything behind that lobbying or not .
I think we have to figure out how to put some pressure behind that lobbying . ”
Until then , he argues , the focus on Congress is premature .
He may be right that movement - building — the focus of 350.org — is the long - term imperative .
But there ’s a bill in the Senate that demands a response right now .
So how should environmental organizations and concerned citizens respond to the bill ?
What ’s the best way to built momentum toward a strong climate movement ?
And how do we get started with solutions as soon as possible ?
A judge Friday morning ordered the San Diego Police Department to return all property seized from medical marijuana patient and provider Eugene Davidovich , including the dried marijuana and concentrated cannabis seized more than a year ago , in February 2009 .
“ Although I do n’t agree with this , I have no choice but to return the property of Mr. Davidovich , ” said Judge David Szumowski .
“ After receiving a refusal from the District Attorney ’s office to comply with our letter of demand for the return of all my property , today we were forced to spend more of our resources as well as the taxpayers ’ resources on frivolous litigation caused by San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis ’s bias and hate towards medical marijuana , ” Davidovich said .
Davidovich , the former defendant in a San Diego medical marijuana trial , said the office of the District Attorney was wrongfully holding his belongings , despite his acquittal by a jury .
Eugene became a spokesman for local medical marijuana patients when his home was raided and four charges brought against him .
According to Davidovich , the reason he had to go back to court to get his belongings is likely political Davidovich was one of 37 people charged with criminal offenses during Operation Endless Summer in 2008 .
He was unanimously found not guilty by a jury on March 25 .
“ Will Ms. Dumanis ever stop going after medical marijuana patients and begin respecting state law ? ” Davidovich asked .
Attorney Michael McCabe had already contacted Deputy District Attorney Theresa
Pham at least five times to obtain Davidovich ’s belongings , to no avail .
McCabe was eventually forced to send a letter ( PDF ) to Pham on April 7 with the formal request .
“ Since Mr. Davidovich was acquitted of all charges by the jury ’s verdict on March 25 , 2010 , your office has no legitimate reason to continue to maintain possession of these items , ” McCabe wrote in his letter .
“ Thus , under the express power conferred upon the Court by Penal Code 15365 , these items must be returned to Mr. Davidovich . ”
The letter said that the D.A. is required , under California law , to return “ 34.1 grams of marijuana contained within 11 separate plastic bags , as well as 14.59 grams of concentrated cannabis ( hashish ) contained within three plastic bags . ”
Take a look at the incredible artwork that adorns our walls , ceilings , floors , doors and more at our pubs , breweries and hotels .
Who thinks up this stuff ?
Who creates it ?
What is the inspiration ?
Originally , the artwork served a practical purpose – as Mike McMenamin puts it , " We had good - sized walls to cover . "
But over the course of twenty - plus years , the art evolved into an expression of the building 's history , the company 's mission and of McMenamins itself .

Warning : Spoilers
After watching preview clips , I must admit that I expected this one to be better that The Payback and in some ways , it was .
The storyline , however , never really flowed as it should have as it kept going back and forth , not giving the viewer a chance to really understand what was happening and I really did n't care for the hip hop music that much anyway .
When Kevin was n't on screen , the movie tended to fall a little flat , but his appearance seemed to pick things up a bit .
Kevin was great in this , and while I thought the scene as a whole was gory , he did some really great work in the torture scene .
If I had to choose a favorite scene , it would be the front porch reunion between Nick & Kate - it seemed to show that they really did love & care for each other .
The ending was a bit weird to me , but seeing Nick & Sam finally bonding after the earlier strain in their relationship was nice .
Overall , it was a good effort on Kevin 's part , but I would n't recommend it unless you are a die hard Sorbo fan !

September 2003 - und nicht der 11 .
September 2001 Peter Mühlbauer
Die deutsche Rezeption der beiden South Park Jubiläumsfolgen zeigt auf mehrerlei Weise , warum die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " der schlimmere Zensor ist als die Angst vor dem Islamismus
Deutsche Printmedien entdeckten erst mit einer guten Woche Verspätung , dass Trey Parker und Matt Stone in der zweihundertsten South - Park - Folge die Mohammed - Karikaturendebatte behandelten .
Das ist insoweit wenig verwunderlich , als Printmedien ihrer Natur nach den Geschehnissen immer ein bisschen stärker hinterherhinken als andere .
Seltsam war allerdings , dass praktisch alle Zeitungen den Inhalt der Episoden 200 und 201 falsch wiedergaben und behaupteten , dort werde der Religionsstifter Mohammed in einem Bärenkostüm dargestellt , was Anlass für Drohungen von Islamisten sei .
Die Feuilletonrundschau Perlentaucher fertigte nach Sichtung dieser Artikel einen
Text , der in seiner ursprünglichen Fassung nur darum ging , welche Zeitung sich traut , " Mohammed im Bärenkostüm " darzustellen und welche nicht .
Auf den ( wie später noch zu sehen sein wird ) mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit via Google gefundenen Bildern sah man dann zwar tatsächlich eine Figur in einem Bärenkostüm - allerdings wiesen Plot und Silhouette bereits im ersten Teil der Doppelfolge sehr deutlich darauf hin , dass nicht der " Unparodierbare " in diesem Kostüm steckt .
Und Stan Marsh sagt seinem Vater Randy in Teil 2 noch einmal klar , warum man durchaus darauf kommen hätte müssen : " If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume , why would it actually be Muhammad , you fucking idiot ! "
Doch selbst , wenn sich die deutschen Printmedien darauf berufen wollten , dass Teil 1 theoretisch auch anders fortgesetzt werden hätte können , erklärt dies nicht die Artikel mit den falschen Tatsachenbehauptungen ( die Trey Parker und Matt Stone durchaus abmahnen könnten , wenn ihnen jemand steckt , wie einfach das mit dem weltweit einzigartigen deutschen Abmahnrecht geht und wie lukrativ das ist ) .
Denn alle Artikel erschienen erst zu einem Zeitpunkt , als der zweite Teil bereits ausgestrahlt und damit unwiderlegbar klar war , dass nicht Mohammed , sondern der Weihnachtsmann in dem Bärenkostüm steckte .
Neben dem Mohammed im Bärenkostüm , der keiner ist , fällt an der Darstellung der beiden Folgen in den deutschen Medien noch etwas auf : Obwohl es darin eher um die Zensurdebatte über die Mohammed - Karrikaturen , als um die Figur des Religionsstifters geht , kommt in Teil 1 nämlich tatsächlich ein gezeichneter Mohammed vor - der aber offenbar niemanden gestört zu haben scheint .
Randy Marsh meint dort nämlich , er hätte nach gründlichen Recherchen herausgefunden , wie Mohammed heute aussehen könnte - und präsentiert dann ein Strichmännchen in rudimentärster Form .
Woher kam die Fehlinformation über den angeblichen Mohammed im Bärenkostüm ?
Sie geht zurück auf das in den USA gehostete Islamistenforum RevolutionaryMuslim.com , in dem eine sehr fadenscheinig als " Warnung " getarnte Drohung gegen Parker und Stone ausgesprochen worden war , weil diese die Figur angeblich so darstellten würden .
Ob die Islamisten den Ersten Teil der Doppelfolge gesehen und ( weil popkulturelle Analphabeten ) nicht verstanden hatten , oder ob ihnen jemand den I nhalt falsch erzählt hatte , lässt sich nicht feststellen , weil die Konvertiten , die hinter der Site stecken , nicht auf Medienanfragen reagieren .
Fest steht in jedem Fall , dass der amerikanische Nachrichtensender CNN in einer Meldung zu dieser Drohung den Plot der Doppelfolge ebenfalls so wiedergab , als stecke tatsächlich Mohammed im Bärenkostüm - und dieser Berichterstattung schlossen sich alle deutschen Medien an .
Doch warum überprüfte nicht wenigstens ein Mainstreammedium diese Darstellung ?
War die Zeitnot unter deutschen Feuilletonautoren wirklich so groß , dass sie es sich nicht erlauben konnten , zwei Mal zwanzig Minuten dem zu widmen , über das sie schrieben ?
War es vielleicht schiere Faulheit ?
Oder steckte etwas anderes dahinter , das möglicherweise interessantere Einblicke über Zensur in Deutschland bieten kann als die wieder aufgewärmte Mohammed - Karikaturendebatte ?
Verlorenes Wissen über Filesharing , Sharehoster und Streamingportale
Einen Hinweis gibt die auf einen Tadel hin gemachte Äußerung eines Autors bei einer größeren norddeutschen Tageszeitung , möglicherweise habe ja tatsächlich der Weihnachtsmann in dem Bärenkostüm gesteckt - aber das könne man ja nicht nachprüfen , weil die entsprechenden Folgen auf dem offiziellen Portal nicht verfügbar seien .
Knappe sieben Jahre nach dem Zypries - Urheberrechtsgesetz vom 13 .
September 2003 , seinen Verboten der Werbung für und der Anleitung zu " Umgehungstechnologie " und diversen ( wenn auch noch nicht höchstrichterlich bestätigten ) Gerichtsurteilen , scheint also zwar nicht beim Volk , aber doch bei den Zeitungsschreibern , das Wissen über Filesharing , Sharehoster und Streamingportale so weit verloren gegangen zu sein , dass man automatisch davon ausgeht , dass nicht existiert , was nicht auf einem offiziellen Portal abrufbar ist .
Man würde den armen Printredakteuren selbstverständlich nur allzu gerne helfen - doch so umfangreich , wie Monopolrechte derzeit geschützt sind , wäre sowohl ein Link auf MegaUpload ein rechtliches Risiko , als auch eine simple Anleitung , welche fünf Worte jemand bei Google eingeben muss , um sich die Folgen ansehen zu können .
Das alles ist Zensur , die dafür sorgt , dass der deutsche Journalismus tendenziell schlechter wird .
Auch der vom Perlentaucher allein mit Angst vor islamistischen Halsabschneidern erklärte Verzicht auf Bilder könnte in dem einen oder anderen Fall von der Angst vor einer anderen Sorte Halsabschneider mit bestimmt gewesen sein .
Immerhin musste der Bundesgerichtshof gestern tatsächlich über die Klage einer Rechteinhaberin entscheiden , die zwar ihre Bilder offen ins Web stellte , dann aber von Google Geld wollte , weil der Konzern diese bei Suchanfragen als Thumbnails präsentierte .
Was hier 2006 geschrieben wurde , das gilt deshalb heute noch stärker als damals : Die Zensur durch die Religion vom " Geistigen Eigentum " ist weniger sichtbar , aber umfassender als die Zensur durch traditionelle Religionen .

Bangladesh 's dark brothel steroid secret
Please turn on JavaScript .

Every country has secrets it does not want foreigners to discover , and I have just found one in Bangladesh .
It is a vast brothel , where 800 women and girls lead painful and degrading lives , in the otherwise pleasant town of Tangail , a place of flowering trees and atmospheric old bazaars , a couple of hours drive from the capital Dhaka .
At first glance the brothel does not look any different to countless other slums in this country , which is one of Asia 's poorest and most congested .
It is a densely packed collection of tin shacks , alleyways and open sewers .
It has perfectly normal looking shops selling things like soap , biscuits and light bulbs .
It has a hair salon , tea stalls and a Muslim shrine .
There are young children playing in every corner .
But the brothel , which is only a five minute walk from the town centre , is policed by men carrying heavy wooden staves .
Its sewers have been blocked by used condoms , and at two in the afternoon it is crowded with customers taking an extended lunch break .
It is one of 14 official Bangladeshi brothels .
All women working here have to have legal documents proving they are over 18 , but many are clearly younger than that .
In theory the women can walk out of the brothel whenever they want , but in practice that seldom happens .
By working here , even against their will , they become social outcasts and are rejected by their families and communities .
For most women , the brothel is also their prison , until men no longer want to have sex with them , and they are forced out to fend for themselves .
Desperate measures
Since the men do not pay much , the women need to have many clients every day .
And even though there is no shortage of clients , competition is intense , and the prostitutes are forced to take some desperate measures to survive .
Most , I learn , take a steroid called Oradexon .
They take it because they say it makes them stronger , larger and more attractive .
They say that Bangladeshi men like big women .
But it is also the same drug that farmers here use to fatten up their cattle before taking them to market .
Also , according to the charity ActionAid , it can cause terrible health problems , and even result in death if misused .
One user is Ranu .
She is so sought - after that when I interview her , three men are prepared to sit in line for her on old bags of cement .
Her mother also worked in the brothel , so this is where Ranu , who is now 28 , was born and brought up .
She says she is taking the steroids so that her own child will have a better future .
' No remorse '
" I used to have small breasts but they are now bigger and my hips are larger too ... demand for me has risen , " she says .
" I do n't worry about the health risks because I have a son .
I take Oradexon and I have good customers and I have made quite a good future for my son .
" If I die because of taking Oradexon I wo n't have any remorse because my son is all set , " she says .
But not everyone here has the freedom to choose .
The brothel is controlled by a group of madams , who used to be prostitutes themselves .
They insist that the women who work for them take the pills .
Underage girls take them to become stronger , older women to stay fit .
One of the madams is called Shanti .
She says that she is not worried about the health risks and she has never heard of anyone having any problems .
Harmful
" When I came here as a young girl I was skinny and dark skinned .
I had to take the pills to become fatter , and it is the same for the women who work for me now .
I also make sure they eat lots of rice and take vitamin pills .
That 's what the customers like , " she says .
These pills are indeed fine if prescribed by a doctor and taken for a limited period of time .
In Bangladesh , Oradexon is commonly used to help asthma sufferers .
But the women in the brothel take them continuously for years , and local pharmacists and doctors are only too willing to keep pushing them .
A recent survey , carried out by ActionAid in two different brothels , found Oradexon to be extremely addictive and harmful in many different ways .
It says the pills can affect the women 's hormones , cause high blood pressure , skin rashes and liver damage .
Over time , they can make the women more likely to get infections .
It also believes that three women died after taking the steroids and has launched a campaign to inform the women of the drug 's dangers .
" We are trying to make the sex workers realise that this is harmful for them and that if they can reduce taking it gradually , they can improve a lot , " Action Aid 's Luftun Nahar explained .
But without government help , this campaign is unlikely to have much impact , as there are so many prostitutes in Bangladesh .

We have learnt that prostitutes are taking it to develop their bodies , but we advise them not to as long - term use can be deadly ” End Quote Drug firm executive
The authorities however seem unwilling to intervene in the brothels in any meaningful way , apart from occasionally threatening to allow property developers to bulldoze one or other of them .
The drug 's manufacturer , Orion Laboratories , says the drug is safe - if used properly .
" Oradexon can be used for curing allergies and inflammations .
It is very effective and safe , but if anyone misuses it and takes it for a long time , it can cause all sorts of problems , " said senior executive Nantu Krishna Kundu .
" We have learnt that prostitutes are taking it to develop their bodies , but we advise them not to as long - term use can be deadly .
Nobody should buy it without the advice of their doctor . "
The Tangail brothel used to have its own clinic and doctor , paid for by an aid group , but that has now closed down .
Aklima Begum Akhi , the head of the Tangail Sex Worker 's Association , worries about the effects of the steroids .
" Bangladesh is a poor country and the women who live in brothels are the poorest .
Nobody helps us , but we sex workers need help , " she says .
" People are only interested in us when they can exploit us . "
The sad fact is that even if the prostitutes are able to escape life in the brothel one day , the effects of these steroids are likely to stay with them for the rest of their lives .

How adults approach children aged 3 to 6 years during conversations has a major influence on their language acquisition .
Those who address children as fully - fledged conversation partners lay an early basis for the development of ' academic language ' , says Dutch researcher Lotte Henrichs .
Children at a primary school need a certain type of language proficiency : academic language .
Academic language is not an independent , new language , but is the language that teachers use and expect from the pupils .
It enables children to understand instructions and to demonstrate their knowledge in an efficient manner .
Academic language is characterised by difficult , abstract words and complex sentence structures .
The language often contains a lot of clauses and conjunctions and due to the methods of argument and analysis it has a scientific appearance .
Parents make the difference
Henrichs demonstrated that children are already confronted with academic language in the nursery school .
They already hear a lot academic language from the teacher and are often expected to use academic language themselves .
The extent to which academic language is used at home was found to differ strongly between families .
An essential aspect is how parents approach their children during conversations .
If children are given the opportunity to make meaningful contributions to conversations , they often use characteristics of academic language proficiency naturally .
In addition to this , the knowledge of academic language depends on the extent to which parents read to their children , tell them stories and hold conversations about interesting subjects .
Lotte Henrichs investigated how very young children in particular acquire this academic language proficiency and the role played by child raisers and schools in this process .
Within the large research programme that Henrichs carried out her research in , 150 children aged 3 to 6 years were followed for a period of three years .
All of the children lived in the Netherlands and came from Turkish , Moroccan - Berber and Dutch families .
From all these participants , a subgroup of 25 Dutch families were involved in the in - depth study of Henrichs .
Magny - Cours is reportedly being lined up as a potential stand - in race in F1 2010 should the organisers of the inaugural Korean Grand Prix scheduled for later in the season prove unable to be ready in time .
There have been repeated rumours about the likelihood or otherwise of the Korean International Circuit being fully - prepared for F1 by 24 October , when the first - ever Korean Grand Prix is due to take place .
Whilst F1 commercial rights - holder and Formula One Management ( FOM ) chief executive Bernie Ecclestone recently visited the Yeongam County venue - 400 kilometres south of the capital , Seoul - and declared everything to be proceeding as planned , not everybody is convinced .
With a general desire not to see the calendar reduced from 19 grands prix to 18 at short notice , French magazine Auto Hebdo claims the notion of replacing the race with one at Magny - Cours - a circuit that staged the French Grand Prix every year between 1991 and 2008 prior to falling out of favour - is being championed by Gilles Depeigneux , an advisor to French Prime Minister Fran?ois Fillon .
The Nevers track , however , has rarely been popular amongst the F1 fraternity for its lack of atmosphere , rural location and consequent difficulty of access - and the necessity to find some EUR20 million to re-instate the French Grand Prix is also understood to have generated considerable political opposition .
Toronto city councillors have been told to surrender their free Metropasses immediately or risk paying back taxes on them after the Canada Revenue Agency deemed them a taxable benefit .
In an email to councillors on Thursday , TTC chief general manager Gary Webster said a CRA compliance audit of the City of Toronto for 2006 and 2007 found they should have been paying taxes on the freebie worth about $ 1,100 a year .
Ottawa “ will not retroactively assess taxes for the 2006 and 2007 taxation years as long as your 2010 transit pass is immediately revoked by the TTC .
Accordingly , passes must be returned to the TTC , ” Webster wrote .
The CRA is also looking at councillors ’ free passes to the Toronto Zoo and other city facilities .
The politicians could , as with the transit pass , formally request them and acknowledge they have to pay taxes for the benefit .
“ Touchdown ! ” cheered Etobicoke councillor and mayoral candidate Rob Ford , who has been fighting for years to scrap perks for councillors , including free Sony Centre passes .
He said that , after failing to convince council to end freebies , he complained to the CRA years ago and was told last year that the agency was investigating .
“ It took 10 years but , at the end of the day , councillors will have to pay to get on the bus like everyone else , ” Ford said .
He plans to investigate if councillors will be able to pay taxes on their passes out of their $ 53,100 office budget – calling it a “ bad joke ” if they can .

Google Ventures has just invested an undisclosed amount in Recorded Future , a company that is working to accurately predict the future .
As its name implies , the web application uses a wealth of quantifiable data from the past and present to forecast trends and predict outcomes .
It likely has around the same level of accuracy , give or take , as a weather report .
Recorded Future offers alerts on topics such as financial markets , geopolitical news , industry changes , public figures , technology and information security .
The app can be customized to return results for an individual or other topic , as well .
Predicting the future is big business in industries such as finance , marketing and bookmaking .
The way the analysts in these areas make their predictions is also through quantifying and parsing massive datasets .
Applying the same principles to other topics makes sense , and we 're interested to see what Recorded Future does with this investment and onslaught of press and user attention .

Former Bush political adviser Karl Rove has a unique talent for escaping the consequences of making transparently false statements .
Out and about on his book tour , the Bush administration ’s architect appears to have been in typical form at a Borders Books in Oklahoma City this week , telling a crowd that President Bush “ never ” allowed aides to name - call opponents or question their patriotism and motives .
ADVERTISEMENT
However , Rove personally engaged in all of these on a regular basis during the Bush administration .
“ President Bush , for example , never allowed a White House staffer or administration spokesman to go out and do what this administration and our predecessor routinely did Ã¢â‚¬â€ that is to engage in calling the leaders of the opposition party disparaging labels and question their motives , ” Rove said , according to reporter Bryan Dean with The Oklahoman .
“ In fact , Rove and other members of the Bush administration were routinely critical of opponents to the Iraq war and questioned their patriotism , and Rove questioned the patriotism of first lady Michelle Obama in 2008 while her husband was seeking the Democratic nomination for president , ” Dean wrote .
“ Rove and other commentators criticized Michelle Obama in February 2008 when she said , ‘ For the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback . ’
On Monday , Rove incorrectly attributed that quote to Barack Obama . ”
Another example of the Bush administration ’s actions contradicting Rove ’s recent claim is the Valerie Plame scandal , in which the administration sought to directly retaliate against prominent war critic Joe Wilson by outing his wife ’s status as a covert CIA agent working on nuclear non-proliferation efforts .
RAW STORY later revealed that Plame was working in Iran , with intelligence sources claiming her outing caused “ severe ” damage to her undercover teams and hampered the CIA ’s efforts to keep tabs on Iran ’s nuclear program .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rove ’s book , Courage and Consequence , has been lashed in the press as “ a cherry - picking of history ” .
According to reports ,
Rove ’s self - portrayal as an innocent victim hounded by Plame - case special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald overlooks the fact that it was he himself who let the “ persecution ” play out by not acknowledging at the time that he was the person who confirmed Plame ’s identity as a CIA agent to columnist Robert Novak .
Instead , he allowed press secretary Scott McClellan to lie on his behalf when the scandal broke and continued to let that lie stand over the next two years .
McClellan has since broken from his former colleagues and accuses Rove of “ living in his own world . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He ’s the only one that thinks that he was not involved in any effort to expose Valerie Plame ’s CIA employment , ” the former Bush press secretary told MSNBC .
“ He continues this cover story that ‘ I did n’t know her name ’ and for that reason , he could n’t have leaked her name . ”
Rove was never indicted .
An even more flagrant example of Rove contradicting his statements in Oklahoma , Think Progress noted , came amid the 2008 campaigns , when “ RoveÃ‚Â cast doubt on now - President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s patriotism by attacking him for not wearing a flag pin Ã¢â‚¬â€ even though RoveÃ‚Â was nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t wearing one at the time Ã¢â‚¬â€ and criticized Michelle Obama for not showing ‘ adequate enough ‘ Ã‚Â patriotism after she had given a lengthy speech professing her love of country . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Rove also rankled his political foes repeatedly during the Bush - era by claiming that liberals who sought to end the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan really wanted American soldiers to get injured .
While he ’s drawn a line in some public statements , suggesting that whatever false and rhetorical charge he ’d leveled “ does n’t make [ Democrats ] unpatriotic , ” then proceeding to demean his opponents in every way possible .
In the campaign arena , where broader themes of political messaging are the true communicators , with individual narratives by both campaigns competing for public acceptance , Rove ’s core strategy in 2004 was to cast opposition to President Bush as “ unpatriotic ” .
He succeeded on a high enough level to supposedly put the Republican on top .
Unfortunately for Rove — now out of power and plotting a comeback — much of his experience on the world ’s stage has been meticulously tracked by thousands of journalists , making flagrantly false claims like his statements in Oklahoma City much harder to slip through unnoticed .
While the UK enjoys fairly liberal ( in a wide context ) rules on what can and can't be included in games , other European states have n't been able to enjoy quite the same level of freedoms .
In Germany , specifically , many top games , including Gears of War , and Wolfenstein have been refused ratings by their equivalent of PEGI , the USK .
While be refused a rating does n't prevent the game from being sold , it does mean that the game can't be advertised or displayed in stores - meaning that if a customer wants to buy a game , they have to specifically ask for it .
Awkward , we 'll sure you 'll agree .
Last year , a motion emerged from Germany 's Interior Ministers , looking to take the legislation one step further .
The new law would have banned not only the sale of " violent " video games ( which is bad enough - as how do you define " violent " ? ) , but also the production of violent games within Germany .
This rule , it was feared , would lead to several large German development houses having to either relocate the development of their more violent games , or simply leave the country altogether .
As may have been expected , the motion gathered quite a lot of controversy , eventually gathering some 73,000 signatures from disgruntled players - and employees of games companies - who were worried about what the new law would mean .
Yesterday , it was announced that the Government would not be proceeding with the new legislation , but , listening to the voice of the signatories , would instead promote a greater public awareness of the current PEGI rating system - which , in all honesty , should be enough to prevent young children from playing violent games anyway .
If it 's an 18 , a ten year old should n't really be playing it in the first place .
The senior Vice President of EA , Dr Jens Uwe Intat said , in a comment to Gamesindustry .biz
" The German decision is a very welcome step as we encourage policy makers to better understand the reality of today 's videogame market and give games the same respect as books , films or music . "

Introduction
You might wonder why you ought to learn Bash programming .
Well , here are a couple of compelling reasons :
You 're already running it If you check , you 'll probably find that you are running bash right now .
Even if you changed your default shell , bash is probably still running somewhere on your system , because it 's the standard Linux shell and is used for a variety of purposes .
Because bash is already running , any additional bash scripts that you run are inherently memory - efficient because they share memory with any already - running bash processes .
Why load a 500 K interpreter if you already are running something that will do the job , and do it well ?
You 're already using it Not only are you already running bash , but you 're actually interacting with bash on a daily basis .
It 's always there , so it makes sense to learn how to use it to its fullest potential .
Doing so will make your bash experience more fun and productive .
But why should you learn bash programming ?
Easy , because you already think in terms of running commands , CPing files , and piping and redirecting output .
Should n't you learn a language that allows you to use and build upon these powerful time - saving constructs you already know how to use ?
Command shells unlock the potential of a UNIX system , and bash is the Linux shell .
It 's the high - level glue between you and the machine .
Grow in your knowledge of bash , and you 'll automatically increase your productivity under Linux and UNIX -- it 's that simple .
Bash confusion
Learning bash the wrong way can be a very confusing process .
Many newbies type man bash to view the bash man page , only to be confronted with a very terse and technical description of shell functionality .
Others type info bash ( to view the GNU info documentation ) , causing either the man page to be redisplayed , or ( if they are lucky ) only slightly more friendly info documentation to appear .
While this may be somewhat disappointing to novices , the standard bash documentation can't be all things to all people , and caters towards those already familiar with shell programming in general .
There 's definitely a lot of excellent technical information in the man page , but its helpfulness to beginners is limited .
That 's where this series comes in .
In it , I 'll show you how to actually use bash programming constructs , so that you will be able to write your own scripts .
Instead of technical descriptions , I 'll provide you with explanations in plain English , so that you will know not only what something does , but when you should actually use it .
By the end of this three - part series , you 'll be able to write your own intricate bash scripts , and be at the level where you can comfortably use bash and supplement your knowledge by reading ( and understanding ! ) the standard bash documentation .
Let 's begin .
Environment variables
Under bash and almost all other shells , the user can define environment variables , which are stored internally as ASCII strings .
One of the handiest things about environment variables is that they are a standard part of the UNIX process model .
This means that environment variables not only are exclusive to shell scripts , but can be used by standard compiled programs as well .
When we " export " an environment variable under bash , any subsequent program that we run can read our setting , whether it is a shell script or not .
A good example is the vipw command , which normally allows root to edit the system password file .
By setting the EDITOR environment variable to the name of your favorite text editor , you can configure vipw to use it instead of vi , a handy thing if you are used to xemacs and really dislike vi .
The standard way to define an environment variable under bash is :
$ myvar= ' This is my environment variable !'
The above command defined an environment variable called " myvar " and contains the string " This is my environment variable ! " .
There are several things to notice above : first , there is no space on either side of the " = " sign ; any space will result in an error ( try it and see ) .
The second thing to notice is that while we could have done away with the quotes if we were defining a single word , they are necessary when the value of the environment variable is more than a single word ( contains spaces or tabs ) .
Note
For extremely detailed information on how quotes should be used in bash , you may want to look at the " QUOTING " section in the bash man page .
The existence of special character sequences that get " expanded " ( replaced ) with other values does complicate how strings are handled in bash .
We will just cover the most often - used quoting functionality in this series .
Thirdly , while we can normally use double quotes instead of single quotes , doing so in the above example would have caused an error .
Why ?
Because using single quotes disables a bash feature called expansion , where special characters and sequences of characters are replaced with values .
For example , the " ! " character is the history expansion character , which bash normally replaces with a previously - typed command .
( We wo n't be covering history expansion in this series of articles , because it is not frequently used in bash programming .
For more information on it , see the " HISTORY EXPANSION " section in the bash man page . )
While this macro - like functionality can come in handy , right now we want a literal exclamation point at the end of our environment variable , rather than a macro .
Now , let 's take a look at how one actually uses environment variables .
Here 's an example :
$ echo $ myvar This is my environment variable !
By preceding the name of our environment variable with a $ , we can cause bash to replace it with the value of myvar .
In bash terminology , this is called " variable expansion " .
But , what if we try the following :
$ echo foo$myvarbar foo
We wanted this to echo " foo This is my environment variable ! bar " , but it did n't work .
What went wrong ?
In a nutshell , bash 's variable expansion facility in got confused .
It could n't tell whether we wanted to expand the variable $m , $ my , $ myvar , $ myvarbar , etc .
How can we be more explicit and clearly tell bash what variable we are referring to ?
Try this :
$ echo foo$ {myvar}bar fooThis is my environment variable !
bar
As you can see , we can enclose the environment variable name in curly braces when it is not clearly separated from the surrounding text .
While $ myvar is faster to type and will work most of the time , $ {myvar} can be parsed correctly in almost any situation .
Other than that , they both do the same thing , and you will see both forms of variable expansion in the rest of this series .
You 'll want to remember to use the more explicit curly - brace form when your environment variable is not isolated from the surrounding text by whitespace ( spaces or tabs ) .
Recall that we also mentioned that we can " export " variables .
When we export an environment variable , it 's automatically available in the environment of any subsequently - run script or executable .
Shell scripts can " get to " the environment variable using that shell 's built - in environment - variable support , while C programs can use the getenv ( ) function call .
Here 's some example C code that you should type in and compile -- it 'll allow us to understand environment variables from the perspective of C :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( void ) { char * myenvvar = getenv ( " EDITOR " ) ; printf ( " The editor environment variable is set to %s
" , myenvvar ) ; }
Save the above source into a file called myenv.c , and then compile it by issuing the command :
$ gcc myenv.c -o myenv
Now , there will be an executable program in your directory that , when run , will print the value of the EDITOR environment variable , if any .
This is what happens when I run it on my machine :
$ ./myenv
The editor environment variable is set to ( null )
Hmmm ... because the EDITOR environment variable was not set to anything , the C program gets a null string .
Let 's try setting it to a specific value :
$ EDITOR=xemacs $ ./ myenv
The editor environment variable is set to ( null )
While you might have expected myenv to print the value " xemacs " , it did n't quite work , because we did n't export the EDITOR environment variable .
This time , we 'll get it working :
$ export EDITOR $ ./ myenv
The editor environment variable is set to xemacs
So , you have seen with your very own eyes that another process ( in this case our example C program ) cannot see the environment variable until it is exported .
Incidentally , if you want , you can define and export an environment variable using one line , as follows :
$ export EDITOR=xemacs
It works identically to the two - line version .
This would be a good time to show how to erase an environment variable by using unset :
$ unset EDITOR $ ./ myenv
The editor environment variable is set to ( null )
Chopping strings overview
Chopping strings -- that is , splitting an original string into smaller , separate chunk (s ) -- is one of those tasks that is performed daily by your average shell script .
Many times , shell scripts need to take a fully - qualified path , and find the terminating file or directory .
While it 's possible ( and fun ! ) to code this in bash , the standard basename UNIX executable performs this extremely well :
$ basename /usr / local / share / doc/ foo/foo.txt foo.txt $ basename /usr / home / drobbins drobbins
basename is quite a handy tool for chopping up strings .
It 's companion , called dirname , returns the " other " part of the path that basename throws away :
$ dirname /usr / local / share/doc/foo/foo.txt /usr/local/share/doc / foo $ dirname /usr / home / drobbins / /usr/home
Note Both dirname and basename do not look at any files or directories on disk ; they are purely string manipulation commands .
Command substitution
One very handy thing to know is how to create an environment variable that contains the result of an executable command .
This is very easy to do :
$ MYDIR=$ ( dirname /usr/local/share/doc/foo/foo.txt ) $ echo $ MYDIR /usr / local / share / doc / foo
What we did above is called command substitution .
Several things are worth noticing in this example .
On the first line , we simply enclosed the command we wanted to execute with $ ( ) .
Note that it is also possible to do the same thing using backquotes , the keyboard key that normally sits above the Tab key :
$ MYDIR=`dirname /usr / local / share/doc/foo/foo.txt` $ echo $ MYDIR /usr / local / share / doc / foo
As you can see , bash provides multiple ways to perform exactly the same thing .
Using command substitution , we can place any command or pipeline of commands in between ` ` or $ ( ) and assign it to an environment variable .
Handy stuff !
Here 's an example of how to use a pipeline with command substitution :
$ MYFILES =$ ( ls /etc | grep pa ) $ echo $ MYFILES pam.d passwd
It 's also worth pointing out that $ ( ) is generally preferred over ` ` in shell scripts because it is more universally supported across different shells , is easier to type and read , and is less complicated to use in a nested form , as follows :
$ MYFILES=$ ( ls $ ( dirname foo / bar/oni ) )
Chopping strings like a pro
While basename and dirname are great tools , there are times where we may need to perform more advanced string " chopping " operations than just standard pathname manipulations .
When we need more punch , we can take advantage of bash 's advanced built - in variable expansion functionality .
We 've already used the standard kind of variable expansion , which looks like this : $ {MYVAR} .
But bash can also perform some handy string chopping on its own .
Take a look at these examples :
$ MYVAR=foodforthought.jpg $ echo $ {MYVAR ##* fo} rthought.jpg $ echo $ {MYVAR #* fo} odforthought.jpg
In the first example , we typed $ {MYVAR ##* fo} .
What exactly does this mean ?
Basically , inside the ${ } , we typed the name of the environment variable , two ##s , and a wildcard ( " * fo " ) .
Then , bash took MYVAR , found the longest substring from the beginning of the string " foodforthought.jpg " that matched the wildcard " * fo " , and chopped it off the beginning of the string .
That 's a bit hard to grasp at first , so to get a feel for how this special " # # " option works , let 's step through how bash completed this expansion .
First , it began searching for substrings at the beginning of " foodforthought.jpg " that matched the " * fo " wildcard .
Here are the substrings that it checked :
f fo MATCHES * fo foo food foodf foodfo MATCHES * fo foodfor foodfort foodforth foodfortho foodforthou foodforthoug foodforthought foodforthought .j foodforthought.jp foodforthought.jpg
After searching the string for matches , you can see that bash found two .
It selects the longest match , removes it from the beginning of the original string , and returns the result .
The second form of variable expansion shown above appears identical to the first , except it uses only one " # " -- and bash performs an almost identical process .
It checks the same set of substrings as our first example did , except that bash removes the shortest match from our original string , and returns the result .
So , as soon as it checks the " fo " substring , it removes " fo " from our string and returns " odforthought.jpg " .
This may seem extremely cryptic , so I 'll show you an easy way to remember this functionality .
When searching for the longest match , use ## ( because ## is longer than # ) .
When searching for the shortest match , use # .
See , not that hard to remember at all !
Wait , how do you remember that we are supposed to use the ' # ' character to remove from the * beginning * of a string ?
Simple !
You will notice that on a US keyboard , shift - 4 is " $ " , which is the bash variable expansion character .
On the keyboard , immediately to the left of " $ " is " # " .
So , you can see that " # " is " at the beginning " of " $ " , and thus ( according to our mnemonic ) , " # " removes characters from the beginning of the string .
You may wonder how we remove characters from the end of the string .
If you guessed that we use the character immediately to the right of " $ " on the US keyboard ( " % " ) , you 're right !
Here are some quick examples of how to chop off trailing portions of strings :
$ MYFOO=" chickensoup.tar.gz " $ echo $ { MYFOO % %.*} chickensoup $ echo $ {MYFOO %.*} chickensoup.tar
As you can see , the % and % % variable expansion options work identically to # and ## , except they remove the matching wildcard from the end of the string .
Note that you do n't have to use the " * " character if you wish to remove a specific substring from the end :
MYFOOD=" chickensoup " $ echo $ {MYFOOD % % soup} chicken
In this example , it does n't matter whether we use " % % " or " % " , since only one match is possible .
And remember , if you forget whether to use " # " or " % " , look at the 3 , 4 , and 5 keys on your keyboard and figure it out .
We can use another form of variable expansion to select a specific substring , based on a specific character offset and length .
Try typing in the following lines under bash :
$ EXCLAIM=cowabunga $ echo $ {EXCLAIM :0:3} cow $ echo $ {EXCLAIM :3:7} abunga
This form of string chopping can come in quite handy ; simply specify the character to start from and the length of the substring , all separated by colons .
Applying string chopping
Now that we 've learned all about chopping strings , let 's write a simple little shell script .
Our script will accept a single file as an argument , and will print out whether it appears to be a tarball .
To determine if it is a tarball , it will look for the pattern " .tar " at the end of the file .
Here it is :
#!/bin/bash if [ " $ { 1 ##*. } " = " tar " ] then echo
This appears to be a tarball .
else echo
At first glance , this does not appear to be a tarball .
fi
To run this script , enter it into a file called mytar.sh , and type chmod 755 mytar.sh to make it executable .
Then , give it a try on a tarball , as follows :
$ ./mytar.sh thisfile.tar
This appears to be a tarball .
$ ./mytar.sh thatfile.gz
At first glance , this does not appear to be a tarball .
OK , it works , but it 's not very functional .
Before we make it more useful , let 's take a look at the " if " statement used above .
In it , we have a boolean expression .
In bash , the " = " comparison operator checks for string equality .
In bash , all boolean expressions are enclosed in square brackets .
But what does the boolean expression actually test for ?
Let 's take a look at the left side .
According to what we 've learned about string chopping , " $ {1 # # *.} " will remove the longest match of " *. " from the beginning of the string contained in the environment variable " 1 " , returning the result .
This will cause everything after the last " . " in the file to be returned .
Obviously , if the file ends in " .tar " , we will get " tar " as a result , and the condition will be true .
You may be wondering what the " 1 " environment variable is in the first place .
Very simple -- $ 1 is the first command - line argument to the script , $ 2 is the second , etc .
OK , now that we 've reviewed the function , we can take our first look at " if " statements .
If statements
Like most languages , bash has its own form of conditional .
When using them , stick to the format above ; that is , keep the " if " and the " then " on separate lines , and keep the " else " and the terminating and required " fi " in horizontal alignment with them .
This makes the code easier to read and debug .
In addition to the " if , else " form , there are several other forms of " if " statements :
if [ condition ] then action fi
This one performs an action only if condition is true , otherwise it performs no action and continues executing any lines following the " fi " .
if [ condition ] then action elif [ condition2 ] then action2 . . . elif [ condition3 ] then else actionx fi
The above " elif " form will consecutively test each condition and execute the action corresponding to the first true condition .
If none of the conditions are true , it will execute the " else " action , if one is present , and then continue executing lines following the entire " if , elif , else " statement .
Next time
Now that we 've covered the most basic bash functionality , it 's time to pick up the pace and get ready to write some real scripts .
In the next article , I 'll cover looping constructs , functions , namespace , and other essential topics .
Then , we 'll be ready to write some more complicated scripts .
In the third article , we 'll focus almost exclusively on very complex scripts and functions , as well as several bash script design options .
See you then !

China Miéville 's story of a murder investigation in parallel worlds , The City and the City , has won the British Science Fiction Association 's award for best novel – the first in what could be a slew of genre prizes to come its way this year .
Miéville 's novel , in which Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad attempts to solve the case of a murdered woman in the city of Beszél , a decaying metropolis existing in the same space as the city of Ul Qoma , has also been shortlisted for the Hugo best novel award and the Arthur C Clarke prize for the best science fiction novel of the year .
Over the weekend , it was voted best novel by members of the British Science Fiction Association , ahead of Adam Roberts 's Yellow Blue Tibia , Ursula K Le Guin 's historical fantasy Lavinia and previous winner Stephen Baxter 's apocalyptic Ark .
" I do n't think this is the last award it will win this year , " said Niall Harrison , editor of the BSFA 's journal , Vector .
" What I admire about The City and the City is its deep but generous intelligence .
Its representation of urban experience is one of those rare , inspired fantastical conceits that you really do take with you when you finish reading . "
A two - time winner of both the Arthur C Clarke and the British Fantasy Award , Miéville has not previously won the BSFA prize .
The Times called The City and the City " an eye- opening genre - buster " comparable to Kafka and Orwell , while Michael Moorcock , writing in the Guardian , said it was written " in the tradition of Philip K Dick " .
Miéville was in the US on the day of the awards ceremony , and was texted by his editor at Macmillan , Julie Crisp , to let him know that he'd won .
" China was absolutely thrilled and phoned me about 30 seconds after I sent him a text , " said Crisp .
" He was so pleased . "
She read out a speech from the author , in which he dedicated the book and the prize to his mother , Claudia , " who very much loved the crime fiction I 've tried to be as faithful to here as I am to the SF I grew up with " .
" If Julie Crisp is saying these words to you , it means : i ) that like some alien parasite I , China Miéville , am controlling what she says , ii ) that I am stuck in a time paradox where I 'm thanking you all for something I do n't know yet , and iii ) that The City & the City has won the BSFA award .
Thank you so much .
I cannot tell you how grateful and honoured I am , " Miéville wrote in his speech .
" It 's been a wonderful year for wonderful shortlists , always at least as important as winners , and it has been an honour to be on this one alongside such amazing nominees . "
The BSFA best short fiction prize was won by Ian Watson and Roberto Quaglia 's story The Beloved Time of Their Lives , in which Jonathan travels to parallel versions of Earth in search of Elena ( it can be downloaded for free here ) .
Nick Lowe 's film column Mutant Popcorn won best non-fiction – " recognition at last for some of the best film reviewing , inside genre or out , " said Harrison – and best artwork was taken by Stephan Martiniere 's cover for Desolation Road by Ian McDonald .
A unit of Johnson & Johnson has voluntarily begun a recall of certain children ’s over - the - counter liquid medicines because of manufacturing deficiencies , the Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday .
The deficiencies may affect the potency , purity or quality of the products , the agency said in a statement .
It said it was investigating the plant where the products were made to make sure there were no other problems .
Consumers should stop using certain lots of infants ’ and children ’s Tylenol , Motrin , Zyrtec and Benadryl products because some of them may contain more of the active drug ingredient than specified , the Johnson & Johnson unit , McNeil Consumer Healthcare , said in a statement late Friday .
Other products involved in the recall may contain foreign particles or inactive ingredients that may not meet testing requirements , the company said .
“ The particles may be solidified product ingredients or manufacturing residue such as tiny metal specks , ” Marc Boston , a McNeil spokesman , said .
Yes !

Tomgram : William Astore , The Business of America Is Kleptocracy
By William Astore
Posted on April 20 , 2010 , Printed on July 8 , 2020

It ’s hard to miss these days .
The headlines tell the story -- repetitively .
Everyone , it seems , is on the take .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Goldman Sachs with securities fraud for creating and selling “ a mortgage investment that was secretly intended to fail ” -- and then betting against its own customers .
JPMorgan
Chase which , in a pinch in 2008 , happily took taxpayer dough , just reported $ 3.3 billion in profits for the first quarter of 2010 , a jump of 55 % over the previous quarter .
The bank set aside $ 9.3 billion in what ’s called “ compensation and benefits ” for its employees in 2009 .
Even when they lose , they win .
According to James Kwak of the Baseline Scenario website , on a deal in which JPMorgan swallowed $ 880 million in losses , its bankers still managed to walk away with up to $ 10 million in compensation .
As he wrote , “ JPMorgan ’s bankers did just fine , despite having placed a ticking time bomb on their own bank ’s balance sheet . ”
Meanwhile , Robert Rubin , who helped create the world that led to the 2008 financial meltdown as Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton , then took a top position at Citibank and made more than $ 100 million before it tanked on his watch .
As economist Dean Baker puts it , “ In the fall of 2008 , when Citigroup was saved from bankruptcy with a taxpayer bailout , Rubin quietly slipped out the back door ( with his money ) , resigning from his position at Citigroup . ”
Only recently Rubin made the headlines for offering the least apologetic ( non - ) apology imaginable for taking the American people to the cleaners .
And when it comes to taking , according to Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times , “ more than 125 former Congressional aides and lawmakers are now working for financial firms as part of a multibillion - dollar effort to shape , and often scale back , federal regulatory power . ”
In other words , the regulators and their aides legislate the rules and then simply step through that infamous revolving door and pick up a handsome check on the other side .
There are , in fact , at least 11,000 well - employed registered lobbyists in Washington today .
A $ 3.4 billion “ industry ” in 2009 , lobbying is definitely a field to get into , even in bad times , and according to the Christian Science Monitor , “ when the cost of grass - roots efforts and of strategic advisers are all counted , total spending on influencing policy in Washington approaches $ 9.6 billion a year . ”
As for the money flowing into politics from corporate deep pockets , 2008 not only saw the first billion - dollar presidential campaign , but at $ 1.7 billion , more than doubled the 2004 campaign ’s costs , and no one expects 2012 to be anything but more expensive .
All this is , of course , known to anyone who glances at the front page of a daily newspaper , but what exactly do we make of it all ?
What does it add up to ?
William Astore , historian and TomDispatch regular , has a suggestion , but before you start his piece , you might want to close your purse or button that back pocket with your wallet in it .
Otherwise , they could be picked bare by the time you ’re done .

American Kleptocracy
How Fears of Socialism and Fascism Hide Naked Theft
By William J. Astore Kleptocracy -- now , there ’s a word I was taught to associate with corrupt and exploitative governments that steal ruthlessly and relentlessly from the people .
It ’s a word , in fact , that ’s usually applied to flawed or failed governments in Africa , Latin America , or the nether regions of Asia .
Such governments are typically led by autocratic strong men who shower themselves and their cronies with all the fruits of extracted wealth , whether stolen from the people or squeezed from their country ’s natural resources .
It ’s not a word you ’re likely to see associated with a mature republic like the United States led by disinterested public servants and regulated by more - or - less transparent principles and processes .
In fact , when Americans today wish to critique or condemn their government , the typical epithets used are “ socialism ” or “ fascism . ”
When my conservative friends are upset , they send me emails with links to material about “ ObamaCare ” and the like .
These generally warn of a future socialist takeover of the private realm by an intrusive , power - hungry government .
When my progressive friends are upset , they send me emails with links pointing to an incipient fascist takeover of our public and private realms , led by that same intrusive , power - hungry government ( and , I admit it , I ’m hardly innocent when it comes to such “ what if ” scenarios ) .
What if , however , instead of looking at where our government might be headed , we took a closer look at where we are -- at the power - brokers who run or influence our government , at those who are profiting and prospering from it ?
These are , after all , the “ winners ” in our American world in terms of the power they wield and the wealth they acquire .
And should n’t we be looking as well at those Americans who are losing -- their jobs , their money , their homes , their healthcare , their access to a better way of life -- and asking why ?
If we were to take an honest look at America ’s blasted landscape of “ losers ” and the far shinier , spiffier world of “ winners , ” we ’d have to admit that it was n’t signs of onrushing socialism or fascism that stood out , but of staggeringly self - aggrandizing greed and theft right in the here and now .
We ’d notice our public coffers being emptied to benefit major corporations and financial institutions working in close alliance with , and passing on remarkable sums of money to , the representatives of “ the people . ”
We ’d see , in a word , kleptocracy on a scale to dazzle .
We would suddenly see an almost magical disappearing act being performed , largely without comment , right before our eyes .
Of Red Herrings and Missing Pallets of Money
Think of socialism and fascism as the red herrings of this moment or , if you ’re an old time movie fan , as Hitchcockian MacGuffins -- in other words , riveting distractions .
Conservatives and tea partiers fear invasive government regulation and excessive taxation , while railing against government takeovers -- even as corporate lobbyists write our public healthcare bills to favor private interests .
Similarly , progressives rail against an emergent proto - fascist corps of private guns - for - hire , warrantless wiretapping , and the potential government - approved assassination of U.S. citizens , all sanctioned by a perpetual , and apparently open - ended , state of war .
Yet , if this is socialism , why are private health insurers the government ’s go - to guys for healthcare coverage ?
If this is fascism , why have n’t the secret police rounded up tea partiers and progressive critics as well and sent them to the lager or the gulag ?
Consider this : America is not now , nor has it often been , a hotbed of political radicalism .
We have no substantial socialist or workers ’ party .
( Unless you ’re deluded , please do n’t count the corporate - friendly “ Democrat ” party here . )
We have no substantial fascist party .
( Unless you ’re deluded , please do n’t count the cartoonish “ tea partiers ” here ; these predominantly white , graying , and fairly affluent Americans seem most worried that the jackbooted thugs will be coming for them . )
What drives America today is , in fact , business -- just as was true in the days of Calvin Coolidge .
But it ’s not the fair - minded “ free enterprise ” system touted in those freshly revised Texas guidelines for American history textbooks ; rather , it ’s a rigged system of crony capitalism that increasingly ends in what , if we were looking at some other country , we would recognize as an unabashed kleptocracy .
Recall , if you care to , those pallets stacked with hundreds of millions of dollars that the Bush administration sent to Iraq and which , Houdini - like , simply disappeared .
Think of the ever - rising cost of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , now in excess of a trillion dollars , and just whose pockets are full , thanks to them .
If you want to know the true state of our government and where it ’s heading , follow the money ( if you can ) and remain vigilant : our kleptocratic Houdinis are hard at work , seeking to make yet more money vanish from your pockets -- and reappear in theirs .
From Each According to His Gullibility --
To Each According to His Greed Never has the old adage my father used to repeat to me -- “ the rich get richer and the poor poorer ” -- seemed fresher or truer .
If you want confirmation of just where we are today , for instance , consider this passage from a recent piece by Tony Judt :
In 2005 , 21.2 percent of U.S. national income accrued to just 1 percent of earners .
Contrast 1968 , when the CEO of General Motors took home , in pay and benefits , about sixty - six times the amount paid to a typical GM worker .
Today the CEO of Wal - Mart earns nine hundred times the wages of his average employee .
Indeed , the wealth of the Wal - Mart founder ’s family in 2005 was estimated at about the same ( $ 90 billion ) as that of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population : 120 million people .
Wealth concentration is only one aspect of our increasingly kleptocratic system .
War profiteering by corporations ( however well disguised as heartfelt support for our heroic warfighters ) is another .
Meanwhile , retired senior military officers typically line up to cash in on the kleptocratic equivalent of welfare , peddling their “ expertise ” in return for impressive corporate and Pentagon payouts that supplement their six - figure pensions .
Even that putative champion of the Carhartt - wearing common folk , Sarah Palin , pocketed a cool $ 12 million last year without putting the slightest dent in her populist bona fides .
Based on such stories , now legion , perhaps we should rewrite George Orwell ’s famous tagline from Animal Farm as :
All animals are equal , but a few are so much more equal than others .
And who are those “ more equal ” citizens ?
Certainly , major corporations , which now enjoy a kind of political citizenship and the largesse of a federal government eager to rescue them from their financial mistakes , especially when they ’re judged “ too big to fail . ”
In raiding the U.S. Treasury , big banks and investment firms , shamelessly ready to jack up executive pay and bonuses even after accepting billions in taxpayer - funded bailouts , arguably outgun militarized multinationals in the conquest of the public realm and the extraction of our wealth for their benefit .
Such kleptocratic outfits are , of course , abetted by thousands of lobbyists and by politicians who thrive off corporate campaign contributions .
Indeed , many of our more prominent public servants have proved expert at spinning through the revolving door into the private sector .
Even ex-politicians who prefer to be seen as sympathetic to the little guy like former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt eagerly cash in .
I ’m Shocked , Shocked , to Find Profiteering Going on Here An old Roman maxim enjoins us to “ let justice be done , though the heavens fall . ”
Within our kleptocracy , the prevailing attitude is an insouciant “ We ’ll get ours , though the heavens fall . ”
This mindset marks the decline of our polity .
A spirit of shared sacrifice , dismissed as hopelessly naïve , has been replaced by a form of tribalized privatization in which insiders find ways to profit no matter what .
Is it any surprise then that , in seeking to export our form of government to Iraq and Afghanistan , we ’ve produced not two model democracies , but two emerging kleptocracies , fueled respectively by oil and opium ?
When we confront corruption in Iraq or Afghanistan , are we not like the police chief in the classic movie Casablanca who is shocked , shocked to find gambling going on at Rick ’s Café , even as he accepts his winnings ?
Why then do we bother to feign shock when Iraqi and Afghan elites , a tiny minority , seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the majority ?
Should n’t we be flattered ?
Imitation , after all , is the sincerest form of flattery .
Is n’t it ?

NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor has been arrested for rape in New York , according to a report from WCBS - TV in New York City .
The former New York Giants linebacker was taken into custody early this morning by the Town of Ramapo police after being accused of raping someone in the Holidome Hotel in Montebello , north of New York City , WCBS said .
Ramapo Detective Lt. Brad Weidel told the AP that Taylor , 51 , had n't been formally charged .
He said charges will be filed when the police investigation is completed .
The Journal News says the alleged victim is a 15 - year - old girl who was beaten .
The Journal News also says it has learned Taylor will be charged with third - degree rape , which involves intercourse with a minor .
UPDATE : Reports now say the alleged victim is 16 .
In New York , conviction on third - degree rape charges can result in a prison sentence of up to four years .
The station said a new conference is expected later today , where police will give more details .
Taylor 's troubled past includes repeated drug problems .
He tested positive for cocaine in 1987 and in 1988 was suspended by the NFL for 30 days when he failed another test .
In an autobiography , Taylor admitted resuming heavy cocaine usage when he retired .
He entered drug rehab twice in 1995 , but later was arrested two times in three years for allegedly attempting to buy cocaine from undercover officers
In a November 2003 interview with 60 Minutes , Taylor said he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics at the peak of his drug abuse .
A 10 - time Pro Bowler , Taylor was the NFL's MVP in 1986 and the league 's Defensive Player of the Year in 1981 , 1982 and 1986 .

Here 's one thing that can , plainly , be said about the controversy over Rand Paul and the Civil Rights Act : this is exactly what Democrats hoped would happen .
The Democratic campaign and message apparatus has been banking , for months , on the rightward tilt of the Tea Party to damage the Republican Party in November 's midterm elections .
They put out a strategy memo to this effect in January .
The idea is , basically : Tea Partiers are crazy , right - wing extremists .
If the Republican Party elects them to run in November , the Republican Party will lose .
Democrats have been saying this for months .
Paul 's statements about the Civil Rights Act , brought up last night by Rachel Maddow and discussed at length , in an interview , have dominated the news cycle today .
It has not looked good for Paul , or for the Tea Party .
Just to be clear what we 're talking about , Paul does not oppose the 1964 Civil Rights
Act on the whole .
He disagrees with the provision that required businesses to serve people equally .
He says this is a matter of speech , and that to support such limitations on private business -- as opposed to statutory desegregation of public institutions like schools , which Paul supports -- one has to accept that what the government has done is tell a private business owner how to run his private business .
He opposes that .
On the question of whether he would have voted for it , Paul seems to indicate that , supporting 9/10 of its statutes , he probably would have , but he leaves the question open , and says that , had be been in the Senate at the time , there would have been " some discussion " about the provision that desegregated private businesses .
When Maddow asked Paul , point - blank , whether lunch counters in the South should have been allowed to keep serving whites only , Paul would not answer the question in a " yes " or " no , " as Maddow implored him to .
Paul has warned repeatedly that this is an abstract debate that will be oversimplified and used against him by political opponents .
So far , the latter is certainly true .
Ta -Nehisi , earlier today , chided Paul for his proud ignorance and for not simply settling down to make the case for private - sector discrimination .
There is an argument there , and there are some valid points in its favor .
Paul makes some of them .
Here 's the interview segment : Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Whether this proves that Democrats were right all along , and that Tea Partiers are not viable candidates for office at all , remains to be seen .
Rand Paul is a prized candidate of the Tea Party movement ; this is an early problem for him , which has sprung up less than a day after he won his party 's nomination .
Before that , he and the movement were both riding high .
A Tea Party organizer I talked to today said the whole thing has been blown out of proportion .
He had no problem with anything Paul had said .
One thing 's for certain , in all this : other Tea Party - backed candidates will be asked , by Democratic campaigns and by debate moderators , what they think of desegregating private businesses .
Part of the Democratic plan has been to ask Tea Party - backed candidates about controversial views and get them on the record .
Paul 's stance has become a big enough story , however , that the media will probably do this on its own .
Depending on what Tea Partiers say about Paul 's statements , and how the public debate over Paul plays out , this moment has a chance to further alienate the movement as a whole from the mainstream .
That said , it 's not the end of the movement , as Democrats would very much like it to be .
If Richard Blumenthal can overcome questions about his portrayal of Vietnam service , surely Paul and the Tea Partiers can get over this .
As Ta -Nehisi points out , there are better ways to argue Paul 's stance .
There are probably more caveats to offer , too .
Other Tea Party candidates -- Florida 's Marco Rubio , Nevada 's Sharron Angle , and Utah 's Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater , for instance -- ought to be working out their stances on the Civil Rights
Act as we speak .
Because the questions are coming , and some talking points are needed .
Whether this proves that Democrats were right all along , and that Tea Partiers are not viable candidates for office at all , remains to be seen .
Rand Paul is a prized candidate of the Tea Party movement ; this is an early problem for him , which has sprung up less than a day after he won his party 's nomination .

Women are on track to save the planet from environmental ruin by having fewer children , science writer Fred Pearce argued on The Daily Show last night .
Contrary to the fear that overpopulation will exhaust the world 's resources , Pearce says that women making choices to having fewer children are " defusing the population bomb . "
And that 's not just in the developed world , as Stewart said he 'd assumed .

" They 're saying , if I have a choice between working and having a family , and if men , and the state , and the church , and employers make it really hard for me to have both , then they say , ' Well , I 'll have a job and forget about the family , ' " he said .
And that 's happened without the social control of forced sterilization or widely adopted one - child policies , both of which Pearce chronicles in his new book , The Coming Population Crash And Our Planet 's Surprising Future .
It 's happened with the help of the various prongs of reproductive choice , from sexual education to contraception to access to abortion .

" What we 're now discovering is that women are doing it on their own , " Pearce said .
From Bill Moyers final broadcast of the Journal following his interview with Jim Hightower .
Bill 's last guest on The Journal was author Barry Lopez .
And bang they did , with an " equity strategy " for their investors , entitled , " Revisiting Plutonomy : The Rich Getting Richer . "
Here are some excerpts :
Plutocracy is not an American word but it 's become an American phenomenon .
Back in the fall of 2005 , the Wall Street giant Citigroup even coined a variation on it , plutonomy , an economic system where the privileged few make sure the rich get richer with government on their side .
By the next spring , Citigroup decided the time had come to publicly " bang the drum on plutonomy . "
Ed Murrow told his generation of journalists bias is okay as long as you do n't try to hide it .
So here , one more time , is mine : plutocracy and democracy do n't mix .
Plutocracy , the rule of the rich , political power controlled by the wealthy .
BILL MOYERS : You 've no doubt figured out my bias by now .
I 've hardly kept it a secret .
In this regard , I take my cue from the late Edward R. Murrow , the Moses of broadcast news .
" Asset booms , a rising profit share and favorable treatment by market - friendly governments have allowed the rich to prosper ...[ and ] take an increasing share of income and wealth over the last 20 years ... "
" ... the top 10 % , particularly the top 1 % of the US -- the plutonomists in our parlance -- have benefited disproportionately from the recent productivity surge in the US ...[ and ] from globalization and the productivity boom , at the relative expense of labor . "
" ...[ and they ] are likely to get even wealthier in the coming years .
[ Because ] the dynamics of plutonomy are still intact . "
And so they were , before the great collapse of 2008 .
And so they are , today , after the fall .
While millions of people have lost their jobs , their homes , and their savings , the plutonomists are doing just fine .
In some cases , even better , thanks to our bailout of the big banks which meant record profits and record bonuses for Wall Street .
Now why is this ?
Because over the past 30 years the plutocrats , or plutonomists — choose your poison — have used their vastly increased wealth to capture the flag and assure the government does their bidding .
Remember that Citigroup reference to " market - friendly governments " on their side ?
It has n't mattered which party has been in power — government has done Wall Street 's bidding .
Do n't blame the lobbyists , by the way ; they are simply the mules of politics , delivering the drug of choice to a political class addicted to cash — what polite circles call " campaign contributions " and Tony Soprano would call " protection . "
This marriage of money and politics has produced an America of gross inequality at the top and low social mobility at the bottom , with little but anxiety and dread in between , as middle class Americans feel the ground falling out from under their feet .
According to a study from the Pew Research Center last month , nine out of ten Americans give our national economy a negative rating .
Eight out of ten report difficulty finding jobs in their communities , and seven out of ten say they experienced job - related or financial problems over the past year .
So it is that like those populists of that earlier era , millions of Americans have awakened to a sobering reality : they live in a plutocracy , where they are disposable .
Then , the remedy was a popular insurgency that ignited the spark of democracy .
Now we have come to another parting of the ways , and once again the fate and character of our country are up for grabs .
So along with Jim Hightower and Iowa 's concerned citizens , and many of you , I am biased : democracy only works when we claim it as our own .

KEN GIGLIOTTI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS
Taz Stuart , City of Winnipeg entomologist at his first press conference of the season Thursday , with a spraying helicopter behind him .
A black - tailed mosquito that feeds on birds and carries a potentially lethal strain of encephalitis is the second new mosquito species found in Winnipeg in the past three years .
Culiseta melanura , a mosquito never before seen north of Minneapolis , was trapped in Winnipeg in 2008 and positively identified the following year by Mahmood Iranpour , an entomologist at the National Microbiology Laboratory .
Also in 2008 , city entomologist Taz Stuart confirmed the presence of a small , blue mosquito called Uranotaenia sapphirina , which carries West Nile virus but predominantly feeds on frogs and toads .
Prior to that , no new mosquito species have been found in Winnipeg since the 1940s .
Iranpour and Stuart are now trying to figure out if the new skeeters are here to stay -- or are just visiting .
" There needs to be more investigation to see if it will be established , " Iranpour said of C. melanura , which he found only in small numbers .
But its confirmed presence brings the number of mosquito species known to inhabit Winnipeg up to 40 and the number in Manitoba up to 50 overall .
Unlike U. sapphirina , which is not considered much of a threat to human beings , C. melanura has been monitored closely in the United States because it is known to carry eastern equine encephalitis , or EEE , a disease that kills roughly 35 per cent of the people who contract it .
C. melanura hangs around in tree canopies and feeds almost entirely on birds .
It only poses a threat to people because EEE - infected birds can be bitten by " bridge vector " mosquito species that also bite human beings .
In Winnipeg , Culex tarsalis -- the main culprit in the transmission of West Nile virus -- could serve as a vector mosquito , said Stuart .
But the presence of eastern equine encephalitis in Winnipeg is entirely theoretical at this point .
Manitoba has had cases of western equine encephalitis before , but not since 1983 , Stuart said .
The movement of dangerous or destructive insects is a hot topic for environmental scientists , as the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle -- both invasive species from China -- lay waste to North American hardwoods .
The widening range of insect species indigenous to North America is also seen as a possible result of climate change .

There are few things that will give you a better boost in lifetime productivity than a good solid education –you are essentially upgrading your mind to understand , comprehend and process more .
Modern technology is making education surprisingly easy to obtain and inexpensive .
Years ago , you ’d get a bachelor ’s degree , go work for a big company and eventually retire with a gold watch .
That model does n’t really work anymore .
If you want to maximize your potential , you need continual education .
This can be be formal and informal , but in this article we are going to look at my experience getting a formal education that leads to a degree while working full time .
In particular , we are going to look at getting an online masters degree .
This is a pretty long articles so here is an executive summary :
You can get an online master ’s degree from Harvard through their Extension School and take the majority of your classes over the internet .
The entrance process is simple and the cost is much lower than similar programs .
My Background
Five years out of high school , I had earned a bachelor ’s and master ’s degree in music composition .
During that same period , my summer job at the local hospital had grown into a full - time network administrator position covering two hospitals and a handful of clinics .
Technology skills came very easily for me .
My music education had been very valuable in learning to work with people , learning to concentrate and learning to understand abstract concepts .
Still , it seemed like a good idea to get more formal education related to technology .
After looking at several programs , I finally settled on the ALM in IT program from Harvard ’s Extension school .
The ALM in IT was one of the few master ’s degrees where all the required classes were available online .
( The ALM in IT does have a residency requirement as described below . )
I signed up for an online class on Java programming and was very impressed .
The teachers were great and the class experience was far superior to the correspondence - style classes I had seen people slaving through from other schools .
Harvard Extension School
Founded in 1910 , Harvard ’s Extension School was originally designed to serve local non-traditional students .
It is now under the Continuing Education division .
The Extension School is the only of Harvard ’s thirteen schools to offer both graduate and undergraduate degrees and also the only to offer an associate degree .
Anyone can sign up to take a course without being admitted to a degree program .
The primary qualification for admittance to a master ’s degree program is the successful completion of 12 hours of courses ( three classes ) with a decent GPA .
Some of the programs now require that specific classes be taken as part of those first 12 hours .
These are usually the classes that are the hardest .
This is actually a very kind requirement .
You do n’t want to get admitted by taking the 4 easiest courses and complete most of the coursework only to discover that one of the classes you left to the end is well beyond your ability .
I had a bit of a scare right after I finished my fourth class .
They came out with a new requirement for the ALM in IT master ’s degree program that one of your first four classes must be the Theory of Computation ( or similar class ) .
When I asked about it , they explained that the requirement did n’t apply to current students .
After taking the class , I understand why they created this requirement .
It was very challenging for someone with more music background than mathematics .
It was n’t necessarily hard ; it just required learning a new way of thinking that I had n’t been exposed to before .
There is a beautiful simplicity in letting students take classes to determine admittance .
There are no admission tests or GRE scores required .
Admission is based on your ability to complete the course work –proven by your ability to do well in four classes .
Once you ’ve passed the four classes , you can apply to be admitted to the master ’s degree program .
This involves an application and an essay .
The vast majority of people taking classes through the Extension School do not graduate with a degree .
I believe it is 97 % that do n’t get a degree .
A high percentage are probably just taking a few classes and never even apply for a degree program , but I ’m sure quite a few are pursing a degree and never complete it or run into a required class that they simply can’t handle .
Distance Education Class Format
Since I do n’t live anywhere near Cambridge , most of the classes I took were online .
The online master ’s degree classes follow a live class .
Most of the time , you can physically go to class if you ’re near the Boston area .
A few of my classes the classes were using video from a school other than the Extension School , and in those cases , the classes were only available online for Extension students .
When a physical class is held , it is video taped and within 48 hours posted on the web .
Most classes use a slide show or PDF synchronized with the video .
A few use other , more experimental , methods of synchronizing the visual aids with the lecture .
There is usually a teaching fellow assigned to all the internet students to answer questions and hold sections that which are posted to the class website .
The online master ’s degree classroom experience at Harvard is far superior to what I ’ve seen from other online degree programs .
Aside from watching the video a day or two later than the physical class , distance students are treated pretty much like on - campus students .
Testing is done through a proctor at a local college or university .
The proctor receives the test by FedEx and ships it back after you complete it .
Quite a few classes avoid tests entirely and instead focused on projects , papers or very complex open book tests that do n’t require a proctor .
Residency Requirement
The ALM in IT master ’s degree program has a one - semester residency requirement .
Since the eight - week summer session counted toward this , we chose to spend a few months there during the summer .
My wife and I rented a small , one - bedroom furnished apartment a few blocks from Harvard Square , and I took eight credit hours during those eight weeks .
We were only a block or two from the Science Center where my classes were held and very near the subway in Harvard Square , so we did n’t need to use our car .
It sat in a parking lot for most of the summer with the battery slowly draining from disuse .
In retrospect , I would probably take fewer classes during the summer session and spend more time taking advantage of the museums and cultural events in the area .
I was also working remotely , so my schedule was pretty full .
Many of the master ’s degrees from the Extension School have some classes that can be taken online .
Most require at least two semesters residency .
Some programs require that a certain number of hours be taken in person .
The masters ’ degrees in information technology ( ALM in IT ) and environmental management are the only two that appear to have the smallest residency requirement .
Many of the classes offered by the Extension School do not have an online option , so beyond the residency requirement , some classes must be taken in person .
Master ’s Degree Courses
The ALM in IT program I chose concentrated in Software Engineering–basically a Master ’s of Arts in IT focused on developing software .
It consisted of 10 four hour courses with the final course being the thesis .
In addition to Harvard professors , the Extension School has lecturers teaching elective classes that come from local companies and even non-professors from Harvard .
For example , one of the classes I took on XML was taught by the programmer responsible for all of the XML - driven websites and course catalogs for the Extension School .
Having these two types of teachers proved very valuable .
The Harvard professors were particularly good at teaching theoretical concepts and mathematics .
The industry teachers were very good at teaching the classes that dealt with how to get things done in the real world .
My program required that at least 8 classes ( 32 of the 40 hours ) be taken from “ Harvard Instructors . ”
I believe most of the other programs have a similar requirement .
The difficulty of the courses seemed to vary greatly , but this was probably a function of my previous experience more than anything else .
Coming from a totally unrelated field , but with a lot of hands - on experience , meant that there were some gaps I had to fill in while taking classes that probably would n’t have been an issue for someone with an undergraduate computer science background .
The Theory of Computation class was especially difficult for me .
In fact , I took it twice .
Halfway through it the first time , I was getting a B , but really struggling .
I ended up dropping it .
That summer , I took a course in discrete mathematics .
It was n’t required for the degree , but it filled in some of the background I needed to pass the Theory of Computation the next semester .
I was impressed with how helpful the teaching fellow was during the the class that I found to be difficult .
At the same time , I realized how difficult it is to take the classes online when you are struggling .
There is something about sitting down in the room with someone that really benefits your comprehension .
You simply do n’t get trying to explain things back and forth over email .
On the other hand , writing your questions on email can help you clarify your thoughts .
Often , I found the answer to my problem simply by trying to formulate a written question .
The Theory of Computation class was taught by Harry Lewis , who had taught the same class for years .
He was teaching the class for the last time .
The teaching fellows brought in some cake and refreshments on the last day .
That ’s another downside of not being on campus–no cake .
Interesting side note : Dr. Lewis taught the same class to Bill Gates before he dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft .
Online Master ’s Degree Distance Education Experience
Taking classes by watching the lectures on your computer and communicating by email is hard .
It is very hard .
It is much easier to go to a physical class and sit with a bunch of your fellow students than participate in an online degree program .
It is not something that everyone can do .
It can be very frustrating and leave you feeling very isolated .
Before making a huge commitment to try to earn a master ’s degree using distance education technology , make sure you try a class or two .
You have to make sure it works with your personality .
It definitely is n’t for everyone .
Most of my education through high school was self paced and individualized working through textbooks and workbooks on my own .
A teacher was available for questions , but there was n’t any type of lecture .
It involved reading , doing problem sets and then telling the teacher when you are ready to take the test .
Distance education seemed like something of a hybrid between my college and high school education .
In theory , you can watch the lectures multiple times , but in practice , this would require a huge time investment .
It is convenient to go back and re-watch a section that you did n’t understand , but not nearly as effective as asking the student sitting next to you , attending a study group , raising your hand , visiting your professor during office hours or catching him / her after class .
I found some software that would let me speed up or slow down the lectures without changing the pitch .
For material that I was already very familiar with , I ’d play it 20 % faster .
Also , if I was reviewing a lecture for the second time , I ’d speed it up even more and slow it back down when I came to sections I did n’t fully understand .
When I encountered material that was very difficult , I ’d slow the playback down to 80 % of the original to give myself more time to process what was being said .
Master ’s Degree Cost
The biggest expense of a master ’s degree is rarely the the tuition .
The opportunity cost –the money you could have been earning at a job during the time you were going to school–usually represents the biggest expense .
Unless you have a very flexible employer , it is going to be difficult to take traditional classes while you continue your day job .
Distance education courses allow you to minimize this opportunity cost .
You can keep working your normal job while taking many of your classes .
Make sure you consider the lost income potential of programs that require you to stop working .
A four - hour class from the Harvard Extension School costs somewhere around $ 1,800 to $ 1,850 now .
They were slightly cheaper when I started .
This works out to about $ 450 per credit hour .
This is extremely inexpensive .
Columbia ’s Video Network and Standford ’s Center for Professional Development both appear to charge around $ 1,300 per credit hour .
Compared to both of those , Harvard tuition seems cheap .
Harvard ’s tuition is only slightly more than the per credit hour cost of master ’s degree tuition at both Kansas University and Kansas State University resident tuition and less expensive than out - of - state tuition for either of those institutions .
Some state schools ’ instate tuition may be more expensive than Harvard .
The value provided by Harvard ’s Extension School is very good and is less expensive than any other comparable option I could find .
In addition it is less expensive than a number of much less reputable schools .
( University of Phoenix online tuition works out to nearly $ 700 per credit hour and it looks like Capella ’s tuition is in the $ 600 per credit hour range . )
Master ’s Degree Thesis
My thesis took a very long time .
The actual writing part did n’t take too long , but getting the thesis proposal approved and locating a thesis director took years .
Off - campus students seem to have a bit more trouble getting a thesis director assigned .
( I think they have made some changes to help fix this , now . )
First , you submit a thesis proposal and get it approved by the research adviser for your area of study .
Then a thesis director is assigned .
The director is the one who will give you your final grade–there is n’t a thesis committee .
The research adviser does review your thesis to make sure it meets Harvard ’s standards for clarity , organization and formatting .
Harvard does a good job of giving you what you need to complete the thesis .
There are Microsoft Word templates for the Thesis Proposal and the actual Thesis that make it very easy to deal with the citations , various tables of content , etc .
My thesis involved writing a piece of software and then writing a detailed explanation of how it worked , the technology behind it , and how it was different from other pieces of software .
In the end , I ended up with a nicely bound 180 page document .
When you are doing things remotely , the thesis work involves a lot of emailing documents back and forth .
I ran into some problems getting Word on a Mac to show images correctly when they were transferred to Windows .
( It turns out , images do n’t embed properly if you just drag them into the document . )
So my thesis director would print the PDF I sent him , mark it up , scan it back in and send back the PDF image of the scan .
Later on we started using the editing features in Word .
Once the research adviser and the thesis director were both happy with the document , I sent it to a bindery in Massachusetts .
They printed and bound two copies .
One was sent to me in Kansas , and the other was sent to the Harvard Extension School to go in the library there .
I highly recommend Wells Bindery .
Their cost per page for color was about 1/5th what other binderies were going to charge .
They had Harvard ’s binding requirements on file and took care of everything without requiring every specific detail .
Be aware that there is a time limit on how long you can take to complete your master ’s degree .
I was well beyond that limit , but I was told that once you get to the point where you are waiting on them to find a thesis director “ the clock stops ” and does n’t count against you .
Now , if I had needed a further extension on my thesis , I would have needed to petition and possibly retake any classes that were over five years old .
Not every master ’s degree program requires a thesis .
The program I was in added the option to do a “ capstone ” course instead of a thesis right around the time I was in the middle of my thesis proposal .
Is it a “ Real ” Harvard Master ’s Degree ?
This is the question that everyone seems to ask .
Yes , it is a real master ’s degree from Harvard .
You get the same diploma as everyone else .
It lists your degree as “ Magistri in Artibus Liberalibus Studiorum Prolatorum ” that is “ Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies . ”
I think the “ Extension Studies ” addition is something fairly new and I do n’t think that was on diplomas from previous years .
I ’m guessing that this is due to some of the criticism that admission to the Extension School programs does n’t involve the same level of scrutiny that is required of other Harvard schools .
This is completely true .
Admission to the Extension School is based solely on your ability to perform well in that program .
It is worth noting that the admission process to other Harvard schools has in the past been criticized for being based on factors other than academic merit .
On the other hand , graduates of the Harvard Extension School who worked full - time while getting their master ’s degrees might complain that the students who were able to go to school full - time had things too easy .
Holding down a full - time job while maintaining the discipline to complete an online master ’s degree from an academically rigorous school is very difficult .
It is much harder to sit alone in a room late at night after work watching lectures and doing problem sets than it is to attend class with your peers .
The skills that will let you pull that off will generally go a long way toward helping you succeed .
Still , a lot of the value from going to college occurs outside the classroom .
This is one of the biggest drawbacks to getting a degree predominately through online classes .
For a second Master ’s degree while you are working a full time job , it is n’t as big of a deal .
Hopefully you ’ve already developed the social skills and contacts from your previous 6 years of schooling .
However , I would n’t recommend it for someone who just graduated from high school .
In that respect , employers looking for “ Harvard graduates ” may be looking for more than their academic credentials .
They may be looking for someone with the contacts that would come from being physically on campus .
As mentioned before , only 3 % of people who take classes through the Extension School end up with a degree .
By comparison , Harvard College ( where students get their undergrad degree ) generally accepts around 7 % of applicants in a given year .
So the Extension School lets everyone try , but is selective in the academic quality of people who achieve passing grades .
Harvard College is selective in who they allow into the school in the first place .
Since the peer experience is a very important part of Harvard College , this makes sense .
It is a much less important part of the Extension School .
Some employers are upset because they interview people who claim they went to Harvard when all they did was enroll in ( and not necessarily complete ) a course through the Extension School .
I ’m sure there are people misrepresenting their degrees or coursework on their resume , but I ’m sure this happens with most universities .
I know it sometimes happens with universities that are completely fictitious .
It is important to realize that the degrees offered by the Extension School may not map directly to degrees offered by other schools .
My degree is the ALM in IT with a concentration in software engineering .
I do not have a Master ’s of Science in Computer Science as is offered by the Harvard Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences .
While there is some overlap , that degree requires different courses and goes much deeper on the computational theory side of things .
The classes I took included several that were more focused on practical use of current technologies rather than being all theory .
My required courses seemed about equivalent to the Master of Science in Computer Science degrees from some of the state schools I researched .
Graduation
Participating in commencement is an option , but given the distance from Kansas to Massachusetts and the prospect of traveling with a baby , we opted not to go .
So , for all practical purposes , my graduation was on March 10th when I received this email :
Good afternoon , Congratulations on your March 2010 graduation !
I ’m emailing to let you know that you can come by the Professional Programs Office , 7th floor , 51 Brattle Street , to pick up your hard - earned diploma or certificate .
Our office is open Monday – Friday , 9 am – 5 pm .
Please email me so we know when to expect you !
If you are out of state , please confirm the address to which we should mail your diploma or certificate .
It has been a pleasure working with you .
Please accept my best wishes for continued academic and professional success .
Cheers ,
Stephen
A week later I got a Fed Ex package with my diploma .
Other Schools
There are many other schools offering distance education master ’s degrees , but the ones below are the only two that seemed most similar .
Stanford Center for Professional Development –
When I started looking , Stanford was the only other option that seemed to have a really good online classroom .
However , they used to require your employer to be a member of SCPD before you could sign up for any classes .
This requirement seems to have been dropped , so they might be worth checking into .
Their tuition appears to be 2 to 3 times higher than Harvard ’s Extension School .
Columbia Video Network – Has a number of Master ’s degree programs .
Classes are two to three times more expensive than Harvard ’s Extension School .
Conclusion
Overall , I was very happy with the experience and education .
It significantly added to my education without taking much time off work .
I believe this type of degree is particularly valuable for work beyond your first master ’s degree .
Taking the majority of your classes online does limit your interaction with other students , and this is often one of the most valuable aspects of college .
I would be very hesitant to recommend getting a bachelor ’s degree online for someone recently out of high school because the student interactions are so valuable .
One of my regrets is that I did n’t work harder at networking with classmates during the summer residency .
While there are a number of other schools that offer various types of online master ’s degrees , there is a significant benefit in being associated with one of the strongest educational brands in the world and an institution known for solid academics .

If you want more information on Harvard Extension School , here are some useful links :
In the 1982 movie " Tron , " a programmer goes into a computer world , where he must compete in the gladiator - style games he helped design .
For many gamers , possessing the powers , living the life and fighting the battles of their favorite characters would be a dream come true .
Virtual reality can make this possible , but it 's not the only solution .
What if you could build a video - game environment in the real world with a system that would allow you to perform all of the game 's actions and moves in real time and space ?
A team of three New York University students -- Daniel Albritton , Quanya Chen and Noah Shibley -- is doing just that with one of the most popular video games ever produced : " Super Mario Bros . "
They 're calling their creation " Nintendo Amusement Park , " and with it , they 're helping to evolve a new area of science known as physically - augmented reality .
In this article , we 'll give you a behind - the - scenes tour of the Nintendo Amusement Park and explain the differences between augmented reality , physically - augmented reality and virtual reality .
We 'll also describe how the parts of the Nintendo Amusement Park work together and take a look at some similar projects .

The name " Nintendo Amusement Park " is actually a misnomer , because an amusement park is a collection of rides , games and other forms of entertainment .
It 's really a single " ride " -- a real - life interactive adventure that allows players to dress up as Mario or Luigi , enter the Mushroom Kingdom and perform the actions that the heroes perform in the video game .
Players can jump over obstacles , land on and ride moving platforms , and smash enemies .
They can even collect gold coins and punch power - up boxes .
How do you give normal human beings the superhuman abilities Mario and Luigi have in the video - game world ?
You help them jump , of course -- and jump high .
Jumping is just one requirement , though .
The other is the world itself -- the Mushroom Kingdom complete with its moving platforms , obstacles and enemies .
The designers plan to use a variety of mechanical systems and objects to duplicate these effects and create a large , navigable obstacle course .
When complete , the Nintendo Amusement Park will be a 100 - meter - long course that fully replicates the side - scrolling , platform action of " Super Mario Bros . "
To simulate the various worlds and levels of the video game , the designers will build different challenge areas -- or courses .
That 's the ultimate vision , anyway .
Right now , the park exists as a much simpler prototype , with plans for a gradual , phased implementation of the more complex gaming environment .
Let 's look at the prototype in greater detail .
The Prototype
The Nintendo Amusement Park prototype recreates the core elements of " Super Mario Bros " on a smaller , simpler scale .
Although it 's fairly crude , the prototype demonstrates the basic principles and technologies necessary to recreate " Super Mario Bros " in the real world .
Those parts are :
" "
A motorized truss that acts as a support structure and attachment point for the suspension system .
A suspension system that boosts players ' jumps .
A harness that connects players to the suspension system .
An obstacle course that replicates the physical challenges of the video game .
The obstacle course in the prototype consists of inflatable objects and foam props placed on the ground , balloons attached to the background sheet and boxes suspended on wires from the overhead truss .
" "
While the player has great vertical mobility in this system , he does n't have much forward or lateral ( side - to - side ) mobility because the suspension system is attached to fixed points on the truss .
The farther he moves from the fixed point , the more the bungee cords pull him back .
This makes it difficult to have an interaction that takes place over a long horizontal distance , a defining characteristic of " Super Mario Bros . "
To solve this problem , the designers have several modifications in mind for future versions of the game .
In the next section , we 'll look at these modifications .
Anybody who played sports as a kid has probably had one or both of their parents behave in such a ridiculously embarrassing manner during a game that it still makes us cringe just to think about it .
So it should come as no surprise that on athletic fields around the world , the phenomena known as Sideline Rage ( that is , adults acting like unbalanced assholes during children 's sporting events ) seems to have gotten even more terrifying since we were kids .

As much as every parent says , " It does n't matter if you win as long as you have fun , " nobody wants their kid running around picking daisies in the outfield and taking fancy - pants swings at the ball .
Sure , you can make your kid do extra practice at home , or maybe even spring for a personal trainer .
Or , if you 're like dentist and overzealous sports dad Dr. Stephen Cito , you can weaponize your son 's football helmet before a big game .
Not quite this , but almost .

Taking a page out sports legend Ty Cobb 's playbook , Dr. Cito sharpened the face guard of his son's football helmet so it would slash any opposing players that got close enough .
His son wore the death helmet in a game against high school rival Albuquerque Academy .
After five players were taken off the field with lacerations , referees halted the game , and an inspection of the Cito 's super - helmet revealed it was " sharp enough to shred a magazine cover . "
Hopefully this one .

Let 's make it clear :
He did n't rig this thing to scratch up some arms and hands and make the game a little tougher on the other team .
One opposing player had to be taken to the hospital to get 10 stitches on his arm .
Yes , this is a real thing that happened .
Cito 's son was expelled from St. Pious High and banned from competition for a year .
Dr. Cito himself was charged with conspiring to commit aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to two days in jail , one year probation and 400 hours community service , presumably teaching little leaguers how to file down a toothbrush and hide it in their glove .
A Walkthrough of Ruby In The Web Browser using IronRuby and Silverlight
By Jimmy Schementi
With Microsoft's IronRuby and Silverlight , Ruby can become a first - class citizen in the browser on Windows , Linux and OS X.. think < script type = " text / ruby " > - yes , it 's possible !
This walkthrough will get you started with using Ruby in the browser for HTML and vector - graphics - based applications .
IronRuby enables
Web developers to use Ruby to write client - side browser applications and even reuse code between the server and the client .
Background
IronRuby is a Ruby 1.8.6 - compatible implementation , with ever - increasing support for 1.9 features that runs on Microsoft 's Common Language Infrastructure .
The CLI blesses IronRuby with some powerful features like an efficient just - in - time compiler and sophisticated garbage collector .
However , certain runtime - specific Ruby features are not supported on IronRuby , like continuations which interact with the runtime , certain performance - bogging parts of ObjectSpace , and the native Ruby C API .
To support native - code interop we are planning on supporting FFI in the future ( though today you can use the Win32API for Win32 calls , and the platform invoke APIs for the rest ) .
IronRuby runs on the .NET framework ( 2.0 SP1 + ) and Mono( 2.0 + ) , so IronRuby runs on a ton of platforms , including Mac OS and Linux .
IronRuby also runs in the browser on Silverlight and Moonlight , a fairly - complete - but - tiny runtime which allows you to build " rich internet applications " ... basically anything doing vector - graphics , webcam , audio , etc , in the browser .
Getting Started
Note :
All code shown in this article can be found on GitHub .
To develop browser applications with IronRuby , you just need a Web server , text - editor , Web browser , and Silverlight installed for your browser to use :
1. Download and Install Silverlight for Mac or Windows
You 'll notice these installers are larger than advertised ( 7MB Windows , 13MB Mac ) : these are the " developer " versions since they contain error - message strings rather than just error codes , which is all the " consumer " versions have .
2 . Set up any Web server , text - editor , and Web browser
I 'll be using the latest version of Firefox for the Web browser , the Apache Web server ( which is part of Mac OS ) , and TextMate as the text - editor ; on Windows you can use IIS ( or any Web server of your choice ) and any text - editor of your choice ( notepad.exe is already installed , but I 'd suggest E - TextEditor , InType , or even gVim for the more courageous ) .
Silverlight officially supports IE , Firefox on Windows , and Firefox and Safari on Mac OS , but Opera and Google Chrome on both operating systems are known to work .
See the system requirements page for more details .
3. Write Ruby in HTML pages
Here 's a simple " Hello , World " - style Ruby application in the browser :
Open the text - editor , place this code into it , and save the file to a convenient location where your Web server can access it ; I 'm saving mine to ~/ Sites / ruby .html , since that will let me access it from http://localhost/~<username>/ruby.html
( IIS users will have to put the file under C:inetpubwwwroot , which will let you access it from http://localhost/ruby.html )
When you visit the site in a Web browser , you will see " Ruby says hello ! " :
Note : if you just see " Loading ... " for a very long time ... did you already install Silverlight ?
There is no install detection in these examples .
If you 're on a slow connection , make sure files are n't still being downloaded ( see below ) .
And this will not run direct from the file system due to Silverlight 's security sandbox , so make sure you access it through a Web server .
Behind the scenes
That 's it !
It 's very simple to get started with IronRuby in Silverlight , especially versus using ActionScript in Flash , or even the other languages like C# or VB.NET in Silverlight .
Let me briefly explain what is going on behind the scenes to make IronRuby work so transparently with Silverlight .
The first script - tag runs dlr -< releasedate >.js which sets up a hidden Silverlight control on the page to download IronRuby and run any Ruby script - tags .
The IronRuby binaries are downloaded to the browser cache , so they are not re-downloaded for any other application , unless the browser cache is cleared or is invalidated ( Fig 2 and 3 ) .
These binaries set up the Silverlight control to process Ruby script - tags and execute them with IronRuby .
Note : IronRuby is not currently part of the Silverlight installation because keeping IronRuby open - source is a priority , and Silverlight is a closed - source project .
The ability to download the binaries on the first load lets IronRuby stay as a separate project .
The specification for how all this works is in the Silverlight - Back to Just - Text paper ; it is also a great source of documentation for the IronRuby - specific features , over and above what Silverlight already provides .
It 's worth pointing out that the entire application is just text ; Silverlight IronRuby applications are made up of script - tags which have inline ruby code , or point to a ruby file on the Web server , along with other supported file - types referenced by script - tags to use vector graphics , archives of Ruby libraries ( like the Ruby standard library , or a Gem ) , or even .NET assemblies .
Vector Graphics
A similar " Hello , World " example can be done with Silverlight 's vector - graphics as well :
The vector - graphics markup is called XAML , providing a simple XML - based markup language for defining any vector - graphics , like a user - interface .
However , visual elements defined with XAML can also be defined through code ; for example that < TextBlock > tag could have also been created from Ruby code , so you can decide to use XAML or just Ruby code to build vector - graphics :
t = TextBlock.new t.name , t.text , t.font_size = " message " , " Loading ... " , 14
XAML is useful as there are great designer tools like Expression Blend which generate XAML that is directly consumable by Silverlight .
However , if designers - tools are n't your thing , the Magic library provides a very clean Ruby DSL for building user - interfaces .
In - Browser Ruby Console
A lot of Ruby development happens at an interactive Ruby command - prompt , and there is no exception with running Ruby in the browser .
Turning on the Ruby command - prompt is simple ; just enable the " console " setting for this page , and a Ruby command - prompt will appear at the bottom of the page , letting you run code against the active application :
document .
message represents the DOM element with the id property of message ( document.get_element_by_id(" message " ) also works ) and the click DOM event is hooked with the block , which changes the innerHTML of the clicked element .
You can play around with code in this console window , and then when your satisfied move it into the actual HTML file .
Everything in Silverlight is usable through Ruby , just like it was originally written in Ruby .
The is possible because IronRuby is directly integrated with the CLR .
For example , you can see what methods are on the first DOM object in the HTML body by using normal Ruby idioms .
For more information on what APIs are available in Silverlight , see the Full Silverlight 3 Documentation .
2D Drawing
A good way to get acquainted with new technology is to focus on an area and have some fun ; here I 'll be using the 2D drawing libraries in Silverlight to make some " art " .
The first example is ruby - squares .html , which draws 200 randomly size and randomly colored squares .
However , that 's not all the Ruby code running in the app ; in the HTML file you 'll notice four script - tags before the code shown above .
These files provide various helpers for working with Silverlight from Ruby .
repl.rb provides a way of enabling the command window through code , along with controlling when it 's visible based on the query - string ( ruby - square .
html does n't show the console at all , ruby - square.html ?
console will open the IronRuby Console panel , and ruby - square.html?console=off show the console with all panels hidden ) .
wpf_ext.rb contains some helpers to make dealing with Silverlight 's graphics libraries nicer from Ruby .
This is only a fraction of the functionality that wpf_ext.rb normally provides , as this file was truncated for the article .
sketch.rb sets up Silverlight for 2D drawing , calling those setup and draw methods described above at the appropriate times ; largely influenced by ruby - processing .
bouncer.rb bounce any Silverlight object around a Silverlight canvas ; I 'll use this directly in the drawings .
To experiment with it , run $ sketch.toggle_bounce from the command - window to begin bouncing all the objects on the screen around .
You can also re-run $ sketch.setup to add more objects :
Speaking of ruby - processing , ruby - circles .
html is one of the ruby - processing examples which I showed running in a Windows desktop app at RubyConf 2009 , but can also run on the Mac through Silverlight .
Flickr Photo Viewer
While 2D animations are a fun way of exploring Ruby in the browser , they do n't really capture what making a " real - world " client - side web application would be like , with more standard user - interactions like clicking links and typing into text boxes .
A simple Flickr photo viewer should do the trick though ; using Flickr 's Web service to search for images and displaying them on the page :
The first thing this application needs to do is react when the " search " button is pressed .
Ruby blocks ( as well as procs ) are used to handle events from the HTML page :
The create_request method takes the text in the textbox and makes a Web request to the appropriate Flickr Web service URL .
When the request is complete , the applications shows the images Flickr returned :
The show_images method parses the response from Flickr into Ruby objects , and then the application 's view render the photos with ERB :
view.rb - rendering HTML from ERB templates
images.erb - an ERB template which creates HTML for displaying Flickr images
The erb method uses the exact same ERB that is part of the Ruby standard library , and what Rails uses by default in views .
The ability to run the same libraries , such as ERB , or even your own application code , on both the client and the server is unique way of being " DRY " .
It can help to blur the line between your client and server code , since everything can be written in Ruby , and open up new ways of sharing code and being productive .

" Cleggalomaniac . "
" Vote for Clegg is vote for Brussels . "
" Clegg in Nazi slur on Britain . "
" Clegg , the donors and payments to his bank account . "
The Sun and Daily Mail do n't do things by halves .
When the message goes out that a leading politician , hitherto ignored , poses a mortal threat to the nation , it must be hammered home , not once , but page after page , headline after headline , day after day ; not just on news pages , but in every available opinion column ; not only in words , but in pictures .
One can only stand , admire and get out of the way , as one does when herds of animals stampede in unison across the African savannah .
Since Nick Clegg was declared the " winner " of the first televised election debate , no shred of evidence to discredit him has been left unused .
Eight - year - old newspaper articles , expenses claims we were told about months ago , internal Liberal Democrat memos that long preceded his becoming an MP - let alone party leader , have been unearthed by Fleet Street 's fearless sleuths .
It was n't just his pro-Europe views , his dodgy finances or his cosmopolitan ancestry .
He attended Westminster School when the place was awash with drugs .
He worked for a lobbying firm that once represented Colonel Gaddafi and Vladimir Putin .
The papers failed to find evidence that Clegg shook hands with a man who danced with Myra Hindley but not , I am sure , for want of trying .
Out of the loop
What explains the hysteria of these attacks , which far exceed anything directed at Gordon Brown ?
There is no doubt political correspondents for right - wing papers were briefed and given " angles " by Tory spin doctors .
But to see it all as a Tory plot is too simplistic .
Parties routinely brief friendly journalists on campaign themes .
They do not always get such an enthusiastic , single - minded response .
Newspapers do not like the idea of a hung parliament or of the Lib Dems achieving anything like equality with the other parties .
Football matches do not have three sides .
A three - sided contest flouts the elementary rules of drama and narrative .
At elections , several million people vote for the Lib Dems , but no newspaper consistently backs them .
Journalists do not cultivate Lib Dem contacts , read their policy papers or , in the Sun 's case , even attend their conferences ( as an ex-editor of that paper revealed recently ) .
The prospect of Lib Dems having crucial influence on the next government , and even becoming ministers , leaves newspapers feeling out of the loop .
They therefore warn of national ruin if there is a hung parliament and / or coalition government .
But for editors and proprietors , deeply personal issues are also involved .
The Mail , for example , has always been and remains a Tory paper .
But its editor , Paul Dacre , does not care for David Cameron : he is too posh , too slick , too modish , too liberal on social issues , too much like Tony Blair .
Gordon Brown is none of those things ; he shares with Dacre ( or Dacre believes he shares ) a stern moral compass .
So the Mail , while going hard for Labour , went easy on Brown , faintly praising him on occasions .
This made its initial election coverage strangely muted .
Clegg 's success in the TV debate was a liberation : at last , the Mail had a clear enemy - as posh as Cameron , and even more like Blair - and it could proceed in its finest traditions of character assassination .
Then there is the Sun , a paper that derives much of its identity and authority from its reputation for backing winners .
Its claim to be the paper " wot won it " for John Major in 1992 is central to its brand image .
Its proprietor , Rupert Murdoch , wishes to exercise power , not so much to influence policy or even to secure business advantage ( though he uses his closeness to governments to both ends ) , but because he likes power in the way other people like snow - capped mountains or Greene King real ale .
Murdoch does not despise Brown , as he ­despised Neil Kinnock .
Like Dacre , he has a soft spot for the PM and , as a populist , does not warm to Cameron .
But last autumn , Murdoch was persuaded by his son James , his representative in London , and by Rebekah Brooks , News International 's chief executive , to abandon New Labour and embrace Cameron .
Murdoch
Sr made the wrong call in the US presidential elections , backing John McCain rather than Barack Obama .
Now he fears ending on the wrong side in the British election , too .
Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic would then know they can survive without Murdoch .
They can ignore his calls and his demands for an audience .
To a man so accustomed to access , being frozen out would be unbearable .
The setting Sun
No wonder that ( according to a blog by Murdoch 's biographer Michael Wolff ) Tom Newton Dunn , the paper 's Old Etonian political ­editor , is telling colleagues : " It is my job to see that Cameron fucking well gets into Downing Street . "
No wonder Brooks and Murdoch Jr burst into the Independent 's offices to berate the acting editor , Simon Kelner , for his paper 's advertising slogan : " Rupert Murdoch will not decide the outcome of the election .
You will . "
The longer Clegg rides high in the polls , the worse for the Sun and other papers .
They have " exposed " the Lib Dem leader as a liar , a fraud ,
a hypocrite and a foreigner .
They have declared Cameron the clear winner of the second televised debate .
" The Cam Back Kid " , the Sun announced in one of its more excruciating puns .
But as I write , the polls still predict a hung parliament and most suggest the Lib Dems will get around 30 per cent of the vote , perhaps more .
The editors and proprietors have pulled the usual levers .
They should , by now , have pulverised the opposition .
Nothing has happened , and on Twitter the people mock .
An awful truth is dawning : even newspaper readers no longer take newspapers seriously .
Peter Wilby was editor of the New Statesman from 1998 - 2005 .
" All Islanders looked the same to her , she explained .
She could n't tell them apart .
So none would be allowed in . "
In Anchorage , police uphold the right of businesses to deny service based on race .
It gets worse .
Even when the courts find evidence of discrimination , as they did in the case of Carolyn Mitchell , there 's no guarantee of justice .
Carolyn Mitchell was awarded damages of $ 1 by a jury in 2004 .
In 2009 she was ordered to pay $ 45,594 , the cost of the trial , minus $ 1 .
A Very Special Bracelet
Mom loves her charm bracelet .
To help personalize it , each family member gives her a charm .
There 's one from her son , one from each daughter , and one from Dad that says " A little head never hurt anyone . "
Last year Dad gave Mom a Pugster bracelet that said " Two in the pink , one in the stink . "
But she did n't understand it , so the next charm had a picture .
Amazon has since discontinued any charm bracelets advertising " the shocker , " but there 's still one very special bracelet charm that just says " PMS . "
We told Dad these were great gift ideas — but that 's because we 're trying to get them divorced .
For her birthday , Dad gave her a charm that said " Pootie Tang . "
Any day now ...

The Phoenix lander will not be phoning home .
A new image of Phoenix taken this month by the HiRISE camera ( High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows signs of severe ice damage to the lander ’s solar panels , with one panel appearing to be completely gone .
The Phoenix team says this is consistent with predictions of how Phoenix could be damaged by harsh winter conditions .
It was anticipated that the weight of a carbon - dioxide ice buildup could bend or break the solar panels .
“ Before and after images are dramatically different , ” said Michael Mellon of the University of Colorado in Boulder , a science team member for both Phoenix and HiRISE .
“ The lander looks smaller , and only a portion of the difference can be explained by accumulation of dust on the lander , which makes its surfaces less distinguishable from surrounding ground . ”
Mellon calculated hundreds of pounds of ice probably coated the lander in mid-winter .
Several attempts to contact Phoenix during the past few months came up empty .
“ We can see that the lander , heat shield , and backshell - plus - parachute are now covered by dust , ” said Mellon and Alfred McEwen on the HiRISE website , “ so they lack the distinctive colors of the hardware or the surfaces where the pre-landing dust was disturbed .
But if the lander is structurally intact , it should cast the same shadows .
While that is indeed the case for the shadow cast by the backshell ( which came to rest on its side ) , that does not appear to be the case for the lander . ”
See the larger image of all the various pieces of Phoenix on the HiRISE website .
So now , the Phoenix mission is officially over .
But during its mission on Mars , Phoenix confirmed and examined patches of the widespread deposits of underground water ice detected by Odyssey and identified a mineral called calcium carbonate that suggested occasional presence of thawed water .
The lander also found soil chemistry with significant implications for life and observed falling snow .
The mission ’s biggest surprise was the discovery of perchlorate , an oxidizing chemical on Earth that is food for some microbes and potentially toxic for others .
“ We found that the soil above the ice can act like a sponge , with perchlorate scavenging water from the atmosphere and holding on to it , ” said Peter Smith , Phoenix principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson .
“ You can have a thin film layer of water capable of being a habitable environment .
A micro-world at the scale of grains of soil — that ’s where the action is . ”
The perchlorate results are shaping subsequent astrobiology research , as scientists investigate the implications of its antifreeze properties and potential use as an energy source by microbes .
Discovery of the ice in the uppermost soil by Odyssey pointed the way for Phoenix .
More recently , the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected numerous ice deposits in middle latitudes at greater depth using radar and exposed on the surface by fresh impact craters .
“ Ice - rich environments are an even bigger part of the planet than we thought , ” Smith said .
“ Somewhere in that vast region there are going to be places that are more habitable than others . ”

In the second part of a series on the conflicts facing Muslims in Europe , the BBC's Islamic affairs analyst , Roger Hardy , discovers strains between younger and older Muslims in Glasgow .
Nazia Iqbal ( centre ) started a campaign for voting rights at her mosque
They are young , Muslim and Scottish - and will not take no for an answer .
I met Nazia Iqbal and two of her friends at the student union of Glasgow 's Strathclyde University .
Ms Iqbal , who is the equal opportunities officer , has been making waves ever since she went to the city 's Central Mosque and asked to become a voting member .
According to the mosque 's constitution , Muslim men and women not only have the right to pray at the mosque - if they are over 18 , they are entitled to become voting members and have a say in its running .
But Ms Iqbal , who is 20 , was turned down , on the grounds that she is female .
Her response was to start a campaign on Facebook , and complain to the body that regulates Scottish charities .
Pioneers
To find out what was going on , I went to Friday prayers at the Central Mosque to meet one of the community 's first - generation pioneers , Bashir Maan .
Now 83 , Mr Maan came to Glasgow as a young Pakistani student in the early 1950s .
Bashir Maan is one of his community 's first - generation pioneers
He became one of the best - known figures in the community and , after joining the Labour Party , the first Muslim councillor in Britain .
The mosque is an impressive structure , occupying a large site beside the River Clyde .
It opened its doors in 1984 and can hold more than 2,000 worshippers .
Mr Maan agrees that the constitution opens up membership to both males and females - but criticises Ms Iqbal and her friends for being confrontational .
Some of the younger generation do not want to work with the " oldies " , he told me - they think they know best .
For now , it is stalemate .
Ms Iqbal has not become a member , the campaign goes on - and the regulatory body has yet to reach a decision .
Is haggis halal ?
What is so striking about Glasgow 's Muslims is their attachment to a Scottish identity .
A young Islamic scholar , Sheikh Rizwan Mohammed , debates with his students whether Muslims can eat haggis - the Scottish national dish - or wear a kilt .
( His answer is yes to both - provided the kilt is below the knee . )
Another example is Muslim involvement in politics .
My visit coincided with the British election campaign .
In the constituency of Glasgow Central , two young Muslims , both in their 20s , were competing for the same seat .
Anas Sarwar was standing as a Labour candidate for the seat previously held by his father , Mohammed .
One of his challengers , Osama Saeed , left the Labour Party in protest at the Iraq war and was the candidate for the Scottish National Party .
The SNP wants independence for Scotland .
In the event , Anas Sarwar retained the seat for Labour .
But his party can no longer rely , as it could in the past , on unquestioning Muslim support .
The Muslim community is stagnant
Javed Ali
Roger Hardy 's first report , from Amsterdam Among the younger generation , it is not just students like Ms Iqbal who think it is time for change .
At the Andalus Centre , in a former office block in a Glasgow suburb , I met an energetic husband - and - wife team - Kishwar Sultana and Javed Ali .
They not only teach young Muslims the Koran , they take youngsters - girls as well as boys - kayaking and rock climbing .
The parents trust them , says Kishwar Sultana , because they are sensitive to the families ' religion and culture .
I asked some of the mothers why they had chosen the centre rather than one of the mosques .
They liked its approach to learning , they told me , and its welcoming atmosphere .
The implication is that the more traditional mosques - patriarchal and conservative - are less family - friendly .
" The Muslim community is stagnant , " says Javed Ali .
It needs new ideas and new leadership to move forward .
Roger Hardy 's programme about Glasgow 's Muslims , in the Heart and Soul series on the BBC World Service , is broadcast on Wednesday 12 May at 1232 and 1632 , with repeats .

The mere mention flooded my mind with all sorts of flashes of what this show and era of the Dead was like .
She grew up in Woodstock , NY , where I had also spent my high school years , and we reminisced about the Dead and what that show must have been like .
The mellow Cornell campus and the awesome finger lakes nearby , just heaven for mind tripping Dead heads to explore new universes of space time mind travel .
What a blessing it was that we could enjoy this music back then , and now here in the archive !
I plan to donate to the archive to help them flourish , as I would encourage others to as well .

Subject : Better not be there when it rolls over ...
It is probably best NOT to title anything ' BEST SHOW BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD '
It is challenging enough to pick out the best shows from a particular year let alone to have one ultimate show for the 30 year run .
What you can get from a listen to this show is that when the band is on just about everything they play stands out and sparkles .
The biggest standouts probably being ' Dancin '
' Scarlet > Fire the whole St. Stephen > N.F.A>
Stephen
' The Dew ' but really the entire show is well played .
( MORNING DEW - It is amazing that a tune they started playing so early along could blaze so hot all thru the years .
and it scorches here . )
The N.F.A reminds me of The ENGLISHTOWN one they would play four months later .

No way !!
After hearing a bunch of Dick's Picks and other great 77 shows , I still think this was the greatest by far of a very good year .
The late , great Dick Latvala did a heck of a lot for the Dead legacy but got it completely wrong on this one ( except that he did recognize this Dew as the best ever ) .
The Scarlet > Fire blows away other versions from 77 and may be the best ever .
St. Stephen > Not Fade Away > St. Stephen >
Morning
Dew is simply one of my favorite jam sessions of all time .
Talk about primal Dead !
It 's a very solid first set as well , with a spectacular Loser and culminating in a long , well - jammed Dancin ' .
It may be a good thing they do n't have this one in the vault .
All these great - sounding recordings will be available on Archive for the foreseeable future .

Let Someone Else Report On This Bullshit
NEW YORK — While millions of young , tech - savvy professionals already use services like Facebook and Twitter to keep in constant touch with friends , a new social networking platform called Foursquare has recently taken the oh , fucking hell , can't some other desperate news outlet cover this crap instead ?
Advertisement
Hip city - dwellers nationwide are embracing the new , come to think of it , have n't we used this photo for some other tech piece ?
Launched last year , Foursquare is unique in that it not only allows users to broadcast their whereabouts , but also offers a number of built - in incentives , including some innovative new crap The New York Times surely has a throbbing hard - on for .
Advertisement
In fact , why do n't we just let them report on this garbage and call it a day ?
" Foursquare is a little bit of everything — a friend - finder , a local city guide , an interactive mobile game , " said company cofounder Dennis Crowley , as if reading from the same tired script used by every one of these Web 2.0 or whatever - the - fuck - they 're - called startups .
" But more than that , Foursquare is an [ endless string of meaningless buzzwords we just could n't bring ourselves to transcribe ] . "

Added Crowley , " [ Who gives a shit ] . "
According to sources we feel really , really sorry for , Foursquare works by allowing users to " check in " from their present location , whether it be a bar , restaurant , nearby magazine stand , or man , this piece would be perfect to hand over to that schmuck Dan Fletcher at Time magazine right about now .
Advertisement
By " checking in , " users can earn tangible , real - world rewards .
For instance , the Foursquare user with the most points at any given venue earns the designation of " mayor " and can receive discounts , free food , or other prizes that , quite honestly , we 're thoroughly disgusted with ourselves for having actually researched .

In addition , please , kill us already .
As you 've no doubt guessed from reading a dozen similar articles in The Washington Post , now 's the part of our " trend piece " where we quote an industry expert like Leonard Steinberg , a Boston University communications professor and specialist in his field who remarks in a rather defeated tone that Foursquare represents a revolutionary new way for businesses and customers to interact .

" Through its competitive elements like badges and points , Foursquare helps generate brand loyalty , " said the Ph.D. - holding individual , whose decades in higher education were basically shit upon by our inane questions about various bits of Foursquare ephemera .
" It 's a unique and transformative social networking tool . "
" Can I go now ? " he added .
Although it recently hit the million - user mark , Foursquare has yet to approach the vast subscriber base of Facebook and Twitter .
But that all could change as people become increasingly reliant on the …okay , here , here , let me sum up this whole " news " story for you :
Aging , scared newspapermen throw themselves at the latest mobile technology trend in a humiliatingly futile attempt to remain relevant .

And now that you 're all caught up , take it away , final miserable paragraph :
The current mayor of her local coffee shop and the young woman we 've selected to represent young people everywhere , Jen Galanos , 26 , has so far earned a free cappuccino and two hours of Wi-Fi .
But while she likes the rewards , she said they 're only a fringe benefit of an application that , as we suspected , The New York Times has already creamed its jeans and tripped all over itself in a rush to cover .

So , where are they ?
Well , they 're everywhere and nowhere .
Some follow the sun while others follow their business investments - and the best chance of seeing them in the same room is likely to be at art sales in London or New York .
Never has the phrase " jet set " been quite so appropriate to describe this tribe , were it not for the fact that if you want to buy a plane with room for five passengers , there is a two - year waiting list .
The iPad is n't a big iPod touch — an iPod touch is a miniature iPad that restricts the full multitouch experience in exchange for offering greater portability .
With the iPad , in contrast , you get multitouch the way it was meant to be done .
That 's one of our many take - aways after having submerged ourselves in iPad land since launch .
The larger screen does n't just offer more space to work with — it opens up a different and more immersive user experience .
Because of this different experience , though , the closed nature of the platform can get under some users ' skin in ways the iPhone and iPod touch do not .
Still , the iPad is likely to just be a starting point for Apple and for multitouch computing in general .
There are obvious downsides to the device — we'll tell you what those are — but it 's clear that it does sit in its own category that floats somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop , and it serves different purposes than either its smaller or bigger siblings .
But we 're getting ahead of ourselves .
A large chunk of the Ars staff contributed to this review , either in the form of writing full sections or by offering feedback and insights based on their own experiences .
Because the 3G + WiFi version is not yet on the market , we all tested a WiFi- only iPad .
We think it 's worth noting up front that the WiFi - only version is probably best if you only plan to use it at home or at Starbucks — you 'll definitely miss not having an Internet connection while out and about , and the ( non-contract ) 3G data plans are not bad at all , so long as you can stomach the extra $ 130 you 'll have to fork over for the privilege .
It 's also the case that there are some parts of the iPad " experience " that we did n't get to cover here , but we think the next several pages will convey more about what using the iPad is like than you ever thought you wanted to know .
So let 's get on with it !

Ed Balls has pledged to " listen first " after confirming his intention to stand for the leadership of the Labour Party .
The ex-schools secretary said he wanted to " hear what the public say " and said he recognised there were concerns on immigration and tuition fees .
It was not about " Blair versus Brown " or " old Labour versus new Labour " .
David and Ed Miliband are also standing in the contest .
Left - wing MP John McDonnell wants to stand - but says the process is " stitched up " .
' Brave things '
Mr Balls said he recognised that in some constituencies immigration had been an issue and some felt tuition fees " had been a barrier " to going to university - he said some people did not know about the points system introduced for economic migrants .
" We 've got to listen first , hear what the public say , that 's going to be at the centrepiece of my campaign , " he said .
Mr Balls was Mr Brown 's chief economics adviser for 10 years before becoming an MP in 2005 and being promoted to schools secretary two years later , when Mr Brown became prime minister .
MPs / members annoyed about short nominations timetable : I have to say I agree .
Need broadest possible choice & time for MPs to decide &consult
Ed Miliband
He said the former PM had made " the right decisions to get us through " economic difficulties and said he was " proud " of his record in government and he thought people would " look back and say Gordon did some really brave things " .
" I do n't think people are going to see this ( contest ) through the old prism of Blair and Brown , or of old or new Labour , I think that 's the past really - what people want to know is , are we in touch with the public , are we on their side , do we understand their concerns ? "
He said he had spoken to Mr Brown at the weekend , but he was remaining neutral in the contest : " I told him I was going to stand and he said : ' Good luck , go for it ' . "
Mr Balls was backed by former schools minister Vernon Coaker at the launch - and is also being supported by Michael Dugher , Mr Brown 's former spokesman and new MP for Barnsley East , and Sharon Hodgson , MP for Washington and Sunderland West .
Nominations timetable
He said the fact that he was now in a marginal seat - after his majority was cut on a 9.3 % swing to the Tories - would not affect his bid : " The Conservatives threw everything they could at me , money and some pretty abusive stuff - I won . "
Pressed on what policy differences there were between him and the Miliband brothers , Mr Balls said he was " not going to fall into the trap .. of making this a bitter and divisive fight " .
He said there would be some differences and mentioned voting reform , but added : " We 've been friends and colleagues for a long period of time ...
Whoever wins this I will back them 110 % because I think the unity of the Labour Party is vital and this generation has got a massive responsibility . "

There has been some concern about the tight timetable for leadership candidates to gather the 33 MPs ' signatures necessary to get on the ballot paper - something they must do by Thursday 27 May .
The winner will not be announced until 25 September .
Ed Miliband wrote on his Twitter page " MPs / members annoyed about short nominations timetable : I have to say I agree .
Need broadest possible choice & time for MPs to decide&consult " .
John McDonnell - who said on Wednesday he would try to get on the ballot paper but the timetable made it " almost impossible " - has argued that the process has been " stitched up from the start " .
Mr Balls told the BBC it was important that new MPs were given the time to think about their choice but said it was " not sensible " to criticise the rules .
" The nomination period was shorter than I expected but I will work with that , " he said .
' Stitched up ' Hayes and Harlington MP Mr McDonnell wanted to stand against Gordon Brown for the leadership in 2007 but did not get enough nominations for MPs .
He has criticised the process which he says is " stitched up from the start " and " renders it almost impossible for me to get on the ballot paper " .
In a speech to the Public and Commercial Services Union 's annual conference in Brighton on Wednesday , he confirmed he would stand , if he can get the nominations .
He said if only the Miliband brothers and Mr Balls stood , the contest would amount to " the sons of Blair versus the son of Gordon Brown " .
" All of the other candidates so far are all from the New Labour stable .
They are all implicated in the policies that basically lost us the last election , " he said .
" I refuse to vote for things like privatisation of public services , the war in Iraq .
I 'm in favour of redistribution of wealth through the tax system . "
Influential backbencher Jon Cruddas - who has ruled himself out of the leadership race - has also said he did not think candidates had long enough to secure nominations .

Panama 's Manuel Noriega extradited from US to France
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

The former Panamanian leader , Manuel Noriega , has arrived in France after being extradited from the US , where he has served more than 20 years in jail .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier signed a " surrender warrant " after all judicial challenges ended .
Noriega was convicted in France in his absence in 1999 for laundering money but is likely to face a new trial .
Noriega is now expected to go before prosecutors in Paris to be notified of the arrest warrant against him .
His French lawyer said he would argue that French courts did not have the jurisdiction to try his client .
Detention ruling Noriega had wanted to be sent back to Panama after finishing his 17 - year jail sentence in 2007 .
But in February the US Supreme Court rejected his final appeal against extradition to France .
ANALYSIS Steve Kingstone , BBC News , Washington
Manuel Noriega had been in US custody since 1990 , after the US military invaded Panama during the administration of the first President Bush .
Convicted of cocaine trafficking and racketeering , he served a sentence that ended three years ago .
But he had remained in custody pending extradition to France , where he was convicted - in his absence - of money laundering in 1999 .
Noriega 's lawyers say his treatment breached the Geneva Convention , as he had been classified as a prisoner of war when he was brought to the US .
His legal team opposed his extradition to France , but the US Supreme Court ruled against him .
His lawyers hope that once he 's landed in Paris he 'll at least be granted a second trial .
Noriega is expected to be brought before a judge later on Tuesday ; his lawyer will probably argue he should be bailed pending further proceedings , though one suspects that is extremely unlikely .
Panama 's government said it respected the " sovereign decision " the state department took to extradite Noriega , who is in his mid-70s .
But it insisted it would seek his return to serve outstanding prison sentences there .
Noriega was escorted on to an Air France passenger jet at Miami International Airport on Monday afternoon , shortly after Mrs Clinton signed the extradition order , US officials said .
French prison officials took custody of him once he was on board .
Noriega 's plane arrived in the French capital shortly before 0800 local time ( 0600 GMT ) on Tuesday .
A spokesman for the French justice ministry , Guillaume Didier , said that Noriega would appear before prosecutors to be notified of the arrest warrant against him and a judge would decide whether to place him under temporary detention until his case was referred to a criminal court .
Agence France - Presse news agency quoted Mr Didier as saying that Noriega could go on trial within two months .
Noriega 's lawyer in France , Yves Leberquier , said he would challenge French jurisdiction on the grounds of his client 's immunity from prosecution as a former head of state and because the statute of limitations had expired .
" We 're not here to eventually make a moral judgment , we 've got legal rules that have to be applied and respected , " Associated Press quoted him as saying .
' Prisoner of war '
Mr Didier said France had been notified of the extradition two weeks ago .
But Noriega 's lawyer in Miami , Frank Rubino , told the BBC he had not been notified and had only learned of his client 's transfer from the media .
WHO IS MANUEL NORIEGA ?
Became de facto ruler of Panama in 1983 , head of defence forces Formerly one of Washington 's top allies in Latin America US later accused him of drug - trafficking and election - rigging Surrendered to invading US troops in 1990 and was flown to the US Also faces a 20 - year sentence at home imposed by Panama court
Amazing fall from grace Q&A : Noriega extradition " Usually the government has - does things in a more professional manner and respects common courtesy and we 're shocked that they did n't , " he said .
" I 'm surprised that they did n't put a black hood over his head and drag him out in the middle of the night , " he added .
Noriega was Panama 's military intelligence chief for several years before becoming commander of the powerful National Guard in 1982 and then de facto ruler of the country .
He had been recruited by the CIA in the late 1960s and was supported by the US until 1987 .
But in 1988 he was indicted in the US on charges of drug trafficking .
After a disputed parliamentary election the following year , Noriega declared a " state of war " .
A tense stand - off followed between US forces stationed in the Panama Canal zone and Panamanian troops .
By mid-December , the situation had worsened so much that President George H W Bush launched an invasion - ostensibly because a US marine had been killed in Panama City , although the operation had long been planned .
Noriega initially took refuge in the Vatican embassy , where US troops bombarded him for days with deafening pop and heavy metal music .
He eventually surrendered on 3 January 1990 and was taken to Miami for trial .
In 1992 , he was convicted of drug trafficking , money laundering and racketeering .
He was handed a 40 - year prison sentence , later reduced to 30 years , and then 17 years for good behaviour .
Noriega was convicted in absentia in France in 1999 for allegedly using $ 3 m ( £ 1.9 m ) in proceeds from the drug trade to buy luxury apartments in Paris , and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
Shortly before the completion of his US jail sentence , the French government sought Noriega 's extradition .

Just got off the phone with agent George Bazos , and he says the Wild is close to signing UMass forward Casey Wellman to a two - year entry - level deal .
It 'll be for the rookie cap of $ 900,000 per year , but the first year is basically three weeks long .
Wellman arrives Tuesday morning and it's unclear as of now if he could potentially make his NHL debut against the Edmonton Oilers .
He will be eligible and he IS NOT going to Houston .
Wellman , 22 , is tied for sixth in the nation with 23 goals .
Bazos said GM Chuck Fletcher went above and beyond , visiting Wellman twice .
He said Wellman received interest from 22 teams .
Here is Wellman 's bio
Wellman is a right - shot centerman .
He 's got a great shot , is excellent on draws .
Fletcher undoubtedly sold the Wild 's weakness at center as being a reason for Wellman to come here .
In other words , he can play right away and will have an excellent chance to make next year 's club .
He wo n't be eligible to play in the playoffs if the Wild makes it .
This is about the future .

WASHINGTON — The White House is facing a budding revolt over its carefully crafted strategy for repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military that would have pushed the decision past the November election .
Democrats in the House and Senate — including two key lawmakers from Colorado — say they are unwilling to wait for completion of a 10 - month Pentagon study on repeal of the policy known as “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” and are instead moving to include immediate repeal in the defense reauthorization bill , scheduled for mark - up next month .
Sen. Mark Udall , D - Colo. , among the Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee backing the move , said the committee was “ within a vote or two ” of including repeal in the must - pass legislation .
He met with three discharged members of the military Tuesday , using their stories to highlight the need for repeal this year .
Rep. Jared Polis , a Boulder Democrat and one of three openly gay members of Congress , holds a key position on the Rules Committee that he is willing to use to insert a similar provision in the House version of the spending bill , he said Tuesday .
Congressional aides said both approaches are likely to face opposition from the White House , which in February laid a timetable built around an extensive Pentagon study that wo n’t be completed until Dec. 1 , pushing a final move on the contentious issue past what ’s expected to be Democrats ’ toughest election cycle in years .
3 tales of careers ended
But the White House is facing pushback on several fronts at once .
On Monday , repeal activists heckled President Barack Obama for several minutes at a fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer in California .
“ The sooner we can end this policy , the better , ” Polis said .
“ There have been plenty of studies about this policy and how it continues to weaken our military every day that it exists . ”
The three former military personnel gathered in Udall ’s Senate office Tuesday each had stellar careers cut short when officials discovered they were gay .
Mike Almy was an Air Force major commanding a sensitive communications unit in the Middle East when a colleague discovered personal e-mails sent to relatives back home .
After a 16 - month investigation , he was discharged and escorted from the base by police “ as if I were a common criminal or a threat to national security , ” he said .
David
Hall spent five years loading bombs and missiles on F - 15 fighter jets when he was accepted into an officer - training program , with a chance to become a fighter pilot .
Ranked No. 1 in his cadet class , he was discharged when a female cadet told his superiors he was gay .
Stacey Vasquez had a career as a distinguished noncommissioned officer , including being named the top recruiter in the Army .
It ended when a colleague ’s wife saw her kissing another woman in a club in Dallas , she said .
“ Once I was discharged , I remember a distinct feeling as I was driving away from Fort Hood thinking , How could my country let me down like this ? ” Vasquez said .
“ How could I give 12 years , how could I go out and tell kids how great the service was , and then one day — due to no misconduct — my country tells me that I ’m not a valuable asset ? ” she said .
Udall cited the record of each and called repeal “ the most common - sense step we could take to enhance our national security . ”
Backers ’ strategy
Opponents of repealing do n’t ask , do n’t tell , which allows gays to serve in the military as long as their sexual orientation remains a secret , make the opposite argument :
Allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military presents of risk of significant disruption in the midst of fighting two wars .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee , supports including immediate repeal in the defense spending bill , aides said , a strategy that would require a super majority of 60 votes to remove it .
Two or three Democrats on the committee are opposed , which means supporters will have to pick up some Republican allies .
But the most significant factor may be how far the White House is willing to go in opposing the idea .
“ I ’m going to push everybody possible to see this happens this year .
We ’ve had this discussion long enough , ” Udall said .
“ The Pentagon has taken some big forward steps that they ’ve never been willing to take , ” he said .
“ I do n’t under estimate the steps they ’re taking , but in the end we need to change the law . ”

Man , 26 , coated in creosote and tortured to death - for asking young mother out on a date
Shaun Fitton was brutally assaulted and murdered after asking Rebecca Birt out on a date
A 26 - year - old man was stripped naked , covered with white paint and then tortured to death after asking a young mother out on a date .
Shaun Fitton was overheard flirting with 22 - year - old Rebecca Birt at a party by her boyfriend Shaun Beatty , who seized Fitton and began assaulting him .
The entire attack , - inculding an horrific sexual assault which left Fritton with fatal internal injuries - was filmed on a camcorder by Birt .
She can be heard laughing and encouraging others to continue the torture in the tape .
Fitton was eventually dropped head first and naked into a wheelie bin before being hauled around the streets .
Police officers found him screaming in agony and covered in paint by a wheelie bin in Birt 's back yard .
He died 24 hours later in hospital from multiple organ failure .
Police arrested the killers after finding Birt 's video camera in her home , containing three clips of the torture session .
Beatty , 20 of West Bank Street , Atherton , near Wigan , Greater Manchester was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years after being convicted of murder whilst Birt , was jailed for nine years after being found guilty of manslaughter .
Birt 's former lover Owen Skeate , 23 , of Bowling Green Row , Atherton , was also jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years after he was convicted of murder .
As he sentenced the trio at Liverpool Crown Court , Mr Justice Henriques described the murder as both sexually motivated and sadistic .
The court had previously been told the victim had been subjected to a ' sadistic killing ' and jurors recoiled and covered their mouths in shock as they watched Birt 's footage of the incident .
' This was a sexually motivated and sadistic killing , ' said Mr Neil Flewitt QC prosecuting .
Shaun Beatty was convicted of murder while his girlfriend Rebecca Birt was jailed for nine years after being convicted of manslaughter
' Shaun Fitton was totally defenceless .
What they did to him was intended to humiliate and punish him for what he had said earlier .
' They are all responsible for what was done to Shaun Fitton either because they inflicted the injuries themselves or because they assisted and encouraged those who inflicted the injuries . '
Fitton , described by his family 'as a soft - hearted , tender person with a heart of gold ' , had gone to Birt 's home for a party she was throwing for Beatty and her former boyfriend in August last year .
Trouble began when then victim propositioned Birt .
Beatty punched Fiton in the eye before grabbing him .
He intially had white paint poured over his body and nail varnish slapped on his finger and toenails .
The court heard how the voices of the killers could be heard in the background laughing and shouting words of encouragement .
The attack only came to an end when neighbours called police after they saw Fitton , unconscious and covered in paint , being dragged around the streets inside the wheelie bin .
Owen Skeate was also jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years after he was convicted of murder
When oficers arrived Beatty fled the scene but the others were found inside the house .
Skeate , Gerrard and Birt were standing at the kitchen door .
PC Robert Longman told the hearing : ' Shaun was kneeling up , completely naked and covered in white paint .
He was screaming in agony .
I asked all three who he was and what had happened .
They all just laughed and said : " We 've painted him " . '
Birt later told the interviewing detective that covering the victim in paint had been ' just a joke . '
Beatty handed himself in 24 hours after the killing .
Another man Michael Gerrard , 22 , of Rivington Street , Atherton , was acquitted of murder .
In a statement after the case , Fitton 's father Anthony Hall said : ' Shaun was a soft - hearted , tender person and was loved by all his family .
' He was a beloved son , brother , nephew , uncle and cousin .
He had a heart of gold and was well liked by his friends - but sadly he had got in with the wrong crowd .
' I think Shaun has finally got justice and can finally be laid to rest and hopefully be with God .
' His family will always be thinking of him and I will never forget him until the day I die . '
Following sentencing today , Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall said : ' This was a cruel and senseless attack on a man , who through drink was barely able to stand let alone defend himself against such vicious and vile actions from people he thought of as friends .
' These three people are equally responsible for his death - irrespective of who actually inflicted these horrible injuries because not one of them did anything to stop this or help Shaun and , in fact , encouraged each other .
' I hope seeing those responsible getting the sentences they deserve provides some comfort for Shaun 's family . '
For those who do n't have Bloomberg News on 24/7 , the Dow just dropped almost 1,000 points , before bouncing back to . . . well , to being down a mere 400 points .
What on earth is going on ?
Immediate theories :
It was the computers , stupid .
This seems likely to have been at least part of the problem ; the drop was just too sudden , as was the recovery .
Accenture dropped from $ 40 a share to one cent at some point , and Proctor and Gamble also had an improbably gigantic drop .
I 'd guess that some trading programs , somewhere , hit the wrong stock price level and went horribly wrong .

The market knows something that we do n't about Germany .
Now that Greece has passed its austerity plan , the rest of the eurozone has to go along .
Germany , the single biggest player , votes tomorrow , and maybe someone knows we 're headed for a nasty surprise .

Passing an austerity plan does n't guarantee that it will work ; Argentina was going through governments like paper plates right before it terminated the dollar peg and defaulted .

Passing an austerity plan does n't guarantee that it will work ; Argentina was going through governments like paper plates right before it terminated the dollar peg and defaulted .
The market does n't know anything we do n't , but some idiots panicked when Mohamed El - Erian said that Greek contagion was on the verge of spreading .
One of the more comforting explanations ; if so , the idiots seem to have thought the better of it .

The challenge is to find where the solid fact is , because what you ’ve got there is a lot of internecine strife within the team and within Pakistan politics , with rival camps making allegations .
We are satisfied that that was a totally dysfunctional tour from a Pakistani point of view , and that dysfunctionality in the dressing room led to players not performing well , and maybe making them potentially underperform deliberately .
Ofer Malamud and
Cristian Pop - Eleches look at the effects of a program that gave poor households a voucher to purchase a computer .
( The program was Romanian but the results may hold lessons for similar programs around the world . )
Households with incomes directly below a cutoff level were given a voucher while households with incomes directly above the cutoff were not .
Thus , households which were very similar were treated differently and this lets the authors use a regression discontinuity design that makes their results credible as representing a causal effect .
The results of a regression discontinuity design are also very easy to explain with figures .
The income cutoff is shown by the red line .
Beginning at the top left we see that households with incomes just below the cutoff were much more likely to have a computer than households with incomes just above the cutoff – thus the voucher program has a big effect on computer ownership .
The top right figure shows similarly that the voucher program increased computer usage since computers were used much more often in households with incomes just below the cutoff than in the non-eligible - for - voucher households with incomes just above the cutoff .
Now take at look at the figures below .
The one on the left shows that the voucher program significantly increased the time spent playing computer games .
The one on the right which looks at the effect of the voucher program on the use of computers for homework – well , the punch line is clear .
Not surprisingly , with all that game playing going on , the authors find that the voucher program actually resulted in a decline in grades although there was also some evidence for an increase in computer proficiency and perhaps some improvement in a cognitive test .

Czech inquiry falls in line with international suits , as Internet giant calls incidents “ accident ”
Internet giant Google has apologized for the interception of personal data from Wi-Fi networks while gathering information for its Street View service .
The expressed regret comes a month after the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection launched a probe into the company ’s activities .
Peter Barron , Google ’s director of communications for North and Central Europe , said the company was sorry for its “ accidental collection ” of personal information from the public ’s Wi -Fi networks .
“ We are determined to learn the lessons from this mistake , ” he said in an interview with the BBC May 22 .
“ Collection of data is not to know anything about you as an individual ; it is about providing a better service . ”
The mea culpa comes as data protection agencies across the globe launched investigations into Google ’s activities after the company admitted May 17 that its fleet of Street View vehicles , used for the collection of images for its Google Maps service , had intercepted communications sent over unsecured wireless networks in people ’s homes .
The data , totaling 600 gigabytes ( GB ) , was collected from 30 countries over the past three years .
“ We screwed up , ” said Sergey Brin , the company ’s co-founder , at the opening of Google ’s conference for software developers in San Francisco May 20 .
Google is adding to its internal controls after it mistakenly captured the data , he added .
Investigations have been launched in several countries including Australia , the United States and Italy to see whether the tech giant has breached data protection and computer hacking laws .
In the United States , Google is facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and a class action lawsuit that could force the company to pay up to $ 10,000 ( 8,200 euros / 211,200 Kč ) each time it records data from unprotected hotspots .
Meanwhile , in Germany , Hamburg prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation .
Locally , the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection said its case was based on Google ’s failure to “ fulfill conditions of registration ” for the collection of personal data as prescribed by Czech law .
“ Google has not complied with the registration requirement imposed by law for the personal data controllers who intend to process personal data , ” Czech Office for Personal Data Protection spokeswoman Hana Štěpánková told The Prague Post .
“ Their intentions are not justified by any specific law . ”
According to the agency , Google could face a fine of up to 392,000 euros for the breach .
Privacy experts speculated the incidents may have exposed a significant oversight in Google ’s operations .
“ Google must have accessed a lot of passwords and data when carrying out the unauthorized data collection .
I do not understand why Google did not address the possible risk of its actions in advance , ” said Kateřina Hlatká , a spokeswoman for local privacy group Iuridicum Remedium .
“ Perhaps it is easier for them to go out there in the first place and deal with the risks involved afterward . ”
Hlatká added that she supported the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection investigation .
“ At least it will be a deterrent case for other companies , ” she said .
Meanwhile , Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , said the incident was a massive blow for Google ’s credibility : “ This is a cock - up that makes even the most unconcerned wonder if they could believe a company claim ever again . ”
“ How did nobody notice there was 600 GB of data that was n’t meant to be there ? ” he said , according to The Financial Times .
“ Something is amiss , frankly , in the whole story . ”
This is not the first time Google ’s Street View project has come under scrutiny .
Earlier this year , the company said it might cancel the Street View service in the EU due to the unmanageable requests of the European Commission , including a demand that residents be notified before cameras were sent out .
In November 2009 , Switzerland ’s Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner said the agency would be suing Google because a number of faces and vehicle number plates “ are not made sufficiently unrecognizable from the point of view of data protection ” in the Street View service .
Meanwhile , shortly after its UK launch in March last year , Privacy International sent a formal complaint about the service to the UK data protection agency , the Information Commissioners Office ( ICO ) , which cited more than 200 reports from members of the public who were identifiable in Street View images .
The latest incident has prompted a number of agencies , including the ICO and the Irish Data Protection Authority , to ask Google to delete all of the personal information it has collected from their respective countries .
Privacy International said it is against such a move , saying it is unlawful .
“ Privacy International believes this instruction is based on advice that is ill - informed and irresponsible , as the action may be unlawful , ” it said in an open letter to EU privacy commissioners .
“ We urge Google to politely ignore these instructions and , instead , securely store the data with a trusted third party pending further investigation . ”
The letter added that destroying any data would constitute a destruction of evidence .
The political foundations for union were never laid .
Governments kept building higher and higher regardless .
Political crisis did not weaken this structure , as Haass says .
Coming earlier than the architects would have wished - that is , before voters got with the program - political and economic crisis showed how weak the structure was to begin with .
History and ordinary prudence dictated that the union might be broad and shallow ( a free - trade area , with embellishments , capable of taking in all - comers ) or else narrow and deep ( an evolving political union , confined to countries willing to be led there ) .
Of the two , I always believed that the first was better .
But the architects did not even have the brains to choose the second .
They recognized no limits to their ambitions .
They set about creating a union that was both broad and deep .
A federal constitution , a parliament , a powerful central executive , one central bank , one currency - all with no binding sense of European identity .
As for scale , well , the bigger the better .
Today Greece , tomorrow Turkey .
And why stop there ?
Madness .
Gideon Rachman makes an interesting point .
I used to think Europe had got it right .
Let the US be a military superpower ; let China be an economic superpower - Europe would be the lifestyle superpower .
The days when European empires dominated the globe had gone .
But that was just fine .
Europe could still be the place with the most beautiful cities , the best food and wine , the richest cultural history , the longest holidays , the best football teams .
Life for most ordinary Europeans has never been more comfortable .
It was a great strategy .
But there was one big flaw in it .
Europe cannot afford its comfortable retirement .
Yes - but may I fine - tune the observation ?
First , Europe is not alone in enjoying an unaffordable lifestyle .
The United States cannot afford its lifestyle either , and its own reckoning on this score cannot be indefinitely delayed .
Also , what Gideon says may be true of ordinary Europeans ' ambitions , but not of their leaders ' .
This is the disconnect I 'm emphasizing .
Military and economic supremacy are collectivist aspirations - you need a strong sense of nationhood to give them meaning .
Europe could have the most beautiful cities , the best food and wine , the richest cultural history , and the longest holidays without having to turn its peoples into " Europeans " .
The admirable goal of leading the world in quality of life , rather than dominating it in military or economic terms , requires no political union , least of all if you value cultural diversity .
But Europe 's architects did want the union to be militarily powerful ; they did want to create an economic superpower ; unlike ordinary Europeans , they were not content with lifestyle success .
That is why they pressed on as they did .
And see how far they got : if this was timid leadership , show me the bold kind .
They were ambitious to a fault .
What they never bothered to secure was the underpinning popular commitment , and that is partly why the union is now in such trouble .
Previously , Europe 's governments have responded to stress on the union by trying to accelerate the pace of integration .
Do n't rule out the possibility that this will happen again .
In fact you could argue it already has .
The bail - out plan is a huge development in its own right , and the innovation cannot stop there .
Now there is talk of stronger central control of national budgets .
Voters wo n't like that .
But what do voters know ?
It 's not as though they 'll take to the streets ...

Lord Ashcroft , who put £ 5 m into marginal seats , is said to be furious with Cameron for doing TV debates and a lack of support over the ' non - dom ' status row
David Cameron was facing a growing backlash from his own MPs and party grandees today over the conduct of an election campaign that left him short of an overall majority and trying to make a deal with the Lib Dems .
The Observer can reveal that Lord Ashcroft , who pumped £ 5 m into marginal seats , is furious with the Tory leader for having agreed to take part in television debates that he believes undid much of his work for the party .
Friends of Ashcroft also say the peer is angry because he believes Cameron failed to stand up for him properly in the row over his " non-dom " tax status , which harmed the Tories in the run-up to the election .
Today , one senior frontbencher rounded on the Conservative leader , demanding that he sack key figures involved in the campaign , including the man who ran it , George Osborne , the shadow chancellor .
The frontbencher said : " He ran his campaign from the back of his Jaguar with a smug , smarmy little clique – people like Osborne , [ Oliver ] Letwin and Michael Gove .
He should get rid of all of them .
The party will settle for nothing less . "
Another senior and normally loyal Tory MP complained that Cameron 's big idea for the campaign – " the Big Society " , under which armies of volunteers would come together to tackle the country 's ills – was " complete crap " .
" We could n't sell that stuff on the doorstep .
It was pathetic .
All we needed was a simple message on policy .
We could have won a majority if we had not had to try to sell this nonsense . "
Cameron is certain to feel the wrath of his MPs at an emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of backbenchers tomorrow , called to discuss a possible coalition with the Lib Dems .
Today , Tim Montgomerie , the editor of the ConservativeHome website , posted a blog saying that Cameron had to adopt a more collegiate style of leadership if he was to have any chance of taking the party with him in talks on a possible deal with the Lib Dems .
For months , leading Tories have complained that the election strategy was being drawn up by a narrow group around the party leader , including Osborne , Letwin , Gove , Steve Hilton , his close adviser , and his communications chief , Andy Coulson .
Arguably the most damaging for Cameron is the tension with Ashcroft .
In the early hours of Friday morning , when a hung parliament had become inevitable , Ashcroft said the TV leaders ' debates had been a turning point .
" I think from the time the Conservatives were ahead , we then had the debates , which has quite obviously turned everything topsy - turvy and what were natural assumptions before those debates changed the whole of the playing field , " he said .
" This is the type of result we are now seeing as a consequence of those debates . "
Taking " a pure strategic hindsight view " he said there was a " balanced argument " over whether David Cameron should have taken part .
A friend of Ashcroft told the Observer that the peer held Cameron personally responsible for the emergence of Clegg as a genuine rival : " He believes it knocked several points off our poll ratings and that , without it , we would have won . "
And that ’s how the Hundred Years ’
War started .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Former child star Gary Coleman , who shot to fame on TV sitcom “ Diff ’rent Strokes ” but suffered personal troubles as an adult , died in a Utah hospital on Friday , after suffering a brain hemorrhage .
He was 42 .
Coleman gained stardom as the sharp - talking , adopted son Arnold Jackson of a wealthy New Yorker in the hit sitcom that aired on U.S. television from 1978 to 1986 and in syndication around the world .
His line , “ What you talkin ’ ‘ bout Willis ? ” when talking to his brother , became a pop culture catchphrase .
But when the show was taken off the air , Coleman saw his Hollywood star fade , and he found himself suffering through financial , legal and domestic problems .
“ We are very said to have to report Mr. Gary Coleman has passed away as of 12:05 p.m. mountain time , ” ( 6:05 gmt ) , his manager , John Alcantar , said in a statement .
Alcantar said Coleman was removed from life support , and “ he passed quickly and peacefully ” surrounded by his wife and other close family members .
The diminutive Coleman , who suffered from a congenital kidney disease that halted his growth , was hospitalized Wednesday night after suffering an intracranial hemorrhage at his home in Santaquin , Utah .
Media reports said he had fallen and hit his head .
On Thursday , he was conscious and lucid in the morning , but in the afternoon his condition worsened , he slipped into unconsciousness and was placed on life support at the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center , according to a statement issued on Friday by the hospital .

“ Gary is now at peace , and his memory will be kept in the hearts of those who were entertained by him throughout the years , ” Alcantar said .
SMALL BUT MIGHTY
Born February 8 , 1968 in Zion , Illinois , Coleman was an adopted son who suffered a condition known as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , an autoimmune disease that alters the kidneys .
As a result , Coleman stopped growing at a height of 4 ft. 8 in . and underwent two kidney transplants in his life .
But his size , coupled with his age , made him the perfect fit for the role of the funny , sassy and often emotional Arnold Jackson on “ Diff ’rent Strokes . ”
The show revolved around a 12 - year - old girl and her rich white father who adopted the two black sons of his housemaid after she died .
Arnold was 8 years - old and his brother Willis was 12 when they came to live with the Drummonds in an upscale Manhattan apartment .
Coleman ’s cute face and smart mouth -- he played the role of young Arnold when , in fact , he was roughly 10 to 18 years - old -- quickly put him at the center of the show .
He made millions of dollars from “ Diff ’rent Strokes ” and from guest appearances on TV talk shows and other programs .
U.S. cable television channel VH1 ranked him No. 1 among a list of “ 100 Greatest Kid Stars . ”

But Coleman never recaptured his fame after the show ended .
As an adult , much of his work went straight to video , and he became a symbol of faded Hollywood stardom .
In 1989 , he sued his parents and former manager for mishandling his finances , and for a time , he worked as a security guard .
In 2003 , he made a failed bid to become governor of California in a recall election that eventually saw Arnold Schwarzenegger become the chief executive of the state .
Coleman also suffered legal troubles .
In 1998 , he was charged with assault after hitting a woman who asked for his autograph in one of several instances of disorderly conduct .
Just this past January , he was arrested in Utah on a charge of domestic violence .
But he and his wife remained married .

In many households Yom Ha’atzmaut marks the beginning of the grilling season .
Throughout the country people are dusting off their grills , buying bags of charcoal and deciding whether to cook chicken , red meat or both for the festive menu .
Families familiar with the Turkish culinary heritage might be feasting this holiday on eggplant kebab .
This celebrated Turkish specialty is much more than grilled skewered eggplant .
You could describe it as a marriage of eggplant and meat .
I first tasted eggplant kebab at a restaurant in Gaziantep , a.k.a .
Antep , a city in southeast Turkey known for its superb lamb and excellent kebabs .
I watched the chef prepare eggplant kebab by alternating meatball - sized pieces of seasoned ground lamb with eggplant slices on skewers and carefully grilling them until the meat and eggplant were perfectly done .
He served the kebab the traditional way , on the skewer , accompanied by fresh flatbread .
The succulent meat flavored the eggplant , and the result was delicious .
Some cooks , like Binnur Tomay , author of , use beef instead of lamb .
Tomay skewers thick eggplant slices and beef meatballs and broils them , at the same time broiling tomato halves , pale green peppers and garlic cloves in a tray .
To serve the dish , she cuts the grilled meatballs , tomatoes and peppers in pieces , peels the eggplant and garlic and mixes all the elements together , then sprinkles the medley with olive oil , salt and crushed red pepper .
She recommends wrapping the mixture in a thin flatbread or spooning it into a pita .
Not all cooks serve eggplant kebabs directly from the grill .
In some kitchens , grilling the meat mixture and eggplant might be the first step in a more complex preparation .
They are then simmered in a pan with tomatoes and peppers to create a stew with a slight grilled flavor .
Some eggplant kebabs are not what we think of as kebabs ; in fact , they never see the grill at all .
Neset Eren , author of , makes eggplant kebabs from meat cubes sauteed with onions , then cooked with chopped tomatoes until tender .
The eggplant is separately sauteed , then topped with the cooked meat , green pepper rings and tomato slices and simmered together .
Tugrul Savkay , author of , presents an elaborate version of eggplant kebabs .
Here , too , the meat and vegetables do n’t go anywhere near the grill .
The lamb is sauteed with onions , and then simmered in an herb - flavored sauce .
The eggplant is cut in long , thin slices , deep fried and used to wrap the meat cubes , and this “ package ” is topped with tomato halves and baked .
With a growing interest in vegetarian cooking , you ’ll sometimes find eggplant kebab that is meatless .
For example , in Kybele Turkish Restaurant in Marietta , Georgia , the eggplant kebab is made from skewered marinated eggplant with portobello mushrooms , green peppers and tomatoes .
This marinade , flavored with ground coriander and cumin , goes well with chicken , meat and vegetables .
If you ’re preparing this dish at home rather than in the park , you might like to serve the eggplant and chicken with rice pilaf garnished with toasted almonds .
1.3 to 1.6 kg. chicken legs and thighs2 medium eggplants , cut in slices 6 mm .
thick6 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil21⁄2 tsp. ground coriander 21⁄2 tsp. ground cumin1 ⁄2 tsp. cayenne pepper1⁄4 tsp. salt2 Tbsp. grated onion
Put chicken on plate and eggplant slices in a tray .
Combine olive oil , coriander , cumin , cayenne and salt in a small bowl .
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the marinade over the eggplant slices and rub them into the eggplant .
Add onion to remaining marinade and pour it evenly over both sides of chicken .
Rub spice mixture into chicken .
Let chicken and eggplant stand at room temperature while heating coals or refrigerate up to 2 hours .
Set chicken and eggplant on a rack about 13 to 15 cm. above glowing coals .
Cover and grill eggplant for 7 or 8 minutes per side , and chicken about 15 to 18 minutes per side or until thickest part of meat near bone is no longer pink when cut .
Serve immediately .

Once we learned that the TSA was investing heavily to equip airports around the country with hundreds of new " full - body " scanners , also known as Advanced Imaging Technology , or AIT , machines , what news item did we know , sooner or later , was bound to appear ?
How about the flat - out judgment of the person in charge of airline security in Israel that the whole idea is preposterous and another illustration of easily - thwarted , Maginot Line - style , tech - heavy " security theater " thinking .
As this person , Rafi Sela , told Canadian authorities last week ( according to the Vancouver Sun ) :
In his own words :
" I do n't know why everybody is running to buy these expensive and useless machines .
I can overcome the body scanners with enough explosives to bring down a Boeing 747 , " Rafi Sela told parliamentarians probing the state of aviation safety in Canada .
" That 's why we have n't put them in our airport , " Sela said , referring to Tel Aviv 's Ben Gurion International Airport , which has some of the toughest security in the world .
Sela , former chief security officer of the Israel Airport Authority and a 30 - year veteran in airport security and defence technology , helped design the security at Ben Gurion .
So we face the timeless question of figuring out how to weigh competing claims .
On the one hand , we have " this will work ! " reassurances from an agency whose ability to make common - sense decisions we observe each time we go to the airport , backed by government contractors with a big new procurement order to defend -- and both of them arguing that this new technology will really solve a criminal / terrorist / human - network problem .
On the other hand , we have the guy in charge of Israel 's airport security , saying that reliance on machines is a mirage , that the real answer lies in intelligence and savvy , that capital - heavy , static tech solutions simply invite clever opponents to work around them , and so on .
And to boot , Mr. Security , Bruce Schneier , is on the same side .
TSA + defense contractor + security theater , vs Israeli expert +
Schneier + common sense .
Hmmm , I do n't know what to believe .
[ Updated at 1 p.m. : Tens of thousands of immigrant rights demonstrators rallied in downtown Los Angeles and across the country Saturday to protest a tough new anti-illegal immigration law in Arizona and stalled legislative reforms in Congress .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Cardinal Roger Mahony joined the crowd and were among the speakers at the rally .
The mayor took the stage to raucous cheers , taking a moment to groove to the live band on stage before addressing the crowd .
Speaking in English and Spanish , he called Los Angeles a bilingual city and expressed strong support for immigration reform .
Villaraigosa recounted the story of his grandfather who immigrated to the city in the early 1900s .
He drew loud cheers when he expressed support for the thousands of illegal immigrants who have documented children at war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Afterward , Mahony spoke , saying " everyone in God 's eyes is legal .
We are all standing with our immigrant brothers and sisters . " ]
The hearts and minds of many of the demonstrators were with their counterparts in Arizona .
Arizona lawmakers recently passed legislation that would allow police to check the legal status of people they suspect are illegal migrants .
Officials said the law , which takes effect this summer , was needed in part to safeguard against violent Mexican drug cartels .
One man in the crowd wore a white T - shirt with black block letters reading " Todos Somos Arizona " or " We are all Arizona . "
Another bobbed a sign over the crowd with a swastika scrawled in between the names of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who strongly supported the new law .
Union members blew horns and chanted " no human being is illegal " over the rhythmic melodies of a mariachi band .
The smell of bacon - wrapped hot dogs sizzling alongside onions and peppers on vendors ' hotplates wafted through the crowd .
The march is set to begin at 11 a.m .
Herlindo Ordonez , 40 , stood on the corner with his teenage daughter , their wrists buckled to jail bars with yellow chains .
A sign on the bars read " SB 1070 . "
The concerns over the oil leaking from the BP well in the Gulf are increasingly focusing on the amount of oil that is still leaking from the well , and the overall rate at which the well has been producing oil and gas in the past .
It is now possible to view the site where the riser insertion tube ( RIT ) is drawing oil from the well .
Clearly there is still a considerable amount of gas and oil escaping into the sea , despite BP now drawing some 5,000 bd up through the RIT .
This has led BP to recognize that the spill is larger than had originally been estimated .
( Note that there are live feeds from Senator Nelson ’s office and the House , both of which can be overloaded with demand .
( They were when I just tried to get an illustrative frame . )
This , instead , is a shot from a video of the remaining leak that is just above the BOP , and that is not currently addressed , but should also be stopped when the well is killed .
Part of the problem remains in the complexity of the flow of an expanding gas in oil , coming out into an unconfined ( apart from the sea pressure ) space .
Estimates of the flow have ranged up to 100,000 bd .
At the moment the evaluation is relying largely on either visual evaluations , or relatively crude analysis , albeit with sophisticated systems , based on estimated behaviors of the flow volumes .
Whether the flow has , as BP have stated , been significantly reduced by the riser insertion tube ( RIT ) tap , or whether the current tap has had little significant effect is largely , at present , left up to individual judgment without measurements of the actual flows .
Unfortunately useful real information is not being provided in quite the open and transparent way that BP and the Unified Command had originally promised .
And , having watched the video of the flow intermittently this afternoon , it largely depended on where the ROV had positioned the camera as to how much gas was visible in the plume .
Since BP are the ones getting much of the data , it is therefore not surprising that the Federal Government is beginning to lose patience with them over this situation .
It may be , as BP have stated , that a higher proportion of the flow is natural gas , and that this distorts the evaluation at the mouth of the riser .
However it is possible , based on other available measurements , including those established using the gamma ray survey equipment from Sandia , to get a ball - park estimate of the flow upstream of the riser end .
It is disappointing that BP has chosen not to make that information public .
Public anger at BP is continuing to build .
The arrival of oil , both as crude and emulsion in the Gulf Shores is going to become significantly worse in the short term , and questions will likely turn to how this oil was able to circumvent the booms that have been put in place to contain it .
At the last count the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command lists the following efforts to stop the oil reaching the shore :
• Personnel were quickly deployed and more than 24,000 are currently responding to protect the shoreline and wildlife .
• More than 1,000 vessels are responding on site , including skimmers , tugs , barges , and recovery vessels to assist in containment and cleanup efforts — in addition to dozens of aircraft , remotely operated vehicles , and multiple mobile offshore drilling units .
• More than 1.43 million feet of containment boom and 560,000 feet of sorbent boom have been deployed to contain the spill — and approximately 370,000 feet of containment boom and 1.28 million feet of sorbent boom are available .
• Approximately 8.3 million gallons of an oil - water mix have been recovered .
• Approximately 655,000 gallons of total dispersant have been deployed — 600,000 on the surface and 55,000 subsea .
More than 340,000 gallons are available .
17 staging areas are in place and ready to protect sensitive shorelines , including : Dauphin Island , Ala. , Orange Beach , Ala. , Theodore , Ala. , Panama City , Fla. , Pensacola , Fla. , Port St. Joe , Fla. , St. Marks , Fla. , Amelia , La. , Cocodrie , La. , Grand Isle , La. , Shell Beach , La. , Slidell , La. , St. Mary , La. ; Venice , La. , Biloxi , Miss. , Pascagoula , Miss. , and Pass Christian , Miss .
It is perhaps a little surprising , seeing this effort , that the oil has been able to bypass the barriers and to come ashore in the volumes that are being reported .
Regardless of the outcome of the top kill try that will likely take place this weekend , the oil that has been released will be the center of public attention for the next few weeks .
Public concern has already led EPA to change their mind over the use of the dispersant Corexit 9500 being injected into the flow underwater .
( A selection previously approved by EPA , after testing both on the surface and with undersea release . )
But if the kill works this weekend , that concern will go away , while the concerns over the quantity of the oil released and its effects on the beaches and marshes will become more of the headline .

Sushi Rice , the Secret Behind Delicious Sushi
I am finally delivering on my promise to talk about seasoned vinegar ( sushi - su ) and sushi rice ( sumeshi ) .
Sushi rice , or rice dressed with a seasoned vinegar , is an essential component of a variety of sushi dishes .
In fact , sushi would n’t be sushi without this rice .
If you are serving slices of fresh uncooked fish without any sushi rice , you are serving sashimi !
My experience is that semi-decent sushi can be ruined by bad sushi rice .
If you can make good sushi rice , there is no reason why you ca n’t make delicious sushi at home !
Sushi Rice Tips & Tricks
Use polished ( white ) short - grain Japanese rice ( japonica ) or medium - grain California rice .
These types of rice are often labeled as sushi rice or Calrose rice at the store here in the US .

Wash your rice to get rid of the starchy powder that clings to the grains .
This starchy powder will prevent proper absorption of the sushi- su and give you less than perfect rice .
To wash rice , place your measured rice into a bowl and cover it with fresh cold water .
Use your hand to swish and stir the rice around and then carefully drain the water ( I use a fine - mesh strainer to do this ) .
Repeat this process until the water runs clear .

Repeat this process until the water runs clear .
If you eat a lot of rice , a rice cooker is a wonderful investment because it eliminates timing problems , makes perfect rice , and many cookers offer a warming function that keeps rice fresh ahd warm for 24 hours .
My favorite that I ’ve personally used is Zojirushi ’s Neuro Fuzzy Logic .
But again , it ’s an investment !
It is best to mix the seasoned vinegar with the cooked rice in a sushi- oke or an unvarnished wooden bowl , but you can also use a wide shallow glass or ceramic bowl .
I use a wide shallow glass mixing bowl , because that is what I have on hand .
Do not , however , use an aluminum bowl , as this type of bowl will retain heat differently and give the rice a metallic taste .
Prepared sushi rice should be stored at cool room temperature , covered with a moist cloth or plastic wrap .
It will keep this way for up to 12 hours .
Do not refrigerate it or freeze it , as this destroys the texture .
How to Make Sushi-su ( Seasoned Vinegar for Sushi Rice )
There are many recipes for sushi-su ( seasoned vinegar ) , but all use the same basic components : rice vinegar , sugar , and salt .
Some recipes also through in a small piece of kombu , which adds more depth of flavor , but this is optional .
I prefer my sushi-su to be not as sweet as some .
Once you make your own , you can adjust the sugar to suit your personal taste !
This recipe makes 1 cup of sushi-su .
I like to make extra sushi- su so that I can use it as a salad dressing ( you can add some sesame or olive oil , but I like it without ) .
It is delicious tossed with baby arugula and then sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds .
The sushi-su to rice proportions that I like to use are :
3 cups cooked rice : use 1/4 – 1/3 cup sushi-su
4 cups cooked rice : use 1/2 – 2/3 cup sushi-su
5 cups cooked rice : use 2/3 – 1 cup sushi-su
Print This Recipe Sushi-Su ( Seasoned Vinegar for Sushi Rice ) 1 cup rice vinegar
3 tablespoons sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 piece kombu , 2 - inches square ( optional ) Combine the vinegar , sugar , salt , and kombu in a small saucepan .
Place the saucepan over medium - high heat and cook , stirring until the sugar and salt dissolve .
When the mixture is clear , remove the saucepan from the heat and set it aside to cool .
Discard the piece of kombu .
Sushi- su can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month .
How to Make Sushi Rice 1 .
Transfer the freshly cooked hot rice to a wide shallow bowl .
Pour a small amount of the sushi- su evenly over the rice .
Toss the rice by gently cutting into it vertically with your rice paddle ( or spatula ) , and then lifting the rice and turning it over .
As you do this , fan the rice with a hand fan or piece of cardboard ( or get someone to help you ) .
Add more of the sushi-su and continue the cutting , folding , and fanning process .
Fanning the rice facilitates quick cooling , which gelatinizes the surface of the rice and gives a glossy finish to the rice .
Towards the end , taste the rice occasionally to decide how much of you sushi- su you want to add .
2 . Cover the seasoned rice with a moist cloth or plastic wrap until ready to use .
Now that you ’ve got delicious sushi rice , you can start making sushi !

( Mashable ) --
It was speculative before given the lack of independent confirmation , but now apparently Apple has gone on record to confirm that the original deal signed with AT&T for iPhone exclusivity back in 2007 was a five - year deal .
That means at least some legal hoops would need jumping through if we 're ever going to see that oft - rumored Verizon iPhone before 2012 .
Engadget reports that court documents filed by Apple in a California class - action suit confirm the original AT&T exclusivity deal had a five - year duration .
The suit , ongoing since 2007 , claims that Apple and AT&T were exerting a monopoly over iPhone service by surreptitiously locking iPhone buyers into renewing contracts with AT&T once their initial two years was up .
On the flip side , there are a number of reasons such a contract might be amended or canceled , so it 's not exactly a total given that the iPhone wo n't appear on another carrier before 2012 .
But given the original terms , it could require some tricky negotiation or legal fancy footwork to get there .
Moreover , the class - action suit also alleges an illegal monopoly over the iPhone App Store , which the court ruled substantial enough to move forward .
On both fronts then -- consumer market and legal proceedings -- it will be fascinating to watch for further details on when the AT&T iPhone exclusivity curtain might drop or even be forcibly struck down .
Do you think we 'll see the iPhone come to another carrier before 2012 ?

Regular readers will know that Acer 's been planning ereaders and tablets for some time , but the Dubai - based Shufflegazine saw Acer 's CEO fondling what looks like an ereader ( check out the QWERTY keypad ) — despite him calling it an Android - powered tablet .

According to Shufflegazine , CEO Gianfranco Lanci said the tablet measured 7 - inches , has a color screen , and would go on sale sometime in the fourth quarter of 2010 .
A 3G connection is possible , and Shufflegazine noted that " it looked pretty fast with sensitive touch . "

Browsing through the press pack , Shufflegazine also saw some further details on the LumiRead ereader which we 've known is coming for some time .
It 'll have a monochrome 6 - inch screen , 2GB of memory , a microSD card slot , and a QWERTY keypad just like that mysterious tablet .
Pretty puzzling stuff .
If Acer really does want to make an " iPad rival , " then the addition of a QWERTY keypad is ( for me ) a great idea .
But really , when it looks like an ereader and has a keypad , is it still a tablet ?

We live in a highly litigious country .
So when a Boston jury awarded $ 1.5 million to a Malden man who injured his fingers on a saw I was n’t terribly surprised .
What did surprise me was that this case was actually the first to claim that the standard design of American table saws is defective .
Really ?
Defective ?
That ’s an awfully strong word .
Everyone likes the idea of a safer table saw , but mandating it is another thing .

Table Saw Lawsuit Case History
The case began several years ago when Carlos Osorio cut off and injured several of his fingers while installing oak floors .
Carlos accused One World Technologies Inc. , a subsidiary of TTI and maker of Ryobi saws , of “ negligence for failing to include a flesh detection technology that would prevent most serious injuries ” .
The complaint was initially filed in 2006 in US District Court in Boston .
The problem with the complaint of course is that it presumes there was something wrong with the table saw and that the product could have been designed better , in 2006 , so as to prevent injuries .
Now , it ’s important to note that there is a vast difference between claiming that a tool is defective and lamenting the lack of a particular safety feature that could prevent accidents due to negligence .
This is where we depart with , in our opinion , an over - exuberant and out of control Court system .
Why We Think a Safer Table Saw May Not Be Good for America
There are a few reasons for our up - front disagreement :
Ruling that a product should have a feature for which it was not designed means , presumably , that every car accident victim in America should now be able to retroactively sue for any vehicle not in possession of anti-lock brakes .
Ryobi would suddenly become a high - end tool company – not because the quality of their tools would suddenly target professionals , but because it would now be impossible to manufacture an inexpensive saw geared towards the casual user due to increased parts costs .
Table saws would become a high - end product and the elimination of entry level models would mean greater danger for those who would substitute the wrong tool for jobs that require it .
Why stop at table saws ?
Every tool manufactured with a blade must now have this new technology or face being labeled in the future as “ unsafe ” and “ defective ” .
SUPPORT OUR ADVERTISERS
Room for Compassion and Common Sense
While it ’s lamentable that two of Carlos Osorio ’s fingers are permanently disfigured and unusable , and he has suffered numbness and loss of feeling in three other fingers , the bottom line is that his accident was not caused by a defective tool .
If it was then the tool would have malfunctioned against its original design , not some imaginary design parameter that he felt it should have had .
Anyone who has followed this legal drama realizes that the driving force behind it is the owner and manufacturer of SawStop , a technology company that invented a table saw tech that senses capacitance of a finger and immediately stops the blade .
They have been active in mandating this technology across all table saws .
The problem , of course , is that they are n’t doing this out of goodwill – they want to license it and make a fortune .
Quite simply , SawStop wants to legislate itself into millions .
Consumer Burdens and Product Availability
Verdicts like this are irresponsible and place an unnecessary burden on the consumer , artificially change the marketplace , and have rippling effects that go far beyond the apparent short - sightedness of judges and juries who appear to not understand the ramifications of their actions .
One World Technologies said it had been advised of the verdict and their spokesman , Jason Swanson , had this to say : “ We are evaluating the results with our lawyers , and evaluating how to proceed .
Notwithstanding the outcome of this trial and any possible appeal , we remain confident that the saw which was the subject of this lawsuit was well - designed and manufactured with all due consideration for the needs and safety of the consumer . ”
Over 50 Lawsuits Pending
To make it plan how serious these efforts are , there are over 50 lawsuits pending throughout the United States against the major table saw manufacturers for failure to adopt the SawStop technology .
No one is questioning whether or not the advanced technology works .
What is being questioned , with only mild success , is whether the SawStop technology should be able to be mandated .
If the answer to that question is “ yes ” then expect the cost of power tools to go up significantly as the legal system involves itself in a level of corporate intrusion that has n’t been seen in years .
Editor ’s Note :
This year ( 2010 ) UL changed its requirements for approval of table saws to include several new features including a riving knife and other safety features to help prevent accidents .
It ’s not that we do n’t want a safer table saw , but if the judiciary is going to insist that table saws necessarily include additional safety features , then those features should be made possible without having to pay a single company ( SawStop ) expensive , proprietary licensing fees .
We also feel that further research should be undertaken by independent professionals and disagree that any of this represents a “ defective ” current technology .
Conclusion
Considering that Carlos ’ fingers should never have been anywhere near the blade , this lawsuit — and others like it — should never have seen the light of day .
Construction professionals , journeymen , and homeowners should prepare for the onslaught because if this ruling represents the tip of the iceberg , there is no telling where this judicial intrusion will end .
This could make the McDonald ’s “ defective ” hot coffee incident seem like child ’s play .

Waking Up to Genocide
From Gilbert Gatore , The Past Ahead , translated by Marjolijn de Jager from the French .
She remembers the morning when everything began , she is now certain of that .
That morning is set firmly in a niche of her head .
Every now and then she likes to take it out , the way you unfold an old garment to air it out , consider its wear and tear and its obsolescence .
Almost indifferent , she sees it unfurl again , as precisely as possible .
It ’s a typical morning .
A strident ringing wakes her .
Seven o’clock .
A few minutes later , she gets up , slowly .
She puts on the kettle and lights a cigarette .
She takes a shower .
She gets dressed after spending a minute , dazed , in front of her closet .
She has cereal and drinks tea .
She gathers up the things she needs for her classes and goes off to catch the 8:10 train .
A typical day also means that she puts on make - up before leaving , while the small apartment whose window she has opened fills up with fresh air from outside , and that she turns off the clock - radio whose sound has been her companion since seven o’clock .
Usually , nothing of the flow of news , weather reports , commercials , and songs reaches her foggy consciousness .
Just like her yawns , the shower water , or the tea , the radio is only a means of stimulating her sleepy senses .
As she remembers it she is alone that morning .
The other one had n’t inflicted himself on her for the night .
Before picking up her briefcase she makes sure she has everything she needs .
She was about to leave the report she ’d prepared for the marketing strategies course behind on her desk .
She congratulates herself on her habit of checking everything before going out .
How does an involuntary action manage to slip into the automatic physical functions ?
When she turns off the radio before leaving , she raises the volume she intended to turn down until it clicks , indicating it ’s off .
As unbelievable as it may seem , it ’s because she increased the volume instead of turning it off that she is now here .
Everything else flowed from that gesture .
She remembers exactly how violently the sound burst forth .
She wonders whether it ’s possible that the sound never left her ears from the day that she ’s now visiting in her thoughts .
Besides , where does the sound go that we hear ?
Where do the dead go once we ’ve heard them ?
That morning the radio shouted at her that , in a country of which the mere mention froze her with anxiety , the number of prisoners was such that , at the speed with which the verdicts were pronounced , it would take two or three centuries to examine each of the cases .
More softly now that she ’d turned the volume down , the reporter quoted the percentage of the incarcerated population in proportion to the population of the country itself .
He was talking about her native land .

Kristol :
There 's room in the GOP for Rand Paul
Bill Kristol , editor in chief of the Weekly Standard and a contributor to The Post , was one of the national security hawks contacted in March by allies of Trey Grayson with a warning about Rand Paul .
" On foreign policy , [ global war on terror ] , Gitmo , Afghanistan , Rand Paul is NOT one of us , " wrote Cesar Conda , a former aide to Dick Cheney , to Kristol and to other conservatives .
Now that Paul is the GOP 's nominee in Kentucky , what does Kristol think of him ?
" Paul ran a good campaign , " Kristol said .
" He did a good job of being less like his dad -- seeming less ' out there ' -- so if you were a normal Kentucky voter you thought you were voting for a Sarah Palin - like , anti-Washington figure , not someone who bought into the whole Ron Paul agenda . "
Would Kristol welcome Rand Paul into the GOP fold ?
" It 's a big Senate , " said Kristol , laughing .
" It 'll be a bigger Republican caucus next year .
There 'll be room for him .
It 's a very small price to pay for a very helpful and hopeful upsurge of tea party , anti-establishment feeling . "
And is it better to have Ron Paul 's supporters working inside the GOP , even if it means they can knock off candidates supported by Cheney , Conda , et al ?
" Was it better for the Democrats to have the MoveOn people join them ?
Yes , obviously .
People like me were disgusted by them , and they did some things that were disgusting , like the General Petraeus ad .
At the end of the day , in American politics , you can't have a big , energetic grass - roots movement without having a lot of elements of it that you 're not going to personally like or agree with .
But to be fair to Rand Paul , there 's a lot of distance between Rand Paul 's agenda , which is n't exactly mine , and the caricature of nativism or isolationism . "
Among the enduring images left by car bombings , overseas or in the United States , is investigators on their hands and knees , crawling through the wreckage searching for clues : a blasting cap or a timing device , a piece of the explosive ’s casing or a trace of the chemicals used .
Car bombs , by design , do their best to devour any evidence of their existence , or send it flying .
On Saturday in Times Square , a homemade bomb built inside a Nissan Pathfinder did not explode — and as a result , a trove of evidence was left behind for investigators to pore over , not only for physical evidence or forensic clues , but also as a reflection of an assailant ’s methods , mind - set and possible motives .
“ There is a lot there to read into the case that really helps them , ” said James M. Cavanaugh , a former bomb expert with the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives who investigated car bombs and tracked the Unabomber , Theodore J. Kaczynski , and Eric R. Rudolph , the bomber of abortion clinics and other sites .
Or , put another way by Kevin B. Barry , who retired in 2002 as a detective in the bomb squad of the New York Police Department and is now an official with the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators : “ He was trying to cover his tracks , but he left more clues than a guy walking into a bank to rob it without a mask .
This guy left everything here but his wallet . ”

I ca n’t help feeling that this is highly relevant to us today where the world seems shrunk to the size of a small island in the vast ocean of space .
How could the islanders so knowingly have destroyed the life - blood of their island and their own future ?
How do you imagine the Easter Islanders behaved in those last few years before the last tree was felled ?
In fact , the question can be asked more broadly : “ What were the thought processes and discussions amongst the inhabitants of Easter Island leading up to the removal of the last remnants of forest ? ”
This could be seen , perhaps , as a hypothetical exploration , rooted in a real historical event , of “ the psychology of resource depletion denial . ”
For a several years , I have been intrigued by this question which Jared Diamond asks us to consider in his book ‘ Collapse ’ .
This is a case study in which you are invited to answer the question , “ What did the Easter Islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it ? ”
For some of the rationalisations , we probably do n’t need to look any further than our local talkback radio , the proceedings of the Copenhagen convention or the comments section on any mainstream media opinion piece about Peak Oil or Climate Change , but there would certainly have been powerful idiosyncratic religious beliefs at play too .
Setting the Scene :
Easter Island is a small triangular island of 66 sq miles in the sub-tropical South East Pacific Ocean over 1000 miles from anywhere and consisting of 3 linked extinct volcanoes .
It was first settled by Polynesians who migrated there from the nearest Pacific Islands to the west , sometime between 400 AD and 900 AD .
When they arrived bringing their traditional Polynesian vegetables the island was covered in a variety of large and smaller species of trees and in particular a very large species of palm tree with edible nuts and a wide girth , seals and many species of sea birds which nested there free from predators ( incidentally rats which played an important role in the deforestation by eating seeds and nuts ) .
There were no permanent creeks and the soil and climate were relatively unfavourable compared with many other Pacific Islands for a number of reasons , but at first it must have seemed wonderfully bountiful .
The population grew and 12 tribes became established , with the island divided up like a pizza in the traditional Polynesian way .
Most significantly , there was no one supreme chief - - instead each tribe vied for status with one other .
For the most part , this was probably fairly harmonious with considerable cooperation between the tribes probably mediated by a counsel of the chiefs of the 12 tribes such as we see elsewhere but with intermittent power and territorial struggles ( this absence of a single controlling chief may have played a big part in the disasters which followed ) .
The settlers brought with them their traditional Polynesian religious beliefs regarding deification of ancestors transmogrified into gods of fertility and bounty personified in the shape of stone statues -- carved , transported and placed on impressive stone platforms near the beach around the coast in each tribe ’s territory .
Elsewhere in Polynesia though , the statues tend to be small .
Presumably , as the statues represented the power of the chiefs and their link to the supernatural and hence the future prosperity of the tribe , there developed intense competition between the tribes to see who could have the most statues and the largest statues and hence the most prestige and glory .
The key village of each tribe was located near to the beach and the statues were arranged in a row between the village and the sea .
I had always imagined that they faced outwards towards the sea but recently learned that they actually faced inwards towards the village .
Nearly all of the statues came from one quarry of ideal stone near the middle of the island .
The statues had to be carved out of the rock using harder stone tools then transported down to the coast and then somehow erected on the platforms .
( The large reddish cylindrical hats which can be seen on some statues came from another quarry . )
This transportation was an extraordinary feat and could only be performed using vast numbers of wooden rollers , sledges and levers , not to mention the incredible number of man hours per statue .
The capacity of the island to provide a relatively easy living ( what we would call the EROEI ) so as to free up so many workers for seemingly non-productive activity must have been considerable .
But over the centuries , this non-productive use of the forests , combined with increased need for timber due to population growth , would have gradually resulted in progressive deforestation , loss of habitat for a variety of edible plants , birds and animals , loss of protection from sun and wind , loss of fire wood and erosion of soil .
Natural reseeding would have been inhibited by a plentiful supply of seed - eating rats which had few natural enemies on the island ( probably only humans and birds of prey ) .
The phenomenon of ‘ creeping normalcy ’ may have prevented anyone from noticing this decline for a few centuries - especially as the early statues were comparatively small and would have consumed the forests at a relatively modest rate .
But as the forests shrunk in area and the annual percentage rate of depletion steadily increased , at some point , someone must have realised that the situation was not sustainable and said as much .
The island is not that big and what was happening at one end would have been common knowledge at the other end .
By around the year 1600 , the last tree was chopped down and there were no more until they were reintroduced by Europeans many years later .
Some time before the last tree was cut down - perhaps this was done in a moment of spite , desperation , anger or vengeance - the society collapsed into mass starvation , war and cannibalism .
What might have happened in the lead up ?
One can imagine between 1400 and 1500 , some of the people muttering about the loss of forest and predicting that “.. at the current rate it will all be gone in a generation or two . ”
How did the chiefs react to this prediction ?
Did they have a ‘ Forest Change ’ summit ?
Was it on the agenda of one of their regular meetings and at what percentage of depletion from the original virgin forest did this occur ?
50 % ? 70 % ? 90 % ?
Where the first whistleblowers listened to or ridiculed or punished ?
Perhaps at first they were ridiculed as eccentrics then if they persisted .
Perhaps they were seen as a genuine threat to the establishment and eaten as human sacrifice ( with the priests getting first pick of the good bits ) as was the order of the day .
This would have kept the doomsters quiet for a while though many may have continued to secretly harbour fears for the long - term sustainability of the forest .
There would have been powerful forces opposed to the expression of such heretical ideas .
The power of the chiefs , the priestly caste and the gods / ancestors was integrated both practically and theologically ( as we see in most societies ) .
There is a kind of unassailable philosophy which says that the hereditary rights and powers of the chiefs are the manifestation on Earth of the Will of the Gods .
The ancestors of the chiefs ( i.e. dead chiefs ) take on god - like powers .
The role of the gods is to ensure the ongoing health , fertility and prosperity of the people and the ongoing bountifulness of the land and sea .
The priests interpret ‘ The Will of the Gods ’ which somehow always favours the centralisation of power with the chiefs and the priests .
The statue of the chief becomes one of the key physical manifestations of this power .
This all works very well with the people and the king ’s security service remaining loyal and willing to provide tithes of goods and services to the king and his retinue in return for their ongoing guaranteed prosperity .
But this kind of system can easily initiate a competitive positive feedback loop in which each chief attempts to outdo his rival chiefs in creating the biggest and the best statue in his own honour ( the gods have confirmed in each case that this is their wish ) .
Unfortunately the gods can be fickle too and sometimes , in spite of all the standard observances , prayers , ritual , human sacrifices and statue building , the tribes will go through a bad patch in which the fish disappear , the sea birds do n’t nest , the rain does n’t arrive , pests or diseases damage the root crops or other mysterious and inexplicable bad things ( like cyclones or tsunami ) happen .
When this happens the loyalty of the people and their faith in the system can be sorely tested so that the chief will need to respond to the crisis in some way .
One way is to accuse some already unpopular people of witchcraft , blasphemy , giving out bad vibes / negative energy etc to deliberately cause the bad weather events - in other words a scapegoat .
These offenders might also coincidentally be the very persons who had been advocating the building of smaller statures in order to avoid cutting down so many trees .
Another response apart from ruthlessly suppressing all dissent is to logically argue that the gods must be displeased because the statues are n’t big enough and a nervous chief , worried about his shrinking powerbase will commission the production of an even bigger statue just to confirm his piety and majesty .
In spite of all this the Establishment themselves must at some point have started to notice the bleeding obvious , namely that the forest was nearly gone and that they would have to discuss how best to avoid losing the remaining bits of forest .
So what happened next ?
Why did n’t a workable plan emerge and get implemented ?
If it did what went wrong ?
Can we blame it all on tribalism and ‘ The Tragedy of the Commons ’ ?
We know the final outcome , but what was the path to that outcome and are we treading that same path again ?
It would have been wonderful to have had a written historical record of the details but in its absence , it what do you imagine happened ?
MEXICO CITY — Mexican authorities scrambled over the weekend to locate Diego Fernández de Cevallos , a former presidential candidate and wealthy lawyer whose disappearance is the most high profile apparent kidnapping since President Felipe Calderón began his war on drugs in 2006 .
Mr. Fernández , who ran for president with the National Action Party , or PAN , in 1994 , disappeared Friday night in the central state of Querétaro , officials from the attorney general 's office said .

In this picture made available by the Icelandic Coastguard , taken Wednesday April 14 , 2010 , smoke and steam rises from the volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in Iceland , which erupted for the second time in less than a month , melting ice , shooting smoke and steam into the air and forcing hundreds of people to flee rising floodwaters .
Authorities evacuated 800 residents from around the glacier as rivers rose by up to 10 feet ( 3 meters ) .
Emergency officials and scientists said the eruption under the ice cap was 10 to 20 times more powerful than one last month , and carried a much greater risk of widespread flooding .

Top Gear Toyota Hilux Volcano Pictures
Showcasing pictures from Top Gear when they went up the Eyjafjallajökull in a Toyota Hilux .
Little did they know the active volcano would cause so much European travel havoc .
Luckily , the Top Gear cast and crew escaped just hours before the volcano erupted .
Finally a bit of good PR for Toyota .
As cool cars go , the Toyota Hilux remains truely one of the most resilient around !
By modifying the same Toyota Hilux they took to the north pole with water - cooled tires and a roof - mounted ash - guard , the Top Gear team just scaled an active Volcano in Iceland for an upcoming episode .
“ They never take risk ! ” said an Icelandic Volcano expert who traveled with the crew as an adviser .
Like all other episodes , this one appears to have been carefully planned , with full permission from the Icelandic government .
In addition to volcanoes and a collapsed economy , Iceland is known for its ridiculously epic off - roading so we expect the episode to be insanely awesome and heroic .
I took the day off yesterday , to calm down and clear my head .
Stayed off twitter and visited NM for the briefest of moments .
Unlike some who felt the need to rage , vent , bitch or moan I needed some peace and quiet .
Away from the noise and negativity to just think about the whole thing .
Is this team really capable of pulling this off ?
I do n't think there was anyone who was n't crushed by the way the Canucks handed the two games to the Hawks at GM Place .
Despite playing a style that not only was effective all season when they played it , including against Chicago , they played right into their hands , embarrassingly so .
And now elimination day arrives , earlier than most thought .
The majority of the media have written us off .
Many fans have too .
Just look at yesterday 's poll .
That ' B ' word is being tossed around a lot .
Is that fair though ?
More after the jump ...
Before the playoffs began I wrote a controversial post , in which I said I had doubts that the Canucks could go all the way .
I said there were elements of their game that had crept back in that made me unsure of their ability to advance , and unless they showed me different , I was n't likely to change my mind .
The way the team recovered in the Los Angeles series did in fact do this .
And after storming the Hawks in game 1 , I felt as though I had been wrong .
This really was a team that could play with the elites , and while it was going to be a long and hard fought series , the Canucks could triumph in the end .
Game 2 loss ?
Not a concern , a split was what we all hoped for , sure it was disappointing to lose the lead , but hey ... lots of hockey to be played , right ?
It 's not even so much that they lost these last two games , it 's the way they lost them .
They are playing selfish , scattered hockey .
There are no leaders .
No signs from the bench that would give us any reason to hope .
Have we been royally fucked over by the officiating in this series ?
Without a doubt .
When Ron Maclean can't defend it , you know it 's bad .
The real issue is that the Canucks allowed themselves to be the victims , playing right into Chicago 's hands through actions on and off the ice .
The taunting , the lack of composure , some world class dives ... it all played out in Chicago 's favour and they embarrassed us on home ice .
The question being asked of Canucks fans now is , do you believe ?
Are you a fan or a bandwagoner ?
I ask you this :
What have they shown since 10 minutes into the first period of game 2 that should be any cause for hope ?
Can you tell me what exactly I am supposed to believe in ?
Do I want them to win ?
Always .
I live and die with this team .
Problem is , this is an all too familiar refrain .
Is this team like last year 's and so many years before , that simply could n't get the job done ?
Or do they have even a glimmer of the spirit of the 1994 team , that stormed back from 3 - 1 to win 3 straight , all in overtime no less .
From a coaching staff that has been outfoxed to the point of embarrassment , to a group of players whose brightest and best have been pathetic no shows , I am struggling to find anything to believe about here .
Don Cherry last night said Kyle Wellwood was the Canucks ' best player right now .
He may be right .
No stupid penalties .
No quit .
Just effort , every shift .
This team is doomed unless this changes tonight .
The Sedins and Alex Burrows must be a threat every time they 're on the ice .
Ryan Kesler and Mason Raymond must combine with who ever they get as a linemate to provide an effective , speedy second line .
The grunts must take a page from Kyle Wellwood and work hard every shift .
And most importantly , Roberto Luongo has to be the best player on the ice .
If he gives anything less than his best performance of the season , it may not be enough to stem the tide .
The Hawks smell blood and going in for the kill .
Is this the end ?
Well , there 's a reason they still play the games .
But my heart , crushed on so many occasions by this team is wary .
Either they battle back and prove everyone wrong , or they become the butt of jokes once again .
I really do n't know what will happen .
All I ask is if they 're gonna go out , the Hawks have to earn it .
The last couple games have been so easy for them .
They have n't earned this .
If we must fall then let them leave beaten and bloodied .
For one game , give them hell .
If we can win , then take this and build on it .
you want us to ' Believe In Blue ' ?
Make us believe .
This could be the last game for the Canucks tonight .
But if you 're gonna die , die with your boots on .
Another Prophet of Disaster
Who says the ship is lost ,
Another Prophet of Disaster
Leaving you to count the cost .
Taunting us with Visions ,
Afflicting us with fear ,
Predicting War for millions ,
In the hope that one appears .
No point asking when it is ,
No point asking who's to go ,
No point asking what 's the game ,
No point asking who's to blame ,
' Cos if you 're gonna die , if you 're gonna die ,
' Cos if you 're gonna die , if you 're gonna die ,
If you 're gonna die , die with your boots on ,
If you 're gonna try , just stick around ,
Gonna cry , just move along ,
If you 're gonna die , if you 're gonna die .
In 13 the Beast is Rising ,
The Frenchman did surmise ,
Through earthquakes and starvation ,
The Warlord will arise ,
Terror , Death , Destruction ,
Pour from the Eastern sands ,
But the truth of all predictions ,
Is always in your hands .
If you 're gonna die , die with your boots on ,
If you 're gonna try , just stick around ,
Gonna cry , just move along ,
If you 're gonna die , if you 're gonna die .
Scum removal
And just like that , the Detroit Red Wings are gone .
All this talk of choking on the part of the San Jose Sharks is put to rest
as they sealed the deal last night .
And it was Joe Thornton who led them .
In a way , we really should n't be
surprised .
Every dog has his day they say , and Thornton is simply too talented to continually no show in the
post season .
Detroit in the end was not strong enough , and despite Nabokov looking shaky all series , they did n't
have the goaltending they needed from rookie Jimmy Howard .
The Sharks now await the winner of this series , either they know soon or are in for a long wait .
While there 's
still lots of hockey to be played , the San Jose Sharks certainly look like a team that can go all the way .
The Penguins are one game away from moving to the Eastern Conference finals .
Another solid game from
Marc -Andre Fleury propelled them to a 2 - 1 victory in game 5 .
They can eliminate Montreal tomorrow night
at the Bell Center .
I have a feeling that this magical Habs run is coming to a close .
In Largest Science Experiment Ever , Three Spacecraft Will Swap Laser Fire Across 3 Million Miles
The NASA / ESA LISA project aims to measure gravitational waves with giant lasers and free - falling cubes of gold
-- Carey Price was summoned as the starter for Wednesday ’s Game 4 , entrusted with saving Montreal from falling into an almost - insurmountable hole against the top- seeded Washington Capitals
For two periods , Price was delivering on that tall order after Jaroslav Halak , the team ’s No. 1 goalie , proved incapable of blunting the Capitals ’ high - powered attack during the past two losses .
Price stopped eight of the nine shots he faced in the first period , then stopped the first eight he faced in the second as his team took a one - goal lead .
But he could not stop the last shot of the period -- a Mike Knuble dunk on a shorthanded rush with just 6.3 seconds left that changed the whole complexion of the game .
Price then yielded two third - period goals ( on 18 shots ) to a rejuvenated Capitals team .
The Capitals also had two empty - net goals for a 6 - 3 victory that gives Washington a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the best - of - 7 series .
Price finished with 32 saves in his first playoff start since a loss to Boston in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals last year .
A do - or - die Game 5 is Friday night at the Verizon Center .
Price talked about his performance , the shorthanded goal that changed the game -- and the two unsportsmanlike penalties that he took in the final seconds of Wednesday ’s game .
On one , he fired the puck at the celebrating Capitals after their fourth goal .
On the other , Price , on the bench for an extra attacker , appeared to slash Nicklas Backstrom after he scored Washington ’s second empty - net goal . :
The little mistakes obviously came back to bite you as well ? :
That ’s playoffs .
That ’s a big , big key in playoffs .
You ca n’t make mistakes .
Usually when you do , it ends up in your net . :
Do you feel today the traffic was handled well by everyone ? :
I think a lot of our guys played really well .
I though we did a good job of boxing out , for the most part .
They are a team that likes to go to the net and the defense did a pretty good job . :
What happened on the ( first ) unsportsmanlike penalty ? : Just frustration .
It ’s part of hockey though ; you let them know you there . :
Did you know that the celebration was going on over there ? : Yeah .
I did n’t mean to hit anyone .
It ’s over now . :
Your outlook on the next game ? :
Obviously , it is do - or - die for us .
We do n’t have a choice .
We have a lot of character guys in here , and we are not going to go down without fight . :
What about that shorthanded goal at the end of the second period ? :
That gave them a little bit of momentum going into the room , because I thought we carried the play in the second period -- and that one little breakdown winds up in your net and that gives them a breath going into the locker room . :
Does anyone shoot the puck as quick as Ovechkin ? : Kovalchuk .
The puck does n’t spend much time on their blades ; that is why they score so many goals . :
The second unsportsmanlike penalty ? :
Just frustration .
It ’s part of hockey though ; let them know you are there . :
Your first start in a while .
Are you happy with the way you played ? : No. four goals , I ’m not pleased .
I ’m not going to make excuses .
I thought I could have played better .
You ’re that close to playing a great game or an average game .
At first when Staar , as she likes to go , a burlesque dancer and conniver / mistress of the Hollywood jet set decided to put pen to paper back in 2008 her efforts were ridiculed and lampooned by tabloid powerhouse journal Gawker who called her efforts at best derivative , cliched and prone to giving one a grandiose headache should one attempt to read her ‘ aspirant chick lit . ’
That of course caught the attention of Drew Nederpelt of power house publishing house Sterling and Ross who flew over to Hollywood to see if he could straighten things out .
Of course when he arrived she casually mentioned to Mr Nederpelt that her real name was Leslie Zemeckis .
Curious he then asked whether if she was somehow related to behemoth Hollywood producer Robert Zemeckis , producer of such hits as Back to the Future , Polar Express , and Forrest Gump .
She casually looked at him and explained that Mr Zemeckis was in fact her husband .
That of course did n’t deter the stumped Mr Nederpelt who if anything must have been dizzily turned on by the prospect of publishing a book about slutty behavior , mistresses and how to survive as one , penned of course by the wife of one of Hollywood ’s biggest players .
Who also was n’t deterred was Staar as she reached over and whispered into a then giddy Mr Nederpelt ’s ear “ I ’ll give you a book that you will never forget . ”
Forward to the present and Mrs Zemeckis has exactly done that but not in the way Mr Nederpelt ever imagined .
What follows is the horror and joy of metaphorically going to bed with Hollywood vixens and the resultant hangovers , and waking up with a throbbing headache .
A book ready to go , sitting in warehouses hangers , Staar suddenly called via her lawyers “ who said this could all go away , ” to announce to Mr Nederpelt that if he went through with bringing out the book to the public , titled HOW TO LIVE LIKE A MISTRESS ( And Reap the Rewards ! ) , he would have one hell of a fight on his hands in court .
To date Sterling and Ross have been presented with a $ 150 000 lawsuit , which of course they have counter sued …
This all seemed very odd to the baffled Mr Nederpelt until he then remembered Staar is married to Mr Zemeckis who he reckons when finally catching wind of the whole project must ’ve groaned and moaned with the realization of what his wife had done .
It was then when the strange phone calls came and a Hollywood mistress had now initially timidly but now brazenly begun threatening to sue Mr Nederpelt and the publishing house Sterling and Ross should the book ever go to press .

AN application that challenges you to keep a hobo alive on your mobile has become the UK 's most popular download .
iHobo was launched two weeks ago as a Tamagotchi of sorts - users adopt a homeless person and care for them for three days .
Using Apple Push Notification technology , the app sends users alerts to let them know when their hobo is hungry or needs shelter .
The iHobo lives in your phone , and every now and then , they 'll tap on the screen , sometimes asking for money , sometimes just needing someone to talk to .
If you 're there for your iHobo , they 'll get through the day .
If you 're not , you 're given a harsh insight into just what kind of trial surviving on a day - to - day basis is for those who live on the streets .
A blogger for Games Radar tells of how his iHobo woke him up in the middle of night .
He told his owner that he'd sold the sleeping bag he'd given him in order to buy drugs .
Some time later , he was woken up again by the iHobo saying he was cold now he had no sleeping bag .
Another user said he'd missed a call for help and woke to find his iHobo had gone on to accept drugs from a dealer .
He died the next day of an overdose .
As of yesterday , more than 200,000 Britons had an iHobo on their mobile .
And while it might sound like tasteless entertainment , iHobo 's role is actually anything but .
Billed as " the world 's first live action charity iPhone app " , iHobo was developed by UK charity trust Depaul with the aim of provoking conversations about the cause of homeless people .
Once your three days of caring for a hobo are up , Depaul UK uses the app to ask for a donation .
" It is deliberately designed to provoke conversations about youth homelessness and so its name and content had to be able to cause a reaction , " Depaul UK chief executive Paul Marriott told MediaWeek after the app was launched .

What a bloody nerve !
The very banks that have been bailed out with billions of dollars of taxpayer money and the very businesses that grew fat from government stimulus spending are now demanding that governments slash their spending in order to rein in the public debt that resulted from these measures .
Widespread attacks on the working class – cuts in social spending , lower wages and reduced pensions – are the order of the day across the world .
Today the debt crisis has struck hardest in Greece .
Tomorrow it will be Portugal , Italy , Ireland and Spain ; the day after , Britain and the USA ?
The debt crisis , currently centred in Southern Europe , tells us so much about the rottenness of capitalism .
It ’s a system where the very wealthy gamble their money but we end up paying their debts .
“ Heads they win , tails we lose . ”
After North America , Europe is the world ’s wealthiest continent , but what do we see ?
Workers tossed onto the scrap heap ; elderly people who worked for 30 or 40 years having their pensions ripped away from them ; high school and university students facing the prospect of never holding a steady job ; and the unemployed having to pull their belts in another notch .
The international banks , the IMF , and the EU all say that the Greek working class , students and pensioners are in for unprecedented hardship .
Greece will be hit by depression ; national income will fall by 10 - 15 per cent in the next two years .
And , even after the three year EU / IMF bailout comes to its conclusion , even in the “ best ” possible circumstances , Greek indebtedness will be higher than it is today because this “ bailout ” has to be repaid at commercial rates of interest at the very time that the economy will be shrinking rapidly .
The Greek bailout is all about protecting the profits of the German and French banks that hold billions of dollars in bonds issued by governments from Southern Europe .
When all is said and done , “ rescuing Greece ” consists of yet another monstrous give - away of taxpayers ’ money to the banks .
Had Greece defaulted , something it may yet do , the German and French banks would have seen 30 per cent or more of their loans wiped out .
With the bailout they are secure for now .
But the crisis is far from over .
The speculators who brought on the crisis by refusing to buy any further Greek bonds unless they were offered 10 - 20 per cent interest are now casting their eyes further .
Like wild dogs , they roam in packs trying to detect signs of weakness in the financial markets of particular countries .
For the capitalists , enough is never enough .
They are always driven by the competition between themselves for more .
And every “ solution ” they conjure up only points the way to fresh problems .
The activities of the speculators are only the surface of what is a much deeper and more intractable crisis of world capitalism .
The capitalists have no solution to the debt crisis other than to attack the working class .
Meanwhile the rich Greeks are hanging onto their wealth .
They ’ve paid no tax for years .
They ’ve bankrupted the national treasury .
Now that the shit has hit the fan , they ’re scuttling for a safe bolt - hole .
Some are taking their money and running overseas .
Others are staying at home but sending their ill - gotten money to Swiss bank accounts .
The country is being drained of yet more billions .
None of these thieves will see the inside of a jail cell .
The capitalists are protected by the courts and the politicians with whom they work hand in glove .
They live secure in their mansions while unleashing the police against ordinary people protesting against the looting of their country .
The rich decry the “ violence ” of the mass demonstrations , strikes and riots in Athens , but their violence is systemic , daily and reaches into every corner of society .
It ’s not just the tear gas , the capsicum spray , the rubber bullets and the riot cops that they deploy in the streets .
They also use the violence of unemployment to boost their profits ; they use the violence of racism against Roma and Albanians to deflect attention from themselves as the cause of unemployment and housing shortages ; and they use the violence of cutting health services to enable the government to pay back the banks .
The Greek bailout has demonstrated the power of the capitalist class to bring even a democratically elected government to heel .
Last October three million voters supported the Socialist Party ( PASOK ) , smashing the incumbent conservatives who polled less than two and a half million votes .
PASOK won on a platform of rolling back the conservatives ’ attacks on the welfare state and defending the rights of workers and pensioners .
Those three million votes count for nothing compared to the demands of the banks .
Within three months of winning office , PASOK went on the attack .
We live under a dictatorship of capital , no matter the parliamentary façade .
The capitulation by the PASOK government is a stark reminder that labour parties can never be trusted .
Because the social democrats want to run the capitalist state and manage the capitalist economy , they take responsibility for them in good times and bad .
The Greek and European capitalists are demanding that the working class pay for the crisis .
The Greek social democrats are obliging without demur .
Governments are using the crisis to whip up national chauvinism against their rivals and the weaker states .
German newspapers have been saturated with articles slamming the Greeks for their “ extravagant ” welfare state , the better to corral German workers behind German capitalists and to justify attacks on their own welfare state .
Capitalism tries to turn the animosity between the classes into hatred between peoples .
This is the future for workers across Europe if the capitalists have their say :
In a continent of plenty , austerity and misery ; in the ancient home of democracy , the will of the people trashed at the behest of the banks .
Working class resistance
But , as successive general strikes and mass demonstrations this year have shown , the Greek workers are determined not to let the capitalists have the last say .
They have demonstrated some crucial points about the power of the working class .
They have shut down the country .
They have for a day or two at a time stopped the wheels of profit making in their tracks .
They have made plain without them , business stops .
The Greek workers have got a taste of their own power .
Their actions have terrified the speculators , the bankers , the EU and the IMF .
They know what ’s at stake .
If they can crush the Greek workers , workers all over Europe will be more vulnerable .
But if the Greek workers can stand firm and send the IMF packing , it will be a victory for the entire European working class .
Indeed , not just Europe but all over the world .
Union and student activists facing massive public sector cuts in California are closely following events in Greece .
Our struggle is international .
So , if the capitalists are riven by divisions and competition , the working class is united through struggle .
Within Greece , the impetus behind the strikes is always for maximum unity .
It ’s not enough that the public sector workers take action ; the private sector unions have to come on board .
It ’s not enough that the workers go on strike ; the students and the pensioners need to rally too .
It ’s not enough that the “ native ” Greek workers strike , the immigrants have to join in with their demands .
And when through stupid sectarianism the Communist Party calls separate marches and rallies in competition with those called by the main union federations , the tendency amongst the workers is simply to link arms and march together .
The Greek workers have occupied numerous government buildings in protest at the attacks .
Workers who have been retrenched have occupied banks and government offices to demand employment and compensation .
At the initiative of the radical left , workers , students and working - class neighbourhoods have begun to form struggle committees .
In one working - class suburb of Athens , a struggle committee has been established that now includes the local high school teachers union , workers at the local hospital , the local chapter of an immigrant solidarity campaign and many residents ( see SA # 153 ) .
By engaging in these kinds of struggles and by linking up in this way , the working class learns basic lessons of solidarity and gets an appetite for more .
The struggle in Greece also demonstrates the centrality of politics .
No matter the desire of workers to vent their rage against the thieves who are looting the country , the established leaders of the Greek union movement want to cut a deal with the Government .
It has only been pressure from within the ranks of the unions – spearheaded by the radical left – that has made the general strikes happen .
The stakes are so high that some “ compromise ” outcome engineered by the established union leaders can only take the form of a sell - out .
The working class needs a revolutionary , not a reformist , leadership if it is to decisively push back this latest round of attacks .
Such a leadership has to be based amongst the most radical sections of the working class .
But more than that is needed .
The attacks levied as part of this debt crisis will be the pattern for world capitalism for years to come .
Capitalism has demonstrated that it is unfit to rule .
The Greek workers ’ struggle points to an alternative to a future of hardship and escalating nationalist tensions .
That alternative is socialism , where the workers will not just resist this or that attack , but will destroy the whole rotting edifice of capitalism and the misery that it brings .

The Kandahar base reportedly came under attack for hours
Insurgents have attacked Nato 's main military base in southern Afghanistan .
A Nato spokesman said Kandahar airfield had come under rocket and mortar fire , followed by a ground assault .
Several Nato personnel were wounded .
Officials said the attackers had tried to get into the base , but were repelled by security forces .
It is the second attack on a major installation in the last few days - on Wednesday militants attacked the US military base at Bagram .
Nato also said that separate attacks in southern Afghanistan earlier on Saturday killed three Nato personnel and a civilian working with the military .
" Kandahar airfield came under indirect fire at approximately eight o'clock ( 1530 GMT ) tonight and shortly afterward a ground attack was under way as well , " Nato spokesman Lt Col Todd Vician told Reuters .
Three British cabinet ministers , led by Foreign Secretary William Hague , were due to visit the Kandahar base later but were forced to change their plans at the last minute because of the attack .
Bunker request
Nato said in a statement that no insurgents had managed to penetrate the base perimeter .
It added that " a number " of military and civilian personnel were wounded and were receiving medical treatment , but there were no confirmed fatalities .
Afghan contractors said five rockets struck the base , including one which hit the helicopter base and another which targeted a shopping area .
Lucian Read , a journalist at the site at the time of the attack , said people were told to get to bunkers , and that a loudspeaker announcement had warned of a ground attack .
The base , which sits on the edge of Kandahar city , the provincial capital , houses around 23,000 personnel and regularly comes under attack .
In an assault on Bagram base on Wednesday , an American contractor was killed in fighting that lasted several hours .
A day earlier , a Taliban suicide bomber had attacked a Nato convoy in the capital Kabul , killing 18 people including six Nato soldiers .
The Taliban recently announced a spring offensive against Nato forces and Afghan government troops .
Earlier on Saturday , Afghan police said they had found a cache of hundreds of rockets on the outskirts of Kabul .

These days , being a writer for Conan O’Brien would seem to be as synonymous with idleness as being a Maytag repairman or a BP thank - you - note writer .
But the writers for the former “ Tonight Show ” host and future TBS star are putting their downtime to productive use : after Mr. O’Brien completes his Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour , his writers will perform a live show in Chicago that will be broadcast on TBS at the end of June .
The show , called “ Team Coco Presents Conan ’s Writers Live , ” will be presented as part of the TBS Presents a “ Very Funny ” Festival : Just For Laughs ( yes , that ’s its full title ) on June 17 at the Bank of America Theater , its organizers said .
The show will feature Andy Richter , Mr. O’Brien ’s longtime “ Late Night ” and “ Tonight Show ” sidekick , as well as Reggie Watts , a musician and comedian who has been opening for Mr. O’Brien on his tour , and will be shown June 27 on TBS .
Then , before their egos get too inflated , it will be time for the writers to go back behind the cameras and help Mr. O’Brien prepare for his TBS debut on Nov. 8 .
( CNN ) -- Legislators in Hawaii have passed a civil unions bill that would give same - sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples .
The state House of Representatives passed the bill by a 31 - 20 vote late Thursday .
Gov. Linda Lingle has until early July to decide whether to sign the bill into law , CNN's Hawaii affiliates reported .
Civil union supporters cheered in the Capitol rotunda when the bill passed , CNN affiliate KGMB - TV in Honolulu said .
" I was always positive even when people were saying it was dead .
I stayed positive and worked with a lot of different people that made this happen today , " Tambry Young of Equality Hawaii told the TV station .
Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona said lawmakers should n't have approved the measure .
" The state House 's last - minute political maneuvering is unfortunate for the people of Hawaii who have voiced their support for traditional marriage , " he said in a statement .
" If the Legislature wanted to establish the equivalent of same - sex marriage , they should have put it on the ballot for the people to decide . "
House Bill 444 provides state - level spousal rights to same - sex couples .
Voting came as a surprise on the last day of the legislative session , affiliates reported .
In January , House members voted to shelve the bill after Speaker Calvin Say said lawmakers did n't have a veto - proof majority of votes , affiliate KITV - TV in Honolulu reported .
House Majority Leader Blake Oshiro , however , called for the measure to be discussed Thursday afternoon , KITV said .
Larry Silva , Catholic bishop of Honolulu , urged people Friday to ask the governor to veto the legislation .
" We need you to mount a campaign to flood the governor 's office with requests to veto the bill , " Silva wrote on the Diocese of Honolulu 's website .
" Should the governor veto the bill , they will need 34 votes to override .
This is where you come in ! "
Supporters such as Equality Hawaii said they had n't expected a vote Thursday but were pleased with the outcome .
Say , the House speaker , said he was proud of having passed the bill .
" I 'm happy that it 's finally done , " supporter Vincent Rosa told KGMB .
" The vote was taken and democracy was at work at this capital . "
Civil unions advocate Alan Spector told KHON - TV , " I did not know all day this was going to happen .
This was a surprise .
I 'm very happy . "
Five U.S. states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Hawaii would join New Jersey in allowing civil unions .
Three states -- Rhode Island , New York , and Maryland -- recognize same - sex marriages from other states , according to the conference .
California recognizes same - sex marriages performed during six months in 2008 after its Supreme Court granted same - sex couples the right to marry and before the passage of Proposition 8 , which overturned the court 's decision .

I want my country back .
I want back the country of Teddy Roosevelt , who cared about our natural environment .
I want back the country of Harry Truman , who was n’t afraid to give em hell .
I do n’t want an administration that authorizes offshore drilling to make political deals with the most despicable forces in American society .
I know that Big Oil is making billions in untaxed profits that it uses to buy my government so that it can despoil America the beautiful , and I want my country back .
Do you doubt the reality of global climate change , caused by human beings pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ?
You are the victim of propaganda and foot - dragging by big oil corporations .
Virtually all the peer - reviewed academic articles published on global warming acknowledge carbon - fuelled climate change , , but a majority of press reports quite a scientist on “ one side ” and another on the “ other side . ”
The “ other side ” is bought and paid for and lacks a scientific leg to stand on– the equivalent of the “ scientists ” who denied that smoking causes lung cancer .
Just as Big Oil has attempted to muddy the waters ( so to speak ) on the dire environmental threat of climate change , so BP actively lobbied the US government against putting in the kind of engineering safeguards that could have forestalled the worst of the present disaster in the Gulf .
A whistle - blower now says that more BP drilling platforms are at risk of producing such disasters because the company has n’t carefully kept the technical information on these platforms that is needed .
BP officials are accused of initially lying about the likely impact of the spill and failing to act swiftly to contain the disaster That Drudge and CNN (! ) managed to switch the conversation to how fast the White House could respond to BP ’s screw - up tells you everything you have to know about corporate propaganda in this country .
The attempts at Gulf oil spill cover -ups track with attempts at climate change cover - up by big Oil .
These corporations are not charities , they are not acting in our interest .
They are about making money in the short term , and often are willing to take short cuts that are ruinous in the medium to long term .
We need to take back our government from them .
As much as 25,000 barrels a day of petroleum is now pouring into the Gulf of Mexico , damaging shrimp and other wildlife beds , ruining beaches , destroying fishing , tourism , livelihoods at a time of 10 percent unemployment over - all .
There is a real danger that the slick will get into the Gulf Stream and attack America ’s Atlantic beaches , as well .
Why ?
Because the US transportation system is run wrong .
70 percent of petroleum fuels automobiles .
First of all , we should be sending most goods around the country on trains , not trucks .
There are all kinds of hidden government subsidies for trucking , including the millions spent every year on rebuilding inter - state highways , which are constantly torn up by those huge trucks .
But the trucking industry pays only a fraction of that cost .
Train transport of goods is many times more efficient , but because government subsidies are harder to hide in that industry , you always have a lot of yahoos complaining about socialism ( and usually they get money from concrete and oil interests ) .
And , we should be subsidizing city subway systems and trying to put residential skyscrapers in the downtowns of cities , in hopes people will move back from the suburbs and live near where they work .
Washington DC , which is the world ’s worst traffic mess , needs what Vancouver has .
( Siting skyscraper condos downtown actually reduced real estate costs for residents ) .
We need to end the hidden government subsidies for fossil fuels and make sure their true cost , including climate change , is built into them .
Moreover , we should be generating electricity from alternative sources or natural gas ( of which we have a lot ) and then moving to electric and hybrid automobiles .
( Natural gas burns cleaner than petroleum or coal and is probably a necessary bridge fuel to the alternatives ) .
Going to electric vehicles powered by natural gas , wind and solar plants would be cheaper than rebuilding all the gas stations in the country .
Coal should be banned altogether and its use made a hanging crime .
And , we should be matching every penny of the cost of the Gulf clean - up with a huge government Manhattan project on solar energy .
The environmental and economic costs of the oil spill are enormous , but they are tiny compared to the costs of actually burning the oil and spilling more masses of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
If you ’re not alarmed about your future , it is because you have bought the cover - up of climate change , just as Obama bought a cover - up when he believed what he was told about the unlikelihood of oil spills from ocean platforms .
Pregnancy places competing demands on a mother 's physiology :
Her body wants to produce a strong healthy baby but not at the expense of her own health .
Some of the genes that she passes on to her child therefore try to protect her own body from excessive demands from her child .
These so - called " imprinted genes " inherited from the father however do not show the same restraint -- their goal is to get as many resources for the fetus as possible .
Evidence that this battle of the imprinted genes might be at the root of later life disease processes will be presented at the International Conference The Power of Programming in Munich on 6 to 8 May , organised by the EC - funded Early Nutrition Programming Project ( EARNEST ) .
" The imprinted genes derived from the father are greedy whilst those from the mother are conservative in their needs to ensure future reproductive success , " said Dr. Miguel Constancia from the University of Cambridge , England .
" We have found evidence that imprinted genes play important roles in the control of endocrine functions of the placenta .
These placental adaptations have marked effects on nutrient delivery to the fetus , resulting in the programming of homeostatic mechanisms with metabolic consequences extending to adulthood , for example for type 2 diabetes susceptibility . "
There is evidence that some programming effects are different in male and female offspring .
Dr. Rachel Dakin from the University of Edinburgh , Scotland , shows how maternal obesity is associated with sex-specific programming effects in young adult mice .
Female offspring of obese mothers had raised blood insulin levels , whilst male offspring did not .
Male offspring did have alterations in the expression of liver genes important in lipid and glucocorticoid metabolism .
Professor Claudine Junien from the Institut National de Recherche Agronomique ( INRA ) in France says : " For me a gene , a cell and even a sex does not think and has no intelligent design .
Instead it reacts to diverse environments and situations according to what its build - up can afford , pushing in one direction or another ( or several at a time ) .
The limits to which it can go without going awry or dying have been established progressively throughout the slow and long process of evolution , with different genetic backgrounds throughout the world depending on the diversity of experiences over the ages .
We have data showing that gene expression and DNA methylation are sexually dimorphic in male and female placentae under normal / control conditions .
Surprisingly , in stressful conditions , such as a high fat diet or low calorie diet , or maternal overweight / obesity -- the male and female placentae do not use the same strategies : they use different gene pathways and networks to cope with the stress .
Does this directly lead to different outcomes ?
It may lead to sex - dependent differences in the outcome of programming with long lasting effects .
Alternatively , it may be that metaphorically speaking males climb the mountain taking the north face while females take the south face -- but they ultimately reach the same peak after using these different paths . "
Professor Ricardo Closa Monasterolo from the University Rovira I Virgili of Tarragona , Italy , presents work that suggested that infant boys and girls might have different responses to lower or higher protein diets .
Females given higher protein formula milk had higher IGF - 1 levels than males , whilst males showed higher C - peptide / creatinine levels compared to females .
The significance of lower or higher protein diets has also been examined in the EU Childhood Obesity Project ( CHOP ) co-ordinated by Professor Berthold Koletzko of Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität ( LMU ) in Munich .
Starting in 1990 , over 1,000 infants were followed .
The first results show that , after 2 years , the infants fed a formula milk with a lower protein content -- closer to the composition of breast milk -- weighed significantly less than those on higher protein formula , with their weights being more similar to those of breast fed infants .
These differences emerged by 6 months of age and persisted , even after the intervention ceased and the children went onto similar diets .
The researchers predict that these low protein induced differences in early growth would reduce obesity at 14 to 16 years of age by 13 % .
Koletzko , who is also the Co-ordinator of the EARNEST project said , " This is a new and exciting area of research which suggests that some of the differences in disease risk seen in men and women in later life might be explained by different responses to programming effects in early life . "
BP Plc has not been able to reduce the flow of oil in
.
The statement , issued by the company Monday afternoon , refuted a claim made this morning by a company executive that the company had managed to reduce the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico by successfully shutting a set of hydraulic shears known as annular rams , helping to clamp the ruptured pipe and block the leaking oil .
" We 've significantly cut the flow through the pipe , " Jeff Childs said Monday morning at a meeting in Mobile hosted by U.S. Sen .
Richard Shelby , R- Tuscaloosa .
Childs is a deputy incident commander for BP .
The company stated in a release : " BP would like to clarify that , contrary to some media reports , the actions it has taken to date on the blow out preventer have not resulted in any observed reduction in the rate of flow of oil from the MC252 well . "

must exist , the complexity of living organisms proves that a Creator exists .
Not so , says Richard Dawkins , and in this brilliant and controversial book , the acclaimed evolutionary biologist sets out to demonstrate that the theory of evolution by natural selection - the unconscious , automatic , blind yet essentially non-random process discovered by Charles Darwin - is the only answer to the biggest question of all : why do we exist ?
' I want to persuade the reader , not just that the Darwinian world - view happens to be true , but that it is the only known theory that could , in principle , solve the mystery of our existence '

Greenpeace stellt Akten ins Netz : Die Gorlebenlüge
Greenpeace hat in den letzten Wochen 12.000 Seiten zu Gorleben durchforstet : Bei der Standortsuche wurde getürkt .
Das kann bald jeder Bürger im Netz nachlesen .
Es gibt diese offizielle Version zu Gorleben , dem geplanten Atommüllendlager im niedersächsischen Wendland .
Danach ist die Wahl des Standorts vor drei Jahrzehnten " ergebnisoffen " erfolgt .
Darauf bezieht sich auch der derzeitige CDU - Bundesumweltminister Norbert Röttgen .
Viel Zeit sei investiert worden , Geld obendrein .
1,5 Milliarden Euro seien bereits geflossen .
Gorleben müsse darum Vorrang haben , die Erkundung dort vorangetrieben werden .
Akten , die nun aufgetaucht sind , lassen diese Version schlecht aussehen .
Sie sind unangenehm für die schwarz - gelbe Regierung , die die Atommeiler länger laufen lassen will .
Sie haben das Zeug dazu , die Suche nach einem Platz für den wachsenden radioaktiven Müllberg zurück auf Start zu setzen .
Mathias Edler und andere Atomexperten von Greenpeace haben in den letzten Wochen 12.000 Seiten Kabinettsprotokolle , Vermerke , Studien durchforstet .
Edler sagte am Dienstag , es habe " nie " ein offenes Auswahlverfahren gegeben - " Geologische Kriterien spielten eine untergeordnete Rolle " .
Es ist Mitte der 1970er - Jahre , die Bundesregierung beauftragt die Kernbrennstoff - Wiederaufbereitungsgesellschaft ( Kewa ) , ein " nukleares Entsorgungszentrum " zu suchen .
Das niedersächsische Wirtschaftsministerium schreibt am 10 .
Februar 1976 an die Staatskanzlei : " Aufgrund der von der Kewa überprüften Standortvoraussetzungen ergibt sich … folgende Rangfolge : Börger , Weesen - Lutterloh , Ahlden . "
Drei niedersächsische
Orte - von Gorleben keine Rede .
Nahezu zeitgleich erarbeitet der TÜV - Hannover eine Rangliste im Auftrag des niedersächsischen Sozialministeriums und favorisiert - das schleswig - holsteinische Nieby .
Das zeigt eine Tabelle .
Diese Tabelle taucht in den Akten vom November 1976 allerdings ein zweites Mal auf , als kopiertes Einzelblatt , in dem Gorleben handschriftlich ergänzt ist .
Fortan ist das Dorf in Lüchow - Dannenberg mit im Verfahren .
Im Dezember 1976 beauftragt das Wirtschaftsministerium in Hannover einen interministeriellen Arbeitskreis , eine Vorlage für das niedersächsische Kabinett zu erstellen : Mindestens vier Standorte sollen einander gegenübergestellt werden .
Im Februar 1977 sind es in einem " streng vertraulichen " Papier des niedersächsischen Wirtschaftsministeriums nur noch zwei .
Kurz drauf , keine drei Monate nachdem Gorleben erstmals als mögliches Endlager erwähnt wird , beschließt das niedersächsische Kabinett , " Gorleben als vorläufigen Standort eines möglichen Entsorgungszentrums für ausgebrannte Kernbrennstoffe zu benennen " .
Es war ein niedersächsischer Alleingang .
Der damalige SPD - Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt hatte mehrfach Bedenken geäußert .
CDU - Ministerpräsident Ernst Albrecht entschied aus strukturpolitischen Gründen .
Das legen Schriftstücke nahe , die bereits im Herbst letzten Jahres aufgetaucht sind .
Eilig hatten es allerdings alle , einen Endlagerstandort zu finden .
" Wie Ihnen bekannt ist , wird die Entsorgungssituation der deutschen Kernkraftwerke in den Jahren 1981 / 82 kritisch werden " , schrieb die Projektgesellschaft zur Wiederaufarbeitung von Kernbrennstoffen , eine Tochter der Atomkonzerne , an den niedersächsischen Innenminister .
Die Meiler Biblis B , Unterweser und Brunsbüttel waren gefährdet .
Sie brauchten einen Entsorgungsnachweis .
So legte sich 1983 auch die Kohl - Regierung auf Gorleben fest , obwohl Geologen die Tauglichkeit immer wieder anzweifelten .
Es fehle ein " Deckgebirge " , das den Salzstock abschirmt .
Während der Eiszeiten haben die Gletscher die oberen Erdschichten abrasiert .
Zudem könne ein möglicher Kontakt zum Grundwasser Gefahren bergen .
In einem Vermerk vom 1 .
August 1996 schreibt des Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz ( BfS ) dass in 840 Metern Tiefe ein Wasserreservoir im Volumen von 100.000 bis 1.000.000 Kubikmetern liegt .
Er geht an die Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe ( BGR ) .
" Bitte sofort vorlegen " hat einer daraufgekritzelt - und macht damit die Brisanz des Schreibens klar .
In einem Lager für Atommüll hat Wasser nichts zu suchen , es kann nach und nach in die Stollen eindringen , das Salz lösen , die Atombehälter rosten lassen .
Die Öffentlichkeit wurde nicht von den Erkenntnissen des BFS informiert .
Es seien " anfängliche und deshalb noch stark fehlerbehaftete Berechnungen " gewesen , erklärte BFS - Sprecher Florian Emrich am Dienstag .
Mittlerweile habe sich herausgestellt , dass das Reservoir maximal 1.500 Kubikmeter umfasse .
In einem Buch , dass das BGR 2008 über bisherige Erkundungsergebnisse herausgegeben hat , heißt es nun , es sei von " wenigen Kubikzentimetern bis mehreren hundert Kubikmetern " auszugehen .
Die Gefahren seien einfach nicht berechenbar , das Verfahren der Endlagersuche völlig intransparent , meinen die Greenpeace - Leute .
Sie haben im August letzten Jahres bei zwölf bundesdeutschen Behörden und Ministerien Akteineinsicht nach dem Umweltinformationsgesetz gefordert .
Noch haben sie nicht alle
Akten gelesen , sie liegen ihnen auch noch nicht alle vor .
Das Bundesumweltministerium erklärte ihnen zum Beispiel , es müsse erst ein Unternehmen beauftragt werden , die Akten zusammenzustellen , sie hätten dafür nicht das Personal .
Nach und nach sollen die Dokumente unter www.gorleben-akten.de öffentlich gemacht werden .
Für Mathias Edler ist die Sache schon klar : " Röttgen liegen nun die Beweise vor , um Gorleben endgültig zu schließen . "
Der versprach , dies " ernst zu nehmen " und zu " prüfen " .
The Federal Reserve on Monday introduced an online database listing the terms and conditions of more than 300 credit card issuers to help consumers find a card that best suits their personal finance needs .
But the database , mandated under the far - reaching credit card legislation signed by President Obama last May , contains only the raw text of card agreements , which are so densely worded that only the most dedicated customer , perhaps one with a legal degree , could glean value from them , several consumer advocates said .
Take , for example , this section from a PNC Bank card agreement : “ We will calculate finance charges on cash advances by multiplying the ‘ average daily balance of cash advances ’ by the total number of days in the billing cycle , and multiplying the product by the daily periodic rate of finance charge then in effect .
“ The daily periodic rate of finance charge for each billing cycle shall be a rate computed by adding a margin ( ‘ Margin For Cash Advances ’ ) to the value of the index and dividing by 365 .
The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the index plus the Margin For Cash Advances . ”

Ever since a pure copper sculpture was found buried in a palm grove near the Nigerian city of Ife , experts from the West have argued that the artefact was a fake that was too sophisticated to have been created by African hands .
Found in 1910 , the " Olokun head " left Western curators doubting that such a technically advanced work of art could have been created by indigenous people .
Years later , they even began to doubt its authenticity , claiming that the original had been sold illegally and the one which remained in Nigeria was an ingenious copy .
But now , new science is set to turn past wisdom on its head .
There is a growing belief among contemporary curators that the " counterfeit " sculpture is the real thing , according to The Art Newspaper .
When it first travelled to the British Museum in 1948 , it was exhibited as a copy ; scholars claimed it was made from a blend of ancient materials that had been melted down , while the real work of art was thought to have been smuggled out of Africa by a European or American collector .
The artwork , now on its second visit to the British Museum , where it is currently displayed – again as a " replica " – will undergo a thorough scientific investigation next month to establish the truth , once and for all .
Nigel Barley , a former British Museum curator who briefly examined the head in January , believes it may well be the original .
Enid Schildkrout , from New York 's Museum for African
Art and curator of the current exhibition at the British Museum , agrees .
If , she said , the real treasure had in fact been stolen , " it is surprising that the original has never reappeared " .
It was first found by Leo Frobenius , a German anthropologist who had heard rumblings of a buried sculpture in a palm grove , just outside Ife , near a shrine dedicated to the goddess of the sea , Olokun .
He organised a dig to investigate , and found the artwork .
Some days later , the colonial administration seized the sculpture on the grounds that it was sacred and should be returned to its original site , before it was transferred to the Ife Museum .
One theory that emerged was that Frobenius commissioned a replica when he was instructed to hand over the artefact , and smuggled the original out of the country .
At the time of discovery , the head was considered too great a masterpiece to have been created by indigenous African artists – a reflection of prevailing attitudes of the early 20th century .
Some Europeans even theorised that the work was a remnant from the lost city of Atlantis .
A spokeswoman for the British Museum said when the head travelled to the West , it caused a huge stir because " it flew in the face of Western perceptions " ( of African heritage and cultural achievements ) .
It is now accepted by the curatorial community that the advanced artistic techniques used to create the sculpture were " more advanced than those of Renaissance Italy , and comparable to those of [ the artist ] Donatello " .
Such sculptures , discovered in Nigeria and neighbouring Benin , were sold on the open market for under £ 100 , in some instances , during the 1950s .
This particular work was surrounded by various myths and beliefs , but it was not actually examined until 1948 , when it left Nigeria and specialists at the British Museum declared it was a replica .
Guilt , shame , slaughter without purpose , alienation from homeland and life itself — this was the legacy that Günter passed on to his son Walt from his World War II combat service in Hitler ’s Wehrmacht .
Walt , “ the only child born in freedom , ” was born in the United States shortly after his parents emigrated here from Germany .
Growing up in the Cold War 1950s , Walt longed to be an all - American boy , but was always the Indian to his friends ’ cowboys and the “ Kraut ” to their G.I. Joes .
When he turned 18 , Walt enlisted and volunteered for Vietnam .
“ I wanted to finally be one of the good guys , ” Walt said .
“ Service in the American military in a righteous cause would expunge my family ’s past and earn our place in society . ”
He could not know that , instead , he would return with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , feeling less than ever like “ one of the good guys . ”
The Warrior ’s Path
Our troops do not enlist because they want to destroy or kill .
No matter the political climate , most troops seek to serve traditional warrior values : to protect the country they love , its ideals , and especially their families , communities , and each other .
If they must kill or be killed , they need transcendent reasons to do so .
Throughout history , the only reason for fighting that has survived moral scrutiny is a direct attack with real , immediate threat to one ’s people .
PTSD is , in part , the tortured conscience of good people who did their best under conditions that would dehumanize anyone .
Almost all cultures , past and present , have had warriors .
They have also had complex stories and rituals to help them recover from combat and guide them through the life cycle .
The occurrence of warriors is so universal that depth psychologists understand Warrior to be one of our foundational psycho-spiritual archetypes .
We are a nation and a planet of wounded warriors , their offspring , and their neighbors .
People respond to the same call today .
Michael , a Marine who served in Afghanistan , proudly declares that at age 18 he was the first in his state to enlist after 9/11 .
Nick , an army officer who served in Iraq , enlisted because of a lifelong desire “ to be like Hector defending the gates of Troy . ”
In traditional cultures , boys and men studied a “ warrior ’s path . ”
In these societies a warrior was not the same as a soldier ; not merely a member of a huge , anonymous military institution used for the violent execution of political ends .
Rather , warrior was one of the foundational roles that kept societies whole and strong .
Warriors were fundamentally protectors , not destroyers .
Warriorhood , however , is not so valued or nurtured in modern society .
“ Warrior ” is not even a recognized social class .
A veteran , especially one with disabilities , appears to many , and sometimes to him or herself , as a failure in terms of normal civilian identity .
Michael fears that , as an experienced combat veteran , the only place on the planet he now fits is in the French Foreign Legion .
The Echoes of War
War abroad fosters war at home .
When we go to war , we inevitably bring its violence and horror back to our homes and streets .
We can not help it .
Rather than feeling that he had restored his family ’s honor , Walt spent years ravaged by nightmares , homeless , abusing drugs and alcohol , and sitting with a shotgun in his mouth trying to find the will to end it all .
He married and had children , then divorced and neglected his kids .
He could not keep a job .
He could not come home .
War echoes down the generations .
Known or hidden , we all carry the wounds of war .
Walt was wounded by his father ’s history .
His children were wounded by his .
When a veteran has PTSD , his or her entire family and community are inevitably affected .
The individual symptoms of PTSD — sleep disturbances , substance abuse , depression , and problems with intimacy , employment and authority — are the same symptoms that are epidemic in our society .
When we take a close and unprotected look , we see :
We are a nation and a planet of wounded warriors , their offspring , and their neighbors .
Cleansing the Warrior
War poisons the spirit , and warriors return tainted .
This is why , among Native American , Zulu , Buddhist , ancient Israeli , and other traditional cultures , returning warriors were put through significant rituals of purification before re-entering their families and communities .
Traditional cultures recognized that unpurified warriors could , in fact , be dangerous .
The absence of these rituals in modern society helps explain why suicide , homicide , and other destructive acts are common among veterans .
In Viet Nam Walt had exhumed bodies of enemy dead from mass graves and reburied them .
He felt like he had dirtied and damaged his soul .
Nick declared that , though he had wished to be a great champion of his people , “ all they gave me was this dirty stinking little Iraq War . ”
In traditional cultures , warrior cleansing was often guided by shamans , and particular shamans presided over “ warrior medicine . ”
Among his many offices and honors , for example , Sitting Bull served as Medicine Chief of the Hunkpapa Warrior Society , responsible for overseeing the spiritual lives and well - being of the society ’s warriors .
Sitting Bull considered this to be the most important of all the offices he held .
In Sierra Leone traditional purification rituals using ash soap have been an integral aspect of psychosocial healing and reintegration for girls forced to serve as child soldiers .

Walt entered individual and group psychotherapy for combat veterans .
It helped to tell his stories , have his feelings and losses confirmed by other vets , and receive honor as part of a brotherhood .
But he was in search of more cleansing , blessing , and soul healing than traditional therapy could provide .
He eventually partnered with a Native American woman .
He studied her culture , and participated in sweat lodges and other traditional rituals .
He attended a Pow Wow where he was honored as a returned warrior .
He was accepted by the Native community far more than he had been by mainstream America .
I annually lead healing journeys back to Viet Nam , and there , too , vets report feeling more welcomed and honored by their former foes than they have ever felt at home .
A Double Wound
Sitting Bull and his warriors , and other bands from innumerable traditional cultures , were never plagued with self - doubt about the value of their mission , as many of our soldiers are today .
In order to do battle with a whole heart , the danger and threat to one ’s home must be real , and the people must experience it as immediate and about to threaten their total existence ; there must be no alternative .
A people and their warriors must be in unity .
The effect of that unity shows in Nguyen Van Tam , known as Mr. Tiger , a robust , friendly , and serene man of 87 living in Viet Nam ’s Mekong Delta .
He is a veteran of wars against the Japanese , French , and Americans .
Though at war for a quarter century , he has no disturbing symptoms .
“ We Vietnamese , ” he says , “ do not have PTSD because we never hated Americans .
We only fought to protect our families and homes from invaders . ”
When , to the contrary , wars are based on false pretenses , a moral vacuum results .
As Martin Luther King Jr. observed , troops then experience “ not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war , ” but also “ cynicism to the process of death , for our troops must know after a short time that none of the things we are fighting for are really involved . ”
Walt explained , “ I did n’t realize until it was too late that I was just like my father — a good man fighting on the wrong side for the wrong cause . ”
Moral trauma is at the core of PTSD .
An idealistic and sincere young soldier discovering that he is in fact fighting for false or distorted political , economic , or historical agendas can experience deeper and more complicated psychic wounds than those traditional warriors experienced .
War is inherently a moral enterprise and veterans in search of healing are on a profound moral journey .
Healers and communities must walk with them .
The severity and extent to which veterans suffer with Post - traumatic Stress Disorder is a direct response to our culture ’s blindness about war ’s true cost .
PTSD is the expression of the anguish , dislocation , and rage of the self as it attempts to cope with its loss of innocence , reformulate a new personal identity and cultural role , and awaken from massive denial .
Veterans with PTSD are people whose belief systems have been shattered .
We can better understand PTSD as an identity disorder and soul wound rather than a stress and anxiety disorder , as it is presently classified .
War dehumanizes anyone it touches , but especially a veteran who questions the cause he served .
Most conventional therapies teach healers to avoid talk of morality .
But war is inherently a moral enterprise and veterans in search of healing are on a profound moral journey .
Healers and communities must walk with them .
As a society , we must honor those wounds in ways that recognize their depth and degree of psychic suffering .
Lifting the Burden
Warriors in traditional societies served the need for protection , and all that was done was done in the tribe ’s name .
They had rituals transferring responsibility for actions during warfare from veterans to the entire culture .
Ultimately leaders , not ordinary troops , were held responsible for the results of battle and for the deaths that occurred .
Our veterans cannot heal unless society accepts responsibility for its war making .
To the veteran , our leaders and people must say , “ You did this in our name , because you were subject to our orders , and because we put you in untenable and even atrocity - producing situations .
We lift the burden of your actions from you and take it onto our shoulders .
We are responsible for you , for what you did , and for the consequences . ”
Walt received this acceptance from Native American communities .
In my seven trips to Viet Nam , and with every veteran and civilian I have met who has visited Viet Nam since the war , the Vietnamese people have offered such acceptance and forgiveness to any American returning to the country to reconcile .
In contrast , since Afghanistan , Michael says , “ I still love America , but America does not love me . ”
Without this transfer of responsibility , the veteran carries war ’s secret grief and guilt for us all .
Too many veterans collapse into a silent suffering disability and thus serve as our broken scapegoats while the rest of us proceed with “ business as usual . ”
In contrast , during my healing retreats , veterans tell their stories , civilians speak of their lost loved ones , and everyone shares their damaged values and broken dreams .
Finally , our vets enter the center of our circle and civilians pledge to accept responsibility for any harm done in their name and to help carry the veterans ’ stories for the rest of their lives .
By sharing this burden we become a community united in service to war - healing .
Healing for All
We wish , as the gospel song says , “ to study war no more . ”
But scholars count over 14,600 wars in the last 5,600 years of recorded history .
War is so epidemic in its occurrence , devastating in its impact , and lasting in its aftermath , that we must study it and tend to it and treat it .
If we are to return war to its proper place as a last defense when absolutely necessary , we must heal the wounds of our soldiers and communities .
We cannot achieve peace - making without first achieving true and comprehensive war - healing .
We cannot heal from war without involving the entire community and society .
Walt finally put away his shotgun and quit drinking .
He enjoyed a successful relationship with his new partner and was adopted by her tribe and its warrior society .
He took up a spiritual path that restored his belief in the goodness of life and order of the universe .
He volunteered with more disabled veterans , visiting the infirm at his regional V.A. hospital and helping create annual veteran reunions .
Both in therapy and beyond , we created rituals that allowed this soldier to find healing .
The Native American and veteran communities helped support and bring this warrior ’s wandering spirit home .
In turn , Walt became a devoted advocate for other veterans more wounded than he .
The disabled veteran became an elder warrior .
But war completed its damage .
Only in his 50s , Walt died of Agent Orange - related cancer last year .
We cannot heal from war without involving the entire community and society , and without invoking transpersonal help .
We must develop modern rituals that acknowledge the additional wounds caused by war fought for non-defense reasons .
Much as we might disagree with a war , our rituals must include purification , public storytelling , and community acceptance of responsibility for what the soldier has done .
These war - healing rituals and practices serve us all .
They bring home to us the need to break the cycles of war - making and violence both within the individual soldier and within the society .
When we return to our veterans their silenced voices , when we accept our true responsibility as individuals and communities , we will no longer see war as an adventure or a legitimate tool of power politics .
Then , perhaps , we may see that all over our country and world , we share the same legacy of war - wounding .
When we join together to address those wounds wherever they appear , we will finally “ study war no more . ”
I asked Walt ’s permission to tell his story during our farewell visit in the hospital where he was dying of Agent Orange cancers .
He was surprised at first , but finally said , “ I was afraid my life was worthless .
But please tell my story .
Please make it mean something .
Maybe it can help some other poor souls avoid my fate . ”
This morning , the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus held a press conference along with RIAA CEO Mitch Bainwol to call out the six worst websites in the world .
Think of them as an " Axis of P2P Evil . "
Who made the cut ?
The Pirate Bay , naturally .
Canada 's IsoHunt was no surprise .
One - click download service RapidShare was less expected , as a German court ruled only two weeks ago that the site was not responsible for infringement by its users and that it had no duty to preemptively censor uploaded content .
More surprising were the last three sites : Ukraine 's MP3 fiesta , which operates like the now - shuttered allofmp3.com ; Luxembourg 's RMX4U.com , which bills itself as " the biggest community for black music in world ! " ; and Baidu , the Chinese search engine so popular , Google could n't even make a dent in its ratings .
The IAPC is a bipartisan group of 11 senators and a huge number of representatives , and they are concerned that America 's copyright industries are suffering at the hands of " lax or nonexistent enforcement by many foreign governments . "
That 's why , they wrote in a recent letter ( PDF ) , the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) is so important .
But look at that list of websites and services for a moment .
What 's missing ?
Grokster , Demonoid , Oink , Allofmp3 , LimeWire , Napster , Newzbin , Mininova ...
That 's because the copyright industries have in fact been remarkably successful in court within the existing legal frameworks of both the US and foreign countries over the last few years .
Newzbin announced its own closure this week after a long legal fight , while LimeWire lost in a US federal court last week .
Even the Pirate Bay 's ISP had to stop hosting the site this week , and a Swedish court has already ruled against The Pirate Bay 's administrators .
Hold your children close
Still , even with such tremendous victories behind it , the RIAA can't resist a spot of over - the - top rhetoric .
" The global challenge in the years to come will be to win the battle for a civilized Internet that respects property , privacy and security , " said Bainwol .
" An Internet of chaos may meet a utopian vision but surely undermines the societal values of safe and secure families and job and revenue - creating commerce .
Shining the spotlight on these websites sends a vital message to users , advertisers , payment processors and governments around the world . "
Yes , that 's right : a Ukrainian website called " mp3 fiesta " is threatening the safety and security of your family .
And a good chunk of Congress wants to do something about it .

The nurse victimised for being a whistleblower : Trainee thrown out after exposing abuse at shamed hospital
Barbara Allatt was thrown off her training course after reporting the neglect of patients
A student nurse who exposed the appalling neglect of elderly patients at a hospital trust where up to 1,200 people died needlessly has been thrown off her training course .
Two years after the Stafford Hospital scandal , Barbara Allatt reported NHS colleagues for leaving patients in soiled sheets , shouting at dementia sufferers and secretly slipping sedatives into a cup of tea .
But the mature student was condemned for having an ' attitude problem ' before being withdrawn from her nursing course at Staffordshire University last month .
Miss Allatt , 40 , now plans to sue over a ' culture of bullying ' during placements at Stafford Hospital and Cannock Chase Hospital , both part of the crisis - hit Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust .
Her experiences come after a damning independent inquiry found the safety of sick and dying patients was ' routinely neglected ' , leading to between 400 and 1,200 unnecessary deaths at the trust between 2005 and
But no officials were disciplined and two years on hospital bosses have apparently failed to tackle the ' inhumane treatment ' identified in the report .
Miss Allatt , from Cannock , said : ' The wards were heartbreaking .
There were patients crying out for help but the staff would sit chatting .
' Some needed urgent pain relief or a change of sheets and others just needed a bit of reassurance , but they were ignored , shouted at or mocked with cruel names .
' Sick and elderly people were manhandled and abused .
' But when I complained my colleagues told me to mind my own business .
They were so pally with each other that they shut me out and I felt helpless . '
Miss Allatt , a mother of one with a long - term partner , left her job as an occupational therapy technician to start a diploma in adult nursing in March last year .
She passed her exams and got glowing reports on placements in the community - but was disgusted by what she saw on hospital wards .
Over four months at Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals between May 2009 and January this year , she recorded a catalogue of horrors .
Miss Allatt had been doing a training course at both Stafford Hospital , above , and the Cannock Chase hospital , when she witness the neglect
Miss Allatt repeatedly reported her concerns to her university tutors , hospital mentors and senior nurses , but she claims she was fobbed off or attacked for whistleblowing .
In January she was suspended for four weeks over her ' behaviour , attitude and fitness to practise ' .
She was supported by the Royal College of Nursing , but lost two appeals against her suspension , and a fitness to practise panel permanently withdrew her place on the course last month .
Miss Allatt , who suffered stress and depression over her 2008 ordeal , is planning to sue the university for breaching the Public Interest Disclosure Act , which is designed to protect whistleblowers .
She will also take legal action against the trust for bullying , she said .
Now back at work as an occupational therapist , she said : ' I still feel horribly traumatised , but at least I can sleep at night knowing I have reported them and been an advocate for the patient . '
Julie Bailey , from the Cure the NHS campaign group set up for victims ' families in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal , said : ' This is evidence that no lessons have been learnt .
' There are good nurses - Barbara is proof of that - but they are forced out by bullying and victimisation .
' Managers at the hospital and the university knew she was a conscientious student who wanted to uphold nursing standards and reject disturbing , illegal practices , but labelled her with an attitude problem . '
The Royal College of Nursing said it did not comment on individual cases , but in a statement prepared for an appeal hearing , a representative said : ' There is nothing . . . that would suggest anything other than Barbara being a knowledgeable , intelligent , enthusiastic student who performs well and questions appropriately .
' She was unfairly tagged as a troublemaker when she raised concerns on her first placement .
This bad name followed her to her next placement .
' I would suggest collusion between several nurses , and that the decision has been made at some level that it is easier to remove Barbara from her training than pursue her allegations . '
Mid-Staffordshire NHS
Trust said an investigation into her complaints found them to be ' without foundation ' .
A Staffordshire University spokesman said : ' Our nursing students get a lot of input about how to report any issues , and are supported to do so . '
The Daily Mail has consistently highlighted appalling treatment as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign .

Five alleged money mules have been indicted in a bank heist that netted the thieves almost $ 450,000 from a local - government bank account in California .
John L. Quinn II and Anthony Bobbitt , both of North Carolina , were indicted with three others on criminal charges of wire fraud , bank fraud and conspiracy .
Quinn and Bobbitt are accused of allowing their U.S. bank accounts to be used to launder fraudulent money transfers to Lance Holt , Deago Smith and Jennifer Woodard , who were also charged .
The case may be one of the first involving money mules , who have played a key role in hundreds of similar heists that have hit small businesses , organizations , schools and government agencies in the last few years , resulting in losses estimated to be in the millions .
Money mules are generally recruited by bank thieves through job advertisements or other means , and are told they are needed for a work - at - home project to help overseas companies transfer money quickly .
It 's not always clear if the mules know that they 're helping to facilitate a crime , but security blogger Brian Krebs says that most of the mules he 's interviewed have been truly clueless about the nature of what they were doing , or needed the work badly to simply refrain from asking too many questions of their recruiters .
The U.S. attorney 's office in North Carolina , where the charges were filed , would not discuss details of the case , other than to say that the five indicted individuals all knowingly and intentionally conspired to commit the crimes .
According to the complaint ( .pdf ) in this case , the money was siphoned in May 2007 through a number of wire transfers from an account belonging to the city of Carson , California , at City National Bank .
It was sent to bank accounts belonging to Quinn and Bobbitt , who then allegedly withdrew the money in cashier 's checks or electronically transferred it to other bank accounts , while keeping a portion for themselves .
The money transfers were initiated by someone who used valid login credentials to gain access to the city 's bank account .
The credentials were siphoned from a laptop used by municipal treasurer Karen Avilla through spyware loaded on her computer , according to Computer World .
The five indicted individuals are n't charged with hacking , so it 's likely someone else was responsible for the intrusion into Avilla 's computer .
The first transfer occurred on May 23 , 2007 , when an unauthorized electronic transfer of $ 90,500 was made from the city 's account to an account owned by suspect Quinn at the Branch Banking & Trust in Wilson , North Carolina .
Quinn then allegedly transferred the money to an account owned by Woodard at the Fort Sill National Bank in Fayetteville , North Carolina .
The same day , Woodard allegedly withdrew $ 6,000 in cash from that account .
The same day , at a branch in Spring Lake , North Carolina , Woodard allegedly withdrew an additional $ 8,000 in cash and obtained two $ 30,000 cashier 's checks payable to herself .
The next day , Woodard allegedly cashed one of the cashier 's checks and deposited the other one back into her account .
On May 24 , a second unauthorized wire transfer of $ 358,500 was made from the Carson municipal account to a National City Bank account belonging to Holt in Detroit , Michigan .
Holt then allegedly withdrew about $ 103,800 from the account .
The indictment does n't indicate if the money was then sent on to other conspirators in the United States or overseas .
The city was able to recover about $ 304,000 of the stolen money , according to Computer World .
The city 's insurance provider reimbursed it an additional $ 100,000 , but the city ultimately lost about $ 44,000 as a result of the theft .
The city blamed the bank for allowing the transfers to occur and has moved its account to a new bank .
Now , every time a wire transfer is initiated , the bank sends out a message by e-mail , text and fax to Avilla and three other city employees to notify them .

Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has responded to the Henry tax review by saying Labor would never reduce the existing concessions on negative gearing and capital gains tax .
The latest official estimates show house prices jumping by 20 per cent over the past year and critics say that reinforces the need to wind back tax breaks that inflate house prices .
Former New South Wales auditor - general Tony Harris says Mr Swan 's response to the recommendation is the wrong attitude for lifting Australia into the next league .
" It does n't do Australia any good to have a government which when they see these rational arguments from a very well experienced team , they give it three minutes ' thought and then just ditch it , " Mr Harris said .
Treasury Secretary Ken Henry 's panel proposed an innovative solution : replacing a raft of investment tax breaks with one - a 40 per cent discount on your marginal tax rate .
It would have meant that low to middle - income earners would not pay tax on the interest they get from money in the bank .
Mr Harris says not only would that help the less well - off , it would benefit the economy .
" One of the things it does is help the banks reduce their reliance on foreign borrowings .
The biggest problem Australia faces is the fact we 've got $ 700 billion or $ 800 billion worth of net debt to overseas lenders , " he said .
" Some of that would have been replaced by Australian lenders because the Australians would have found investing in bank deposits , bank bonds and the like significantly better . "
The Henry plan would also have cut back the ability of high - income earners to avoid paying income tax by investing in loss - making property , while upping the bill on their capital gains a little .
And that , says Saul Eslake , formerly the chief economist at ANZ and now a fellow of the Grattan Institute at Melbourne University , is good policy .
" Broadly I thought these were sensible recommendations that addressed what has been glaring anomalies between the tax treatment of different forms of saving , " he said .
" Anomalies that for the most part work to the advantage of higher - income earners and to the disadvantage of those lower down the income scale . "
Mr Eslake says it is not surprising the Government rejected any change to negative gearing or capital gains tax concessions .
" I was disappointed , although I would n't have expected them to have taken up such controversial recommendations immediately before an election , " he said .
" It was rather disappointing that they were put in the never - ever category rather than in the category of measures that might be on the agenda for a second term of the present government if it 's re-elected later this year . "
Disadvantaged
Housing commentator and the NSW general manager for property valuers Herron Todd White , Michael McNamara , says it makes sense to dilute the attractiveness of negative gearing .
" Negative gearing inevitably puts house prices up because what happens is you get investors competing with first homebuyers who are also being incited to enter the property market and those investors and first homebuyers compete with mums and dads in the very same property market , " he said .
" This inevitably puts pressure on property prices , disadvantaging those people in the middle which are generally regarded as your mum and dad property owners . "
Mr Swan said the Government rejected recommendations from the Henry review that did not fit with Labor values and philosophy .
Mr McNamara says subsidising the high - income earners who invest in property at the expense of low and middle - income families is a strange reflection on Labor values .
" Essentially what happens today is that taxpayers subsidise investors .
We subsidise them when interest rates go up by the tune of their marginal tax rate , which might be as much as 48 cents in the dollar , " Mr McNamara said .
" It 's a regime that encourages investors to make losses which is inevitably picked up by the taxpayer . "
Then taxpayers subsidise the capital gains .
Mr Harris says the rejection of the Henry review 's recommendations on property taxes and other reforms smacks of political cowardice and ranks this Government one of the most timid and ineffective in modern times .
" I mean you contrast this with the Hawke / Keating government where they actually introduced capital gains tax and they did that knowing it might hurt a little but knowing that Australians would benefit in the long run , " he said .
" I think this Government - well it 's certainly got less courage than the Hawke / Keating .
It 's got less courage than the Howard / Costello government .
It probably has even less courage than the Whitlam government .
" One wonders why they 're in government if they 're not going to do anything . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate approved a sweeping Wall Street reform bill on Thursday night , capping months of wrangling over the biggest overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s .
By a vote of 59 to 39 , the Senate awarded a victory to President Barack Obama , a champion of tighter rules for banks and capital markets after a 2007 - 2009 financial crisis that slammed the economy and led to massive taxpayer bailouts .
The Senate bill must now be merged with a measure approved in December by the U.S. House of Representatives .
Only then could a final package go to Obama to be signed into law , something that analysts said may happen next month .
Changes proposed in both bills -- driven by lawmakers eager to look tough on Wall Street ahead of mid-term congressional elections in November -- threaten to constrain the banking industry and reduce its profits for years to come .
Obama said the final version of the bill will hold financial firms accountable but not stifle the free market .
“ Over the last year , the financial industry has repeatedly tried to end this reform with hordes of lobbyists and millions of dollars in ads , and when they could n’t kill it they tried to water it down ....
Today , I think it ’s fair to say these efforts have failed , ” Obama said .
“ We ’ve still go some work to do , ” he added .
“ The House and the Senate will have to iron out the differences between the two bills .
And there ’s no doubt that during that time the financial industry and their lobbyists will keep on fighting . ”
On Wall Street on Thursday , the Dow Jones industrial average slid 3.6 percent , hurt by fears of Europe ’s debt crisis retarding global economic recovery , but also by uncertainty over U.S. financial reform , traders said .
Barney Frank , head of a key House panel , told CNBC it was important to complete reform soon to ease uncertainty .
He said Obama could sign a bill into law well before July 4 .
FRANK DRAWS EARLY LINE
Frank , the Democratic author of Wall Street reform in the House , on Thursday drew an early negotiating line ahead of impending talks with the Senate on a final package .
In letters to senior Senate Democrats that were obtained by Reuters , Frank said certain House proposals on financial firm regulation and bank trading limits must be preserved .
He said the House proposals were important to his home state of Massachusetts and that “ none of them threaten or weaken the broad objectives of comprehensive reform ...
I will insist that they be maintained in the final bill . ”
The letters were addressed to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , the Democratic author of the Senate bill .
Both will likely be key players , along with Frank , in the House - Senate talks .
Last - minute maneuvering on the Senate floor killed two controversial amendments : one to tighten proposed restrictions on risky trading by banks , and another exempting car dealers that do not finance their own lending to auto buyers from oversight by a new federal consumer watchdog .
Republicans withdrew the auto - dealer amendment , offered by Senator Sam Brownback , so that the bank trading amendment , offered by Democrats Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin , would not come to a vote .
It is firmly opposed by major financial firms .

Expecting such a move , Levin told reporters beforehand that it showed “ the power of Wall Street ” at work in Congress .
The Merkley - Levin amendment would have tightened language in the Senate bill on the “ Volcker rule ” proposed in January by Obama and White House economic adviser Paul Volcker .
As it stands now , the bill contains the rule , but leaves it up to regulators to write the details and possibly water it down .
Levin and Merkley said they would push in the House - Senate conference for tightening the Volcker rule provision .
The House bill already contains a watchdog exemption for auto dealers , opening the door to a deal in conference .
As approved , the Senate bill also contains a provision from Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln that would force banks to spin off their lucrative swap trading desks into affiliates .
Major financial groups such as JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Goldman Sachs could be hit hard by such a requirement , analysts said .
Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , reiterated concerns that Lincoln ’s approach “ could increase , not decrease , risk . ”
Analysts said it was unlikely to survive the conference .
It is not in the House bill .
A Big Box of Hair
Slog tipper Christine writes :
Matter of Trust is accepting donations of hair clippings from salons , sheared hair from pet groomers , etc. to make hair mats and hair booms that actually do suck up oil from oil spills .
Awesome , right ?
But they only accept bulk donations , like a big box from a salon or groomer , and they do n't provide a way for individuals to find a salon or groomer who is sending donations to them .
Maybe there 's a way to raise awareness within Seattle salons and groomers to send in , and a way for those donating places to let people in Seattle know that they are a donating site ?
Maybe , it is Slog ?
" Awesome " is not the first word that springs to mind when contemplating big boxes of dismembered human and pet hair , not to mention " hair mats and hair booms . "
( For the booms , the hair is stuffed into recycled nylons , making depraved - looking tubes — see the video below . )
But Dear Science says this is real , and furthermore :
More helpful than most of the limited choices here .
Think of the average teenager 's head ; hair can wick up quite a bit of oil .
I do n't really want to think of the average teenager 's head .
But !
Anyone know any salons that are collecting hair to send down to mop up the oil spill ?
UPDATE : Commenter stinkbug points out that this hairy issue is being addressed over in Questionland ..
Thanks , stinkbug !
Cool drizzle fell onto the grey Saturday streets of Liverpool , a light breeze tumble - weeded a sweet wrapper down the road in a clichéd fashion , and I was becoming increasingly aware that this would be the strangest conversation of my life .
And I did n’t need psychic powers for that .
For I was in the company of ‘ Psychic ’ Joe Power , fresh from his latest in - store book - signing ( signed copies of which , I add , are still on the shelves of Waterstones – supply quite exceeded demand it seems ) , and things were getting weird .
“ The thing about you sceptics , ” he said , standing on the step of a plus - size lingerie shop to raise himself to my eye - level , “ is that you sit there , festering in front of your computers at 3 am , thinking up ways to get at people .
What if I were to sit in front of your house and tell people you ’re a paedophile ? ”
“ Well , ” I say , “ that ’s for you to decide to do if you want to but it ’s not really the same thing – I ’m raising questions over what you do and the service you claim to provide ; insinuating I was a paedophile would be just a personal attack , and wildly baseless .
It ’s not really the same thing .
At all . ”
“ Oh I think they ’re very similar , ” he answers , “ because you ’re there festering , at 3 am , plotting to get at me , in the same way that paedophiles fester and plot to interfere with children – you both have to be sick in the head to do what you do . ”
With Herculean effort to suspend my natural what - the - fuck ?
reaction , and with a curt politeness that in retrospect now seems other - worldly , I manage a swift retort : “ Sorry , can I just clarify – are you comparing sceptics to paedophiles ?
Could you explain that ?
I mean , are you saying that paedophiles also ask questions of you , or what exactly ? ”
Joe : “ I think most sceptics probably are paedophiles .
I mean you ’re sat around at 3 am , plotting , are n’t you ?
Do you deny that ? ”
An-incredulous - Marsh : “ Do I deny what ?
That I ask questions ?
That I ’m sometimes awake at 3 am ?
Or that I am a paedophile ?
Could you please be clear what you ’re asking me , Joe ? ”
It ’s not often that you ’re 5 minutes into a conversation with someone you ’ve never met before and they ’ve already played the paedophile card .
I had a feeling it was going to be one of those days .
As it happens , I had n’t sat awake at 3 am plotting this at all .
In fact , although I ’d penciled in Joe ’s book - signing weeks ago as an opportunity to go along and present him with an application from for Randi ’s $ 1 m
Challenge , it was only upon arrival at the bookshop that it struck me that I had no absolutely no idea what I was going to say , or do .
I had n’t planned that far ahead .
I ’d figured I ’d wing it , have a quick five - minute chat for the benefit of the unconvinced amongst the queue of would - be signees , and be on my merry way with a first baby - step into sceptical activism successfully traversed – onwards and upwards .
Admittedly , the first hiccup in my vague plan was the total absence of a queue of would - be signees .
When I arrived at the bookshop , Joe sat alone at a specially - roped - off table , signing a pile of books – with no baying hordes nor adoring fans to dazzle .
Perhaps
I ’d missed the masses ’ arrival and departure – I could only speculate , as I ’d arrived 15 minutes after the start of the signing , and stuck around for maybe 20 or so minutes .
I saw 5 people request signatures in that time .
I felt a pang of guilt , even .
I figured I ’d wait for Colonel Molerat to arrive , then introduce myself , hand over the application form , explain what it was and leave it at that .
Alas , as I descended the stairs with the newly - arrived Molerat , we were struck by unforeseen hiccup # 2 : Joe Power had left the building .
Perhaps he was psychic after all – evidently , Molerat and I were not .
But luck was on our side – I could see Joe was stood outside the shop , with his manager Claudine Hope .
‘ In for a penny , in for a pound ’ thinks - I , introducing myself as I approach them , mentally re-citing my position : ‘ Stay polite no matter what , keep professional and calm , do n’t get goaded into saying something silly , do n’t argue , do n’t shout and do n’t lose your head ’ .
Good thing too , as it turns out .
What follows is a pretty solid account of my interview with Joe .
Initially , I had n’t planned on making a big deal of it – which is why I did n’t record anything , and why I initially verbally agreed not to use some of the… kookier allegations and insults Joe sent my way .
Indeed , it all had ended rather professionally and amicably , as was my intention .
However , a few days later I was notified of a rumour that had been posted to the excellent BadPsychics forum – which read as follows :
“ On saturday the sixth of june Joe power was attacked by group of people who surrounded him and his wife and child .
waterstones staff were witness to it .
He had just finished signing his books when he was caught as he and his family came out .
waterstones staff reckoned they were sceptics .
But I would not have thought that sceptics would be party to that only debate and disscussion would be the right thing to do .
Has anyone heard about this incident .
A security guard from the shop broke up the mob ”
The ‘ mob ’ in question consisted of Molerat and I .
The attack was the 30 - or - so - minute conversation we had with Joe and Claudine .
We spoke to his wife Claudine specifically in her capacity as his manager – she was actually rather reasonable and amicable .
Surrounding them would have proven mathematically tricky , with two of us and two of them ( although , as Colonel Molerat mentioned to me later , only Joe could tell if there were a surrounding - mob of ghosts on our side – I am not the Man Who Sees Dead People after all ) .
The security guard in question stood near us for part of the conversation , but was told by Joe and Claudine that he did not need to intervene as we were merely discussing things .
The entire rumour quoted above , unfortunately , is wildly inaccurate .
When I heard about it , I immediately emailed Joe and Claudine to give them the chance to clarify things – to date they have not responded .
We ’re also working on obtaining the CCTV footage of the incident , and will post stills from it as soon as we get that .
In the meantime , in order to set the record straight , the MSS has no choice but to tell what actually happened .
I stress that the views expressed by Joe are not the views of the MSS , and that although the direct wording of the conversation is not exactly transcribed , the subject matter and style is accurate .
Shortly after the conversation where Joe likened scepticism to paedophilia , the police arrived at the bottom of the street .
Joe paused and raised his hand to quieten me , saying , “ I want to see what the police are doing . ”
I , entirely off - handedly , told him , “ Oh , it ’s ok , they ’re just on their routine patrol I think , ” to which he ominously answered , “ No , actually they ’re not – they ’re here for you , we called them because I knew you were coming . ”
The police patrolled routinely past , and did n’t look at Joe or I once .
I ’m unsure if Joe was claiming to have called them psychically , or to have predicted my arrival in advance and prepared the police in that way – but the police took no interest in us .
Almost as if they had not been called to deal with us , and as if Joe was entirely bluffing to try and end the conversation .
Having failed to antagonise with the paedophilia slur , Joe decided next to plough a different furrow : “ Well I could set up my own website , I could set one up saying that gays are all wrong , and what right do you have to stick your cock up another man ’s arse , and screw him . ”
Charming .
His words , not mine .
“ Are you gay , by the way ? ” he added .
“ As it happens , no I ’m not , ” I politely said , getting the hang of this handing - people - enough - rope malarkey , “ and you could do that if you wanted , you could exercise your free speech and make that website .
But I think you ’d have to expect even more criticism than you ’re getting now , and a lot of very upset responses . ”
Seemingly aiming to goad me into a more confrontational position , Joe then re-iterated his point : “ But I could say that you ’re wrong to stick your cock up another man ’s arse and fuck him … ”
At which point Claudine admonished him , in what I felt sounded like serious distaste with his language and approach .
I find it interesting that he could draw a comparison between a sceptical organisation and a homophobic one – quite the false analogy .
What it might show about some of Joe ’s personal views , I could n’t comment on .
It was at this point – withouth trace of irony – that Claudine condemned me for making personal attacks on Joe , and even discussing where he lives , what car he drives , and bringing his family into things .
That ’s not something I have ever done , nor will I ever do .
Firstly , I believe it ’s important and more intellectually - honest to criticise the work rather than attack the man – the sceptical position is better - served by being professional in criticism ; personal vitriol and venomous attack only serve to alienate an audience .
Secondly , and more entertainingly , there are way way way more things to say about Joe Power ’s work than there could ever be to say about him as a person – we wo n’t be running out of material any time soon !
Joe then asked about the Randi challenge – why should he prove himself to James Randi of all people .
I explained through the obvious answers – the importance of evidence , how exciting it would be if we could prove people did have these powers , plus the $ 1 m ( “ We do n’t need the money . ”
“ Then give it to charity , Joe .
Give it to the families of the victims whose murders you helped investigate – I ’m sure they ’d appreciate the gesture ” ) .
I also pointed out the prestige and publicity involved in being officially , scientifically certified as genuine – if not for his own career ( “ I do n’t need the publicity .
I ’ve got my own book out , you know .
I ’ve just done a book signing . ”
I did n’t retort with “ A book signing that 5 people showed up to , ” because I ’m a ) not that cruel and b ) not that quick - witted ) then for the careers of mediums less successful than he .
And to expose the fakes in the industry .
“ You must personally know , surely , a lot of people in your profession who are fake , and you know they are fake and THEY know that they are fake , right Joe ? ”
Joe replied , “ Yeah , of course I know plenty ” .
“ So if you can prove you ’re real , then others who are just as psychic as you can follow suit , and the ones who are fake will be weeded out , and your whole profession would gain a lot more credibility . ”
Joe ’s next false analogy was one I ’ve heard before , in less extreme terms : “ It ’s all the same , you sceptics , you do n’t believe , you ’re all atheists ” .
I pointed out that not all sceptics are atheists , Joe disagreed : “ Well you do n’t believe in life after death so you must be atheist . ”
“ There is a difference , ” I countered , “ between life after death , and COMMUNICATING with the dead .
Christians , for example , do n’t believe that people are able to communicate with the spirit world – in fact that would be necromancy and would be a sin to even attempt .
There ’s no major religion that believes people are able to habitually communicate with the deceased ” .
That lapsed Catholicism of mine is still good for something other than a general crushing sense of guilt , it seems .
Joe : “ What do you get from this , from writing about people like that ? ”
Marsh ( with a slightly - friendly laugh ) : “ Oh , that ’s it entirely – I ’m not going to get anything from this , I wo n’t get a job or a career out of scepticism , I certainly wo n’t make any money out of all this like you do Joe .
I suppose what we get is the chance to protect people who are vulnerable from exploitation – exploitation from people like all those fake psychics you said you know of . ”
The conversation then turned to my previous article on Joe , and his involvement with specific Police inverstigations .
“ I have email communications from the police where they ask me for help on cases , ” Joe claimed , “ What can you say to that ? ”
“ Show me them , ” I answered , “ and I ’ll change my tune .
But the police have denied ever having worked with any psychic , ever ”
It was at this point that Claudine and Colonel Molerat had an interesting exhange – Claudine : “ How do you know the police all know about it ?
Maybe the people denying Joe ’s involvement are n’t aware of the individual who asked us for help . ”
Molerat : “ It was an individual then ?
Was this individual acting in an official capacity as a representative of the police force , or was he just an individual who happened to be a policeman ? ”
Joe and Claudine had no response to this .
If I were to be asked my personal opinion at the moment , I think that ’s why Joe wo n’t show the emails – I ’d say the only communication Joe ’s had ( if any at all – without showing his proof we ca n’t accept that any of it exists ) would be if someone personally contacted Joe and just so happens to be a policeman , and was not acting as an official spokesperson for any specific investigation .
Joe also spoke to me about the Lynsey Quy murder case : “ You do n’t do your research , you just repeat other sceptics ’ opinions .
The officer you quoted , Sloane , was n’t even involved in the case when I gave my information ” .
Well , Joe , I ’m not the only one who does n’t do my research .
Your website describes the case , and how Jeff Sloane replaced the chief inspector you spoke with .
His name is Geoff Sloan , as various reliable and non-sceptical sources testify .
Aside from bad spelling , the point remains – if the information Joe Power had provided on the case was in any way correct , accurate or specific enough to be useful , the new Detective Superintendent would have been told about it , and about it ’s source .
Joe then returned to the subject of testing : “ Well I would do a test but they ’re always rigged .
I just had to pull out of a test because it turned out there were two sceptics running it .
I wo n’t say anything else about that test . ”
I ca n’t be sure , but I know Joe was due to be involved in a TV show with Derren Brown .
If I were a betting man , I ’d say that was the test he ’s pulled out of – but that ’s just my opinion / guess .
“ But why ca n’t it be a sceptic and someone independent , ” he continued , “ and we leave it to the independent person to decide . ”
I answered , “ Because a sceptic , by definition , IS independent – they just want to follow truth and logic .
Whereas the third party or a believer might not know the skills that people like the guys you openly admit are fakes can use .
How can they tell the difference between yourself and one of the fakes you talked about just using cold reading ?
A sceptic can do the research and find out all about that , and ensure the test is as fair as possible ” .
Joe : “ But what about all the grieving people , the thousands of people who have invited me into their homes and I ’ve connected to their dead little boys – if I was a fraud the people of Liverpool would never fall for that , never accept that . ”
I replied : “ Well that ’s it – there are people who are frauds who DO do that , and grieving people fall for it because they are in such vulnerable state .
How do we tell the difference between you and those fakes ? ”
Joe : “ But why should I prove anything ? ” Marsh : “ Because any claim that is unusual needs proof before it is to be believed .
Show one bit of real proof and I ’ll back you to the hilt .
It ’s like if I said I could fly , and I charged money to teach others how to do it – you ’d want to see me fly before some poor sod jumps out of a window . ”
One thing Joe was very determined to go on record on was James Randi : “ He ’s the most boring , uneducated man I ’ve ever met .
Just look at his face , he ’s so boring ” Marsh : “ Just to clarify , when did you meet him ? ”
Joe : “ Well I ’ve not met him , but I ’ve heard of him .
Just look at his face , he ’s so boring .
And he ’s a frustrated medium , that ’s what he is – he tried to do it and he failed .
He used to attend a spiritualist church even . ”
As I pointed out to Joe at the time , Randi did mentalism as part of his magic act , and attended a spiritualist church – to debunk it !
Again , Joe , it really is worth doing proper homework on these things , I ’d advise reading Randi ’s book Flim Flam , where he recounts the whole tale of the spiritualist church , and the debunking of the use of the old Billet - Reading trick he found there .
Furthermore , how can someone be a failed medium – if you really are genuinely seeing the dead , how can someone who had ‘ the gift ’ try to do it and fail ?
The conversation , by this point , had clearly bested Joe , as he reverted back to gauche attempts to irk and goad us .
“ What if I tell you , right now , the exact day and time you ’re going to die ? ” he gloated , “ The exact date and time you ’re gonna croak it .
What would you say to that ? ” I replied in good humour : “ Well , I ’d probably put some kind of bet on it ” .
Colonel Molerat in fact went one better , and offered to put £ 50 on Joe ’s prediction of my expiry , but alas Joe did n’t give us a date .
I even offered to make it simple for him , “ Actually , if you ’d like you could tell me the date and time I was born .
Because I already know that answer , so I we check easily . ”
Joe declined .
One final note on this – Claudine expressed her desire that this stay off the record , because sceptics ‘ twist everything that ’s said , to make Joe look bad ’ .
I ’d just like to re-iterate that I ’m only publishing this account to clear up the erroneous reports that we had mobbishly surrounded and attacked Joe – we did n’t want accounts of our peaceful and professional encounter twisted to make us look bad .
If there ’s anything in the above account that Joe or Claudine feel does not accurately reflect the conversation we had , I ’ll be more than happy to listen to their concerns , and if I ’ve misremembered any details I ’m happy to finesse the account .
With an open and honest dialogue , I ’m sure we can get to the truth on these things – and if at any point Joe is able to offer any kind of proof of his gift that holds up to any kind of serious scrutiny , I will personally become his number one advocate .
I ’ll run the fan club .
I ’ll wear the T - Shirt .
Hell , I ’d even buy one of the many signed books that are still sitting on the shelves in Waterstones .
But personally , I do n’t predict that will happen any time soon …

These movie trailer re-cuts are what happens when fans of movies sit around and think , " what if I made someone think my favorite horror movie is actually a buddy comedy ? " .

KAMPALA , Uganda —
As storm clouds brewed in the near distance , about 1,300 people gathered at the grassy Makerere University sports grounds here for a special Sunday afternoon rally and prayer service that , its organizers said , was to discuss homosexuality , witchcraft , corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country ’s presidential election next year .
The guest of honor , Lou Engle , an American evangelical from Kansas City , bowed up and down from his knees at the front of the stage .
Mr. Engle , who helped found TheCall Ministries , a prayer group that focuses on moral issues , arrived last week in Uganda , where TheCall has opened a new chapter .
His trip comes amid a heated debate throughout the country over a bill that would ban advocacy of gay rights and suggests the death penalty for homosexuals who have AIDS and engage in sexual relations .
Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda , as in several other poor African nations .
Last fall , Uganda ’s Parliament began discussion of the sweeping bill , which has brought threats of aid cuts to Uganda , and has focused attention on several American pastors and politicians who have come here and offered themselves as experts on what they consider the scourge of homosexuality .
Broadcaster Louis Theroux talks to Matthew Stadlen about how he chooses stories for his films , how he developed his style as a presenter , who makes him laugh and how Matt could make him angry .
Louis Theroux : America 's Medicated Kids is on BBC Two on Sunday , 18 April , at 2100 BST

This clip from the very soggy streets of Nashville , TN shows some kids having a brilliantly good time using a Nissan Pathfinder to go water - skiing in a flooded parking lot .
Of course cops step in to enforce ... uh , the law ?
Nashville has seen some pretty wild weather lately , resulting in flooded streets , floating houses , and several unfortunate deaths .
Not all is doom and gloom , though .
Advertisement
These kids decided to take advantage of the situation and have some fun , using a Nissan Pathfinder as a tow vehicle for a little impromptu neighborhood water - skiing .
Nashville police decided " being creative " and " having a good time " really chafed their buzz cuts so they put an end to the good time .
It 's unclear exactly what law was being broken here , but to us it looks like turning soggy lemons into lemonade .
( Hat tip to Stephen ! )

Intravenous delivery of a cancer - targeting virus is successful in destroying cancer cells that have spread throughout the body , according to research to be presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 13th Annual Meeting .
A recent study tested 23 patients with metastasized colorectal , skin , ovarian and lung cancers .
Patients received a single intravenous treatment at one of five dose levels .
In 75 percent of patients who received the highest doses , the therapy reached and replicated within tumors throughout the body , effectively stopping cancer growth .
Some patients on the lower doses also saw disease stabilization .
All dose levels were well tolerated , with patients experiencing only mild side effects , such as flu - like symptoms .
“ This is the first time that we ’ve been able to treat patients intravenously and had proven success in targeting and destroying metastatic cancers in the body with an armed oncolytic virus product , ” said David H. Kirn , MD .
“ This opens up a whole new world of systemic approaches to therapy . ”
Gene therapy has been used before to fight cancer , but previous treatments were limited to localized tumors .
Intravenous delivery allows for whole - body treatment .
Kirn said the study opens the door to retest existing genetic or protein treatments that had previously been limited to patients with localized tumors .
Researchers will begin a Phase III trial later this year in patients with liver cancer .

The number of women MPs has edged up , and women are likely to make up about 21.5 % of the Commons , from 19.5 % before the election , according to the Centre for Women and Democracy , and the Fawcett Society .
From their press release :
The number of Labour women has fallen from 94 to below 80 – about 30 % of Labour MPs ..
The number of Conservative women has risen from 18 to about 48 – about 16 % of Conservative MPs .
The number of Liberal Democrat women has fallen from 9 to 7 – about 13 % of Liberal Democrat MPs
These figures are provisional in that they do not include the 23 seats still to declare at the time of writing ; however , statistically these seats can make little difference to the outcome .
Nan Sloane , director at the Centre for Women and Democracy , commented : “ These figures are a real disappointment and demonstrate that , despite the political parties ’ efforts to increase the percentage of women MPs , no real advance has been made at this election .
Indeed , had there not been an unusually high number of MPs retiring , and had there not been a relatively high number of women standing in those seats , we would have seen an actual and significant fall in both the number and the percentage of women in the House of Commons .
“ In our view the time has now come for radical action – no constitutional or electoral reform will have democratic validity unless it ensures the full participation of women at the most senior levels of our political life .
Until we take some clear and effective steps to rectify the position we will continue to lag behind most of the rest of Europe , and it will take decades – if not centuries – to rectify the position . ”

I.M. Pei has been called the most important living modern architect , defining the landscapes of some of the world ’s greatest cities .
A monumental figure in his field and a laureate of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize , Pei is the senior statesman of modernism and last surviving link to such great early architects as Corbusier , Gropius , and Mies van der Rohe .
Entering into the twilight of his career and well into his eighties , Pei returns to his ancestral home of Suzhou , China to work on his most personal project to date .
He is commissioned to build a modern museum in the city ’s oldest neighborhood which is populated by classical structures from the Ming and Qing dynasties .
For the architect who placed the pyramid at the Louvre , the test to integrate the new with the old is familiar but still difficult .
The enormous task is to help advance China architecturally without compromising its heritage .
In the end , what began as his greatest challenge and a labor of sentiment , says Pei , ultimately becomes “ my biography . ”
American Masters ’s I.M. Pei : Building China Modern follows
Pei on this historic journey to define China ’s architectural vision as it comes into its own on the world stage .
“ I.M . Pei is an architectural poet – a living legend , ” says Susan Lacy , series creator and executive producer of American Masters , a seven - time winner of the Emmy Award for Outstanding Primetime Non-Fiction Series .
“ He ’s among the league of rare American masters whose artistic sensibilities have both provoked public debate and transformed our notions of what is possible , of how tradition can be honored in the 21st century . ”
The film captures Pei as he forges an architectural language that brings together Western modernity and Eastern tradition into a current synthesis .
After decades of living in the U.S. and amassing unprecedented international acclaim for his projects , Pei returns as a “ foreigner ” to his birth country to give a new direction for Chinese architecture in which history can live in the midst of change .
In effect , Pei , who has contributed to America ’s urban landscape during the height of its architectural and engineering power is now helping China do the same .
Few architects have played such a critical dual role .
With an agenda of change , Pei inevitably enters into a crucible of conflict in Suzhou .
For those concerned about the loss of traditional forms of architectural identity , he is too modern .
For those who would simply bulldoze China ’s past , he is too tradition - minded .
Adding to the already complex assignment , he faces the controversy of displacing residents living at the museum site .
To meet the design challenges , Pei draws on ideas that stretch far back within his own life and work – including a 1946 thesis project at Harvard , where he was taught abstract modern architecture .
Throughout his education and career , Pei maintains his “ impossible dream ” to bring together modernity and traditional , regional influences ( including nature ) in his work .
Eight years in the making , American Masters ’ I.M. Pei : Building China Modern traces
Pei ’s pursuit of that dream and explores the defining conflicts of our age – the lure of the modern versus the pull of history .
The result is a surprisingly revealing and intimate portrait of the man who set as his goal nothing less than the redefinition of architecture in modern China .

Performance Scaling with HD 5870 Date 15th May 2010 Author dirtyd Editor James " Agg " Rolfe Manufacturer AMD
Introduction , Setup , Overclocking
 Bottleneck  is a term often used loosely when discussing the performance characteristics of PC gaming .
Hopefully an explanation of a bottle isnt necessary , but you never know ...
Ultimate performance is the liquid that enthusiasts want to gush out of their machine ( although I m sure OCAU beer would be grudgingly accepted by most ) .
But there 's always something holding performance back , and the bottleneck of a computer system can be any one of several components , depending on the task in question .
Map loading in games , for example , is largely dependent on secondary storage ( hard drive ) speeds .
General single - threaded application performance is largely dependent on CPU architecture and frequency .
Professional 3D rendering thrives on CPU core count .
Databases love lots of fast memory .
But how about high resolution gaming ?
General opinion has it that the GPU will be the main bottleneck ; meaning that upgrading other components such as the CPU or RAM will have a negligible effect on performance .
But is that always the case ?
Questions fly on the OCAU forums from members wondering if purchasing a particular piece of hardware is worth it , given they play  X game at  Y resolution with  Z other hardware .
OCAU is based around overclocking components , so instead of throwing a number of different CPU and GPU models at a set of tests , this article will focus on the effect of overclocking a Phenom II CPU , a Radeon 5870 GPU , and a combination of the two ; all at  Full HD  resolution - 1920x1080 .
From this we hope to see exactly where the bottleneck for our system is , for various games , and how they respond to overclocking .
Test system specification and rendering options :
All games were set to the highest possible image quality , with the following exceptions meriting explanation .
Crysis : WARHEAD ran with the  Very High ( tweaked )  setting in the HWBench benchmarking tool , with 16 x Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) on all tests
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Call of Pripyat used the benchmark applications   Ultra preset with  Enhanced full dynamic lighting ( DX11 )  , HDAO - a new higher quality Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) technique - , tessellation and contact hardening shadows all enabled .
It s worth bearing these conditions in mind when comparing to other reviews and benchmarks around the web , as writers will often use an in - game preset for continuity with previous tests .
Overclocking :
The Radeon 5870 GPU ( or any other ATI model ) can be overclocked a few different ways .
Most easily , ATIs Catalyst suite provides an  OverDrive function .
This has a pre-determined clock ceiling ; presumably to keep thermal properties under control and minimise the chances of an eager newbie frying their expensive GPU .
Flashing the BIOS of the GPU requires a little more research and effort , yet offers the possibility of noticeably higher performance .
Like all overclocking , the flip - side is more heat , higher power draw , and more risk of damage to your hardware .
This might be old news to most but there are always a few readers that arent aware , so its a good warning to repeat .
The GPUs  core voltage was bumped up from 1.1625 V to 1.2625 V , allowing a relatively conservative 100MHz increase to 950MHz .
The memory wasnt spared , getting the same 100 mV increase for a total 1.25V , enabling 1350MHz from the retail 1250MHz .
The Phenom II CPU was clocked up to 3.914GHz ( 19 x multiplier with a HTT clock of 206 ) for an increase of roughly 500MHz , whilst the RAM boosted to 1098MHz with the same 5 - 5 - 5 - 15 timings .
The CPUs internal north bridge nudged up to a fairly modest 2.47GHz , compared to the stock 2GHz .
So , with more CPU & GPU cycles per second , a faster L3 cache , higher memory bandwidth & GPU memory bandwidth , what gains can be achieved at high resolution gaming ?
Is GPU bottlenecking  still holding back gamers at  Full HD , or is overclocking your CPU just as useful as overclocking your GPU ?

Crude oil oozed into US wetlands Friday as furious Louisiana officials accused BP of destroying fragile marshes and leaving coastal fishing communities in ruin .
As delicate marshlands in the Mississippi Delta faced an environmental nightmare , BP conceded after days of pressure that it had underestimated the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico .
Just how much oil is gushing from a pipe ruptured when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank a month ago has been a contentious issue , with BP putting the figure at 5,000 barrels — or 210,000 gallons — a day .
ADVERTISEMENT
But BP spokesman Mark Proegler said Thursday that 5,000 barrels were being siphoned away each day from the leak by a mile - long ( 1,600 meter ) insertion tube device , and live television pictures showed a significant quantity still streaming out .
“ Now that we are collecting 5,000 barrels a day , it might be a little more than that , ” he told AFP .
Independent experts have warned the flow could be at least 10 times higher .
With thick patches of oil tarring coastal Louisiana marshes , a haven for migratory birds and rare wildlife that will be virtually impossible to clean up , local leaders have started to despair .
“ Twenty - four miles ( nearly 39 kilometers ) of Plaquemines Parish is destroyed .
Everything in it is dead , ” Billy Nungesser , head of the parish in southern Louisiana , told US cable news station MSNBC .
“ There is no life in that marsh .
You wo n’t clean it up . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We ’ve been begging BP to step up to the plate , ” said Nungesser .
He said the slick was “ destroying our marsh , inch by inch , ” and would keep on coming ashore for weeks and months .
An increasingly desperate BP says a “ top kill ” operation to try to cap the leak for good , by filling the well with heavy drilling fluids and then sealing it with cement , could begin as early as Sunday .
But for Louisiana ’s fragile wetlands the measure may come too late .
ADVERTISEMENT
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has been on a personal crusade in recent weeks to force the US government and BP to build sand islands to protect the shoreline and fragile island nature reserves .
“ It is clear from what we saw on Fourchon Beach and Thunder Bayou today that the oil is here .
It is in our marsh , like we saw yesterday in Pass a Loutre , and it is on our shores , ” he said after overflying the stricken areas .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We are very concerned that this is just the beginning , ” Jindal said , warning it could be too late to save 60,000 jobs in Louisiana ’s three - billion - dollar fishing industry .
“ This spill fundamentally threatens Louisiana ’s way of life .
The oil is here , but we are still waiting on the US Army Corps of Engineers to approve our sand boom plan to help keep oil out of our marshes and off of our shores . ”
The neighboring states of Alabama and Mississippi have also been affected by the toxic slick , and Florida ’s tourist beaches and coral reefs could be next .
ADVERTISEMENT
The state ’s governor extended a state of emergency to four southern counties as experts said the slick had entered a powerful current dragging it towards beaches and fragile reefs .
The Loop Current could carry oil ashore within days , as well as up the US East Coast and even into the Gulf Stream .
Oil in the current could cause massive damage to the rich marine wildlife that rides the ocean super - highway from spawning zones to areas where they mature , experts warned .
On Thursday , US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he was hopeful BP would succeed in finally sealing the leak from the well .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Our hope is what they call the dynamic kill of this well will happen on Sunday .
And that it will be killed .
Everything is being done to make sure that happens , ” Salazar told CNN .
“ Our priority is to stop the well from leaking because that ’s where the cancer is and we need to get that stopped . ”
Amid rising concerns that the chemical dispersants used by BP may also be endangering marine life , US officials have given the firm a 24 - hour deadline to choose a less toxic chemical to break up the slick .
The administration also kept up pressure on British Petroleum , with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson demanding daily public updates on the leak .

“ The public and the United States government are entitled to nothing less than complete transparency , ” they told the oil fim , which on Thursday bowed to Democratic pressure to provide a live online video feed of the leak .

Possible Spoilers !
During this trip down memory lane , I 'm going to talk about Final Fantasy VII and why it left such a great impact on gamers around the world , including me !
Final Fantasy VII was released in North America during September of 1997 .
I was in fifth grade elementary school at the time , most likely busy with my school work while anticipating Christmas .
I had not owned a PlayStation until October of that year because I was mostly a Nintendo / Sega person at the time .
I owned a Nintendo 64 and assumed that would be the only console I would ever need to own for the future .
I thought " PlayStation " sounded like some sort of child 's diaper - changing station .
I was n't reading gaming sites or blogs at that time , so how would a child know anything about an unknown console from Sony ?
So why did I even buy a PlayStation ?
Oh , now I remember .
I was ( and still am ) a huge fan of the Mega Man series .
So when Mega Man X4 was released on the PlayStation in October of 1997 , I knew I had to do whatever means necessary to play the latest installment of the Mega Man X series .
I had never even played a Final Fantasy game or even knew about the latest release of the series .
I can't remember the exact date , but it must have been December or late November when one of my good friends at the time had picked up Final Fantasy VII for his PlayStation .
This particular friend 's parents were divorced , so he seemed to always have every game and every system that was available .
Other kids were envious of him , including me .
My friend told me about this amazing new game , Final Fantasy VII .
Well , I was n't going to ignore a game suggestion , so if I remember correctly , I rented Final Fantasy VII from Blockbuster .
First of all , it was the only game I had seen that had 3 discs !
" THREE discs !
That must be one epic game ! "
I must have thought .
Well , I turned on my PlayStation and selected New Game from the game menu .
I was treated to an amazing CG ( Computer Generated ) cutscene that acted as the opening to the game .
" Well THAT was amazing , " I must have thought .
My early relationship with Final Fantasy VII quickly dissolved as the game started and I encountered a random battle , typical in RPG games .
Well , I had never even played a traditional turn - based Japanese RPG .
I was very confused as I was taken into a random battle facing two enemies versus my character .
How could I attack ?!
There was a menu at the bottom of the screen .
It had the options Attack , Magic , and Item .
" Uh Oh , " I thought .
This was outside of my gaming comfort zone .
I had never played a game that used menus to attack before , so I did n't think this game could be any fun .
Games from series such as Mario , Mega Man , and Zelda all had characters that you controlled when fighting other enemies .
These types of the games were the only ones I had ever played .
Final Fantasy VII was my first Japanese RPG .
I thought the game could n't possibly be fun having to choose what actions my characters do , so I turned my PlayStation off and later returned the game to Blockbuster .
I had previously mentioned to my Dad that Final Fantasy VII must be a great game since my friend loved it .
Well , I did n't realize it , but after telling my Dad that , he had gone to the store and already secretly purchased it for my Christmas present .
After playing Final Fantasy VII for the first time by myself from Blockbuster , I was disappointed and told my Dad that Final Fantasy VII was a terrible game .
So he secretly returned my Christmas present without me realizing it .
I think it was n't until I went over to my friend 's house or he came to mine that I actually got to see what was after the beginning area of Final Fantasy VII .
It was after he played the game and showed me how the fighting system worked that I got to experience more of the story and be drawn into this deep and engaging world .
After that happened , I must have told my Dad that Final Fantasy VII was an amazing game .
Well , he had had enough of going behind the scenes trying to buy me Christmas presents , so he confessed that he had already bought the game once and returned it based on my comments .
So yeah , he ended up having to buy Final Fantasy VII twice .
Final Fantasy VII was such a revolutionary game for me in many ways .
It was the first game I had ever played that used in - game cinema movies .
This absolutely blew me away .
Of course , this is nothing special now , but at the time , this was a new element to video games .
The characters were 3D models ( horribly constructed polygons , I might add ) that were placed on pre-rendered backgrounds .
There is something magical about playing games that make use of pre-rendered backgrounds .
It 's as if every scene was masterfully created by an artist for the sole purpose of you , the player , to walk through and study all the intricate details .
Starting with the PlayStation 2 , Final Fantasy games would steer away from using pre-rendered backgrounds and be in complete 3D .
This does n't make a Final Fantasy game bad , but I felt the wonderful details in scenery were lost in that transition .
That 's why I always fondly study the scenes in Final Fantasy VII when I play .
Am I the only one that feels this way ?
Of course , what makes a great game is not necessarily good graphics .
Final Fantasy VII had amazing graphics at the time , but they are very outdated now .
Despite that , the amazing story , fun battle system , and unique characters all came together to form an amazing RPG experience .
I know there are some people that do not like Final Fantasy VII , and that 's okay .
Some people complain about the mistakes in translation , the break away from traditional fantasy setting , or how overhyped the game can seem by fans .
Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy game and remains my absolute favorite of the series .
Younger gamers might feel that Final Fantasy X , the first FF game for the PlayStation 2 , is the best .
That 's fine with me , but I do hope those people will attempt to play older Final Fantasy games and give them a chance .
I did this with Final Fantasy VI for the Super Nintendo .
( Or Final Fantasy III as it was known in the US ) Final Fantasy VI would have been an amazing game for me had I played it as a child .
The graphics do not wow me as they would have if it was still a 16 - bit world .
( And I 'm sure the same can be said about people that play VII for the first time now )
But that 's all right ; I recognize that Final Fantasy VI is still an amazing game .
It 's not my favorite , but I like and respect it .
The plot of Final Fantasy VII is long and complicated , so I am just going to throw a few points out there .
The full plot of Final Fantasy VII can be found online for those that are interested .
In the beginning of Final Fantasy VII , the main character Cloud has just joined a rebel group that is trying to destroy reactors that are harming / destroying the planet .
When I first started , I thought the game was going to be about going to each reactor and doing the same thing over and over again .
Well , something happens that completely changes the direction of the scenario you thought was going to happen .
Rather than Shinra , the organization that is the main enemy in the beginning , a new enemy known as Sephiroth emerges .
To me , Sephiroth is one of the greatest villains in video game history .
He 's seen as someone to be admired and respected in the beginning .
However , as more of the story is revealed , the player witnesses Sephiroth lose his sanity and turn into a very powerful enemy .
The game constantly reminds you of his power and how weak you are in comparison .
Sure , I had played games with bosses before , but I think Sephiroth was the first villain to make me somewhat nervous / afraid due to his theme music .
Speaking of music , Final Fantasy VII has some of the best video game music around .
The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu who did most of the music for the Final Fantasy series until recently .
As a matter of fact , I am listening to the original Final Fantasy VII music as I write this .
Later in the game , there is a main character that dies .
This was so shocking for my friend and I , as well as many people all over the world .
How could they have killed off that character ?
I do n't believe I had ever seen the death of a person handled in such a way like Final Fantasy VII portrayed it .
The Mario , Zelda , and Megaman series are fast games where if one dies , you simply start over .
There was no such thing as a supporting character dying , or at least one you really cared about .
The closest to a character dying I can think of that was somewhat tragic was the death of " Zero " from MegaMan X1 on the SNES .
But that death was nothing compared to the character death in Final Fantasy VII .
There was no blood or anything , but there was music and the characters in the game reacted to the death .
A person that had been with you early on in the game would no longer talk with you .
You 'd never get to interact with that character again .
It 's not like this was near the end of the game , this was only near the end of the first disc .
My adventure was nowhere near over and I already felt like I lost someone special .
That moment was very unique in video games , or at least in my experience with them .
Another thing that makes Final Fantasy VII so special is the expansiveness of the world itself .
Once your team of characters escapes the starting city known as Midgar , you realize just how much of an adventure lies ahead .
There are so many towns to visit with different characters and personalities .
When I entered or left towns , I would wonder what all the people would do when I was not there .
It 's so fun to think about !
Have you ever read a book and wondered what the characters did after the ending or when you were n't reading to progress the story ?
The feeling is like that .
We develop these universes from the games in our mind and can continue developing them if our imagination is powerful enough .
It 's funny how I 've changed since I first played Final Fantasy VII .
When I was young , I mostly played with the characters that I considered the " main " ones .
They were the characters that joined you early in the game such as Tifa , Barret , and Aeris .
I rarely wanted to play with the characters that join the party much later in the game .
Now that I 'm playing it in 2010 , I 'm actually using some of the later characters and enjoying it .
When in battle , besides using weapons , characters could use magic through the use of " materia " which could be equipped to characters to give them various abilities .
This was such a unique concept for me .
Most of the games I had played before Final Fantasy VII usually had set upgrades or weapons .
I had never encountered something like the materia system .
If one was clever , he / she could link materia together to really perform some excellent magic / tricks in battle .
Looking back , I do n't think I was very good at using materia effectively .
Now I find myself looking up different materia combinations in order to get a jump - start on the enemy .
Now that I think of it , I was n't very concerned with weapon or materia stats when I was younger .
I just cared about the weapon that dealt the most damage , which was a major mistake .
Going back now , I carefully inspect every new available weapon and weigh the pros and cons of other stats and not just strength .
Well , at least I learned , right ?
Getting near the end of the game , your characters have to go down into a crater at the northern continent to face off against Sephiroth .
Wow , this was certainly an exciting way to lead to the final part of the game .
Once your characters make it to the bottom of the crater and fight a boss , they are taken even deeper inside the crater where Sephiroth awaited to prevent you from stopping his plans .
Could a final boss be any more epic ?
The fight with Sepiroth starts and you 're anxious to beat him as fast as possible .
My jaw dropped after I beat Sephiroth in the first battle .
After defeating Sephiroth for the first time , he comes back in a SECOND form !
This time he 's even more powerful and has a crazy summon spell that has to be seen to be believed .
After beating Sephiroth 's second form , it 's assumed that he 's finally gone .
Cloud and the others start heading back up the crater but there is actually one more battle with Sephiroth , but this time it 's only the main character fighting .
Once that 's over , the game 's amazing cut scene starts .
The ending cut scene of Final Fantasy VII is about 13 minutes , and wow !
It 's extremely suspenseful .
How did I feel about the ending when I was younger ?
I think I was a bit confused by the ending and felt somewhat cheated by how the game ended .
Now that I watch the ending as an adult , I actually feel that it's a warm ending , and a message of hope and the power of faith in humanity .
I still think the ending left a lot to be desired in terms of closure .
I knew the planet was not destroyed , but that was n't enough .
After spending countless hours with characters and being in towns , I wanted to see what happened to them .
How were those people continuing to live their lives ?
In the SNES ( Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) game , The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past , the ending of the game shows every character that appeared in the game continuing with their lives after the final battle is over .
I suppose that 's the reason I wanted the same thing for Final Fantasy VII .
So , after 1997 , the universe of Final Fantasy VII was sealed up , never to be reopened .
It was n't until 2005 that the Final Fantasy VII universe would be revisited .
SquareEnix , the company that developed Final Fantasy VII , released a Final Fantasy VII movie .
A movie !
And it supposedly would take place two years after the game ending .
It was called " Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children " .
The hype was incredibly strong .
I remember always checking websites for the latest screenshots / developments .
I watched the teaser trailer countless times .
I would get a chance to be reunited with the characters I spent so many hours adventuring with together .
The movie was released in 2005 on DVD in Japan .
I 'll never forget that the movie was actually leaked on the Internet before the official Japanese release date .
I remember waiting for it to download .
When night fell , the download had finished and I watched the movie without English subtitles .
It was n't until the next day that a fansub group had released external subtitles to be paired with the movie file .
I rewatched the film after getting my hands on the subtitles .
The beginning of the movie contained this statement from the director , " To those who loved this world ... and have spent their time together with their companions in this world in the past : reunite once again to endure this time .
" So what did I think of the movie ?
There were good points and bad .
The movie itself was absolutely stunning .
The 3D animation , the characters , and the world itself were beautifully rendered .
I got to see the characters I spent so much time adventuring with become even more alive .
They looked better , had facial expressions , and even voices .
The action scenes were amazing and kept me on the edge , especially the final battle .
Let 's talk about the music .
The Final Fantasy games are known for their fantastic music composition thanks to the great composer Nobuo Uematsu .
Because of this , I was expecting great things from the movie since Uematsu was in charge of the film 's score .
My opinion is mixed on the overall music used in the movie .
There are orchestrated / revamped versions of songs from the game that are stunning .
For the music that is original to the film , I found them not so great .
As for aspects of the film that bothered me , the plot was somewhat confusing or uninteresting .
The movie introduced new villains that were subpar .
It was only after Kadaj , one of the three new villains , ended up resurrecting Sephiroth that I felt Cloud and his party were actually in trouble .
After watching the teaser for the movie so many times , I think I ended up imagining how the film would turn out , and Advent Children was different than I expected .
I blame the teaser trailer for being different and giving off a completely different feeling .
There were n't only new villains ; there was a new character in this story .
Denzel is an orphan that was living with Cloud until Cloud himself became ill .
I felt Denzel was utterly a pointless character and I had no sympathy for him nor did I care about his situation .
I think the movie failed in that area .
I did n't care about Denzel or the new villains because I thought the movie did n't do a proper job of introducing them and convincing the audience they were real characters worth caring about and that they belong in the Final Fantasy VII universe .
Cloud , the main character , was mostly depressed and unwilling to fight until near the end of the movie .
It did n't make a lot of sense to me until I went back later and read a lengthy write - out of the plot on Wikipedia .
Maybe that 's why I feel another movie is needed .
I felt I waited forever just to see Cloud " wake up " enough for the final battle .
The ending to Advent Children is perhaps a little bit better than the game .
At least all the characters are together in the end and Cloud realizes he did n't need to be depressed because in his words , " I 'm not alone . "
I think it was very emotional to see one of the characters that died from the game appear to Cloud in the end .
Maybe I 'm the only one that thought that part was a great moment and a way to give service to fans .
Okay , so those were my thoughts on the original movie .
Since that time , there has been a new version of the film released on Blue - Ray called " Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children Complete " .
It includes 20 minutes of new footage placed throughout the movie .
I recently sat down to watch it to see how I felt about it compared to the original .
The new version includes scenes that do help the audience sympathize more with Denzel the orphan , as well as better explaining some of the plot that appeared confusing in the original .
The score for the movie slightly changed as well .
I could hear some more themes from the game in the movie , which made it much better than the previous songs used .
Overall , I think the movie itself is the best treat for fans of Final Fantasy VII .
I am so grateful that this movie was made so that fans could have one more look into that universe .
How does the movie stand alone as a movie ?
It does n't .
It looks pretty , but would be really difficult for a non-Final Fantasy player to understand or get into .
This movie is strictly fan service for the fans that love the game .
When Sony showed off the PlayStation 3 for the first time , SquareEnix had a tech demo running that showed the intro scene from Final Fantasy VII being rendered in real time .
I remember seeing the video and hearing everywhere cheer when they saw a very impressive Cloud character model jump down from the train .
This Cloud looked like he jumped out of the Advent Children movie and into a new game .
He no longer looked like a little polygonal character with spiked hair from the original PlayStation .
I do n't know about other Final Fantasy VII fans , but I was very excited to see that tech demo .
It gave hope to the many fans of the world that perhaps SquareEnix was going to remake Final Fantasy VII and make an even better world for the players to explore .
As of this writing , the folks at SquareEnix have stated that there are no current plans to remake Final Fantasy VII on current generation game consoles .
Another indicator for the reason that SquareEnix is avoiding a remake is the problems that occurred in the development of Final Fantasy XIII for the PS3 and XBox 360 .
Gamers called the game very linear because the developers did not have the resources , time , or manpower to create open worlds with towns and places to explore .
It is simply too time consuming and expensive to create games like the old Final Fantasy games of the 90s on consoles capable of HD graphics .
Well , that 's the reasons I 've heard from the developers , anyway .
Here 's my take on a Final Fantasy VII remake : I do n't need a complete remake .
I want an " enhanced " version .
Fix the polygon models and update the 3D parts , but leave in the pre-rendered backgrounds .
The cut scenes could be remade using the 3D animation style from the Advent Children movie .
Boom , a remade Final Fantasy VII without the need for a completely 3D game like Final Fantasy XIII .
I 've seen users take the PC version of Final Fantasy VII and add custom patches to make the game look spectacular .
I think that would be the best way to approach a Final Fantasy VII remake .
It makes the old fans happy to see their game get a slight update in visuals and it attracts new players that might not have tried the game before due to being put off by the horrible looking polygonal characters from the PlayStation era .
In conclusion , Final Fantasy VII was a breath - taking game , and one that left its mark on my life .
No matter what spin - offs or games are released , I will always have the original PlayStation version in my mind , where all the characters are still living peacefully .
Thank you for traveling down memory lane with me .

Sexual violence is used as a weapon of war and with extraordinary brutality
By Anne Mawathe
BBC News , Goma
'' The rebel leader asked me two things : ' Do you want us to be your husbands ?
Or do you want us to rape you ? ' "
Congolese mother - of - eight Clementine speaks in a quiet and hesitant voice : " I chose to be raped . "
She explains : " I told myself , if I tell them that I want to be their wife , they will kill my husband .
I did n't want my children growing up saying the one that made our father die is our mother . "
Every time they see this woman , they see someone they were not able to protect

But that sacrifice was not enough .
Her husband left her for another woman .
" After they raped me , my husband hated me .
He said I was dirty .
I often ask myself : ' Surely , I gave up my dignity for him , how come he can abandon me this way ? ' "
Margot Wallstrom , the UN 's special representative on sexual violence in conflict recently said the Democratic Republic of Congo was the " rape capital of the world " .
A host of different armed groups roam parts of eastern DR Congo and all are accused of horrific violence against women .
' Failures '
Clementine says she will not marry again : " He is the husband I chose when I took my vows in the church .
If God wills , he will return . ''
It seems to be a forlorn hope .
Jocelyn Kelly , a researcher with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative 's Gender - Based Violence programme , says the men that have survived these attacks on their families are extremely traumatised themselves : " They say : ' I can no longer look at my wife . '
And every time they see this woman , they see someone they were not able to protect .
They feel like failures and the only way they can deal with it is to reject their wife and start over . "
This is part of the damage that has been caused by people like Emmanuel , a former child soldier who is now 22 years old .
Rebel groups complain that they are left to fend for themselves in the forests
He fought with the CNDP rebel group .
Emmanuel says that they raped to show their anger with the authorities for neglecting them .
" Soldiers or rebels usually rape because we stay in isolated places and we do n't get our pay - even if it can come , it does n't come on time .
" After living for a long time in the forest , you do n't see women and so if one woman shows up then all of us , we profit . "
Weapon of war But Congolese women 's rights activist and vice - president of the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom , Marie - Claire Faray argues that men like Emmanuel are taking advantage of the vulnerability of women .
If they can't control themselves then they are at the level of an animal
Marie - Claire Faray
Congolese women 's rights activist
DR Congo is world ' rape capital ' DR Congo rape crisis ' spreading '
" What is their cause ?
This is nothing to do with women , " she says .
" It does n't make sense .
They are getting some form of pleasure out of it and it has nothing to do with fighting for a cause . "
Sexual violence is used as a weapon of war and with extraordinary brutality : Gang rape is commonplace ; and objects such as gun butts are sometimes used .
At a centre in the main eastern Congolese town of Goma , where rape survivors are brought from various villages for medical attention , 57 women are singing and dancing to the beat of a drum .
Their ululations and agile dancing mask their fear .
Even though the worst has already happened .
Cold and emotionless
In one of the rooms , a heavy foul smell suffocates the air .
At first impression , it gives the impression of a toilet that is not clean .
It was n't .
The smell was coming from the women themselves .
Some of them are suffering from fistula whose manifestation is the uncontrollable passage of urine and in some cases , faeces .
It is estimated that 14 women are raped each day in eastern DR Congo
One 15 - year - old is drumming as hard as she can .
Her experiences exemplify this complex war raging against women .
She was abducted by 10 rebels from the Interahamwe group accused of carrying out the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda .
They kept her for about a year as a sex slave .
'' They would rape me in turns .
It got to a point where I did not feel pain . ''
They fed her when they wished and gave her water from their gumboots to drink .
She soon became pregnant .
The rebels said she would be set free once she had given birth .
'' One day they tied me to a tree and tried to pull the baby out .
The blood ... it just kept flowing . ''
She says she can no longer feel pain and relates all this in a detached manner - cold and emotionless - and then ties a colourful wraparound around her waist and walks away .
Prison
A former government soldier who is serving 20 years in Goma Central Prison says he attacked the first woman he came across after sneaking away from his post :
Sometimes I feel like I do n't have a desire to live on this Earth
Clementine
Congolese rape victim '' I asked her to help me .
I had this urge to have sex .
She did n't want to have sex with me .
But I forced her .
I felt that if I did n't have sex then I would get sick .
" She left without crying but as she was leaving she said she would denounce me .
I regret it now because I am in prison . "
He is among the few to have been arrested .
Ms Kelly says that many soldiers view women as men's helpers .
" There is this attitude that it is a man 's right to have sex and there 's no way that a man can not have sex . "
Ms Faray despairs : " If they can't control themselves , then they are at the level of an animal .
It is really just an excuse to legitimise the violence and they are living in a situation of impunity .
It is an excuse to live a life of lawlessness . "
Dr Lucy Kasereka of the Heal Africa Hospital says justice is hard to come by .
'' Even when these suspects are arrested , there is no proper prison or even legal representation .
For us Christians , the Ten Commandments are our judge . ''
' They destroyed my life ' Provincial Minister for Justice and Human Rights Francois Rucogoza thinks that if DR Congo can rid itself of all the armed groups , rape will be a thing of the past .
Women have borne the brunt of the violence
But women like Yvone , 37 , will never escape the past .
Her husband was made to watch while she was raped , repeatedly .
Today , her husband wants nothing to do with her .
Yvone explains : " I am living with my husband in the same house but we are separated .
He spends nights on his bed and I spend nights on my bed with the children .
" We can not do the act of love .
When I need him , I tell him , but he says ' No. Never . '
' He tells me to go back to my husbands , the Interahamwe , every time we argue . ''
She says she begs her husband to understand her situation .
He refuses to .
Only other women understand her .
Clementine speaks for them all when she says : " I cannot forgive these rapists because they destroyed my life .
Sometimes I feel like I do n't have a desire to live on this Earth . "

Several days before Gov. Jan Brewer signed Arizona 's controversial immigration bill , Congressman Raul Grijalva called on the rest of the nation to boycott his home state if the new proposal became law .
National organizations , Grijalva said , should cancel upcoming conventions slated to be held there .
" If the state follows through with this , the cost will be high , " Grijalva warned .
Turns out , he was right : so far , the state has lost between $ 6 million and $ 10 million in projected business revenue , with 23 group hotel bookings -- from small meetings to large conventions -- having been canceled in protest since the stroke of Brewer 's pen , according to the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association .
Hotels do n't want to disclose which clients have canceled , for fear of alienating businesses .
So far , the most widely publicized cancelation has come from the American Immigration Lawyers Association
" It 's clear that the bill has had an economic impact on the state .
It 's impossible to say that it has n't , " says Glenn Hamer , CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce .
The business community -- and the hotel and lodging industry , in particular - - has been put in something of an awkward position by this development .
Businesses were agnostic about the bill before Brewer signed it ; now , they 're feeling its backlash .
The hotel industry had no position on the bill as it came through the legislature , and , now that it 's been passed , it sees little point in taking one now .
The point is moot , the group says .
" It was n't even on our radar screen , " says Kristen Jarnagin , VP of Communications for the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association , the trade group for the hotel and tourism industry in Arizona .
" It was never considered a tourism issue . "
It 's quickly become one , and that 's an important thing for the state .
Tourism is Arizona 's number - one industry , off and on , vying for that title with the technology industry , according to Jarnagin .
It 's a $ 12 billion industry in the state , and it contributes $ 1.4 billion in tax revenues .
The Arizona business community , predictably , is n't too pleased with Grijalva - - or anyone else calling for a boycott .
It 's misguided to damage one industry and its employees , when the real political enemies of the boycotters reside in the state house and the governor 's mansion .
" You do n't hurt the legislature , you do n't hurt the management of the hotel , really , " Jarnagin says .
" But the people who will immediately and drastically lose their jobs and lose their health benefits ... are the hourly associates on the front lines of this issue , and , again , largely the Hispanic people that you 're trying to stand up for , usually , by making a political statement like this are the ones that get hurt immediately . "
And there 's the rub : in canceling a big convention , a group can cost a hotel hundreds of thousands of dollars in logging , food , beverage , and entertainment revenue .
Which means Hispanic service workers can get their hours cut when the hotel 's budget takes a hit , and if they fall to part - time status , they lose their health benefits .
Which seems a bit counterproductive to the boycotters ' aims .
The hotel and restaurant industries mirror state demographics on the whole , Jarnagin says , meaning at least 30 percent of hotel and restaurant workers are Hispanic , including management .
The Arizona Chamber of Commerce finds itself in a similar predicament .
" It 's a wildly inappropriate reaction to that bill to call for a boycott .
In terms of peaceful protests , in terms of making the case that this law has problems and needs to be addressed , there are appropriate ways to deal with laws , and we just strongly believe that any sort of call to boycott is just wrong and is going to harm a lot of people , " Hamer , the Chamber of Commerce CEO , told me .
The Chamber did n't have a stated position on the bill as it came through the legislature , either .
A note about the business community and immigration law , in general : they typically do n't like immigration restrictions , the same way other conservative constituency groups do .
Businesses like being able to hire labor , and they like cheap labor ; any demagoguery against letting immigrants into this country seems unproductive , to them , when they need people to work .
A front - line of the immigration debate has been employee verification -- an electronic records system , e-Verify , was implemented under President Bush -- and , generally , businesses do n't like to be held to higher - than - reasonable standards .
If it 's difficult to verify that an employee is here legally , either because records are hard to come by or because identity theft is rampant , they do n't want to be penalized for failing to do so .
But now that the law is posing a problem for businesses , what can they do ?
Their response , so far , has not been to lobby for the bill 's repeal .
They have , on the other hand , spoken out against the boycotters .
Beyond that , it gets a bit murky .
The Hotel & Lobbying Association has made its problems known to Brewer and state legislators .
" We voiced those concerns , and we continue to work closely with the governor 's office and the legislature to let them know what 's happening to our associates , " Jarnagin said .
It is not , however , pushing for a repeal of the law .
Since it 's already been signed , Jarnagin says , the point is moot .
And AZHLA insists its lobbying clout is weak , citing the state legislatures ' decision to cut funding from the tourism office last year , reducing one of its revenue streams ( from taxes on hotels themselves ) to zero , and bringing the overall state tourism budget down from $ 26 million to $ 8 million .
The Hotel & Lodging Association is planning to tell prospective visitors that they can feel safe visiting Arizona , without harassment .
There 's confusion , right now , as to what the bill actually mandates : what people need to be able to present to police if stopped , and whether they can be randomly stopped on the street and asked for driver 's licenses .
AZHLA says it 's getting a flood of phone calls with prospective visitors asking what will happen if they head across the street from their hotel to a convenient store , and they forget their driver 's license .
As a result , the AZHLA plans to put FAQ's on its website about what people can expect .
There 's no massive ad campaign in the works , Jarnagin says , citing AZHLA 's low budget .
But in providing information to visitors -- and doing its job to try to convince them Arizona is a safe and wonderful place to visit , in the face of this new law - - puts the AZHLA in a borderline position of having to defend the policy .
It says it has to be careful about this , and wants to just give people the facts .
It does n't want to take sides in a divisive political issue .
" I think we 're trying to walk the fine line of providing the facts and information and letting people know who a boycott really hurts , " Jarnagin says .
" But I can definitely tell you that in doing that we are receiving a lot of feedback from people on both sides . "
The Chamber , meanwhile , seems content with the law itself .
It would entertain changes to it that would make it clearer , Hamer says , that it is not intended to target Hispanics -- but Hamer says Gov. Brewer has already made that clear .
Hamer notes that the law is popular .
It does n't seem , from talking to him , that the Chamber is inclined to stand in the way of something that , f rom this CBS / New York Times poll , appears to enjoy a majority of public support .
When asked if there 's anything the Chamber can do , in response to the economic hit , Hamer says it 's a good question .
" I think , and this is n't really us so much as it's probably the governor continuing to explain what the law does and does n't do , and I believe where we can be helpful is continuing the call , which we will continue to do , for a federal solution once and for all for our immigration mess , " Hamer says .

THE POSSIBILITIES
There has been an ongoing thread on the official forums this past week entitled “ Leveling is , let ’s face it , ridiculous ” that has garnered quite a bit of attention .
It became so popular in fact that the Lead Combat Designer Damion Schubert decided to drop in and leave a line .
In his post he discusses a lot of interesting faults with skill based leveling systems .
Quote From : Damion Schubert Quote From :
Not to go into the details of what advancement systems we will have or not have inside the game but … this does n’t always work out this rosily , without great designer care .
I worked on Meridian 59 , which was a wholly skill - based game , and learned a lot about the strengths and pitfalls of systems like it .
One of my great pet peeves of pure skill - based systems is that they claim that they are more realistic , but they in fact can create extremely unrealistic situations inside the world .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired , according to two CNN sources .
A senior administration official has told CNN that an official announcement will be made during President Barack Obama 's news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon .
The decision to fire Birnbaum comes in the wake of a recently released report highlighting what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , which is part of the Interior Department .
The period covered by the report was prior to the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon , resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap .
Among other things , the report , issued by the Interior Department 's inspector general , revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored .
In one case , an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles , Louisiana , conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company , the report stated .
The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS .
A September 2008 inspector general 's report found regulators in the agency 's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption " evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [ the agency ] and the oil and gas industry . "
He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general 's recommendations , " including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination , discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution . "
Salazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee , however , that Birnbaum had resigned " on her own terms and own volition . "
She " is a strong and very effective person who , among other things , helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do , " Salazar said .
" She helped us with addressing a very broken system .
And all I can really [ say ] is that she is a good public servant . "
MMS collected nearly $ 10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009 .
Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development , enforcement and revenue collection divisions , saying they have " conflicting missions " that needed to be separated .
The associate director for the agency 's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May , a month earlier than planned , in the wake of the Gulf spill .
That official , Chris Oynes , launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans , Louisiana , supervisor Donald Howard 's firing in 2007 .
Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued at more than $ 6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor .
As part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS , Sen .
Bill Nelson , D - Florida , introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate .
Among other things , the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies .
It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies , and prohibit regulators from part - time employment in the industry .
Leading mayoral candidate George Smitherman went for Rob Ford ’s political throat Wednesday , saying his rival ’s “ disgusting ” comments about gays in 2006 make him unfit to lead Toronto .
In the first major debate , all six main hopefuls on stage , Smitherman seized his opportunity to pose one question to another candidate , taking Ford to task for his argument against a $ 1.5 million AIDS prevention strategy .
“ It is very preventable , ” Ford told council in 2006 .
“ If you are not doing needles and you are not gay , you would n’t get AIDS probably , that ’s the bottom line . ”
He also said he did n’t understand why more women were becoming AIDS patients , adding : “ Maybe they ’re sleeping with bisexual men . ”
( In that year , more than 27 per cent of Torontonians diagnosed with HIV were women .
Nearly half of HIV - positive women in the city are from countries where it is endemic , and heterosexual sex is a primary means of transmission . )
Smitherman , who is gay , turned to Ford and said : “ I ’d like you to explain to people how your character , and especially these comments , is justifiable now that you present yourself as someone who wishes to be mayor of Toronto , one of the most diverse places to be found anywhere in the world ? ”
Some audience members booed the attack .
Ford did not apologize for , or try to explain , the remarks or any others he has made as in a decade as an outspoken Etobicoke councillor .
“ Let me tell you what Rob Ford ’s character is about — it ’s about integrity , it ’s about helping kids get off the street , helping thousands of kids . . .
I do n’t talk the talk , I walk the walk .
I have a Rob Ford football foundation .
I ’m caring . ”
Ford then spoke of his economic development efforts in Etobicoke North and his business acumen , before hitting back with a dig at the former health minister ’s stewardship of the province ’s cash - gobbling electronic health records system .
“ You want to get personal , go ahead . . .
I ’m not going to play games like you have , blowing more than a billion dollars on eHealth , ” Ford said .
Later , in a scrum , Smitherman called Ford ’s comments about AIDS victims “ disgusting ” and encouraged voters to go online and look up Ford ’s other verbal gaffes .
Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone jumped in to agree with Smitherman .
“ Really , ( Ford ) does n’t believe about diversity , ” Pantalone said , citing Ford ’s consistent pattern of voting against grants to diversity groups .
Ford stood a short distance away , smiling tightly and shaking his head .
Asked by reporters if he regretted the comments , Ford again referred to his philanthropic work and vowed not to resort to personal attacks .
With reporters yelling questions , he turned and left after noting the candidates had to go to a question - and - answer session at a Scarborough school .
Former executive and federal Liberal fundraiser Rocco Rossi did not join the attacks on Ford , nor did Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti or Women ’s Post publisher Sarah Thomson .
A Toronto Star - Angus Reid poll conducted April 8 - 12 showed Smitherman leading the field , but with Ford , then only three weeks into his campaign , just seven points behind and far ahead of the rest of the pack .
Smitherman ’s new campaign manager , Bruce Davis , has vowed to “ unleash ” the combative former deputy premier .
Earlier in the debate , in front of several hundred members of the Toronto Real Estate Board , Smitherman also had a target on his back .
Rossi used his question to accuse Smitherman of being arrogant for releasing few policy statements four months into the 11 - month campaign .

“ When will you come down from Mount Olympus and give us the wisdom of what you actually stand for , beyond giving us the story that you ’re going to do a line - by - line budget analysis with the same due diligence and the same level of skill that saw a billion dollars blow out the door on eHealth ? ” Rossi asked .
Smitherman replied : “ Indeed ( eHealth ) is not a place where the best results were achieved , and I take responsibility for that , but overall for five years I have a record that I ’m proud of and I ’ll put it up against yours at any time . ”
Pantalone also aimed his question at Smitherman , saying that in five years as the most powerful Toronto MPP , “ You were unable or unwilling to do something for Toronto and the GTA in terms of transportation systems , in terms of GO Transit , Transit City and finally the TTC . ”
Smitherman shot back , listing ways he helped Toronto as health minister and noting Toronto has done little with provincial dollars it got four years ago to expand the subway to York University .
“ Why have you only managed to move a water main , Joe ? ” Smitherman shot back .
Thomson chided Rossi for a transit plan that would add only 2 kilometres of new subway track per year , and said his financing plan does n’t add up .
He replied that his plan to sell Toronto Hydro and other assets to pay off the city ’s debt and free up hundreds of millions of dollars spent in servicing that debt makes more sense than relying on the province to pay , as the city has done with the Transit City plan .
Mammoliti asked Thomson why she told reporters she lost a 1997 bid for a Hamilton council seat by about 200 votes when it was more than 1,000 .
She said she remembered it wrong and learned a lesson about checking figures before speaking to reporters .
The first question — and the one that mattered most to the realtors , judging by the cheers and boos — was which candidates would promise to repeal the land transfer tax introduced by Mayor David Miller .
Ford and Mammoliti said they would , while the others said there is no obvious immediate replacement for the $ 200 million a year it generates .
In December 2009 , a tiny music label that specializes in the blues and is based in Destin , Florida , had enough of online piracy and decided to sue ...
Google ?
Yes , the music label sued the search giant because Google linked to infringing copies of the label 's music hosted by one - click download site RapidShare .
According to the lawsuit , the president of Blues Destiny Records spent November 17 , 2009 Googling his own bands .
In numerous cases , the very first links returned by Google were to music hosted on RapidShare .
" Although Google could screen or block access to websites known for hosting infringing music content , apparently they have chosen not to , " said the complaint .
Although legal questions here are not entirely settled , the label was certainly taking a huge chance .
Writing back in December , law professor Eric Goldman summed up the case by saying , " Given the ambiguities of that opinion , the plaintiff 's action here is n't clearly wrong as a doctrine matter .
However , in my opinion , it is nevertheless ill - advised and unlikely to succeed . "
Stranger than the decision to go after Google was the label 's simultaneous decision to go after Microsoft 's Bing search engine , despite the fact that " Bing removed from its search result the links to websites offering illegal copies of Plaintiff 's Recordings " before the lawsuit was even filed .
Google takes such lawsuits seriously ; by trying to restrict the company 's linking practices , this kind of lawsuit goes to Google 's key business : collecting , indexing , and presenting links to the world 's information in order to sell advertising .
The music label decided to dismiss the case voluntarily on March 24 , 2010 .
The company 's lawyers did tell Google , however , that the case would be refiled in the future .
On April 15 , Google attorneys contacted the label again and asked if they still planned to go forward with the lawsuit .
The label was " considering its option on whether it would seek relief against Google , " but gave no timeframe for doing so and refused Google 's request for a guarantee that it would not sue .
A week later , Google told the label that , unless it " agreed to release its claims against Google , Google was going to seek declaratory relief concerning those claims . "
That happened last week in a California federal court , where Google asked the judge for a " declaratory judgment that Google does not infringe the copyrights " of the label .
In its filing , Google claims " safe harbor " under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and says that it " responded expeditiously to [ Blues Destiny Records ' ]
DMCA - compliant notifications of claimed infringement by removing , or disabling access to , links leading to webpages allegedly containing material infringing BDR 's copyrights . "
If Google 's account is accurate here , the case sounds far less interesting than BDR made it sound .
Under the DMCA , service providers like Google are generally shielded from copyright liability if they remove access to copyrighted material when notified by the rightsholder .
But other issues are more complicated ; if a search engine links to a blog post that is essentially just a pointer to a RapidShare download , must the search engine remove that link ?
How far removed must the search engine be ?
Blues Destiny Records may have had second thoughts about its decision to go after the search behemoth , but it 's got a fight on its hands now .
In related news , this week RapidShare triumphed in a German appeals court , which found that its file - hosting service did not need to preemptively filter uploaded material for copyright violations .
In its 2009 complaint , Blue Destiny Records had actually pointed to an earlier decision from a lower German court which came to an opposite conclusion in the RapidShare case .
In addition to seeking legal remedies , BDR earlier this year signed up with MiMTiD , which provides " Copyright Infringement Search and Automated DMCA Take Down Notice Submission , Management and Tracking Services . "
The rise of social media sites like Facebook , MySpace and Flikr , has been accompanied by fears that we are producing the most narcissistic “ Generation Me ” in history .
But is there any actual scientific evidence for that view ?
Well , a study of 14,000 college students found that today ’s young people are 40 percent less empathetic than college kids from 30 years ago .
The research was presented this weekend at the annual meeting of Association for Psychological Science .
Researchers analyzed data from studies conducted between 1979 and 2009 , and found the sharpest drop in empathy occurred in the last nine years .
For instance , today ’s students are less likely to agree with statements like , “ I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective " and " I often have tender , concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me . "
According to one of the lead researchers , Ed O’Brien , [ AUDIO QUOTE ]
“ It ’s harder for today ’s college student to empathize with others becau se so much of their social lives is done through a computer and not through real life interaction . ”
O’Brien also notes that students are facing increasing competition so they ’re spending much more time working on their grades and resumes , instead of socializing .
[ AUDIO QUOTE ]
“ I think our best suggestion now is to force yourself to step outside the computer a little bit each day and try to remember what it ’s like to relate to others in the real world . ”

Asian pollution delays inevitable warming
Dirty power plants exert temporary protective effect .
Jeff Tollefson
The grey , sulphur - laden skies overlying parts of Asia have a bright side — they reflect sunlight back into space , moderating temperatures on the ground .
Scientists are now exploring how and where pollution from power plants could offset , for a time , the greenhouse warming of the carbon dioxide they emit .
A new modelling study doubles as a thought experiment in how pollution controls and global warming could interact in China and India , which are projected to account for 80 % of new coal - fired power in the coming years .
If new power plants were to operate without controlling pollution such as sulphur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( NO X ) , the study finds , the resulting haze would reflect enough sunlight to overpower the warming effect of CO 2 and exert local cooling .
But this effect would not be felt uniformly across the globe and would last only a few decades .
In the long run , CO 2 would always prevail , and the world could experience a rapid warming effect if the skies were cleaned up decades down the road .
“ The paper highlights the fundamental inequity and iniquity of anthropogenic climate change : ‘ enjoy now and make others pay later ’ , ” says Meinrat Andreae , an aerosol expert at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , Germany , who was not involved in the work .
In fact , he says , dirty coal plants could be seen as “ a very primitive form of geoengineering ” .
The study , which is under review at Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , builds on a well - established idea .
Global temperatures were relatively stable in the decades leading up to the 1970s , even as fossil - fuel consumption shot up .
Then industrialized countries began curbing SO 2 and NO X to reduce acid rain and protect public health — and temperatures increased rapidly .
The latest work , led by Drew Shindell at NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , looks at how the climate effects of air pollutants and greenhouse gases could play out over time and geography .

Let 's talk tea parties -- and the press .
The past week included Tax Day ( April 15 ) and a lot of local tea party rallies drawing thousands of primarily middle - class citizens protesting the growing role of government in their lives .
These rallies heard much about federal abuses to capitalism , liberty , the Constitution , individual responsibility , and national sovereignty .
Perhaps the earliest indication of public disaffection happened Feb. 27 of last year with small rallies in 50 cities at which taxpayers protested the $ 786 billion stimulus bill .
Those rallies began the tea party movement .
Protest is the essence of America .
It formed the nation .
To say people attending these rallies are loons is to say the same of those who dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest British taxes .
Yet to read in much of what remains of the mainline press , many tea partiers at Tax Day rallies are nothing good -- racists , fascists , gun nuts , gay - bashers , militant separatists .
They are described as generally hateful , ignorant , unhinged , and of course extreme .
Most are none of those things .
Rather , they are largely independent voters angry at relentless Democratic leftism , frustrated by big- spending Republicanism ( primarily under Bush II ) , and outraged by the hubris , pretension , shameless immoralism , and patronizing arrogance so widespread among the lofties in both political parties .
Are these people lopsidedly Christian ?
Yes indeed -- and so is the nation .
Are they conservative ?
Yes again , and hence typical of how a large percentage of voters describe themselves ( a percentage consistently larger than voters describing themselves as liberals ) .
Are they loons swimming out of the mainstream ?
Here 's NPR and Fox analyst Juan Williams :
A Pew poll in early March found 78 percent of Americans " dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today . " . . .
A Fox poll in February found that 59 percent say they do n't trust the federal government .
A CNN poll the same month reported results that suggest 56 percent are well beyond mere mistrust :
They agree that the federal government is " so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens . "
And are they defectors from the mainline press ?
You 'd better believe it .
For years , generations , first the print press , then network radio , and then network television gave little comfort to conservatives -- and still do n't .
So conservatives and independents either turned off or turned away .
They went first to talk radio , then to cable news ( Fox ) , then to the Internet .
Liberal talk radio ( Air America ) never took off ; National Public Radio would n't exist were it not for various forms of federal favor .
Viewership of liberal cable ( MSNBC and CNN ) is plunging , paralleling network viewership .
And too many newspapers continue to struggle .
All object to any ideological characterization .
Yet the truth is leftism long has dominated in newsrooms , and long has dominated among top television and newspaper editors ( polls in 1972 indicated about 90 percent of them voted for George McGovern ) .
At an April 1980 convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors , just 1 percent of about 500 editors marking a preference ballot signified for Ronald Reagan .
Talk radio , cable , and the Internet liberated today 's independents and tea partiers -- gave them niches where they could go for news and comfort .
Long subdued ( remember the Silent Majority ? ) , they now find themselves emboldened and vocal .
They are turning out to make their voices heard -- and their votes count .
In many cases , neither Republican nor Democrat can win without many votes from independents , whom many tea partiers typify .
Your average tea partier will give his vote to whichever candidate , of whichever party , deserves it most .
That is why so many Democrats and Obamians ( and so many mainline pressies who keep the Obamian tablets ) so detest tea partiers -- disparage them , call them names .
It is also why some who see the risks tea partiers pose are seeking ( in the words of one wire account ) " to infiltrate and dismantle " the group " to make its members appear to be racist , homophobic , and moronic . "
Still , from the president on down , leftists vilify and caricature tea partiers ( a ) at profound peril to the perpetuation of their ideology and ( b ) at political peril principally to themselves .
What moves the tea partiers ?
Perhaps these sentiments and beliefs . . .
They tend to wonder -- despite the fall of the Berlin Wall -- whether Obamacare , federal bailouts for everyone with a lobbyist , and government takeover of General Motors and the student loan industry suggest socialism has won .
Whether the coming debt / inflation tsunami -- with Obama having obligated , pre-Obamacare , more federal debt in just one year than his 43 predecessors combined -- will make the Greek and European Community debt problems look like spring showers .
Whether punishing those who tell the truth about Obamacare , as Rep. Henry Waxman proposes to do April 21 , is a prudent course .
They tend to wonder why the mainstream media do not hold liberals and Democrats to the same standards of behavior they impose on conservatives and Republicans .
Why it is fiscally responsible to add trillions in debt for Obamacare when Social Security , already with a negative cash flow , will have no cash at all in just eight years .
Why it is OK for members of Congress to pass a health plan for the everyday rest of us , yet one exempting them .
And tea partiers tend to wonder why it makes any sense to cozy up to our declared foreign enemies and insult our foreign friends , to enhance the power of unions ( most noticeably public - employee unions ) , to expand federal regulation and federal intrusion , and to permit Iran to move unfettered toward development of nuclear weapons .
. . .
With all that , would it be too much to suggest the tea partiers are riding to the nation 's rescue on the political / ideological inconvenience of the truth ?
Who does n’t like free stuff ?
Free activities , free services , free goodies … it ’s always good to take !
Canadians are pretty generous , there are tons of free stuff out there — you just have to find them .
I put up a list of ten free - everything available in Ottawa .
Note that many of the finds here are also available in other cities across Canada , you do n’t necessarily have to live in Ottawa to benefit from them … just look for something similar !
The library : I ’m the freak who reads a book a day and I ’m addicted to the library .
But I have very good reasons for that .
First , membership is free if you are a resident of Ottawa ( it ’s $ 50 if you live outside Ottawa ) .
A library card allows you to borrow as many books , magazines and movies as you want , usually for three weeks .
Public library branches also offer cardholders two hours per day at the computer workstation ( with free Internet access and many programs ) , programs for newcomers ( including language conversation groups and preparation for the citizenship test ) and many other services , all that for free .
Visit the Parliament : Parliament
Hill is one of the main landmarks in Ottawa – it ’s kind of hard to miss the Peace Tower .
But have you visited the Parliament ?
All tours and programs are free of charge .
When the House is sitting , tours may be shorter so check the House of Commons calendar .
You may visit the Centre Block and the East Block , go to the top of the Peace Tower and enjoy the view , see the Memorial Chamber , and have a look at the beautiful Parliament Library .
Another fun activity to do is to sit in the public galleries and to attend Question Period .
City of Ottawa programs : the city of Ottawa regularly offers programs to improve the city and the country .
For instance , the current TREE Program , mentioned by Guillermo a few days ago , aims at planting 100,000 trees in Ottawa by 2010 .
Ottawa residents can register for a free tree to plant on their property , and it will even be delivered right to your door .
Other past campaigns and programs included free energy - efficient light bulbs , and I ’m sure more programs will be promoted in the future .
Newcomers and employment services : the YMCA has employment counselling centers and programs .
For instance , Job Connect helps people prepare for and find a new job , Second Career Strategy help recently laid - off workers to fit the local labour market , the Federal Public Sector Youth Internship program places young Canadians in federal organizations etc .
Each of these programs has specific requirements but you will certainly find one that suits your needs .
The YMCA also has a Newcomer Information Center staffed by multilingual employees who organize workshops , events and offer a library of resources .
Language test and language instruction : LINC ( Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada ) provides free English / French language training for eligible individuals .
You must be 18 years old or older , be a resident of Ontario and meet some immigration status criteria .
This free service includes a benchmark assessment of your language skills ( French or English ) and a referral to LINC training programs ( language classes that meet your needs ) .
Donation - based Internet access : National Capital Freenet is a not - for - profit community network owned and controlled by people living in the region .
They offer a donation - based dial - up model access : you can either volunteer some time or make a donation of $ 5 / month to cover the coast of running the service .
They also offer a high - speed DSL at $ 29.95 / month , which is very cheap for Canada .
Their popular services also include email , webpage hosting , discussion groups and help for people new to the Internet .
Free learning materials : university is unfortunately pretty expensive in Canada and not everything has access to training at work .
However , the Ottawa Public Library has a separate website , LearningExpress Library , offering all kind of learning materials online .
For instance , you can take free TOEFL practice tests ( this is an awesome tool considering how expensive TOEFL prep materials are ! ) , prepare the Canadian citizenship test , improve your writing skills , learn how to create great resume and cover letters , take a business writing course , take a number of practice test to certified for a job ( law enforcement , teaching , civil service … ) …
There are even “ recursos para Hispanohablantes ” !
All you need to access these online resources is an Ottawa Public Library card .
A little bit of everything … free : in the “ free ” section of Kijiji , the popular local classified website , you can find a bit of everything : free doors , free phones , free rollerblades , free fridge …
Plenty of people want to get rid of their stuff all year long .
But let ’s face it , garage sales are not that fun in the middle of the winter – that ’s where Kijiji comes in very handy .
Just use common sense ( i.e. if it ’s too good to be true , it probably is … ) and browse often for great finds .
Reading magazines at Chapters : Chapters is a large Canadian bookstore chains .
They invariably offer a large magazine section as well as thousand of books and pride themselves on being somewhat cozy .
You can often grab a coffee at Starbucks and use the chairs and couches inside the store – yes , Chapters does not discourage the reading of books inside the store !
I love to go there once a week to read the French magazines I would n’t otherwise buy ( imported stuff are expensive ! ) .
A free Canadian flag : and not just any flag , but one of the three flags that has flown on Parliament Hill .
The government of Canada is regularly packaging and mailing the flags that have flown on top of the Peace Tower , and on the East and West blocks of the Parliament .
To qualify , you must live have a mailing address in Canada .
All you have to do is submit a request to Public Works and Government Services Canada .
One caveat : the waiting list is rather long … 27 years for the Peace Tower flag and 19 years for the East and West blocks flags !
Los Morales Sánchez llegaron a Ciudad Juárez hace 12 años .
Casi tres días en camión desde el Puerto de Veracruz .
Les habían dicho que aquí había mucho trabajo .
Y no les engañaron .
Marisela Sánchez recuerda que pisó la ciudad fronteriza con Estados Unidos un 21 de marzo : " Y el 22 ya estaba trabajando en una maquiladora " .
Ahora las cosas han cambiado .
Falta trabajo .
Y sobra violencia .
Ciudad Juárez es , con mucho , la ciudad más peligrosa de México y tal vez del mundo .
Los cementerios están llenos y los parques vacíos .
Su hijo , Alfredo Morales Sánchez , después de muchas lágrimas , ha tomado una decisión : " Nos vamos .
Aquí la vida no vale nada " .
El viernes ya no quedaba nada por empacar .
Los Morales Sánchez y otro puñado de familias acaban de aceptar la invitación del gobernador de Veracruz , el priista Fidel Herrera , para regresar a sus lugares de origen .
" Nos van a pagar el viaje y la mudanza " , aclara Marisela Sánchez , " y tal vez nos ayuden a encontrar un nuevo trabajo , a emprender una nueva vida " .
Serán 150 los veracruzanos que , en una primera expedición , huyan de Ciudad Juárez aprovechando la ayuda oficial .
Se calcula que otros 200.000 juarenses , de nacimiento o adopción , ya huyeron en los últimos meses por sus propios medios , hacia Estados Unidos o hacia el interior de México , dejando tras de sí más de 60.000 casas vacías y un número incalculable de sueños rotos .
" He tomado la decisión de irme " , explica Alfredo Morales , " pero siento dolor , mucho dolor .
Yo he llegado a amar esta ciudad .
Aquí me casé , aquí fueron naciendo mis tres hijos , aquí hay gente a la que quiero y que me quiere .
Pero , de esa reja para afuera , hay demasiados peligros ... " .
Marisela Sánchez dice que sus nietos , como la mayoría de los críos de Ciudad Juárez , viven secuestrados en sus propias casas , condicionados y hasta contagiados por el miedo de sus mayores .
" Tengo temor " , reconoce , " de llevarlos al parque , de que se separen de mí más de dos metros .
Y no crea que exagero .
Ya hemos visto pasar muchas balas cerca .
¿ Se acuerda de aquel restaurante donde mataron a ocho ?
Pues está justo enfrente de mi casa .
Conocíamos a algunos de los que murieron .
Gente normal .
No todos los jóvenes que mueren aquí son sicarios o andan en malos pasos .
Algunas compañeras de la fábrica ya han perdido a dos hijos " .
La conversación se adentra de lleno en la galería de los horrores vividos .
Mónica Sánchez , la hermana de Marisela , recuerda aquel día que unos pistoleros persiguieron a su víctima por los pasillos del supermercado en el que ella suele hacer la compra .
Alfredo relata la noche en que , a sólo unos metros de su casa , escuchó la banda sonora inconfundible de esta ciudad : " Primero unos disparos , luego un coche que salía a toda prisa , quemando llantas , y ya enseguida el llanto de unas mujeres .
Acababan de matar a un joven de 16 años en unas canchas de fútbol " .
Como si fuera verdad aquello de que las desgracias nunca llegan solas , la escalada de violencia en México coincidió con la crisis económica .
El trabajo en las fábricas manufactureras empezó a escasear .
Y a la violencia generada por la lucha emprendida por el gobierno de Felipe Calderón contra los cárteles de la droga se unió un incremento de la delincuencia común .
" Ya el único problema no es que te maten " , explica Mónica Sánchez , " también estamos sometidos a las extorsiones telefónicas .
Nosotros un día estuvimos a punto de caer en una .
Nos llamó alguien haciéndose pasar por un familiar .
Nos dijo que estaba retenido en la aduana y que teníamos que pagar 20.000 pesos ( casi 1.200 euros ) para evitar que lo metieran en la cárcel .
Al final nos dimos cuenta de que era un engaño .
Llaman desde las cárceles .
Y si el teléfono lo contestan los niños , les sonsacan información para luego cometer la extorsión .
Desde entonces ya no dejamos que los críos contesten .
No pueden hacer nada las criaturas ... " .
Alfredo Morales no oculta su nerviosismo .
Dentro de unas horas , sus hijos - de diez , ocho y siete años- pisarán por primera vez la tierra de sus mayores , conocerán a sus abuelos , a sus tíos , a sus primos .
Porque desde aquel día de hace 12 años que Alfredo y su familia se montaron en un camión hacia Ciudad Juárez no habían tenido la oportunidad de volver de visita al Puerto de Veracruz .
Ahora , la violencia y la crisis se han aliado para romperles aquel sueño de un futuro mejor .
Regresan derrotados .
Pero vivos .
FORMER CLOWN BASHES BIG MACS
Geoffrey Giuliano - a former Ronald McDonald - launched his own brand of Big Mac attack .
And it was directed at his old employers , McDonald 's Restaurants of Canada .
" Meat is murder , " the ex-hamburger clown told a crowd of about 150 animal - rights activists demonstrating in front of a McDonald 's restaurant at 192A Bloor St. W. A vegetarian since the 1970s , Giuliano lashed out at the burger giant for " the senseless killing of animals for food . "
Sold out " tell the readers of the Sun Ronald McDonald says it 's naughty to eat meat , " he said .
Giuliano , 36 , played the popular clown in Toronto from 1980 to 1982 .
A graduate of " Ronald McDonald University " - the chain 's training school - he was one of several Ronalds working throughout the world .
" I sold out when I was Ronald and I 'm deeply sorry for that , " said Giulano , who is now a successful rock biographer living in Upstate New York Giuliano also played the Magical Mystical Burger King for Burger King restaurants in the Northeastern U.S. in 1978 - 79 and is currently working on a book titled Confessions of a Corporate Clown .
He made $ 50,000 a year , had a private chef , limo service , and an office with a personal secretary during his tenure as Ronald McDonald .
" McDonald 's let me go because they said I was n't " McDonaldized " enough , " said Giuliano .
" Which really means I did n't toe the corporate line . "
McDonald 's spokesman Simon Halls told the Sun Giulano is entitled to his opinion .
" We 're proud of everything we 're doing , " said Halls .

M.I.A. has said that she believes the CIA is behind the development of sites Google and Facebook .
The 34 - year - old warned users to be cautious on the internet , as the government is watching at all times .
" All governments are connected to Google , and all governments can shift their search engines so only what they want you to see comes upâ€ ¦
I want kids to be aware of this digital circumstance , " she told Nylon .
" Everyone on the Internet is like , ' Oh my God , come and join Facebook ! '
Theyâ€™re all so optimisticâ€ ¦ and really , everyone is f**king you up behind the screens .
And I do n't like that .
It makes it difficult for me to interact with my fans knowing that .
Google and Facebook were developed by the CIA , and when you 're on there , you have to know that . "

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Wednesday defiantly rejected a warning by a top Arizona utilities official that the state could cut off power to Los Angeles should the city proceed with its boycott of all things Arizona .
Spokesman David Beltran told Fox News that the message did n't even warrant a response .
" We 're not going to respond to threats from a state which has isolated itself from the America that values freedom , liberty and basic human rights , " Beltran said .
That was after Gary Pierce , a commissioner on the five - member Arizona Corporation Commission , wrote a letter to Villaraigosa slamming his City Council 's decision to boycott the Grand Canyon State -- in protest of its immigration law -- by suspending official travel there and ending future contracts with state businesses .
Noting that a quarter of Los Angeles ' electricity comes from Arizona power plants , Pierce threatened to pull the plug if the City Council does not reconsider .
" Doggone it -- if you 're going to boycott this candy store ... then do n't come in for any of it , " Pierce told FoxNews.com .
In the letter , he ridiculed Villaraigosa for saying that the point of the boycott was to " send a message " by severing the " resources and ties " they share .
" I received your message ; please receive mine .
As a statewide elected member of the Arizona Corporation Commission overseeing Arizona 's electric and water utilities , I too am keenly aware of the ' resources and ties ' we share with the city of Los Angeles , " Pierce wrote .
" If an economic boycott is truly what you desire , I will be happy to encourage Arizona utilities to renegotiate your power agreements so Los Angeles no longer receives any power from Arizona - based generation . "
Appearing to tap into local frustration in Arizona over the raft of boycotts and threatened boycotts from cities across the country , including Los Angeles , Pierce warned that Arizona companies are willing and ready to fight boycott with boycott .
" I am confident that Arizona 's utilities would be happy to take those electrons off your hands , " Pierce wrote .
" If , however , you find that the City Council lacks the strength of its convictions to turn off the lights in Los Angeles and boycott Arizona power , please reconsider the wisdom of attempting to harm Arizona 's economy . "
Pierce told FoxNews.com that he was speaking for himself , not the entire commission , though he has the support of at least one other member .
But Arizona has some serious leverage over Los Angeles , as well as the rest of California .
The state and city get electricity from a nuclear power plant outside Phoenix , as well as from coal - fired power plants in northern Arizona and two giant hydroelectric power generators along the Colorado River .
Despite that , the Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly last week to ban future business with Arizona -- a decision that could cost Arizona millions of dollars in lost contracts .
Los Angeles officials were furious with the Arizona immigration law passed last month and joined local officials in cities across the country in pushing boycotts to register their dismay .
Critics say the law will lead to racial profiling and civil rights abuses .
Arizona officials have defended the law , saying the state needed to take its illegal immigration problem into its own hands .
Pierce said he's " supportive " of the state 's efforts to control the border .
The law requires local law enforcement to try to verify the immigration status of anyone they have contact with whom they suspect of being an illegal immigrant .
It empowers them to turn over verified illegal immigrants to federal custody .
The legislation explicitly prohibits screening people based solely on race or national origin .

Well , Memorial Day weekend is approaching and there is a lot for moviegoers to choose from this holiday weekend .
Jake Gyllenhall , Ben Kingsley , and Gemma Arterton star in Disney ’s ‘ Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time ’ .
The big budget production looks good , and hopefully word of mouth will be positive .
I would like to see Jake score as an action hero , because he is a decent actor and deserves a blockbuster hit .
A $ 50 million opening is probably within reach for this one .
There is no stopping it …it ’s like an out of control freight train .
One of the few films that can bring the ladies in by the masses , and a few of them will drag their significant others along for the ride .
‘ Sex and the City 2 ’ has an undeniable built in audience and this film is going to be huge .
I would expect a $ 70 million weekend , with a little extra tacked on for midnight showings and the extra day tomorrow being thrown in …and I could be underestimating a bit .
Looking for something else , check out ‘ Iron Man 2 ’ or ‘ Robin Hood ’ … both good films .
‘ Shrek Forever After ’ is in its second week for the kiddies .
This should be a big weekend at the box office … Memorial Day weekend normally is .
Can you guess who this is ?
Remember how much weight Tom Hanks had to lose for ‘ Cast Away ’ , or Christian Bale for ‘ The Machinist ’ ?
Well , another actor is giving them a run for their money with his new film .
‘ Things Fall Apart ’ , the new film that stars none other than 50 Cent , called for the rap superstar to play a football player diagnosed with cancer .
An incredible weight loss , especially for a guy that was as pumped up as Fitty was .
50 lost a close friend to cancer , and that was his inspiration for doing the film .
Today , X - 51A Waverider successfully did a 200 + second burn which was the longest - ever supersonic combustion ramjet - powered flight at Mach 5 ( five times the speed of sound – rougly – 4,000 mph or 6,400 km/h at altitude ) .
The 200 + second burn by the X - 51 ’s Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne - built air breathing scramjet engine accelerated the vehicle to Mach 5 .
The previous longest scramjet burn in a flight test was 12 seconds in a NASA X - 43 .
The X - 51A was carried to about 49,500ft under the wing of a Boeing B - 52H before release .
Four seconds later an Army Tactical Missile solid rocket booster accelerated the X - 51 to about M4.8 before it and a connecting interstage were jettisoned .
Air Force Research Laboratory X - 51A programme manager Charlie Brink says preliminary data shows that the separation from the B - 52H was “ phenomenal ” and the solid booster light was “ perfect ” .
At 65,000 ft the booster separated from the vehicle as planned , followed by the start of the scramjet engine with an ethylene mix and switchover to JP - 7 fuel .
While the programme had a goal for a 300s flight to M6 , Brink says that at roughly 140s of powered flight , engineers “ started noticing some anomalies with some sensors ” .
The engine continued to run , but the telemetry stream to the ground was interrupted , requiring controllers to activate the self - destruct function .
Despite the shorter flight , the team was exhilarated over the results .
“ Up until 140s , everything was working textbook , per calculations ” , says Joe Vogel , Boeing ’s X - 51A programme manager .

Kudos to the team !
Toward the end of a mostly compelling and occasionally moving new documentary , Cornel West does his best to puncture the image of a benign and nonconfrontational Martin Luther King Jr .
West rejects what he calls the “ Santa Clausification ” of King , fuzzy myth - making that the African American scholar says is “ one of the ways in which you defang and domesticate people who are on fire for justice . ”
“ MLK : A Call to Conscience ” works best when it tends to the words of the provocative West -- revealing a King who was both more troubled , more radical and , yes , even more courageous than standard hagiography typically has allowed .
The documentary , airing at 8 p.m. Wednesday on KCET , delivers a worthy glimpse of the feeling , thinking and struggling King , a year before the end of his life .

The program would have been even more successful had it probed deeper into King ’s psychological and political challenges from both left and right and tossed aside some diversions , particularly an off - target attempt to hold President Obama accountable to the King legacy .
Still , there ’s much to learn and admire in executive producer and host Tavis Smiley ’s effort .
In the second of four documentaries that take him away from his regular PBS talk show , Smiley wisely reexamines one of King ’s speeches not favored in YouTube mashups and glowing celebrations of the ‘ 60s .
An address King called “ Beyond Vietnam ” has been judged by historians and King allies ( who carry much of the narrative here ) as his most audacious , challenging not only the Vietnam War but what King believed was a heavy - handed foreign policy and a skewed domestic agenda .
Smiley reports that King ’s already strained relationship with President Lyndon B. Johnson , his onetime civil rights ally , became “ fractured beyond repair ” after he delivered the speech on April 4 , 1967 at Riverside Church in New York City .
Advertisement
One year to the day later , King would be shot down at a motel in Memphis , Tenn. , where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers .
Smiley and King ’s associates from that time -- including Harry Belafonte and Marian Wright Edelman -- describe how he decided to speak out despite tremendous pressure not to stray from economic and social issues on U.S. soil .
The minister looked sad and troubled that night in the standing - room - only church .
He told the crowd that “ the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony . ”
But he said that “ my conscience leaves me no other choice .
A time comes when silence is betrayal . ”
It had become difficult for King to answer young people who asked whether his admonitions of nonviolence extended to foreign affairs .
“ I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos , ” King said , in the most controversial line of the 45 - minute address , “ without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government . ”
Advertisement
It ’s hard for us now to reconcile that more confrontational King with the King who is now embraced even by personalities on Fox News .
The speech included a graphic description of the horror - scape of combat , the minister saying America suffered one casualty for every 20 of the Vietnamese .
He claimed the U.S. had “ killed a million of them , mostly children . ”
King railed against a “ deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long ” and suggested sympathy for “ a revolutionary government ” even if it included “ some communists . ”
Such unsparing and sometimes hyperbolic assessments of Johnson ’s war -- not to mention King ’s harsh words about the evils of capitalism -- exploded like a land mine with the American people and media .
But most of those vivid passages did not make the final cut of “ MLK : A Call to Conscience , ” which would have done more than a platoon of talking heads to blow away the mythological cloud .
Advertisement
Smiley ’s documentary leaves no doubt , though , about the influence of King ’s words .
A once largely fawning press wrote dozens of angry editorials .
Life magazine called the speech “ demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi . ”
It ’s not surprising that Smiley would try to bring a contemporary slant to the story .
But an attempt to conjure up a slight by Obama ( the host claims that Obama implied in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech “ that the current climate of terror outstrips what Dr. King and his generation faced ” ) seems contrived .
Likewise , it ’s dandy that all these decades later King ally Tony Bennett continues to abhor war and violence .
But the crooner ’s cameo does n’t add much to our understanding of King .
It ’s left to Princeton ’s endlessly plain - spoken professor West , eyes dancing , to remind that Obama and King have different roles .
Advertisement
“ I think they ’re in different lanes and they have very different callings , ” West said .
“ The latter is a prophet , the former is a politician . ”
Smiley ’s documentary works best and clarifies most when it acknowledges King as human , even more courageous for rising above his doubts .
His acolyte and onetime aide , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , tells us : “ There ’s that tension between politician and prophet .
And that ’s a real tension . ”
( Full disclosure : I recently did a video commentary for KCET ’s “ SoCal Connected . ” )

* General Manager Ruth Seymour of KCRW -FM ( 89.9 ) told me last year she did n’t think much of Arbitron ’s new Portable People Meter .
The meters counted just 289,000 weekly listeners for KCRW in August , well behind another public - radio fixture , KPCC -FM ( 89.3 ) , which had 549,000 .
Though Seymour has retired , she owes me a “ toldya . ”
The most recent Arbitron report puts KCRW at 514,000 weekly listeners , right on the tail of KPCC ’s 544,000 .
* Those giant Internet sinkholes demand to be filled .
That at least partly explains why no fewer than six news outlets made sport Tuesday of U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina , whose message for Passover included the words “ as we break bread . ”
SFGate ( a.k.a. the San Francisco Chronicle ) and political reporter Carla Marinucci noted that the flight of the Hebrews from Egyptian slavery is “ also known as the ‘ Festival of the Unleavened Bread . ’ ” That would be matzo , Carly .

A big development in the Hutaree case :
A federal judge in Detroit today ordered the release of nine members of a Lenawee County Christian militia group freed on bond over the objections of federal prosecutors .
" The United States is correct that it need not wait until people are killed before it arrests conspirators , " U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts said in a decision this morning .
" But , the Defendants are also correct : their right to engage in hate - filled , venomous speech , is a right that deserves First Amendment protection . "
She said federal prosecutors failed to persuade her that the defendants must be jailed until trial .

Modern people suffer from an intersection of low self - esteem and high self - interest .
As a result , they are scrabbling desperately for something to make them seem smarter .
Maybe that ’s why they turn to Hollywood producers to learn history .
There ’s been a resurgence in this quotation :
“ You know when I was a little boy , there was an old negro farmer that lived down the road from us , named Monroe .
He was … ( subtle laugh ) , I guess he was just a little more luckier than my daddy was .
He bought himself a mule .
It was a big deal in round that town .
Now my daddy hated that mule .
Cause , his friends were always kidding him about , “ They saw Monroe out plowing with his new mule and Monroe is going to rent another field now he had a mule . ”
One morning that mule showed up dead .
They poisoned the water .
After that , there was n’t any mention about that mule around my daddy .
It just never came up .
One time we were driving down that road and we passed Monroe ’s place and we saw it was empty .
He just packed up and left , I guess , he must of went up north or something .
I looked over at my daddy ’s face , I knew he done it .
He saw that I knew .
He was ashamed .
I guess he was ashamed .
He looked at me and said , “ If you ai n’t better than a [ African - American ] son , who are you better than ? ” ” – Agent Anderson , Mississippi Burning
As noted on this blog of late , people are calling the Tea Partiers “ racist ” because ( a ) it ’s a version of the insult the left uses against everyone — you do n’t support class war , therefore you ’re on the side of the elites , who since we ’re all equal could not possibly deserve their elite status and ( b ) because the Tea Party is the beginnings of a white middle class separatist movement , those having learned that the “ progressives ” do n’t just want space for themselves ; the “ progressives ” want to destroy the comfortable , hard - working , traditionally - minded silent majority .
They just claimed they wanted to help , and justified it with pity for minorities , gays , women , you name it .
The justification is n’t the reason why .
The Tea Party figured it out : progressives are in it for a power grab .
So now , just as in 1860 , racial class differences have become front and center in American politics , and they obscure the real reason for the Tea Party ’s fusion of libertarian and conservative principles ( escape Nanny State government , live traditionally , reward the best and do n’t subsidize the rest ) .
Yet despite all the hype from the media , it ’s hard to buy into the idea that the Tea Party is a cloaked Klan meeting .
And the facts bear that out , if we look past the headline :
But what about the racial stereotyping items ?
The lead investigator , political science professor Christopher Parker , graciously provided me with the fuller dataâ € ” which strongly contradict the notion of the Tea Parties as a unique hotbed of racism .
Thus , while only 35 percent of strong Tea Party supporters rated blacks as hardworking , only 49 percent described whites as such .
While the gap is evident , these responses are close to those for all whites ( blacks are rated as “ hardworking ” by 40 percent , whites by 52 percent ) .
While whites who are strongly anti-Tea Party seem free of bias on this itemâ€ ” blacks and whites are rated as “ hardworking ” by 55 percent and 56 percent , respectivelyâ € ” this is not true for intelligence and trustworthiness .
Whites in every group are less likely to rate blacks than whites as “ intelligent ” by similar margins : 14 points for Tea Party supporters ( 45 percent vs. 59 percent ) , 13 points for all whites ( 49 percent vs. 62 percent ) , 10 points for Tea Party opponents ( 59 percent vs. 69 percent ) .
On “ trustworthy , ” the gap is smaller in the pro-Tea Party group ( 41 percent vs. 49 percent ) than in the anti-Tea Party group ( 57 percent vs. 72 percent ) .
One could write headlines about the “ racial paranoia ” of white liberals who consider blacks less trustworthy than whites !
– Reason.com , “ Race and the Tea Party movement , ” April 27 , 2010
That is indeed interesting .
If my hypothesis is correct , white liberal “ anti-racism ” is more about grabbing power than helping anyone out , or even liking them .
After all , most white liberals live in white suburbs .
But claiming that you ’re helping the pitied — the homeless , minorities , victims , the diseased , women , homosexuals and so on — you make yourself look like a moral White Knight coming to save us all .
Who can argue against you ?
If you argue against the White Knight , by the terms of our binary view of the world , you ’re the Black Knight .
You ’re not Jesus , you ’re Satan .
You ’re not Aragorn , you ’re Saruman .
You ’re not the enlightened modern person who is coming to save us all from the ignorance , violence , and instability of the past .
No — instead , you ’re some ignorant bastard living in a trailer who hates black people because he needs someone to feel superior to .
Nevermind that in this society it ’s easy to find people to feel superior to .
Just go to Wal - mart or a convenience store .
No matter how screwed up your life is , someone will wander in who will make you look rich as a king .
But if anti-racism can be a justification , what does that say about anti-racists — is it possible they ’re trying to feel superior to someone , too ?
That would make sense , after all .
We ’re all human , and if racism is a human failing , anti-racism done for the wrong reasons could also be one .
Thomas Sowell investigates our fear of race in this country :
In our own times , especially , this is not just a spontaneous reaction .
Many of our educators , our intelligentsia and our media — not to mention our politicians– promote an attitude that other people ’s achievements are grievances , rather than examples .
When black school children who are working hard in school and succeeding academically are attacked and beaten up by black classmates for “ acting white , ” why is it surprising that similar hostility is turned against Asian Americans , who are often achieving academically more so than whites ?
This attitude is not peculiar to some in the black community or to the United States .
The same phenomenon is found among lower - class whites in Britain , where academically achieving white students have been beaten up badly enough by their white classmates to require hospital treatment .
These are poisonous and self - destructive consequences of a steady drumbeat of ideological hype about differences that are translated into “ disparities ” and “ inequities , ” provoking envy and resentments under their more prettied - up name of “ social justice . ”
– Thomas Sowell , Townhall.com , “ Race and Resentment , ” May 4 , 2010
When people automatically assume that any inequality is an injustice , a pervasive climate of hatred rears its ugly head .
That in turn creates an audience who will elect as their champion anyone who confirms their prejudices .
And since we automatically assume injustice when we see inequality , that makes anti-racism as much of a prejudice as racism .
Even more , in a society where we strive to look “ intelligent ” and “ educated , ” our social status is determined in part by the opinions we hold and whether those appear elevated and progressive to others , as this passage from an insightful novel reveals :
When it was over , the three of them looked at one another , and Glenda , the English baby nurse , spoke up , with considerable agitation .
“ Well , I think that ’s perfectly disgusting .
The colored do n’t know how good they ’ve got it in this country .
I can tell you that much .
In Britain there ’s not so much as a colored in a police uniform , much less an important public official , the way they have here .
Why , there was an article just the other day .
There ’s more than two hundred coloreds who are mayors in this country .
And they want to bash the Mayor of New York about .
Some people do n’t know how well off they are , if you ask me . ”
She shook her head angrily .
Kramer and his wife looked at each other .
He could tell she was thinking the same thing he was .
Thank God in heaven !
What a relief !
They could let their breaths out now .
Miss Efficiency was a bigot .
These days the thing about bigotry was , it was undignified .
It was a sign of Low Rent origins , of inferior social status , of poor taste .
So they were the superiors of their English baby nurse , after all . ” – Tom Wolfe , The Bonfire of the Vanities
The American racial problem has not gone away despite two centuries of trying .
Part of the reason is that no matter who is in control , and whichever side they ’re on , there ’s too good of a chance that they ’re not trying to solve our problems at all — they ’re just trying to be “ better than ” someone else .
When we look out at the vast liberal blogosphere , in which 35 - year - old bagboys get to pretend they are erudite college professors , we ’re seeing a group motivated by a desire to raise social status and take revenge on the majority , who they dislike because that majority is successful .
This is why liberalism fundamentally appeals to the alienated : it makes excuses for failures , creates an enemy , and makes a group hatred out of this perceived wrong .
In our desire to do right by our racial problems , we should make sure we do n’t get ensnared by this violent emotion — because it ’s every iota of the same uncontrolled blame and rage that propels a lynch mob .

Memes never die .
They just fade away .
Downfall subs were a meme to last a thousand years , but survived only six .
If you have never seen Hitler complain about Brett Farve ’s pseudo - retirement , the HD - DVD / Blu - Ray format wars , or the American election cycle , then this may be your last chance .
The uber - popular Downfall subs , aka The Hitler Meme or Hitler Finds Out , in which users provide new subtitles to an amazing scene from the 2004 film Der Untergang ( Downfall ) of the Great Dictator melting down in his bunker , are in the process of being walled off .
The German production company Constantin Film has blocked these parodies from YouTube “ on copyright grounds . ”
If there is still time , I recommend you read Alex Leavitt ’s excellent exploration of the history and meaning of this meme ( and memes in general ) at doalchemy.org .
My immediate thought on hearing this news was to create a “ Hitler finds out that ‘ Hitler finds out ’ is being taken down ” but was I happy to discover that general friend of Internet Freedom , Brad Templeton , has already completed a masterful parody of an earlier rash of take downs .
But my joy was tempered by the thought that YouTube users may lose access to such a widespread , versatile , and dare I saw , intellectually valuable meme .
So let ’s follow the familiar route and explore : 1 ) these automated takedowns , 2 ) why this particular line of attack is colossally stupid , and 3 ) fair use ( the likely tool used by content authors to salvage their own “ Hitler finds out ” creations ) .
First off , there are a few sites reporting that the Hitler blackout is the result of DMCA takedown notices .
This is not technically correct .
This particular shut down appears to be the result of YouTube 's “ Content ID Tool . ”
In response to requests from copyright holders , YouTube has added a Video ID tool that checks uploaded videos against a cache of digital audio / video fingerprints for copyrighted content .
The copyright owner can choose to automatically block , track , or monetize videos that contain their fingerprinted content .
So the owner has several , non-destructive , value - adding options .
Constantin films has elected to go through door number 1 , which is a bit like getting involved in a land war in Asia .
Second , the decision to drag their content from the hands of potential consumers is simply idiotic .
Constantin could have tried to generate ad revenue from user - generated content , making money for nothing ( and chicks for free ) .
Or , it could have used the track figure to gather more information about the relative popularity / interest in Downfall and targeted those markets for future sales .
Instead , Constantin has decided to go dark , and hope that consumers , who will no longer be constantly exposed to novel commercials for a 6 - year - old product , will suddenly gain a greater interest in German Cinema .
Who thought this was a good idea ?
Finally , I ’d like to briefly touch on the possible legal posture of users and Constantin : are “ Hitler Finds Out ” videos fair use of Constantin ’s copyrighted content ?
The fair use defense looks to the purpose and character of the use , the nature of the work itself , the amount of the work used , and the effect of the use on the market value of the work .
17 U.S.C. § 107 .
It seems to me that the majority of these factors point in the favor of Hitler artists .
These videos appear to be non-profit ( though I suppose they might be hosted on other sites with embedded ads ) , the amount of the movie used is rather short , and my gut tells me that these videos had no negative effects on the market value of Downfall .
( I , for one , first watched Downfall after seeing the particularly intense “ Hitler finds out Barack Obama is the presumptive nominee . ” )
Also , I ’d like to briefly correct a view I have seen on several sites : just because the videos are being used as parodies does not automatically render them fair use .
While it is true that courts generally look favorably on parody , they are much more likely to allow parodies which provide commentary on the originally copyrighted content .
For example , the song Barbie girl and the art installation “ Food Chain Barbie ” were deemed fair because these works commented on the social values embodied by Mattel 's Barbie doll .
Here , the great majority of “ Hitler Finds Out ” videos are n’t parodying Hitler or the Movie Downfall or Constantin films ( though I have a feeling that ’s about to change ) , but are instead simply using the image of Hitler to comment on Brett Farve ’s career , or the rabidity of Apple Fanboys , or the pressure to create new and interesting memes .
So to sum up : these take downs are like waging a two front war – monumentally dumb .
This whole maneuver seems to be a pointless exercise of copyright for copyright ’s sake – if it ’s wrong to want to live in a world where I can see Hitler complain about the ending of Inglourious Basterds , then I do n’t want to be right .
( Andrew Moshirnia is a second year law student at Harvard Law School and a CMLP blogger .
He had many Hitler related meme - puns .
His favorite was Meme Kampf , which totally makes sense because it would mean Meme Struggle , and that 's exactly what this is , but he rightly assumed his editors would n't let him print that . )
It was close to 2 a.m. when Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) and others on a House - Senate conference committee saw just how much clout the oil industry had when it came to winning special tax breaks and other financial benefits from Congress .
At issue was the 2005 Energy Policy Act — the largest energy bill in years .
The committee chairman , Rep. Joe L. Barton ( R- Texas ) , a friend of the industry , had saved some big issues for the end : billions of dollars in tax and royalty relief to encourage drilling for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico and other offshore areas .
There was even a $ 50 - million annual earmark to support technical research for the industry .
At the time , drilling was already proceeding at a brisk pace , and industry profits were setting records .
“ With all the money they are making , ” Markey said to his top energy aide , who recalled the scene , “ why does the government need to subsidize their work and their research ? ”
That point of view did not prevail .
The bleary - eyed lawmakers wanted no part of Markey ’s amendments .
The bill was eventually passed in both houses with bipartisan support .
Notably , then - Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois voted in favor .
Today , Markey and other critics complain that these policies have cost the U.S.
Treasury tens of billions in lost revenue , and led to a reckless search for oil in fragile environments like the deep floor of the Gulf of Mexico .
He and others say the unfolding catastrophe at the Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded April 20 in a disaster that killed 11 , can be directly linked to oil - friendly legislation over the last two decades .
On Monday , three senators introduced a bill to reduce tax breaks and royalty waivers they deemed a giveaway to big oil companies .
Industry officials contend that the incentives have resulted in gains in domestic production , additional fees paid to the Treasury , and many jobs created in gulf state oil communities .
And they say there is no connection between the industry incentives and the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
But there is little disagreement that the industry received significant federal support for such deep - water drilling .
Since the government began aggressively issuing offshore drilling permits under President Reagan , the industry has received tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies , including exemptions from royalty payments — the fees due when a company extracts resources from U.S. government property .
The royalty waiver program was established by Congress in 1995 , when oil was selling for about $ 18 a barrel and drilling in deep water was seen as unprofitable without a subsidy .
Today , oil sells for about $ 70 a barrel , but the subsidy continues .
The Government Accountability Office estimates that the deep - water waiver program could cost the Treasury $ 55 billion or more in lost revenue over the life of the leases , depending on the price of oil and gas and the performances of the wells .
Congress had originally intended to provide royalty relief only when oil prices were especially low .
But an Interior Department error in the drafting of contracts in the 1990s led the industry to argue against pegging the relief to oil prices .
Oil companies won a lawsuit last year requiring the government to pay back $ 2.1 billion in royalties from previous years , including about $ 240 million to BP .
An increasing number of analysts say the waiver program has pushed drilling into fragile and remote areas where emergency response plans were inadequate .
“ If it was n’t profitable for them to do it , then that ’s a good argument for leaving the oil in the ground , ” said Robert Gramling , who studies the history of the oil industry at the University of Louisiana , Lafayette .
The government - subsidized rush to deep - water exploration led to a situation where the industry was doing “ things that were technically possible but were beyond our ability to undo them if we find out we have a problem . ”
At the industry - funded American Petroleum Institute , policy advisor Allison Nyholm disputes Gramling ’s conclusions and points out that the incentives yielded an enormous jump in energy resources .
In addition , she said , the expansion of drilling in the gulf created tens of thousands of jobs .
But through the years , critics have argued that the incentives are no longer necessary .
“ No reputable economist believes that increasing the amount of [ offshore ] drilling we do will have any real impact on energy prices , ” said Rep. Nick J. Rahall II ( D - W.Va . ) , chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee , in a hearing last year as he called for the end of some of the royalty waiver programs and for a more cautious approach to drilling .
In addition , several analysts say , billions more have been lost to the Treasury through another form of subsidy — favorable packaging of federal leases sold by the Interior Department .
Bill Freudenburg , a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara who has worked with Gramling studying the economics of offshore drilling , contended that such packaging had in effect given away drilling rights .
He noted that in the early 1980s , the Interior Department began selling drilling leases at an average rate of $ 263 per acre compared with $ 2,224 per acre in the previous decades .
A 2008 General Accounting Office report found that out of 104 jurisdictions throughout the world , only 11 received a smaller portion of oil revenue than the U.S. government .
“ We were just stunned by how badly the American taxpayer has been getting screwed , ” Freudenburg said .
“ I do n’t know of too many places where it is harder and more expensive to get oil out of the ground than the North Sea off of Norway .
And Norway somehow manages to get a 75 % take [ of oil revenue ] , basically double of what we get . ”
Mark Salt , a BP spokesman , said , “ We are active in a whole range of countries and a whole range of licensing regimes , including Norway .
Royalty relief is a widely used system and it ’s a matter for governments to determine their efficacy . ”
At the American Petroleum Institute , Nyholm said it was a mistake to look only at the lease price or the royalty rate .
“ The government ’s take includes royalty rates , lease sale bids , bonus bids that are paid at the time of the lease .
It includes rents and taxes .
…
Different countries structure their programs differently .
We have a very , I would say , complicated structure . ”
But , she adds , it has yielded strong results , such as new exploration and job creation .
The industry also argues that comparing the price per acre on drilling leases unfairly pits an era of easy discovery against one in which production is far more problematic .
The bill introduced in the Senate on Monday would charge an excise tax — worth $ 5.3 billion over 10 years — on oil produced under certain leases .
It would also close other tax breaks to industry , including some items that President Obama had suggested ending .
A different approach in the House , which would require companies that seek new leases to renegotiate existing royalty waivers or pay a fee , has cleared that body on multiple occasions but never won approval in the Senate .
Industry lobbyists have rallied effectively during previous efforts to rein in the oil exploration and subsidy programs .
All told , the oil and gas industry spent $ 174.7 million and registered 788 lobbyists to influence lawmakers and regulators last year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan research organization .
Since 1998 , the industry has spent $ 966.8 million on lobbying , making it the sixth - biggest - spending interest group in Washington , the center found .
“ Previous attempts to close these loopholes were dead on arrival because of the industry ’s clout , ” said Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , who co-sponsored the bill with Sens. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) and Jeff Merkley ( D - Ore . ) .
“ Maybe that wo n’t be the case this time . ”

I just got off the phone with my friends Naomi Klein , author of The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , and her husband , Avi Lewis , host of al Jazeera English ’s popular program Fault Lines .
They are traveling around the devastated US Gulf reporting on the horrific disaster caused by BP ’s massive oil spill .
They described to me a run in that they just had with the private security company Wackenhut , which apparently has been hired to do the perimeter security for the " Deepwater Horizon Unified Command . "
The " Unified Command " is run jointly by BP and several US government agencies including the US Coast Guard , the Department of Defense , the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security .
Ad Policy
Wackenhut , of course , is the notorious private security company that operates in the US and around the globe .
It recently became part of the huge British mercenary network G4S .
Most recently , Wackenhut gained global infamy for the conduct of guards from its subsidiary Armor Group after it was revealed by whistleblowers that the company created a " Lord of the Flies environment " at the embassy " in which guards and supervisors are ‘ peeing on people , eating potato chips out of [ buttock ] cracks , vodka shots out of [ buttock ] cracks … [ drunken ] brawls , threats and intimidation from those leaders participating in this activity . "
According to the Project on Government Oversight , " Multiple guards say this deviant hazing has created a climate of fear and coercion , with those who declined to participate often ridiculed , humiliated , demoted , or even fired .
The result is an environment that is dangerous and volatile .
Some guards have reported barricading themselves in their rooms for fear that those carrying out the hazing will harm them physically . "
In other words , Wackenhut is the perfect choice to " guard " the joint BP - US government - US military operation in the Gulf .
Lewis told me that for two weeks his crew has attempted to interview officials from the Unified Command ’s Joint Information Center .
" We had been shut down or dodged for two weeks of official requests , " he said .
Finally , Lewis and Klein , who is on assignment for The Guardian , decided to go to the information center in person " to try to nail something down . "
When they pulled up to the front gate , they were greeted by a private security guard working for Wackenhut , the massive security company .
" We said we were media and he said , ‘ No no no .
You ’re going to have to turn around and go back , " recalls Lewis .
Klein added , " The Wackenhut guard said we could n’t come in without permission , but would n’t tell us who we needed permission from .
When we did n’t leave , he radioed for back up and a Wackenhut truck arrived to escort us off the grounds . "
Here ’s a photo of the Wackenhut guard stopping them :
Klein , who spent extensive time in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina documenting the widespread disaster profiteering and privatization that endures to this day , said the fact that Wackenhut is guarding a joint operation of the US government and BP is not surprising given what is happening in the Gulf right now .
" The whole Gulf Coast is a corporate oil state , " she told me .
" It ’s like BP broke it , so now they own the entire Gulf Coast . "
She added : " We might accept the premise that BP is best positionioned to know how to fix the blow up at 5,000 feet , but that also seems to mean they think they should control media access and the entire clean up of a massive national emergency .
BP is in charge of everything .
We were on the water in open seas the day before the Wackenhut incident and a boat pulled up next to us and asked if we worked for BP and we said , ‘ No , ’ and they said , ‘ You ca n’t be here . ’
It is completely sci-fi .
It ’s a corporate state . "
Well , let ’s see , you still need papers in Arizona–finish the danged fence , eh , John McCain ?
And Elena Kagan is now the darling of Laura Bush–who has started opening her mouth more and more since she does n’t have to just nod her head and smile –although she does that quite a lot in her new book –the one with the mummy mask on the cover ?
So it looks like we ’re back with the LaGulfa Tar Pit–formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico .
Just think , boys and girls , in 50,000 years , people , or whatever intelligent species will be inhabiting this planet , will be able to excavate the Gulf of Mexico and find all sorts of creatures that used to live in the ocean !
We were treated to the spectacle of BP , Transocean and Halliburton all pointing fingers at each other , saying that it was some other guy ’s fault that for nearly a month now , crude oil has been gushing into the sea , endangering wildlife , fishing , creating a dead zone far greater than the previous one , and in general , becoming OILMAGEDDON .
Really , it looked like a Three Stooges movie .
In fact , it probably would have been much more fun for all of us victims to see these three guys slapping each other and poking fingers into eyes !
True , this is probably unfair to Moe , Larry and Curly .
They only created disasters on a purely local level .
Like leveling a house .
It takes an oil executive to create one on a global scale !
See what a college education can do for YOU !
The “ Drill , Baby , Drill ” ideologues have in the meantime weighed in with their peculiar brand of irrationality .
Sarah Palin says this is why we should n’t trust furriners like BRITISH Petroleum ( never mind that TransOcean and Halliburton are American companies ) .
Rush Limbaugh ideates that environmentalists did this to scotch any further offshore drilling –this is the cutting off your nose to spite your face strategy –or maybe Koreans .
He ’s not sure –he ’ll know in another dose of oxycodone .
And of course , the pro-drill crowd says this just PROVES we need to do more offshore drilling –look at all the oil we ’re losing , we ’ve got to make that up SOMEHOW and after all , practice makes perfect !
In the meantime , BP has tried to cap the well with the TOP HAT and the HOT TAP–amazing that the ONLY thing they ’ve gotten to work so far is something that allows them to recover some of the spill into a tanker , but in the meantime , we still have the 10 mile long plumes of crude shooting out to sea .
And it ’s getting near the current that will take it to the Florida Keys .
Ernest Hemingway could n’t do it , hurricanes could n’t do it , but it looks like good old capitalism will finally shut Sloppy Joe ’s down !
And as we watch the death of one of the most important bodies of water in the world , let ’s have a drink on that old fisherman and his soon - to - be- vanished marlin .
One more for my baby and one more for the road –because it was the road that got us here .

A former European Commissioner 's proposal to join the board of budget airline Ryanair just two months after retiring from Brussels has sparked discussion over the possible conflicts of interest that can develop when public figures decide to cross over into the private sector – and concern that measures in place to prevent these conflicts of interest do n't go far enough .
A European Commission ethics committee is mulling over whether former Internal Markets and Services Commissioner Charlie McCreevy , who left his post in February , would breach Lisbon Treaty regulations if he were to accept a position as a non-executive director of Ryanair .
The company has a long - running – and fraught – relationship with Brussels : seven of Ryanair 's contracts with European airports are subject to long - running state - aid inquiries by the commission .
These are not , however , managed by McCreevy 's former portfolio .
Life after office ?
Charlie McCreevy left the European Commission in February
Under the Lisbon Treaty , former European commissioners are obliged to " behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance … of certain appointments or benefits . "
They must also inform the commission if they intend to take up any new position within a year of leaving the executive body .
When this happens , the commission 's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee reviews the proposal and makes a recommendation to the commission as to whether or not the new post might overlap with the former commissioner 's duties for the European Union and therefore present a conflict of interest .
A well - trod path
McCreevy would hardly be the first public figure to take up a position in the corporate world , and the majority of those who make this switch do so legitimately .
But possible conflicts of interest are an ever - present concern , and Berlin - based international corruption watchdog Transparency International says the regulations in place to prevent them from arising in Europe need to be strengthened .
" It is important , to prevent conflict of interest , to ensure that all former commissioners take some sort of a cooling off period after they end their job in the European Commission , after their term is finalised , in order to prevent a situation whereby they can sort of abuse the powers that they used to have , " Jana Mittermaier , head of Transparency International 's Brussels office , said .
Europe is not corruption - free , according to Transparency International
Though the word ' corruption ' calls to mind above all theft , bribes and cronyism , Mittermaier said it often takes a far more insidious form – and that Europe is not immune .
" The [ European Union ] is very diverse and it's not free from corruption at all … we found out that in the western European Union member states , you have more a grand , private - sector related type of corruption , and conflict of interest does play a role in this context for sure . "
This kind of corruption could be something as simple as an ex-official using his or her insider knowledge of a government to gain an unfair advantage in lobbying – or it could suggest a public official who assists a firm while still in office , only to join that firm on leaving government .
Blurred lines
In December 2005 , when former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder accepted a position at Russian gas company Gazprom shortly after stepping down from his government position , the Washington Post called it a " sellout " move .
The newspaper pointed to Schroeder 's support , while still in office , of the controversial Nord Stream pipeline project , and wrote that Schroeder 's move to Gazprom should " raise questions in German voters ' minds about the real reasons Mr. Schroeder was so keen to see this pipeline project launched …
Many have wondered why Germany chose to go along with this project .
Could it have been because the former chancellor realized that he was , in effect , creating his own future place of employment ? "
Schroeder supported Nord Stream when he was Chancellor - now he works for Gazprom
Similar concerns were raised in 1999 , when German politician and acting European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann announced that he planned to move to the executive board of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica – controversial because he had been responsible for EU information and telecommunications policies since 1992 .
Bangemann was subsequently dismissed by the commission , and the ensuing scandal was one of the deciding factors in the push for the development of the European Code of Conduct for Commissioners ( CoCC ) .
Simple measures could cut corruption
Mittermaier said the best way to avoid these kinds of concerns is to enforce a cooling - off period between when public officials leave office and when they take up a new position that could overlap with the area in which they worked in a public capacity .
Transparency International has called for a mandatory three - year cooling - off period to be introduced – currently , according to the CoCC , former commissioners can take up new posts immediately after leaving the commission , although if they wish to do so within one year of leaving the commission they must report their intentions – and for sanctions to be introduced to enforce the CoCC .
Indeed , an independent 2009 report commissioned by the European Parliament 's own Committee on Budgetary Control to examine the effectiveness of the CoCC recommended the commission move " to extend the post - office employment restrictions to two years after leaving office , and to require a minimum time of notice between notifying post - office employment and engaging in this activity . "
The report also noted that no clear criteria existed to help the Ad Hoc Ethics Committee determine whether a new position might compromise a former commissioner 's " integrity and discretion " .
Brussels has no plans to alter the Commissioner Code of Conduct
However , Michael Mann , a commission spokesperson , said that there were no plans to extend the post - office employment restrictions to two years or develop additional criteria , saying that the Ethics Committee takes a " broad - ranging " approach when it makes its recommendations .
He added that the cooling off period outlined in the CoCC is irrelevant – even once the year has passed , former commissioners " are bound by the Lisbon Treaty for the rest of their days " .
That is , a former commissioner would still have to satisfy the " integrity and discretion " clause when considering new positions even five or 10 years after leaving his or her post – but he or she would not have to inform the commission before taking up that new post .
Mann said that there were no plans as yet to introduce specific sanctions for former commissioners who refused to comply with the recommendations of the Ethics Committee , saying he was not aware of this having been an issue since the CoCC was introduced in 2004 .
He added that the commission already has legal recourse in the event of this situation occurring .
" Hypothetically , if it did happen , the Commission could take them to the European Court and it might affect their pension , " Mann said .
As for McCreevy and the board of Ryanair , the Ethics Committee is expected to make its recommendation soon , having already given the green light to four other former commissioners this week .
A Ryanair spokesperson told Deutsche Welle that " Ryanair does n't comment on rumours and speculation . "

The Role of Socratic Questioning in Thinking , Teaching , & Learning
One of the reasons that instructors tend to overemphasize “ coverage ” over “ engaged thinking ” is that they do not fully appreciate the role of questions in teaching content .
Consequently , they assume that answers can be taught separate from questions .
Indeed , so buried are questions in established instruction that the fact that all assertions -- all statements that this or that is so -- are implicit answers to questions is virtually never recognized .
For example , the statement that water boils at 100 degrees centigrade is an answer to the question “ At what temperature centigrade does water boil ? ”
Hence every declarative statement in the textbook is an answer to a question .
Hence , every textbook could be rewritten in the interrogative mode by translating every statement into a question .
To our knowledge this has never been done .
That it has not is testimony to the privileged status of answers over questions in instruction and the misunderstanding of teachers about the significance of questions in the learning ( and thinking ) process .
Instruction at all levels now keeps most questions buried in a torrent of obscured “ answers . ”
Thinking is Driven by Questions
But thinking is not driven by answers but by questions .
Had no questions been asked by those who laid the foundation for a field -- for example , Physics or Biology -- the field would never have been developed in the first place .
In fact , every intellectual field is born out of a cluster of questions to which answers are either needed or highly desirable .
Furthermore , every field stays alive only to the extent that fresh questions are generated and taken seriously as the driving force in a process of thinking .
To think through or rethink anything , one must ask questions that stimulate thought .
Questions define tasks , express problems and delineate issues .
Answers on the other hand , often signal a full stop in thought .
Only when an answer generates a further question does thought continue its life as such .
This is why it is true that only students who have questions are really thinking and learning .
Moreover , the quality of the questions students ask determines the quality of the thinking they are doing .
It is possible to give students an examination on any subject by just asking them to list all of the questions that they have about a subject , including all questions generated by their first list of questions .
That we do not test students by asking them to list questions and explain their significance is again evidence of the privileged status we give to answers isolated from questions .
That is , we ask questions only to get thought - stopping answers , not to generate further questions .
Feeding Students Endless Content to Remember Feeding students endless content to remember ( that is , declarative sentences or “ facts ” to remember ) is akin to repeatedly stepping on the brakes in a vehicle that is , unfortunately , already at rest .
Instead , students need questions to turn on their intellectual engines and they must themselves generate questions from our questions to get their thinking to go somewhere .
Thinking is of no use unless it goes somewhere , and again , the questions we ask determine where our thinking goes .
It is only when our thinking goes somewhere that we learn anything of value to us .
Deep questions drive our thought underneath the surface of things , force us to deal with complexity .
Questions of purpose force us to define our task .
Questions of information force us to look at our sources of information as well as at the quality of our information .
Questions of interpretation force us to examine how we are organizing or giving meaning to information and to consider alternative ways of giving meaning .
Questions of assumption force us to examine what we are taking for granted .
Questions of implication force us to follow out where our thinking is going .
Questions of point of view force us to examine our point of view and to consider other relevant points of view .
Questions of relevance force us to discriminate what does and what does not bear on a question .
Questions of accuracy force us to evaluate and test for truth and correctness .
Questions of precision force us to give details and be specific .
Questions of consistency force us to examine our thinking for contradictions .
Questions of logic force us to consider how we are putting the whole of our thought together , to make sure that it all adds up and makes sense within a reasonable system of some kind .
Dead Questions Reflect Dead Minds
Unfortunately , most students ask virtually none of these thought - stimulating types of questions .
They tend to stick to dead questions like “ Is this going to be on the test ? ” , questions that imply the desire not to think .
Most teachers in turn are not themselves generators of questions and answers of their own , that is , are not seriously engaged in thinking through or rethinking through their own subjects .
Rather , they are purveyors of the questions and answers of others -- usually those of a textbook .
We must continually remind ourselves that thinking begins within some content only when questions are generated by both teachers and students .
No questions equals no understanding .
Superficial questions equals superficial understanding .
Most students typically have no intellectual questions .
They not only sit in silence ; their minds are silent at well .
Hence , the questions they do have tend to be superficial , ill - formed and self - serving .
This demonstrates that most of the time they are not thinking through the content they are presumed to be learning .
In other words , most of the time they are not learning the content they are presumed to be learning .
If we want to engage students in thinking through our content we must stimulate their thinking with questions that lead them to further questions .
We must overcome what previous schooling has done to the thinking of students .
We must resuscitate minds that are largely dead when we receive them .
We must give our students what might be called “ artificial cogitation ” ( the intellectual equivalent of artificial respiration ) .
The Art of Socratic Questioning
The art of Socratic questioning is important for the critical thinker because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought .
What the word ‘ Socratic ’ adds is “ systematicity , ” “ depth , ” and a keen interest in assessing the truth or plausibility of things .
There is a special relationship between critical thinking and Socratic questioning because both share a common end .
Critical thinking gives one a comprehensive view of how the mind functions ( in its pursuit of meaning and truth ) , and Socratic questioning takes advantage of that overview to frame questions essential to the quality of that pursuit .
The goal of critical thinking is to establish a disciplined “ executive ” level of thinking to our thinking , a powerful inner voice of reason , to monitor , assess , and re-constitute –in a more rational direction–our thinking , feeling , and action .
Socratic discussion cultivates that inner voice by providing a public model for it .
The Spirit and Principles of Socratic Questioning
While there are numerous ways in which Socratic questioning can be effectively executed in the classroom , there are a set of principles , which guide a Socratic dialog .
In this section , there principles are laid out in the form of directives .
Teachers engaged in a Socratic dialog should : Respond to all answers with a further question ( that calls upon the respondent to develop his / her thinking in a fuller and deeper way ) .
Seek to understand –where possible – the ultimate foundations for what is said or believed and follow the implications of those foundations through further
questions .
Treat all assertions as a connecting point to further thoughts .
Treat all thoughts as in need of development .
Recognize that any thought can only exist fully in a network of connected
thoughts .
Stimulate students –through your questions –to pursue those
connections .
Recognize that all questions presuppose prior questions and all thinking
presupposes prior thinking .
When raising questions , be open to the questions
they presuppose .
( See the section on logically - prior questions . )
Teachers engaged in Socratic dialog should systematically raise questions based on the following recognitions and assumptions : Focusing on The Elements of Thought Recognize that all thought reflects an agenda .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the agenda behind it .
( What are you trying to accomplish in saying this ?
What is your central aim in this line of thought ? )
Recognize that all thoughts presuppose an information base .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the background information that supports or informs it .
( What information are you basing that comment on ?
What experience convinced you of this ?
How do we know this information is accurate ? )
Recognize that all thought requires the making of inferences , the drawing of conclusions , the creation of meaning .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the inferences that have shaped it .
( How did you reach that conclusion ?
Could you explain your reasoning ?
Is there an alternative plausible conclusion ? )
Recognize that all thought involves the application of concepts .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the concepts that define and shape it .
( What is the main idea you are putting forth ?
Could you explain that idea ? )
Recognize that all thought rests upon other thoughts ( which are taken for granted or assumed ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand what it takes for granted .
( What exactly are you taking for granted here ?
Why are you assuming that ? )
Recognize that all thought is headed in a direction .
It not only rests upon something ( assumptions ) , it is also going somewhere ( implications and consequences ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought unless you know the implications and consequences that follow from it .
( What are you implying when you say that ?
Are you implying that ...?)
Recognize that all thought takes place within a point of view or frame of reference .
Assume that you do not fully understand a thought until you understand the point of view or frame of reference which places it on an intellectual map .
( From what point of view are you looking at this ?
Is there another point of view we should consider ? )
Recognize that all thought is responsive to a question .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the question that gives rise to it .
( I am not sure exactly what question you are raising .
Could you explain it ? )
Systems and Contexts For Thought Recognize that all thought has three possible functions : to express a subjective preference , to establish an objective fact ( within a well - defined system ) , or to come up with the best of competing answers ( generated by competing systems ) .
Assume that you do not fully understand thinking until you know which of the three is involved .
( Is the question calling for a subjective or personal choice ?
If so , let ’s make that choice in terms of our personal preferences .
If not , then , is there a way to come up with one correct answer to this question ( a definite system in which to find the answer ) ?
Or , finally , are we dealing with a question that would be answered differently within different points of view ?
If the latter , what is the best answer to the question , all things considered ? )
Recognize that all thought has emerged within a human context .
Assume that you do not fully understand the thought until you understand the context which has given rise to it .
( Tell us more about the situation that has given rise to this problem .
What was going on in this situation ? )
How To Prepare To Lead a Socratic Discussion
One of the best ways to prepare to lead a Socratic discussion is by pre-thinking the main question to be discussed using the approach of developing prior questions .
Prior questions are questions presupposed by another question .
Hence , to settle the question “ What is multi-culturalism ? ” I should be able to first settle the question , “ What is culture ? , ” and to settle that question , I should be able to settle the question “ What is the basis of culture ? , ” that is , “ What are the factors about a person which determine what culture he / she belongs to ? ’ ”
Construct A List of Prior Questions
To construct a list of prior questions , simply write down the main question which you are going to focus your discussion on and then pose a question you would have to be able to answer before you could answer the first .
Then take the second question and do the same for it ( i.e. , determine what question you would have to answer to answer it ) .
Then , continue on , following the same procedure for every new question on your list .
As you proceed to construct your list keep your attention focused on the first question on the list as well as on the last .
If you do this well , you should end up with a list of questions which probe the logic of the first question , and hence , a list of questions which are relevant to a Socratic discussion of your first question .
During the Socratic dialog , you should loosely follow your list of logically prior questions , using it primarily as a guide for deeply probing the issue at hand .
A Sample List
As an example of how to construct logically prior questions , consider this list of questions that we developed in thinking through a key question intended for use in conducting a Socratic discussion on the question , “ What is history ? ”
What is history ?
What do historians write about ?
What is the past ?
Is it possible to include all of the past in a history book ?
How many of the events during a given time period are left out in a history of that time period ?
Is more left out than is included ?
How does a historian know what to emphasize or focus on ?
Do historians make value judgments in deciding what to include and what to
leave out ?
Is it possible to simply list facts in a history book or does all history writing
involve interpretations as well as facts ?
Is it possible to decide what to include and exclude and how to interpret facts
without adopting a historical point of view ?
How can we begin to judge a historical interpretation ?
How can we begin to judge a historical point of view ?
Sample Socratic Dialogue
In this final section , we provide a sample high school Socratic questioning dialog : Teacher ( T ) : This is a course in Biology .
What kind of a subject is that ?
What do you know about Biology already ?
Kathleen , what do you know about it ?
Kathleen :
It ’s a science .
T : And what ’s a science ?
Kathleen : Me ? A science is very exact .
They do experiments and measure things and test things .
T : Right , and what other sciences are there besides Biology ?
Marisa , could you name some ?
Marisa : Sure , there ’s Chemistry and Physics .
T : What else ?
Blake : There ’s Botany and Math ?
T : Math ... math is a little different from the others , is n’t it ?
How is math different from Biology , Chemistry , Physics , and Botany ?
Blake , what would you say ?
Blake :
You do n’t do experiments in math .
T : And why not ?
Blake : I guess cause numbers are different .
T : Yes , studying numbers and other mathematical things is different from studying chemicals or laws in the physical world or living things and so forth .
You might ask your math teacher about why numbers are different or do some reading about that , but let ’s focus our attention here on what are called the life sciences .
Why are Biology and Botany called life sciences ?
Peter : Because they both study living things .
T : How are they different ?
How is Biology different from Botany ?
Jennifer , what do you think ?
Jennifer : I do n’t know .
T : Well , let ’s all of us look up the words in our dictionaries and see what is said about them .
( Students look up the words )
T : Jennifer , what did you find for Biology ?
Jennifer :
It says : " The science that deals with the origin , history , physical characteristics , life processes , habits , etc ...of plants and animals : It includes Botany and Zoology " .
T : So what do we know about the relationship of Botany to Biology ?
Rick ?
Rick : Botany is just a part of Biology .
T : Right , and what can we tell about Biology from just looking at its etymology .
What does it literally mean ?
If you break the word into two parts " bio " and " logy " .
Blake , what does it tell us ?
Blake :
The science of life or the study of life .
T : So , do you see how etymology can help us get an insight into the meaning of a word ?
Do you see how the longer definition spells out the etymological meaning in greater detail ?
Well , why do you think experiments are so important to biologists and other scientists ?
Have humans always done experiments do you think ?
Marisa .
Marisa : I guess not , not before there was any science .
T : Right .
That ’s an excellent point .
Science did n’t always exist .
What did people do before science existed ?
How did they get their information ?
How did they form their beliefs ?
Peter .
Peter : From religion .
T : Yes , religion often shaped a lot of what people thought .
Why do n’t we use religion today to decide , for example , what is true of the origin , history , and physical characteristics of life ?
Peter : Some people still do .
Some people believe that the Bible explains the origin of life and that the theory of evolution is wrong .
T : What is the theory of evolution , Jose ?
Jose : I do n’t know .
T : Well , why do n’t we all look up the name Darwin in our dictionaries and see if there is anything there about Darwinian theory .
( Students look up the words )
T : Jose , read aloud what you have found .
Jose :
It says " Darwin ’s theory of evolution holds that all species of plants and animals developed from earlier forms by hereditary transmission of slight variations in successive generations and that the forms which survive are those that are best adapted to the environment . "
T : What does that mean to you .... in ordinary language ?
How would you explain that ?
Jose .
Jose :
It means the stronger survive and the weaker die ?
T : Well , if that ’s true why do you think the dinosaurs died out ?
I thought dinosaurs were very strong ?
Shannon :
They died because of the ice age , I think .
T : So I guess it ’s not enough to be strong , you must also fit in with the changes in the environment .
Perhaps fitness or adaptability is more important than strength .
Well , in any case why do you think that most people today look to science to provide answers to questions about the origin and nature of life rather than to the Bible or other religious teachings ?
Shannon : Nowadays most people believe that science and religion deal with different things and that scientific questions cannot be answered by religion .
T : And by the same token , I suppose , we recognize that religious questions cannot be answered by science .
In any case , how were scientists able to convince people to consider their way of finding answers to questions about the nature of life and life processes .
Kathleen , you ’ve been quiet for a while , what do you think ?
Kathleen :
To me science can be proved .
When scientists say something we can ask for proof and they can show us , and if we want we can try it out for ourselves .
T : Could you explain that further ?
Kathleen : Sure , in my chemistry class we did experiments in which we tested out some of the things that were said in our chemistry books .
We could see for ourselves .
T : That ’s right , science is based on the notion that when we claim things to be true about the world we should be able to test them to see if , objectively , they are true .
Marisa , you have a question ?
Marisa :
Yes , but do n’t we all test things .
We test our parents and our friends .
We try out ideas to see if they work .
T : That ’s true .
But is there any difference between the way you and I test our friends and the way a chemist might test a solution to see if it is acidic ?
Marisa : Sure , … but I ’m not sure how to explain it .
T : Blake , what do you think ?
Blake : Scientists have laboratories ; we do n’t .
T : They also do precise measurements and use precise instruments , do n’t they ?
Why do n’t we do that with our friends , parents , and children ?
Adrian , do you have an idea why not ?
Adrian :
We do n’t need to measure our friends .
We need to find out whether they really care about us .
T : Yes , finding our about caring is a different matter than finding out about acids and bases , or even than finding out about animal behavior .
You might say that there are two different kinds of realities in the world , the qualitative and the quantitative , and that science is mostly concerned with the quantitative , while we are often concerned with the qualitative .
Could you name some qualitative ideas that all of us are concerned with ?
Rick , what do you think ?
Rick : I do n’t know what you mean .
T : Well , the word qualitative is connected to the word quality .
If I were to ask you to describe your own qualities in comparison to your brother or sister , would you know the sort of thing I was asking you ?
Rick : I guess so .
T : Could you , for example , take your father and describe to us some of his best and some of his worst qualities as you see them ?
Rick : I guess so .
T : OK , why do n’t you do it .
What do you think some of your father ’s best qualities are ?
Rick :
To me he is generous .
He likes to help people out when they are in trouble .
T : And what science studies generosity ?
Rick : I do n’t know .
None , I guess .
T : That ’s right , generosity is a human quality ; it ca n’t be measured scientifically .
There is no such thing as generosity units .
So science is not the only way we can find things out .
We can also experience qualities in the world .
We can experience kindness , generosity , fear , love , hate , jealousy , self - satisfaction , friendship , and many , many other things as well .
In this class we are concerned mainly with what we can find out about life quantitatively or scientifically .
For next time , I want you to read the first chapter in your text book and I want you to be prepared to explain what the first chapter says .
I will be dividing you up into groups of four and each group of four will develop a short summary of the first chapter ( without looking at it , of course ) and then we will have a spokesperson from each group explain your summary to the class .
After that , we will have a discussion of the ideas mentioned .
Do n’t forget today ’s discussion , because I ’ll be asking you some questions that will see if you can relate what we talked about today with what was said in your first chapter .
Any questions ? … OK , … See you next time .
