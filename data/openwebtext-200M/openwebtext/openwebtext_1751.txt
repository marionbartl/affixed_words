In a rare departure from this year ’s intense political posturing over the soaring budget deficit , House leaders of both parties recently signaled that they are prepared to tackle a leading long - term liability — Social Security — by raising the retirement age .
Politicians often talk in generalities about cutting the deficit , but discussing specifics about how Congress may curb the growth of the biggest and most popular programs such as Social Security and defense is controversial and usually taboo in an election year .
But lessons learned from the debt crisis in Europe and worries that the U.S. could soon confront its own debt crisis , with annual deficits projected at about $ 1 trillion for years to come , may have prompted the unusually frank comments by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat , and House Minority Leader John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .
Speaking in unrelated forums , both leaders stressed that with people living longer and enjoying better health in their senior years , the nation simply can’t afford any longer to be paying out benefits for as long as 30 years after retirement .
“ We need to look at the American people and explain to them that we ’re broke , ” Mr. Boehner said in an interview last week with the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review .
Besides raising the retirement age for full Social Security benefits to 70 for people now 50 or younger , Mr. Boehner suggested curbing benefit growth by tying cost - of - living increases to the consumer price index rather than growth in wages , and providing benefits only to those who need them .
“ If you have substantial non-Social Security income while you ’re retired , why are we paying you at a time when we ’re broke ? ” he said .
“ We just need to be honest with people . ”
Mr. Hoyer also said it was time to be honest with the public that the sheer size of the deficits and public debt means any serious effort to cut them back to manageable levels will require cuts and reforms in all major programs — including defense and Social Security — as well as tax increases .
“ We could and should consider a higher retirement age , or one pegged to life span , ” he said in a speech last month before the Third Way think tank .
Like Mr. Boehner , he suggested making Social Security and Medicare more “ progressive , ” that is , providing benefits primarily to low - income people who need them the most .
Mr. Hoyer also endorsed specific cuts in defense weapons systems sought by the White House , and said the House Armed Services Committee is considering whether to adopt them .
“ I fear that if we cant decide what we can afford to do without today , well be forced to make much more draconian cuts in the years to come , ” he said .
The comments reveal that , beneath the heated rhetoric as each party seeks to gain a political advantage by blaming the other for surging deficits , congressional leaders appear to be laying the groundwork for negotiations on a solution — possibly as early as this fall .
A deficit commission appointed by President Obama is due to present its findings on how to reform major programs like Social Security and defense in November , and it is widely expected to endorse measures like raising the retirement age and others mentioned by the leaders .
Mr. Obama refused to rule out charging the commission with finding deficit solutions , including a value - added tax that would be the first - ever broad national tax on consumption .
One clue that both parties are getting serious about addressing the deficit problem is neither the White House nor congressional leaders of either party chose to single out for attack the others ’ unusually frank discussion on Social Security .
In fact , the interview in which Mr. Boehner detailed his views on Social Security was the same one in which he suggested that the Democrats ’
Wall Street regulatory reforms were like killing “ ants ” with a nuclear weapon — comments that the White House and liberal groups immediately denounced .
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Hoyer repeated the same political talking points that analysts say would make it harder to control the deficit in the future .
Mr. Boehner advocated continued free spending on defense and said that should Republicans take control of the House in the fall elections , one of his first acts as speaker would be to repeal the $ 534 billion in Medicare cuts used to finance the Democrats ’ expansion of health care this year .
Many of those cuts are the same ones seen in a Republican budget plan , the only one to date that carries out the GOP pledge to get the deficit under control without tax increases , authored by Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin .
Mr. Hoyer repeated a frequent Democratic defense of the gaping exemptions in congressional budget rules , which generally require new spending programs to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the budget .
Excluded from those “ pay - as - you - go ” rules are such major trillion - dollar expenses as Medicare doctor reimbursements and President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts for the middle class .
Mr. Hoyer said that was because Congress would routinely override the rules to keep those programs in place , and render the law “ toothless . ”
Still , good government groups were impressed at how far the leaders went toward signaling a consensus on ensuring the solvency of Social Security — one of the government ’s biggest long - term budget challenges .
“ It seems political leaders are finally getting the message ” that the public wants action , said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in a blog on Social Security .
“ Just getting congressional lawmakers to propose solutions in public has been difficult to come by .
Not anymore . ”
Congressional leaders have come to realize that Social Security — once considered the untouchable “ third rail ” of politics — is now the “ low - hanging fruit ” among the many seemingly intractable budget problems facing Congress , the committee said .
“ Compared to fixing Medicare or making significant changes to our tax system , reforming Social Security is a walk in the park , ” it said .
“ The funding gap is much smaller than it is for Medicare , and the options to solve Social Security ’s problems are clear and easy to quantify . ”
It helps that European countries from France and Britain to Greece are moving toward raising the retirement age for their pension systems to address their serious overspending problems and reassure investors in European debt markets .
The International Monetary Fund recently noted that solving such long - term budget problems carries the advantage of calming financial markets today while posing no immediate threat to economic growth like raising taxes or cutting stimulus spending .

An 18 - year - old from County Durham was found on fire after trying to steal live electrical cable carrying 11,000 volts , police said .
The teenager , from Darlington , suffered extensive burns to his arms and head during the incident at derelict buildings in Newton Aycliffe .
He was taken to Newcastle 's Royal Victoria Infirmary where his condition is described as serious .
A 19 - year - old man was arrested and bailed after the incident on Saturday .
' Highly dangerous '
Det Insp Simon Orton , of Durham Police , said : " This young man could have died .
He will have to live with the consequences of his criminal action for the rest of his life .
" People who go out to steal copper cabling carrying electricity are putting their lives at risk .
" We have had a number of these types of burglaries recently and we want emphasise that the intruders are putting themselves in highly dangerous situations where death could result from dishonesty . "
How completely can buses come to resemble streetcars / trams ?
Paris has crossed one important line that North America still seems stuck on : off - board fare collection .
Have another look at a new Paris bus :
Just forward of the back door , just above the advertising panel , is a green dot .
It ’s a button that opens the door from the outside , exactly like the buttons on Paris trams .
You can board a Paris bus at any door , unless you need to pay cash , in which case you board at the front .
If you board at the back , machines are just inside the door to either tag - on with your Navigo smartcard or validate your magnetic stripe ticket .
This is a standard proof - of - payment system , enforced by roving inspectors , just like what North Americans see on light rail but never on buses .
If you ’re used to dealing with crowded buses in any North American or Australasian city , you can probably sense how transformative this would be .
First of all , if a bus is mostly loading ( e.g. at the beginning of the line , where this bus is waiting to start ) , people can board all doors , so if there are three doors they can board in 1/3 the time .
Second , front - door collection forces people to start at the front of the bus and then move back , and this movement itself takes some capacity .
On Paris buses , there ’s no need to move around in the bus , instead , people tend to stay around the door where they boarded , just as they would on a tram or subway .
So these buses are better for both capacity and comfort .
Capacity , because the need for people to move around in the bus takes some space .
Comfort , because while standing may not be ideal , fighting your way through other standees to get to the door is much worse .
Note , too , that the whole North American crowded bus ritual , where the driver is constantly saying “ please move to the back , ” just does n’t happen , so there ’s one less opportunity for the customers to feel like cattle .
In the middle of the line , where you have people getting on and off , these two movements obviously conflict on each door .
This looks pretty inefficient from the outside of the bus …
… but it ’s still more efficient than forcing people to move forward or back through the bus as other fare collection systems do .
After all , in a Paris 3 - door bus , this situation is happening at all three doors , and if one door is moving better people will shift to it .
The result is a process that naturally optimises the flow through all three doors , and thus minimizes the dwell time .
( Observing the situations , I wondered if it would ever be possible to train people to keep right as they enter and exit the bus .
There is a small railing that divides the boarding path into two streams , and if these were used for opposite directions of traffic ( at intermediate stops where both directions exist ) this situation would move a little better . )
So why , exactly , is all - door boarding on buses so hard in North America and Australasia ?
The fare transaction experience can do a lot to form impressions of buses vs light rail .
Nobody really likes that moment of being judged by the driver as they board , or the boarding queues that this moment requires .
So if you can do proof - of - payment on light rail , why ca n’t you do it on high - volume buses ?
Just asking .

My friend Jen has a novel she really needs to finish .
It starts with a man talking with his therapist .
This man owns a Christian gift store , even though he is not himself a Christian .
He has found Christians to be extremely gullible and easy pickings when it comes to making money .
But he recently came upon a challenge .
He had a box of leftover WWJD bracelets he could n’t sell .
What to do with them ?
“ Then I had this great idea , ” he tells his therapist .
“ I hung up all the bracelets on their rack , and made up a new sign : What Would Jabez Do ?
They sold like hotcakes ! ”
I have told Jen she has to finish this novel .
The only problem is it will sound much more like truth than fiction .
Why is it that Christians buy so much religious crap ?
Is it really a problem that religious trinkets are such big business ?
And would you buy a What Would Jabez Do? bracelet ?
Confession time .
I worked in the Jesus junk business in one way or another for many years .
My first payroll job ( as opposed to cutting lawns in the neighborhood ) was working at a Zondervan Family Bookstore in Kettering , Ohio .
That was back when the stores sold everything a Christian or church would need .
Books .
Bibles .
Bible studies .
Bulletin blanks .
Wedding invitations .
Records albums .
( Before CDs , we old people would listen to music on round vinyl discs with a tiny hole in the middle .
You could not push these into a slot on the dashboard of your car .
To listen to music in your car , you had what were called 8 track tapes .
But that is a discussion for another day . )
The books we sold included those of strong , good theology , written by people who spent a lot of time with God and his word instead of those who simply pastored large churches and were good looking .
But we also sold some Jesus junk .
Pencils with Bible verses .
Toothbrushes with Bible verses .
Bumper stickers and combs and spinning tops and sparkly stickers — all with Bible verses .
These were often bought by Sunday school teachers as rewards or bribes or however they used them , but they were also purchased by parents as rewards or bribes to keep their kids quiet as they shopped .
By today ’s standards , the Jesus junk we sold in the 1970s was very tame .
But I still felt awkward selling some of that stuff .
I moved on to work in Christian radio , where we ran ads for Christian crap .
When I switched from on - air to sales , I quickly learned an important lesson .
If a business had the word “ Christian ” in its name , or any other pop-religious word ( like “ agape ” or “ icthus ” ) we required cash — the green stuff — before we would produce and run their ads .
If the business was run by an alcoholic reprobate with three wives and a drive - up heroin fulfillment center on the side , we were good extending them credit .
It always worked that way .
For the past ten years or so I have worked in Christian publishing .
I am going to let you in on a dirty little secret .
Most publishers do not care in the least what is between the covers of a book .
And when someone says , “ You ca n’t judge a book by its cover , ” you need to remind them that is the only way someone judges a book they have never heard of before .
That ’s why a potential author ’s “ platform ” is so important .
If you write a manuscript that is so great , so unique that I feel every true follower of Jesus needs to read it right away , but you are not a TV personality or pastor a megachurch , I wo n’t even be able to get a publisher to return my phone call about you .
On the other hand , if you pastor one of the nation ’s twenty largest or fastest - growing churches , and you have a slick and smooth delivery on TV , bingo !
You and your agent can get a strong six - figure multiple book deal .
What will your book be about ?
Who cares ?
It just does n’t matter .
You wo n’t be writing it anyway .
That will be the job of a ghostwriter hired by the publisher .
Your job is to protect your pretty face and your good reputation .
And that pretty face on the cover is what will sell the book , not the content ( or lack thereof ) inside .
And who can blame these publishers ?
Consumers do n’t rush to buy books that make the reader — gasp !— think .
They want bullet point lists that tell the secret to having a better life right now .
No pain , just gain .
That is why Joel Osteen sells by the million , while Eugene Peterson and Robert Capon and N.T.
Wright and other great thinkers and writers sell , well , much less than a million copies .
Thinking is hard work .
Let me open my mouth and you can feed me , thank you .
Pablum ?
Sure .
But spoon enough sugar on it and I can swallow anything .
Have you really walked around your local Christian bookstore lately ?
What are they selling that really offers anything with nutritional value ?
Well , you say , they do sell Bibles .
Ok , let ’s take a look at the Bible isle .
The American Patriot ’s Bible , complete with stories showing how a “ light from above ” shaped our nation .
The MacArthur Study Bible
The Everyday Life Bible ( Joyce Meyer )
Aspire : The New Women Of Color Study Bible
Holy Bible : Thou Art Loosed Edition
Manual : The Bible For Men
I think you are getting the idea .
Today you might have trouble finding a Bible that is just a Bible with no Christian celebrity endorsement or agenda attached as a companion to Scripture .
The Bible is a great work of art , but we have reduced it to a vehicle to advertise our brand or promote our specific political bent .
Look , I have no problem with businesses making a profit , if the goods or services they sell are legitimately needed by consumers .
For instance , blue jeans are a necessity , especially in Oklahoma where they can pass as formal wear in most situations .
But does anyone really need $ 200 + jeans ?
The answer is no , they do n’t .
And I am all for books and music and other forms of art that draw a person ’s heart upward to Christ .
But is there ever a need for Scripture candy ?
The answer again is a resounding No .
So , just why are Christians so gullible ?
Why are we such easy targets for those simply out to make money ?
In short , why will we buy any item that has a Bible verse or religious - sounding phrase on it ?
I can think of at least three reasons .
Safety .
We are seemingly obsessed with protecting ourselves and others ( especially others ) from sin in any art form .
You do know that the rating system we use for movies today was developed by Father Daniel Lord , a Jesuit priest , who based it firmly on Catholic theology .
This was an attempt to keep movies “ safe ” for families as well as promote religion .
The promotion of religion has gone by the wayside for the most part , but we still cling to the safety factor , setting limits on the rating level our kids can watch .
We feel better about ourselves when we keep our kids from seeing things that might make them think about sin .
The same goes for books , music and visual art , like paintings we allow in our homes .
We expect them to present to us a “ safe ” view of life , one where if sin is committed , it is punished swiftly .
Where crime does not pay .
Where we think only on nice things .
Where the sun always shines , birds always sing in tune , and life is always wrapped in a neat red ribbon .
We demand that our artists conform to this vision of safety .
They cannot explore issues of life like sexuality or doubt about faith , because that might make the consumer of the art uncomfortable or , heaven forbid , lead them to sin themselves .
And as you might imagine , safe art is no art at all .
For art to reach into one ’s soul , it must address four issues :
1 . Who are we ?
2 . What makes us unique — what is our purpose in life ?
3 . What has gone wrong ?
4 . How can we get back ?
A great song that addresses this issue is Joni Mitchell ’s Woodstock .
We are stardust , we are golden ,
We are billion year old carbon ,
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden .
Stardust , golden — that is who we are and what we were made for .
And while we may not hear how to get back , we do hear where “ back ” is : The Garden .
But it ’s the billion year old carbon line that would have this song banned by many Christians .
Why , someone hearing this might be lead to think about evolution .
And just to think about that is tantamount to sin .
Thus , out goes Joni Mitchell and her song about Woodstock .
We will never know how to get back to the Garden if we do n’t listen .
But listening — or viewing or reading — reality is a risk , a big risk .
And our safety - mindedness just will not allow that .
Religiosity .
This actually goes right along with safety .
There is great safety in religion .
Religion is form and procedure and policy .
It is rules that are followed or else .
It is easy to see if you are on the right side :
You just have to measure your thoughts and actions against the yardstick of religious do ’s and don’ts .
If you are on the right side , you pass the test and are religious .
And we know that God likes religious people — at least those who are religious the way we are religious .
Those who do what they should n’t and do n’t do what they should are not religious and God does not like them .
A large number of the items on this religious measuring stick have to do with art .
Going to see Toy Story 3 is good .
Going to see The A Team is questionable at best .
Going to see Get Him To The Greek is a sure ticket to hell .
You can measure the music you listen to ( 12 Stones — good ; Rolling Stones — evil ) , books you read ( Clay In The Hands Of The Potter — good ; Harry Potter — evil ) , and paintings you view ( clothes on — good ; clothes off — evil ) .
We want to feel good about our religious efforts .
And why not ?
What is religion for if not to make us feel good about ourselves ?
And if we are not feeling good , we might as well give it up and just do what we want in the first place .
So we place restrictions on the art we consume to meet these religious standards .
When we do n’t , it leads to the final reason for buying Christian junk .
Guilt .
Oh sure , you used to like listening to Christina Aguilera , but now you are a Christian , so you listen to BarlowGirl , not because you like their sound or their lyrics , but you would feel guilty listening to and enjoying Christina Aguilera now that you have been saved .
You used to love reading science fiction by Orson Scott Card and Ursula K. Le Guin , but now you read Left Behind .
You used to go study the works of Van Gogh , but now you look at a picture of a pasty - white Jesus knocking on someone ’s door .
Are you enjoying your new choices in art ?
No , not really .
But you would have a terrible feeling of guilt if you continued to consume that which you previously enjoyed .
After all , if you like something , it has to be wrong , right ?
So we buy Christian crap , not because we want to , but because we feel guilty buying “ non-Christian ” works of art .
We keep Christian stores in business , buying water bottles that say “ Seek the living water . ”
T - shirts with ripped - off corporate logos like “ Things go better with Christ . ”
And books and music that are such inferior examples of their media they would be laughable if their effects were n’t so horrible .
So much Christian art causes us to become people who cannot think for ourselves , cannot determine what is solid food and what is baby food , cannot distinguish between what is beautiful and what is a very poor imitation of beauty .
In my next essay , I and some of our other writers will take a look how we can get away from Selling Crap To Christians For Profit and get back to what brings
God glory :
Art that is beautiful for beauty ’s sake .
Secession Week 2010 : Economic Secession
Welcome to the fourth day of Secession Week 2010 !
The special on today ’s menu is economic secession .
Today ’s Posts
From elsewhere in the blogosphere :
Last year , Patri touched on similar topics in his post on Non-territorial Secession .
Introduction to Today ’s Topic
The term “ economic secession ” was a coined by John T. Kennedy to refer to the tactic of avoiding paying taxes or obeying regulations in an effort to reduce government control :
The implementation of economic privacy is the implementation of the means of economic secession .
And when those means are available they will be utilized . …
[ I ] f the means of economic privacy are available they must choose between keeping their own money in their own pockets or voluntarily turning it over to government .
Then you ’ll see economic secession on a grand scale .
This idea that anarchists can defeat the state by ignoring it and depriving it of resources is the central tenet of agorism , a school of market anarchist thought developed by Samuel Edward Konkin III .
Agorists see counter - economics – the use of black and gray markets – as a revolutionary act and as a path to a stateless society .
Think of it as starving the beast yourself , instead of depending on elected officials to starve it for you .
In fact , the American revolution might best be thought of as an economic secession that preceded a political one .
Colonists regularly flouted numerous mercantile restraints on trade–whether it be the Navigation Act , the Molasses Act , the Stamp Act of 1765 , or the Tea Party generating Tea Act of 1773 .
Smuggling was rampant and admired .
Some historians say otherwise , but John Hancock did more than sign the Declaration , he also made a fortune channelling his inner Han Solo .
Of course , economic secession of which agorists would approve need not be motivated by a desire to wither the state .
For most people , avoiding state taxes and regulations is simply a way of getting by .
Sudhir Venkatesh shows how important the informal economy is to the urban poor Off the Books :
Whether one is starting or sustaining a business , “ underground ” institutions provide a backbone for all aspects of local enterprise , from loans and credit to advertisement .
The cash economy abuts a world where trading and payment occur through verbal promises , in - kind payments , and barter .
Laborers and entrepreneurs , including small business owners , general workers , equipment renters , and creditors , participate in highly intimate exchange networks , where personal connections and impersonal contractual exchanges coexist .
In the ghetto , advertising and marketing , credit and capital acquisition , enforcement and regulation , and other aspects of commerce seem as easily conducted via informal channels and outside the government ’s eye as through legitimate venues where the state is the arbiter and lawmaker .
The informal economy is even more important in poor countries with inferior institutions .
We think “ economic secession ” is a term which can usefully be used more broadly than that .
It admits differences of degree .
If we consider the possibility of unbundled government , any effort to switch government service providers in the economic sphere can be thought of as partial secession .
Arnold Kling has pitched this idea as “ virtual secession “ :
The problem with physical secession is that it is very difficult to achieve critical mass .
There is probably not much overlap between the people you want to live with and the people who want to choose your particular form of government .
The vast majority of us put up with government we dislike in order to live in proximity to people with whom we want to work and play .
With virtual secession , you could still live in San Francisco or Manhattan or Silver Spring while seceding from much of the government at the city , state , and Federal level .
You and your next - door neighbor might belong to very different governmental units .
Suppose , for example , that instead of having your taxes allocated for you by legislators , you were given a list of programs and could choose how to allocate your taxes .
What percent of your taxes should go to TARP ?
What percent should go to fund the mohair subsidy ?
What percent should fund DC school vouchers ?
What percent should go to Barney Frank ’s affordable housing initiatives ?
As today ’s posts will explore , incremental economic secession could involve opting out of low - quality government currencies or moving business to jurisdictions with better rules and / or lower taxes .
We hope to show that breaking the cartel on government services providers is as morally right , and as socially beneficial , as breaking up OPEC .
WASHINGTON  Acting under federal court order , the Obama administration proposed new air - quality rules on Tuesday for coal - burning power plants that officials said would bring major reductions in soot and smog from Texas to the Eastern Seaboard .
The Environmental Protection Agency is issuing the rules to replace a plan from the administration of President George W. Bush that a federal judge threw out in 2008 , citing numerous flaws in the calculation of air - quality effects .
Gina McCarthy , head of the E.P.A. ’s air and radiation office , said the new rules would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by hundreds of thousands of tons a year and bring $ 120 billion in annual health benefits .
Those benefits , Ms. McCarthy said , include preventing 14,000 to 36,000 premature deaths , 23,000 nonfatal heart attacks , 21,000 cases of acute bronchitis , 240,000 cases of aggravated asthma and 1.9 million missed school and work days .
The rule would substantially reduce the unhealthy smog that shrouds American cities , especially during heat waves like the one now enveloping much of the East .
The 40 - year - old Griffey was n't at Safeco Field on Wednesday .
He simply released a statement through the Seattle Mariners -- the franchise he helped save in the 1990s and returned to for the conclusion of his career -- that he was done playing .
Griffey said goodbye before Seattle played the Minnesota Twins after 13 All - Star appearances , 630 homers -- fifth on the career list -- and 1,836 RBIs .
He 's an almost certain first - ballot Hall of Famer .
" While I feel I am still able to make a contribution on the field and nobody in the Mariners front office has asked me to retire , I told the Mariners when I met with them prior to the 2009 season and was invited back that I will never allow myself to become a distraction , " Griffey said .
" I feel that without enough occasional starts to be sharper coming off the bench , my continued presence as a player would be an unfair distraction to my teammates and their success as a team is what the ultimate goal should be , " he said .
There will be no farewell tour , just as Griffey wanted .
He called Mariners team president Chuck Armstrong and said he was done playing .
Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu called his players together before the start of batting practice to inform them of Griffey 's decision .
" To play with him is a treasure I will keep deep in my heart , " Seattle 's Ichiro Suzuki said through an interpreter .
" I have played 19 years in professional baseball and I can say he was one of my best teammates and my best friend . "
Milton Bradley , Griffey 's teammate for only a few months , turned to Mike Sweeney during batting practice and said , " on a day like this , it should rain in Seattle . "
After Wednesday 's 2 - 1 win over Minnesota , Bradley was emotional speaking about his former teammate .
" I hit left - handed because of Griffey .
I wanted to play baseball , be an outfielder , make diving catches , style on a home run because of Griffey , " Bradley said .
" Guys like him do n't come around every day .
He 's just as magical off the field as on it . "
The team put his number 24 in the dirt behind second base and showed a 5 - minute video tribute to a standing ovation before the game .
" It 's a sad day for the Mariners , our fans , for all the people in the community that have loved Ken , admired him as a tremendous baseball player and a great human being , " Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln said .
" It 's always tough for great superstars like Ken or anyone else to make a decision to retire .
This has been his life for so many years , but he has made his decision and will support it .
We will honor him in every way possible . "
MLB commissioner Bud Selig said : " Ken Griffey , Jr. will always be remembered for his picture perfect swing , for the grace in which he fielded his position , and for the youthful enthusiasm with which he played the game .
He was one of the game 's greatest players and is surely deserving of a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown .
" Ken was and will continue to be a credit to the game and a role model for our children .
I have always had great respect for him as both a player and as a young man .
I wish the very best for him and his family . "
A star from the time he was the overall No. 1 pick in the 1987 draft , Griffey also played with his hometown Cincinnati Reds and the Chicago White Sox .
He hit .284 with 1,836 RBIs .
But his greatest seasons , by far , came in Seattle .
Griffey played in 1,685 games with the Mariners and hit .292 with 417 homers , most coming in the homer - friendly Kingdome , and 1,216 RBIs .
He won the AL MVP in 1997 and practically saved a franchise that was in danger of relocating when he first came up .
McConnell : Bush Tax Cuts Paid for Themselves
Created : July 14 , 2010 09:01 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A few days ago , Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) termed unemployment benefits — a federal insurance system paid for by employers — a “ necessary evil ” and said that tax cuts should not need to be offset , but benefits extensions should .
Today , speaking with Talking Points Memo ’s Brian Beutler , Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) doubled down .
“ That ’s been the majority Republican view for some time , ” he said .
“ That there ’s no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue .
They increased revenue , because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy .
So I think what Senator Kyl was expressing was the view of virtually every Republican on that subject . ”
This is factually incorrect , and Democrats should be all over this today .
Tax cuts do not pay for themselves .
Every dollar of tax cuts by making the Bush cuts permanent stimulates an additional 30 cents or so of economic activity .
Unemployment insurance does not pay for itself , but it comes much closer .
Every dollar of unemployment benefits stimulates around $ 1.60 of economic activity .
Moreover , no economist on earth would say that tax cuts do not need to be offset , but spending increases do ; in terms of the budgetary bottom line , there is no difference .
Here is a chart from Karl Smith , a professor of economics and government at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , at the blog Modeled Behavior , showing the impact of the $ 1 trillion Bush tax cuts :
NEW YORK – On Monday , the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War , a group of 91 Israelis filed a $ 1.2 billion lawsuit in a US federal court against al - Jazeera , claiming the Qatar - based new network ’s war coverage aided Hezbollah , the Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported .
The plaintiffs are civilians who were wounded during the war or are relatives of victims of the Katyusha rockets that were fired on northern Israel for 34 days in the summer of 2006 .
The Kaplan vs. al - Jazeera suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages .
The attorneys representing the plaintiffs said , " al - Jazeera intentionally reported live coverage of the locations of the missile strikes inside of Israel in violation of military censorship regulations , in order to enable Hezbollah to aim the missiles more accurately .
“ Al - Jazeera camera crews in Israel during the war were repeatedly detained by the Israeli police for broadcasting real - time information regarding the location of missile strikes , which Hezbollah utilized to more accurately aim their missiles at civilian population centers , ” the attorneys claimed .
One of the plaintiffs , Haim Kaplan , said , " The first city to be hit was Safed , and I was hit twice on the first day of the war .
In the first incident a rocket landed a few meters from my house ; shrapnel entered the house , and it was a miracle no one was hurt .
Later that day a rocket landed near my car .
The car was damaged , and I was evacuated to the hospital with mild injuries .
I will continue to sue any organization that aids terror organizations .
I will share the damages with the community in Safed . "
Attorney Nitsana Darshan - Leitner , the founder of Shurat HaDin , Israel Law Center ( ILC ) , said , " Without the assistance of al - Jazeera ’s on - the - ground spotters , Hezbollah would have been unable to accurately aim its missiles into Israeli cities .
Al - Jazeera , which has offices in New York , aided and abetted Hezbollah terrorism and is responsible for the injuries suffered by the victims of these attacks . ”
According to her , al - Jazeera will claim it was " just doing its job " .
" It wo n't help them .
They consciously violated the censorship laws for a specific purpose .
That 's what matters , " Darshan - Leitner said .
The public 's collective memory does n't operate in political cycles .
They remember when burnt - out cars were ubiquitous , when communities were terrorised during , before and after bonfire night by the misuse of fireworks .
Londoners remember the rough sleepers on our stations and shop doorways , and everyone remembers that crimes were too many and police officers too few .
Antisocial behaviour was described as low - level nuisance .
The police and local authorities had few powers and no combined structures to deal with it .
The police did n't even have the power to take truants back to school .
This was the country we inherited in 1997 .
We did n't solve every problem and , as I stated last year , there was a period when we put antisocial behaviour on cruise control because of other priorities following the 7 July London attacks , but we did an enormous amount to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour , and any but the most ungracious and mean - spirited government would recognise that .
Cue the home secretary 's speech this week on asbos .
She set out the scourge of antisocial behaviour exactly as I would .
She even nicked my mantra – ASB needs to be tackled not tolerated .
But she went on to give the most bizarre and distorted picture of what 's happened over the last 13 years .
Let 's get the myths out of the way first .
We introduced a range of civil powers for the police , local authorities and other agencies to use in a co-ordinated way to tackle the kind of behaviour that , while falling short of criminality , destroys people 's lives .
They were not driven from Whitehall , as May suggests , but were pursued through the crime and disorder reduction partnerships established locally , involving community groups and social enterprises as well as the police and local authorities .
Very often , where the ASB is caused by someone under 18 , a letter or visit to the parents by the police solves the problem .
Where more co-ordinated action is necessary , parenting orders and acceptable behaviour contracts ( ABCs ) have proved their worth .
Family intervention projects ensure that all aspects of a dysfunctional family 's behaviour are addressed in two years of intense support and intervention .
An asbo is the most serious civil power .
Lasting for a minimum of two years , it sets out a list of conditions , the breach of which is a criminal offence , with a maximum of five years ' imprisonment .
Yes , they are breached .
Unsurprising given the previous behaviour of those who are on them , but the success rate is good and the problem of breaching needs to be addressed through driving up the low level of prosecutions when this happens , not by abandoning asbos .
Theresa
May said that for 13 years people had been told " that the asbo was the silver bullet that would cure society 's ills " .
Who said that ?
When ?
What the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission actually said is that our approach to ASB worked , with 65 % of the NAO 's review sample desisting after the first intervention and 93 % after the third .
More needs to be done , particularly in speeding up the process and empowering citizens to take out legal injunctions .
But the most surprising thing about May 's speech , in among all the platitudes , was the failure to acknowledge any success at all .
Indeed , she resorts to disingenuousness when she says that ASB has become more frequent .
On 15 July her department published the statistics .
It said : " The current proportion of people who had a high level of perceived ASB is the lowest since the measure was introduced in the survey in 2001 / 2 …
In previous years reduction [ with problems with abandoned or burnt - out cars ] was largely responsible for driving falls in the composite measure .
However , the reduction in the overall measure of ASB between 2008/09 and 2009 / 10 reflects falls in the proportion of people perceiving a problem with almost all strands of ASB . "
Getting rid of asbos would be entirely consistent with the usual Tory approach to crime and disorder .
It 's called laissez - faire and it will soon be reflected in the other thing that comes with Tory governments – it 's called rising crime .

To try Sophie 's recipe for a " pasotto " with crab and arugula , click here .
When I was a line cook in New York City , my mornings started with risotto .
While most people were sleepily pouring milk into cereal , I 'd start chopping onions , leeks , and garlic ; toasting the rice ; uncorking a bottle of dry white wine ; then hovering neurotically over the pot , adding liquid , and stirring , over and over , waiting until just the right moment to pull the pot off .
No one should be uncorking white wine before 7:00 a.m. , but I often found myself contemplating a little swig here or there .
I do n't even like risotto .
What was I doing making it before the sun rose ?
However , when I learned the art of pasta cooking that mimics that of risotto , I became a convert .
It 's brilliant .
No enormous pot of water that takes forever to boil ; a much smaller volume of stock can intensely flavor each piece of pasta .
No second pot for sauce ; the sauce forms in the pan along with the pasta .
Hello , pasotto !
A few cooks I know of swear by this method , most famously Alain Ducasse , who even created a special pot for it ( one thing you can put on your kitchen wish list right next to " Twinkie pan " ) and , I 've been told , rarely cooks his pasta any other way .
A little Googling yielded some unverified claims that the practice originated years ago in northern Italy , where water was scarce .
I asked my friend , a native of the region who denied having any historical knowledge , adding , " I can assure you that out of 60 million Italians , perhaps two in any given month might attempt to cook pasta that way . "
No matter — the results were delicious .
A Video Chat with Adam Carolla
Some would say that the idea of combining Adam Carolla with Klondike Bars would be like …well , hell , even I ’m not sure what it would be like , but on the surface , the end result certainly would n’t seem to be on the level of , say , combining peanut butter and chocolate .
Having seen some of Carolla ’s new ad campaign for Klondike , however , I have to admit that I laughed quite a bit at his so - called “ Klondike Everyman Challenges , ” which include “ Pack the Car ” ( going on now ) , “ Grab the Remote ” ( starting June 30th ) , and “ Ball Toss ” ( arriving July 31st ) .
That ’s one reason why , when Bullz - Eye was pitched the opportunity by Klondike to do a video interview with Carolla , I jumped at the chance .
Sure , yeah , we had to ask at least a little bit about the Everyman Challenges , but , hey , funny ’s funny , so it ’s not like I felt all that dirty doing it …
By the way , I should mentioned that we were pitched a 5 - minute interview , but I had a lot of things that I wanted to ask him about …his podcast , NBC passing on the pilot , the missed opportunity to host the American version of “ Top Gear , ” the attempts to make his buddy Ozzie Castillo – who co-starred with Carolla in “ The Hammer ” as well as in the aforementioned pilot – into the next Luis Guzman …so I kept asking , he kept answer , and the next thing I knew , we ’d been talking for 10 minutes .
Lucky you : they kept the camera rolling the entire time .
Lastly , when you get to the end of the interview , you ’ll hear me ask Carolla about having provided the voice of the title character in an animated short entitled “ Save Virgil . ”
I had n’t been familiar with it until I checked IMDb for a few random things to mention during our Q&A , but now that I ’ve seen it …well , to borrow a phrase from “ Futurama , ” I ca n’t unsee it .

Now that Spain has won the World Cup , it 's interesting to go back and look at some metrics from the matches and see if we can tease out what characteristics made for a winning Cup team this time around .
Fortunately , the Guardian 's Data Blog has made a wealth of World Cup statistics available , with data on every player of every team ( position , shots at goal , passes , tackles made , and saves ) , plus aggregate statistics for each team ( goals , % shots on target , fouls , and much more ) .
The data are ripe for analysis in R , especially given that you can download the data directly from the cloud as an R object with the following commands :
players <- read.csv ( " http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tOM2qREmPUbv76waumrEEYg&single=true&gid=1&range=A1%3AH596&output=csv " )
teams <- read.csv ( " http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tOM2qREmPUbv76waumrEEYg&single=true&gid=0&range=A1%3AAG15&output=csv " )
The method I 've described before for accessing a Google Spreadsheet from R did n't quite apply here , as those instructions assume you own the document ( and have access to the Publish menu ) .
But some experimentation and tweaking of the spreadsheet URL made it work : the key parameters seem to be the " &gid= " ( sheet number ) and " %range= " ( cell ranges , use % 3A to encode the colon ) and " &output=csv " to download in CSV format .
It would be nice if Google published the specs to form URLs like these , but as far as I know they do n't .
Anyway , a couple of bloggers have used these data to great effect to express the results of the World Cup visually using R graphics .
For example , the R Charts blog used ggplot2 to look at the number of fouls committed by each team during the tournament :
( Personally , I would have sorted the rows by descending number of fouls , rather than alphabetically . )
Interesting to see that Cup champions Spain are in the middle of the pack on fouls , whereas runners - up Netherlands lead this table ( boosted heavily by their performance in the final ) .
Blogger Jason Priem also took a look at the data , this time with a scatterplot of goals per game by fouls per game , related to how far each team advanced in the competition :
( Download Jason 's code for this chart here . )
Again it 's interesting to see the positions of the two finalists here , with Netherlands on the extreme frontier for both fouls and goals , while spain is moderate on goals per game and near the lowest on fouls per games .
It 's a rich dataset and I 'm sure other Revolutions readers could come up with some equally interesting visualizations .
If you do , tell us about it in the comments .

I ’ve been learning new languages lately , and I ’ve been using the 99 scala problems to help me learn important features of the languages .
I ’m going to blog about my experiences with clojure .
Once I got through the hoops of starting with clojure ( just download the eclipse plugin and go ! ) , it was smooth sailing for the first four problems .
( ns s99 ) ;; P01 (*)
Find the last element of a list .
; Basically , this replicates the ( last n ) functionality already in clojure ( defn s99 _last [ input ] ( loop [ i input ] ( let [ a ( first i ) b ( first ( rest i ) ) ] ( if ( = b nil ) a ( recur ( rest i ) ) ) ) ) ) ; P02 (*)
Find the last but one element of a list .
( defn penultimate [ input ] ( loop [ i input ] ( let [ a ( first i ) b ( first ( rest i ) ) c ( first ( rest ( rest i ) ) ) ] ( if ( nil ? c ) a ( recur ( rest i ) ) ) ) ) ) ; P03 (*) Find the Kth element of a list .
;
By convention , the first element in the list is element 0 . ; in clojure , nth already exists ( nth n l ) ( defn s99_nth [ n input ] ( loop ( if ( = c n ) ( first i ) ( recur ( inc c ) ( rest i ) ) ) ) ) ; P04 (*)
Find the number of elements of a list .
;
This is the same functionality as clojure 's ( count l ) function ( defn length [ input ] ( loop ( if ( nil ? ( first i ) ) c ( recur ( inc c ) ( rest i ) ) ) ) )
So far , the lack of pattern matching makes things a little more difficult than scala or f# , but once I got a hang of the sea of parenthesis , it was easy to remember my college work with xquery .
The new channel , which media experts say appears to be modeled on Al Jazeera , the Arabic news network , aims to provide comprehensive coverage of world affairs , while explaining matters of direct concern to the Chinese leadership in a perspective its producers consider appropriate .
Analysts say China ’s global media expansion is striking because many Western media giants , faced with an advertising slump , have scaled back operations by closing bureaus and laying off employees .
“ While our media empires are melting away like the Himalayan glaciers , China ’s are expanding , ” said Orville Schell , director of the Center on U.S. - China Relations at the Asia Society in New York and a former dean of the journalism school at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ They want to get every hallmark of the world of credible journalism they can , and being in New York City , in an iconic location , is part of that . ”
On Thursday , an official with Xinhua , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press , said Xinhua was planning to build a newsroom at the top of a 44 - story skyscraper in Times Square , giving it an address in the same neighborhood as Reuters , Conde Nast , News Corp and The New York Times .
Xinhua ’s move is just one of several planned by Beijing .
China Central Television , the country ’s biggest state - run television broadcaster , has also been expanding overseas and offering broadcasts in English , Spanish , French , Arabic and other languages .
And China has heavily financed a makeover of China Daily , its English - language daily newspaper , and introduced a new English edition of Global Times , which is controlled by People ’s Daily , the leading Communist Party - run newspaper .
The Internet was once viewed as a " borderless " world that had little regard for the physical location of users .
That sentiment likely seems outdated today to many Canadian Internet users who have grown accustomed to clicking on links for audio or video services only to be advised that the content , site or service is not available in their area .

" Geo-blocking " has become standard practice among broadcasters , sports leagues , and music services that use technologies to identify the likely location of an Internet user in real - time and block the content in some circumstances .
From World Cup broadcasts to Hulu.com ( a popular U.S. video site ) to Spotify ( a European music service ) , Canadians often find themselves unable to access content and unsure who is to blame .
While some have misleadingly suggested that outdated laws are the reason behind the blocking , the reality is that geo - blocking is invariably a business issue , not a legal one .
Indeed , geo - blocking occurs worldwide -- U.S. residents are similarly unable to use Spotify and are blocked from accessing the CBC 's streaming coverage of the World Cup .
Rather than a reaction to older laws , the geo - blocking approach is actually an attempt to preserve an older business model , namely content licencing on a country - by - country or market - by - market approach .
Canadian broadcasters have for years purchased the exclusive rights to air popular U.S. programming in Canada .
This approach led to the simultaneous substitution policies that allow Canadian broadcasters to compel cable and satellite companies to replace the U.S. broadcast of a particular show with the Canadian feed ( complete with Canadian commercials ) .
Licence to block
As video streaming on the Internet emerged as an increasingly popular method of distribution , Canadian broadcasters began bargaining for both the over - the - air and Internet rights to U.S. programs .
With those rights in hand , broadcasters streamed their own version of the programs exclusively to their Canadian audiences .
This explains why Comedy Central streams programs such as The Daily Show in the U.S. , but Canadian users trying to access those streams online are redirected to CTV's Comedy Network site .
The same geography - based licences arise with live sports programming and music services .
World Cup matches are available on the Internet in countries around the world , yet the national broadcast rights holder ( CBC in Canada , ABC / ESPN in the U.S. ) limits their streams to a domestic audience .
Music services and book publishers face many of the same licencing hurdles .
Apple iTunes arrived in Canada nearly two years after the U.S. edition not because of copyright laws , but rather because a new round of negotiations was needed with copyright owners to obtain the necessary approvals .
These delays continue until today , with Pandora -- a hugely popular music service -- blocked to Canadian users and Spotify 's North American launch the victim of successive delays ( Spotify owners have indicated they would like to launch the service simultaneously in the U.S. and Canada ) .
Canadian Apple iPad owners have found the same licencing limitations apply to the electronic book market .
Owners of the popular device can choose from among thousands of public domain books , but the electronic book store supported by the major book publishers in the U.S. has been slow to migrate its way north to Canada .
While frustrated Canadians may be inclined to call on the government to " fix " the problem , the reality is that this is a business issue .
Geo -blocking will only disappear if the business models they support give way to global approaches that make the borderless Internet a reality .

A few years ago , in a class one of us taught , a discussion arose about how capitalism works as a system in which the need for the few to maximize profit drives the entire political - economic structure .
The students appeared to grasp how the capital accumulation process has a strong effect , often negative , on the course of a society ’s development .
The discussion then turned to Salvador Allende ’s Chile of the early 1970s , where the goal was to develop a socialist political economy .
“ Knowing what you do about how capitalism functions , ” the students were asked , “ what would a socialist system look like ? ”
They were unusually quiet .
Finally , one of them blurted out : “ I do n’t know how it could work .
I guess the government would have to kill everybody . ”
The question of how a socialist society would operate raised a horrible , dystopian image in this student ’s mind .
Such libertarian fears of a totalitarian state imposing socialism by force , even to the point of annihilation , on an unwilling people , who are presumed to be capitalist by nature , are all too common .
This brings to mind Fredric Jameson ’s comment : “ Someone once said that it is easier [ for most people in today ’s society ] to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism . ”
Perhaps nothing points so clearly to the alienated nature of politics in the present day United States as the fact that capitalism , the economic system that drives the society , is effectively off - limits to critical review or discussion .
To the extent that capitalism is mentioned by politicians or pundits , it is regarded in hushed tones of reverence for the genius of the market , its unquestioned efficiency , and its providential authority .
One might quibble with a corrupt and greedy CEO or a regrettable loss of jobs , but the superiority and necessity of capitalism — or , more likely , its euphemism , the so - called “ free market system ” — is simply beyond debate or even consideration .
There are , of course , those who believe that the system needs more regulation and that there is room for all sorts of fine - tuning .
Nevertheless , there is no questioning of the basics .
This prohibition on critically assessing capitalism begins in the economics departments and business schools of our universities where , with but a few exceptions , it is easier to find an advocate of the immediate colonization of Mars than it is to find a scholar engaged in genuine radical criticism of capitalism .
This critical dearth extends to our news media , which have a documented track record of promoting the profit system , and a keen distaste for those that advocate radical change .
It reaches all of us in one form or another .
Anyone who wishes to participate in civic life quickly grasps that being tagged as anti-free market ( or socialist ) is a near - certain way to guarantee one ’s status as a political outcast .
To criticize the system is to criticize the nation and “ democracy . ”
This is a dream world for those atop the system .
Such ideological dominance is worth more than a standing army of a million troops to those wishing to maintain their positions of power and privilege .
But the illegitimacy of addressing the nature and logic of capitalism handcuffs almost everyone else .
As long as serious treatment of capitalism , the dominant social system , remains off - limits , social science itself is deeply compromised .
The failure of a society so marked in myriad ways by capitalism to confront this central reality can only be seen as a great evasion .
It is the refusal to engage in meaningful self - criticism , to seek self - knowledge .
Americans are like the proverbial fish unaware of the water that surrounds and permeates their existence .
Of course , much of this lack of awareness of the central political - economic realities of today ’s society is a product of market mystification , which cloaks capitalist property relations , and which constitutes the system ’s primary advantage over all previous systems of social repression .
In John Steinbeck ’s The Grapes of Wrath , an enraged Okie tenant farmer , a victim of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression , wants to know , as he is being removed from his farm by the bank , whom he can shoot .
The tractor driver who comes to demolish his house says it would do no good for the farmer to shoot him , since he ’s just an ordinary working stiff doing his job and would be quickly replaced by another .
When the farmer counters that he will then shoot the person who gave the order , the tractor driver replies that this too would be useless , since that individual is simply a bank employee .
“ Well , there ’s a president of the bank , ” continues the farmer .
“ There ’s a board of directors .
I ’ll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank . ”
The driver said , “ Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the East .
The orders were , ‘ Make the land show profit or we ’ll close up . ’ ”
“ But where does it stop ?
Who can we shoot ?
I do n’t aim to starve to death before I kill the man that ’s starving me . ”
“ I do n’t know .
Maybe there ’s nobody to shoot .
Maybe the thing is n’t men at all .
Maybe , like you said , the property ’s doing it .
Anyway I told you my orders . ”
“ I got to figure , ” the tenant said .
“ We all got to figure .
There ’s some way to stop this .
It ’s not like lightning or earthquakes .
We ’ve got a bad thing made by men , and by God that ’s something we can change . ”
The tenant sat in his doorway , and the driver thundered his engine and started off … .
The iron guard rail bit into the house - corner , crumbled the wall , and wrenched the little house from its foundation so that it fell sideways crushed like a bug… .
The tractor cut a straight line on , and the air and the ground vibrated with its thunder .
The tenant man stared after it , his rifle in his hand .
His wife was beside him , and the quiet children behind .
And all of them stared after the tractor .
The problem faced by Steinbeck ’s hapless tenant farmer is that there seems to be no individual or group of individuals who are ultimately responsible and accountable for the economic decisions that are harming people all over the country .
It is a system “ made by men , ” and some are obviously gaining at the expense of others .
The relation between the haves and the have - nots is clear , but the opacity of the market and the impersonality of it all nonetheless seem to constrain the possibility of active rebellion .
This opacity of the capitalist system and of the relations of class and power that constitute it create the illusion of freedom , based on a seeming lack of direct coercion .
Who really is the boss ?
Who is making the decisions ?
CEOs ?
Stockholders ?
Financial markets ?
We come to believe that , as individuals , we are unconstrained in our day - to - day activities , since we remain at liberty , except when the state intrudes on our lives .
Everything around us seems to function via Adam Smith ’s invisible hand .
What we lose sight of is the reality of an alienated , commodified existence with its innumerable chains forged by class and property relations .
Behind the Veil of Money
The question we should ask is :
What is society actually like when the veil of money is removed , and the real face of power is seen ?
Is society , stripped of its ideological cover and reduced to nakedness , one of equality — where four hundred individuals in the United States ( the Forbes 400 ) own almost as much wealth as the bottom half of the population ( 150 million people ) ?
Is this a rational society , when a trillion dollars each year is spent on the U.S. military ?
Can it be justified when the system , according to modern science , is pointing to mass extinction of the species , quite possibly humanity itself ?
Capitalism ’s main economic claim to being an indispensable system is that it promotes economic growth , the benefits of which ostensibly trickle down to the vast majority .
Today , however , in the mature capitalist economies , economic growth has slowed to a crawl ( though sufficient to threaten the environment ) .
The gains of labor productivity flow upwards by myriad pumps , after which they are seldom allowed to trickle down .
The result is a deeply unequal society and generalized economic stagnation , associated with a dearth of effective demand — countered only in part by financial bubbles , which eventually burst with disastrous effects .
In the past five decades , the U.S. economy has grown , but at slower and slower rates .
The stagnation of the last ten years resembles nothing so much as the stagnation of the 1930s ( i.e. , the Great Depression years ) .
( See Chart One ) .
The same is true to varying extents for all the other rich , mature , capitalist economies .
This long - term slowdown is associated with growing structural inequality .
The economic surplus generated by society is amassed more and more at the top .
Worker productivity is much greater than it was back in 1975 , but very little of this increased wealth actually goes to workers themselves .
As Chart Two demonstrates , the wages of U.S. manufacturing workers have fallen rapidly during the last three and a half decades as a share of value added in U.S. manufacturing .
The median wage of all nonagricultural workers has stagnated over the same period .
In this Les Misérables economy , it is hardly surprising that the general quality of life for most people has not improved — despite the continuing growth of overall social wealth and the increase in human productive capacities .
The Happy Planet Index , developed by the New Economics Foundation , examines how “ happy ” a country is — as measured by a combination of life expectancy and life satisfaction in relation to its ecological footprint .
In the 2009 Happy Planet Index , the United States — the very model of mature capitalism — ranked a dismal 114 out of 143 included countries .
The “ greed is good , ” “ shop ‘ til you drop , ” “ whoever dies with the most toys wins ” ethos that marks free market capitalism is not conducive to genuine human happiness .
What it generates in ever - increasing levels — even among its more successful strata — is stress , heart disease , loneliness , depression , and the waste of human potential .
“ This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism , ” Albert Einstein wrote in “ Why Socialism ? ” in volume 1 , number 1 of Monthly Review ( May 1949 ) .
A lot of this damage to individuals has to do with our lack of concern for collective needs .
The physical infrastructure of the United States — the built environment of our cities , roads , railroads , bridges , public water and electrical systems , parks , etc. — is crumbling .
The per capita ecological footprint of the United States far exceeds what can be sustained at a global level , contributing to rapid degradation of the earth system .
Public education throughout the country is in marked decline .
Much of what we produce is nonessential , indeed waste , including wasted labor .
The United States has fully lived up to John Kenneth Galbraith ’s observation half a century ago that modern U.S. capitalism generates “ private wealth ” and “ public squalor . ”
Massive amounts of labor and resources go toward lethal military purposes , while an increasing amount of human labor and productive capacity lies idle .
By virtually all accounts , economic stagnation will be the order of the day for at least a decade , maybe decades , to come .
In March 2010 , USA Today asked legendary financier Warren Buffett , the second richest individual in the United States : “ What if …the U.S. economy goes into a prolonged period of stagnation and weakness , creating a Japanese - like lost decade or two ? ”
Buffett answered : “ As long as it is n’t a century , I ’m OK . ”
Young Americans are entering an economy in which they have little or no creative or meaningful role to play .
It is far truer today than when Paul Goodman wrote his 1960 classic , Growing Up Absurd , that there are “ fewer jobs that are necessary and unquestionably useful ; that require energy and draw on some of one ’s best capacities ; and that can be done keeping one ’s honor and dignity . ”
Today even the most wasteful , alienating , and degrading jobs are difficult to get , with growing unemployment , and even faster growing underemployment .
We face the situation in the next generation of the continued development of tremendous labor - saving technologies , many that are revolutionary in impact .
Yet , instead of leading to a higher quality of life for all or most people , these new productive technologies will be deployed primarily to maximize the profits of those atop the system .
They will appear , in some respects , to be the enemy of the workers and communities they help to displace .
Likewise , in the coming generation , large swaths of our countryside will likely be torn up and developed for tacky residential projects and gated communities , while a good part of our cities and inner-ring suburbs rot .
All of this , we are told , is basically unavoidable , the price we pay for having the privilege of living in a free society .
No , it is n’t .
It is the price we pay for living in a capitalist society .
It is a system in which the “ need ” of the wealthy to make profit drives everything else , and it is increasingly leading to irrational and disastrous results .
The Plutocratic System
Boiled down , U.S. politics under today ’s mature capitalism are not about the welfare of the demos ( i.e. , the people ) as envisioned in classical notions of democracy , but rather about which party can best deliver profitability to investors and corporations .
There are continuing debates between those who simply want to slash labor costs , taxes , and regulations for the rich , and those who want to do some of that but also use some regulation and government spending to encourage higher wages and demand - driven growth .
Both sides , however , accept that making the economy profitable for the owning class is the sine qua non of successful administration .
Within these constraints , there are occasional important political fights and periodic bones to throw to the electorate .
But , in times of economic stagnation , the bones get smaller and even disappear .
What passes for genuine political debate often tends to be irrelevant gibberish and blatant manipulation on side issues , or inconsequential nitpicking on minutiae .
The big stuff is off the table .
The system is democratic in theory , plutocratic ( rule by the rich ) in content .
The hollowness of democracy in today ’s capitalism is evident in the blatant corruption of governance at all levels in the United States , and the non-accountability of all the major players .
The corruption we are discussing is not about politicians getting inordinately great seats at the World Series , but the degeneration of the system and the dominance of a culture of greed that is now pervasive and institutionalized , contaminating all aspects of life .
The manner in which , during the current Great Recession , the dominant institutions and investors were able to coalesce and demand hundreds of billions , even trillions , of dollars in public money as a blank check to the largest banks — and then shamelessly disperse multimillion - dollar bonuses to individuals at the apex of those very same corporations now on the public dole — was a striking reminder of the limits of self - government in our political economy .
When the Masters of the Universe , as those atop the economic system have been called , need money , when they need bail - outs , when they need the full power of the state , there is no time for debate or inquiry or deliberation .
There is no time for the setting of conditions .
There is only time to give them exactly what they want .
Or else !
Egged on by the news media , all responsible people fall in line or face ostracism .
As for education and the social services that mark the good society , well , they have to wait in line and hope something is left after the capitalist master is fed .
In stagnant times , it is a long wait .
Marx ’s work provides searing insights on how to understand a society that , at the surface , appears to be one thing but , at its deeper productive foundations , is something else .
Marx argued that a core contradiction built into capitalism was between its ever - increasing socialization and enhancement of productivity , and its ongoing system of private appropriation of profit .
In other words , one of the great virtues of capitalism , in comparison to the relatively stagnant societies that preceded it , is that it is constantly revolutionizing society ’s productive capacity and the social interconnections between people within production .
But , at a certain point , private control over the economy comes into stark conflict with the vast productive capacities of social labor that have developed .
These means of private control , the dominant class / property relations , become “ so many fetters ” on the further development of society , of human potential , of even the sustainability of human society .
The fetters must therefore be “ burst asunder , ” to allow for new stages of human development .
The Renewal of Socialism
It seems clear that this need for a “ bursting asunder ” is where the United States is now .
Capitalism , viewed as a system of generalized commodity production motivated by the competitive pursuit of private gain without limits , and thus driven to the amassing of concentrated wealth , even at the expense of public welfare and environmental sustainability , is well past its productive era—during which it could make claims to some degree of rationality .
We have reached “ The End of Rational Capitalism . ”
It survives now on bubbles , bloated debt , military spending that borders on suicidal , and a deadening hypercommercialism .
When we state that capitalism is off - limits to critical review and analysis , what we really mean is that socialism , as the only rational successor to capitalism , is off - limits .
If there is no credible alternative to capitalism , then there is no more reason to discuss transcending capitalism than there would be to debate the means of preventing lightning storms and earthquakes , as Steinbeck ’s farmer observed .
But in fact we are talking about relations and things made by human beings , and these can be changed , and have been changed enormously over the course of human history .
Since the dawn of class societies maybe five or six millennia ago , those in power have decried and demonized the ideas that threatened the status quo .
Capitalism , as a specific form of class society , is no different .
All prospective post - capitalist societies are denounced as so barbaric as to be beyond legitimate consideration .
No one today would say that socialism is inevitable .
The odds indeed may be heavily stacked against it .
But we can say that it is necessary if our species is to have much of a future .
The old socialist slogan “ Socialism or Barbarism ” made famous by Rosa Luxemburg , although meaningful in its time , may need now to be replaced with “ Socialism or Exterminism . ”
Barbarism , it appears , is no longer the greatest danger .
Science tells us that , with a continuation of “ business as usual , ” extermination of humans as well as innumerable other species is the most probable result — and in an extremely short historical period .
The absurd thing is that we ca n’t seem to alter business as usual , even under these dire conditions .
Why ?
Because business as usual is capitalism , which has made the world prey to its own self - expansion .
As Steinbeck wrote in The Grapes of Wrath : “ The bank — the monster has to have profits all the time .
It ca n’t wait .
It ’ll die … .
When the monster stops growing , it dies .
It ca n’t stay one size . ”
All of this suggests that socialism , which offers the possibility of a more egalitarian , democratic , sustainable , and collective response to our problems , is a necessity on both social and environmental grounds if we expect to have a chance at a rational future — or indeed any long - term future at all .
What is socialism ?
We cannot offer anything like a complete account here ( the story of socialism is a long one and is still in the making ) , but it begins with the idea that society ’s resources should be directed to serving the needs of people , not the profit dictates of the few .
It is the socialization ( democratization ) of the economic sphere , and also the enlargement ( de- privatization ) of the political sphere .
From that starting point , we are open - minded .
There is a broad range of options , much to be debated , and enormous room for experimentation .
There is a role for markets alongside democratic planning ( for example , consumer markets ) , but not for a market society — that is , the Hayekian utopia of the self - regulating market , which becomes merely a disguise for the concentration of economic power and wealth .
The classical notion was that socialist movements would succeed , not in opposition to democracy , but as its champions .
Among the contributions of the Soviet Union to our understanding of history is the confirmation of the fact that if socialism is not grounded in popular power , it in effect annihilates itself and capitalism is restored .
Mere state ownership of key productive forces is not enough to create a socialist society ; the people must exercise a sovereign rule over these productive forces and society as a whole , and the society must be organized to promote collective needs .
Just as democracy is not an accomplished reality unless the vast majority of the people rule society , so socialism is not an accomplished reality unless the associated producers control the productive forms of society and use them rationally and sustainably in the collective interest .
The two , in fact , require each other for their fulfillment .
With the failures and successes of some of the early socialist experiments in our rear - view mirrors , and the new socialism of the twenty - first century , pioneered above all in Latin America , in front of us , we believe that the classical notion of socialism has resumed its central role .
This is a period of socialist renewal and revolutionary democracy .
To us , it is encouraging to see the left victories across Latin America in the past decade .
Their significance is made evident by the vitriol they have engendered in the mainstream and business press in the United States and Europe .
A key question thus arises : Has the moment for the renewal of U.S. socialism arrived ?
Some of our friends would respond : “ No . Socialism is permanently beyond our reach .
The best we can hope for is the reform of capitalism along progressive lines . ”
They argue that capitalism can be made into a kinder and more rational system , increasingly in accord with the needs of humanity and the earth .
Popular pressure , they say , can bring about enlightened government policies that will capture the benefits of capitalist economics and minimize the negative consequences .
They make the case because they believe capitalism is so entrenched that it is impossible to do anything but seek reform — and they fear any hint of opposition to capitalism will marginalize them politically — or because they genuinely believe that capitalism can be tamed and made into a relatively benign and progressive society .
The dream world from this perspective tends to be Scandinavian social democracy , in particular the Sweden of the Olof Palme era in the early and middle 1970s .
Sweden , during the decades of relative prosperity following the Second World War , was , in many ways , an enviable society .
It enjoyed a degree of economic equality that has rarely been approached in a capitalist society , associated with high wages , superior social programs , and progressive taxation .
It provided high - quality universal health care and free education up through university .
The condition of women — described by Marx , after Fourier , as the measure of all human progress — was much better in Sweden , in that period , than in most capitalist societies .
To be sure , the Swedish model , when it was “ viable , ” was heavily dependent on Sweden ’s stature within the imperial global order .
Sweden was clearly a beneficiary of the imperialism of the North and West , and not innocently so , given its substantial military budget and arms sales in these years .
It is well to remember that social democracy has never been even a remote possibility for today ’s peripheral capitalist countries .
It was exclusively open to the club at the center of the world system , i.e. , those countries that have continually benefitted from a system of international plunder .
Sweden under Palme was not a socialist society , in our terms , but rather a corporatist , social democratic one , in which the impossible of impossibles seemed to occur for a short time under fortuitous circumstances : the irreconcilables of capital and labor were apparently reconciled .
Self - described Marxist friends have told us that , if they could push a button and move the United States to where Sweden was in the early 1970s , they would gladly forgo any hopes of transcending capitalism and creating a genuinely socialist economy .
This attitude points to something of practical importance : on many matters of contemporary political organizing in the United States , the efforts of the explicitly socialist left converge with those of Keynesian left - liberals and social democrats .
Together , both sides work for increased social spending , environmental sanity , equitable taxation , increased regulation , reductions in militarism , open governance , full employment , civil liberties , and workers ’ rights .
It is all about reducing the power of capital and increasing the power of everyone else .
This is the common ground that defines the broader left in the United States , and that makes the Swedish model of the Palme era seem so attractive to many .
But the main lesson to be learned from the Sweden of left - liberal and social democratic dreams is not that capitalism can be reformed and therefore need not be fundamentally challenged .
Instead , the main lesson is that those progressives who aspire to radical social reforms can only hope to have sufficient leverage to win these reforms if the threat of socialism is looming on the horizon .
In Sweden ’s case : the Soviet Union across the Baltic .
The left can expect to achieve most in every respect when the threat it represents is one to be taken seriously .
The current and pathetically weak state of the progressive forces in the United States points to the dangers of political demobilization .
On issue after issue , progressives tend to garner a significant percentage of the American people ’s support , yet they do not have anything remotely close to commensurate political influence .
The recent debacle over health care , in which the Obama administration and its Congressional allies successfully played the left - wing and voting base of the Democratic Party for patsies and delivered on a gold platter a bill to the liking of the corporate sector , is the most recent evidence .
Of course part of the liberal - left ’s weakness in U.S. politics is due to the news media , unfavorable election laws , and a number of other factors with which progressives are all too familiar .
But a more significant reason for that weakness is that nobody in power fears the liberal - left — and no one should .
The liberal - left tends to trip over itself as it establishes its pro-market bona fides for decision makers .
“ Take us seriously , pretty please ; we are not really radicals and certainly not socialists , we want to make your free market system work better , and do n’t we have some jolly - good ideas , ” they seem to say .
The only way to exact major reforms from those in power is to show them that we really mean it ; to convey the message that if the real demands of the people , expressed in mass movements , are not met by the system ( or are met only in very limited ways ) , then we as a body will make serious attempts to accomplish these ends by transcending the current system of power .
Think of the great progressive reforms in modern U.S. history .
The Wagner Act. Social Security .
The Voting Rights Act .
These came when those in power were petrified .
They arose because of mass revolts from below , and because radicals recognized that it was the peculiar responsibility of the left to help mobilize the working class to fight for their own interests and their own needs — to take to the streets and fight power head on .
Consider why rulers in other nations , like France or Greece , tend to have greater difficulty implementing cutbacks in social programs during crises :
Because , when they look out the window , they see a mass of people who would threaten the perpetuation of their system , if the vested interests were to engineer a class war from above in an attempt to turn back the clock .
This makes the position of the capitalist class in such countries much more tenuous .
The ability of the Swedish Social Democrats to win their tremendous reforms arose through the struggles of a working - class movement that was always populated with “ extremist ” elements open to expropriating private capital altogether .
From the birth of democracy in antiquity , it has been true that those with property will only concede fundamental rights to those without property when they fear for the very survival of their own privileges .
“ If there is no struggle , ” as Frederick Douglass said in 1857 , “ there is no progress … .
Power concedes nothing without a demand .
It never did and it never will … .
If we ever get free from the oppressions and wrongs heaped upon us , we must pay for their removal .
We must do this by labor , by suffering , by sacrifice , and if needs be , by our lives and the lives of others . ”
People arrive at more radical , revolutionary positions through concrete struggle .
The unwillingness , so common among U.S. progressives , to embrace a critique of capitalism , to take it to its radical conclusions , including the necessity of a serious class struggle , has another unfortunate political consequence .
It opens the door to phony right - wing populist movements seizing the mantle of “ radical ” opposition to the status quo .
With the economic system off - limits to criticism ( even invisible in its main power dimensions ) , attention necessarily gravitates to government as the root of all evil .
The state must therefore be the source of the peoples ’ problems ; and indeed , it seems very seldom to operate in their real interests .
It is the state , after all , that imposes taxes that seem to provide ordinary people few benefits ; runs deficits , the burden of which falls disproportionately on those who gain the least ; and controls the military and police .
In today ’s Tea Party ideology , engineered principally by the right , capital is deemed natural , while the state is unnatural — imposed from without on those who would otherwise be free .
The social crisis is then seen as a crisis of too much government , too much interference by state interests in the natural order of things .
Capitalism is treated as an elemental force , like the wind and tides , or a mere byproduct of human nature .
The reality of power in today ’s society is hidden behind the mist generated by this false “ naturalism . ”
The underlying principle , therefore , is clear : progressives need a fundamental critique of capitalism and an open discussion about the possible advantages of socialism — even to attempt major reforms within capitalism .
And when they begin that critique , we believe , most progressives and most Americans will come to the conclusion that C.B. Macpherson , in his The Life and Times of Liberal Democracy , reached some four decades ago :
It is increasingly difficult to reconcile liberal democratic values ( much less anything remotely resembling genuine democracy ) with today ’s monopoly - finance capital .
Something has to go .
And that is exactly why capitalism is off - limits to honest discussion , and why the constraints placed on public debate in our political culture prevent any real , permanent forward movement .
We have not forgotten the basic realities of class .
We know that most of those self - identified as part of the U.S. liberal - left are very privileged , relative to the larger working population .
The liberal - left is heavily entrenched in the professional - managerial stratum , or the upper middle class .
Many of them are employed by the state .
Theirs is a class reality that ties them in innumerable ways to the system .
They may want significant change , but most of the liberal - left is materially linked , in a way that the vast majority of the population is not , to the existing power structure .
Nevertheless , there is no imaginable path toward socialism in the United States today , in which a considerable portion of those who currently constitute the “ liberal - left ” do not play an important role as key initiators and supporters of a general revolt in society .
The current state of U.S. politics might be described as one in which the right has gained more power by moving right .
The left needs to gain more power by moving left .
If this means increased political polarization , so be it .
Getting Serious
We were provoked to write this article because the possibilities in the United States for a genuine , free - wheeling discussion of capitalism ’s defects , and the merits of socialism , are greater today than at any time in generations , and we must not let this historic moment pass .
What is striking , and a cause for optimism , is the current degree of criticism of capitalism and the amount of support for socialism — in a media and political culture where criticism of the former and support for the latter have been all but forbidden .
Back in 1987 , a poll of the U.S. population indicated that 45 percent of the population believed that Marx ’s famous words from the Critique of the Gotha Programme delimiting communism — “ from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ” — were enshrined in the U.S. Constitution .
This , of course , said more about the absolute ideals of most Americans , and what they thought they should expect , than about the U.S. Constitution itself .
Two decades of neoliberalism , far from eradicating radical ideas , appear to have given them rebirth .
A 2009 global survey , conducted by the BBC , found some 15 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that free market capitalism “ is fatally flawed and a different economic system is needed . ”
Another 40 percent thought capitalism had problems that required regulation and reform .
A mere 25 percent thought capitalism was doing a bang - up job and increased government regulation would be harmful .
The remainder were n’t sure .
A different 2009 survey found that only 53 percent of Americans thought capitalism superior to socialism .
Among adults under the age of thirty , capitalism was preferred to socialism as the best system , by a slim 37 to 33 percent margin .
We are in no position to determine the veracity of these poll numbers , though they arise from what are considered respectable sources .
We also can only imagine what people think when they hear the term “ socialism , ” since it is either ignored or mangled in the mainstream culture .
But we do know that people experience capitalism and corporate power every day in their lives , and these surveys demonstrate what we have seen repeatedly :
People do n’t like it very much , despite the endless exhortations about the genius of “ choice ” made possible by the “ free market ” around them .
To many millions of Americans , if socialism is the nemesis of capitalism it must by definition be a damn sight better .
To his credit , filmmaker Michael Moore was the first to tap into this sentiment with his 2009 film , Capitalism : A Love Story .
He toured the nation , explaining that capitalism had failed and needed to be replaced .
Words like these had never been uttered on commercial news media , unless they were part of some denunciation of the speaker .
Capitalism , as an economic , political , and social system based on private ownership , directed to the greatest possible profits for particular individuals and corporations , is , in our day , entirely absurd .
It has no rational or orderly relationship to human life or to the future of humanity .
Socialism , as its heir apparent , stands for the chance that still exists to create a just , egalitarian , and sustainable world directed at human needs , in which the people themselves are sovereign — once the fetters of private profit are burst asunder .
Is this possible ?
Who knows ?
What we do know is that , as long as we breathe air , we have no real choice but to rebel , because under capitalism humanity has no future .
Notes
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court refused on Monday to consider whether the Vatican has legal immunity over the sexual abuse of minors by priests in the United States , allowing a lawsuit filed in 2002 to go forward .

The nation ’s highest court , asked to rule on a U.S. appeals court decision that cleared the way for the lawsuit to proceed , rejected the Vatican ’s immunity appeal without comment .
The lawsuit , filed by a plaintiff identified only as John Doe , claimed he was sexually abused on several occasions in the mid-1960s when he was 15 or 16 by a Roman Catholic priest named Father Andrew Ronan .
According to court documents , Ronan molested boys in the mid-1950s as a priest in Ireland and then in Chicago before his transfer to a church in Portland , Oregon , where he allegedly abused the victim who filed the lawsuit .
Ronan died in 1992 .
The Vatican claimed immunity under a U.S. law , the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 , that allows foreign states to avoid being sued in court .
But the law contains exceptions .
The appeals court cited one of those , ruling the lawsuit has sufficiently alleged that Ronan was an employee of the Vatican acting within the scope of his employment under Oregon law .
Pope Benedict met victims of abuse by priests during his April 2008 visit to the United States .
The U.S. church has paid $ 2 billion in settlements to victims since 1992 .
In recent months , child abuse allegations against Catholic priests have rocked the United States and Europe , forcing resignations of bishops in Ireland , Belgium and Germany in the biggest crisis in Benedict ’s five - year pontificate .
In the Oregon case , the Obama administration backed the Vatican and said the appeals court erred in ruling that a victim ’s claim of sexual abuse by a priest falls within the exception to foreign sovereign immunity law .
But administration lawyers said the ruling did not warrant review by the Supreme Court “ at this time . ”

Opinion
Today 's online environment , where piracy is virtually unchecked , is neither fair nor reasonable .
We need copyright reform to change this .
Pirate websites like IsoHunt , hosted right here in Canada , operate as a bridge to those who want to download music for free .
Such websites offer content that costs nothing to them but has value to consumers , drawing traffic so they can sell online advertising .
The result is predictable and devastating .
As illegal downloads of music have soared , sales have dropped .
In addition to the composers , lyricists and designers who provide true creative content , there is a vast and complex ecosystem of expertise ( such as studio engineers , technicians , musicians , printers , administrative staff and record store employees , etc. ) that has been profoundly affected by large - scale theft and distribution of copyrighted material over the Internet .
The impact filters directly to communities large and small , like Stratford , where I live .
The creative community is working hard to turn its fortunes around by offering new ways for consumers to enjoy our work online , for instance .
But making the necessary investments is impossible when piracy means the investments may never be recouped .
Years of training , hard work and past investment by individuals , businesses and government can be rendered valueless because copyright laws have not been enforced .
Some people suggest that artists can make up their losses by touring all the time or hawking T - shirts .
But this is viable only in a few specific instances and creates huge challenges for those with family obligations .
Even now , parts of the touring industry are also starting to see their business erode .
As a result , many venues , promoters , local crews and even popcorn sellers are all struggling to stay alive .
From activists and academics we hear a lot about so - called " user rights . "
It is my view that this is crafted language .
When folks buy a CD ( or a legitimate download ) they are actually buying a licence to listen .
They do n't own the rights to the song .
Many things the public wishes to do with what they purchase can all be accomplished within the framework of permissions and limited copying for personal use .
In my small business , we grant permissions for educational , charitable and other uses on a regular basis .
Another misconception is equating fame with riches .
Yes , the Internet has brought recognition to some , but keep in mind that the same technology that has helped to make a few artists famous has also made many unable to earn a living , especially in the long run .
Better protection of our intellectual property rights will help to change this .
We can once again have a thriving creative environment where artists are paid and the communities where they live and work reap the rewards .
That is why I welcome copyright reform legislation .
And it is why I am counting on parliamentarians to ensure the measures we need are passed into law .
It is only fair .

Three weeks of speculations have come to an end .
Since this morning Verlinde 's paper is available
I encourage you to give it a try .
The article is well written and the math is limited to fairly basic stuff .
This combination makes it a relatively easy read .
Granted , the paper requires some more gray matter cells being active than the average “ Hammock Physicist ” blog entry , but for an average Hammock Physicist reader probably not by an insurmountable amount .
The crux of the article can be summarized in one sentence :
If it smells like entropy , and it behaves like entropy , it probably is entropy .
As was suggested before , one can consider Verlinde 's starting point to be a reversal of concepts like the Hawking temperature of black holes and the Unruh effect .
Let 's take the black hole temperature as an example .
The black hole temperature is defined at the black hole horizon , and since Hawking 's groundbreaking work we know it is proportional to the gravitational acceleration at the horizon .
Now Verlinde reverses this .
He asks us to consider the gravitational acceleration at the horizon as resulting from the horizon temperature .
Subsequently , Verlinde takes a deep dive : if an acceleration is proportional to a temperature , it has all the characteristics of an entropic effect .
Entropic acceleration results from the tendency of a system to evolve such that there is an increase in the minimum number of bits required to describe the system in all its details .
Could it be that gravitational attraction results from nothing more than a growth in number of bits required ?
Verlinde argues that such is indeed the case .
Key is that one needs to follow a holographic approach with all bits describing reality residing at holographic screens .
I think the relation to entropic effects is clearest in one of the Newtonian scenarios Verlinde considers : a given matter distribution that creates a gravitational potential .
Verlinde requires the holographic screens to coincide with equipotential surfaces , and arrives at the conclusion that the bit saturation ( the number of bits required to describe the system divided by the number of bits available on the screen ) equals where represents the Newtonian gravitational potential .
This bit saturation is a positive number that vanishes at large distances .
If one shrinks the holographic screen whilst ensuring it keeps following the equipotential surfaces , the bit saturation keeps growing until it reaches a value of unity at which the screen is saturated with information .
It can not shrink further , a black hole hole has formed with the screen representing its holographic horizon .
Again , you have to reverse this thinking .
When doing so , the picture that emerges is that of a gravitational attraction ( acceleration defined by a gravitational potential ) that results from a tendency of physical systems to evolve such that the holographically available bits saturate with information .
This tendency towards bit saturation is an entropic effect , that we experience as gravitational attraction .
Verlinde goes further than Newtonian gravity .
He discusses inertia , the equivalence principle , the Einstein equation , and also gives some hints towards implications for string theory .
The paper inevitably has somewhat a handwaving character , and provides a direction rather than a full theory .
Yet , the direction is clear , and points to a novel horizon ( pun intended ) that is unexplored .
I do consider Verlinde 's arguments to be convincing .
Verlinde is ' on to something ' , and it would not surprise me if in a short time frame we will witness a flurry of activity in this area .
A few more critical remarks : in most of the examples , I do not think the sign of the entropic force comes always out very clearly .
Related to this is the question : how is the inside and the outside of a screen defined whilst avoiding any circular reasoning , and how to get a change in sign between attractive and repulsive effects .
I am convinced that within the existing framework these questions can be answered in a satisfactory fashion .
These matters are of paramount importance if one starts to address issues like : can one use this entropic approach to eliminate the need for dark energy ?
Other more philosophical questions center around the emergence of time ( and the good - ole ' arrow of time ' ) from this entropic approach .
And , of course , the million - dollar question is : “ what laws govern the bit dynamics on holographic screens ? ”

The 1984 film Ghostbusters starred Harold Ramis , Bill Murray , and Dan Akroyd as paranormal exterminators in New York City ( later joined by Ernie Hudson ) .
The script was written by Ramis and Akroyd .
The movie was # 1 for five weeks straight that summer , and became the most successful comedy of the 1980s .
But you already knew all that , did n't you ?
Here are ten things you might not know about Ghostbusters .
1 .
The story as Dan Akroyd originally envisioned it involved time travel and many more ghostbusters .
He wrote the principle roles for John Belushi , Eddie Murphy , and John Candy .
Belushi died before the movie was made , and Candy and Murphy were n't interested .
Harold Ramis changed most of the original plot to make the production affordable 2 .
The film had no name through most of its development .
One name that was considered was Ghoststoppers .
After the producers settled on Ghostbusters , plans went ahead .
Some time later , it was brought to their attention that a live action children 's show named The Ghost Busters had aired during the 1975 - 76 TV season .
Columbia quickly pursued negotiations with Filmation , the owners of the series , to secure rights to the title they were already using .
After the movie became a hit , Filmation went back and produced an animated series called Filmation 's Ghostbbusters , using the same characters from the earlier live - action series .
A separate animated series from Columbia Pictures called The Real Ghostbusters based on the movie began in 1986 .

3 . The voice of the gatekeeper Zuul , the minion of Gozer , was that of Ivan Reitman , the film 's director , but he did n't take a credit for it .
Just another trick at a producer 's disposal for saving money - one more voiceover artist they did n't have to pay !
4 .
The Proton Pack is the weapon of choice for the Ghostbusters .
It is sort of a particle - beam weapon .
We have some of those in real - life now , such as the Large Hadron Collider and other particle - acceleration laboratories , but you can't carry something like that on your back .
Columbia Pictures had the Proton Packs made by the prop department out of fiberglass with various gizmos added like pneumatic fittings , resistors , and anything else lying around that might look appropriate .
5 .
Adult film star Ron Jeremy appeared in a the crowd as the containment unit explodes .
The scene is about an hour into the movie , and Jeremy is to the left , sporting his iconic mustache .
6 .
Harold Ramis , who played Dr. Egon Spengler , is better known as a director .
Before writing and acting in Ghostbusters , he directed Caddyshack and National Lampoon 's Vacation .
After Ghostbusters , he directed Bill Murray again in Groundhog Day .
7 .
The spirit / diety Gozer takes the form of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man because Dr. Raymond Stantz ( Akroyd ) thought of him as someone who would never hurt him .
Stay Puft is a fictional company .
The Marshmallow Man was only one of many oversized monsters in the original script - the rest were cut due to budget concerns .
8 .
The voracious green ghost that passes through walls and leaves slime behind is known as Slimer , although he was never referred to by name in the first Ghostbusters movie .
Instead , the cast and crew called him " Onion Head " !
Oh yes , the voice of the - ghost - to - be - later - known - as Slimer was also director Ivan Reitman .
9 .
" Who you gonna call ? "
The theme song " Ghostbusters " by Ray Parker , Jr. went to # 1 on the Billboard singles chart and stayed there for three weeks .
It was nominated for an Academy Award in the best original song category , and won a Grammy .
But you wo n't find the music video on the home video version of the movie Ghostbusters , due to a plagiarism suit brought by Huey Lewis in 1984 .
Lewis charged that the tune to " Ghostbusters " was essentially the same as " I Want a New Drug " by Huey Lewis and the News , which came out six months earlier .
The suit was settled out of court in 1985 , with one of the stipulations being that neither party would ever discuss the suit in public .

Labor and the Greens are on the verge of a comprehensive preference deal that would boost the government 's prospects of holding on to power while helping the Greens achieve the balance of power in the Senate .
Sources said the deal was close to fruition and more comprehensive than that crunched at the last election , while the Greens leader , Bob Brown , indicated it was all but done .
The agreement would give Labor crucial Greens preferences for House of Representatives seats in all but a handful of electorates where Greens branches will exercise their right to choose otherwise .
In return , Labor will direct its Senate preferences towards the Greens .
As the campaign moved into full swing yesterday , the Prime Minister , Julia Gillard , declared the election a referendum on '' our very quality of life ' ' as she revealed a policy on sustainable population .

JONATHAN HAYWARD / THE CANADIAN PRESS Nala gets a ride with her mom almost a year ago .
MONTREAL --
A tiger and two camels whose disappearance made international headlines were relaxing back at home on Tuesday after being found by Quebec provincial police .
Jonas the tiger and camels Shawn and Todd were found safe in their trailer on a rural road Monday evening after an alert passerby saw the trailer and tipped police .
HANDOUT / THE CANADIAN PRESS Camels Shawn and Todd , 5 , are seen in a trailer that was recovered Monday east of Montreal .
" They were in great shape , " said Sgt. Ronald McInnis , a Quebec provincial police spokesman .
" The veterinarian thinks that the people who stole the animals gave them something to eat and drink . "
The trailer and the truck pulling it were snatched while its driver took a rest break during the long drive bringing the animals from Nova Scotia to the Bowmanville , Ont. , zoo .
" The veterinarian gave them a good bill of health , " head zookeeper Stefanie MacEwan said Tuesday .
The good news came as the Vancouver Aquarium delivered some very sad news :
A beluga calf born to much fanfare there last summer died of a " bizarre " condition that is baffling veterinarians around the world .
Vancouver Aquarium staff said Nala was thriving until about two weeks ago when she stopped nursing as usual .
Blood samples showed she had an infection , which was treated with antibiotics .
She was soon back to normal and frolicking with her mom before taking a turn for the worse on Sunday , aquarium veterinarian Martin Haulena said Tuesday .
She died just after 10 p.m. on Monday .
Haulena said staff discovered that Nala , who was born last June to Aurora , the aquarium 's 20 - year - old female beluga , had a pocket beneath her larynx , or voice box , which contained two stones and a penny .
But he said the pocket is n't supposed to be there and no one knows if it developed when debris became trapped in the space or whether the beluga was born with the sac .
He said the penny may have been dropped in the pool by a visitor despite signs in the area asking visitors to keep objects away .

At Lake Olga , Oscar was looking for turtles and for " fish I catch with my hands . "
He held up his 4 - year - old hands while Grandpa loaded the canoe with paddles , life vests , and some snacks .
When we arrived at the lake , the air was still and hot .
Olga is several miles into the pine stands of the Manistee National Forest ( current forest fire danger level : very high ) at the northern edge of Osceola County in Michigan .
Olga is a kettle lake , so - called because the kettlelike basin was formed when a huge chunk of the retreating ice age glacier broke off and crashed into the moraine of soft earth deposited by the flowing ice .
The landlocked iceberg , having nowhere else to go , melted into the depression , forming Lake Olga .
For all of the thousands of years between then and now , the basin had made a habit of collecting anything that rolled into it .
This was Oscar 's first time in a boat .
The sandy boat launch that pushed out into the mucky lake was boxed in by a 7 - by - 10 - foot frame of four - by - fours .
Out beyond the edge of the old wood , the lake sank down into amber depths .
In the corner of the launch , in the shadow of the wood , Oscar knelt and patiently watched minnows for his chance to strike .
When he nervously climbed into the canoe , Oscar informed us , " My bottom wet . "
Like any other piece of forest flotsam , we were adrift on the surface of the lake .
Below the boat grew brown corkscrew - shaped weeds in huge mats .
" What that ? "
Oscar pointed out to the middle of the lake where plants pushed up through the surface of the water .
As we approached , the canoe wobbled and Oscar held tight to the gunwales .
" Can we go back ? " he asked .
" Do n't you want to see what 's ahead ? "
" I want to catch fish with my hand , " he said quietly .
The lily pads were in bloom , little yellow blooms like ping - pong balls with a hole in the top .
A fly flew into one and never came out .
The canoe hissed against the shrubs that grew up out of the water .
In the center of the lake there were great hedges of a strange woody shrub with long , thin gray - green leaves that grew up past the waterline .
Beneath the water there were clumps of mud caught in piles of logs .
It might have been myrtle , it might have been bog rosemary , but it was growing up at the center of a lake .
Amid the shrubs , herbaceous red flowers drooped face down .
In the depths , growing from the muck caught in the old logs , the flowers were sprouting from gape - mouthed pitcher plants .
You could imagine that eventually the shrubs would grow so dense that one could get lost in this mid-lake garden .
The network of logs made up the outer edges of a huge beaver lodge .
The lodge was sun-bleached gray and topped with a high mast of wood about seven inches in diameter that supported an angry red-winged blackbird .
Several muted brown females hid in the shrubs and trilled at us while the males swooped around us and barked .
" I wish I could go in there , " Oscar sighed , his eyes following the woodpile down into the watery dark .
" Me , too , " I said .
I imagined the beavers diving down into the acidic waters where they would slip through a hole deep at the base of the lodge .
Inside the mound of wood , back up above the waterline , they would sleep in a spacious , dark burrow .
There seems , at certain moments in life , to be nothing more comforting than the idea of being completely lost .
The water around the beaver lodge was especially yellow , and I wondered if it was acidic from the wood .
At the center of the lake , a bog was forming .
This would be the first stage of the eventual end of the lake , the water choked off by all the writhing life it collected in its maw .
Beyond the lodge and the copse of shrubs there was open water , and then a dense brake of more shrubs .
The shrubs were clustered so densely that some of the peaty muck they grew from pushed up above the waterline .
The peaty edges of the slowly forming island were fringed with an alien garden of blood - red pitcher plants , drawing greedy deerflies down into their enticing depths .
At the center of the mound of shrubs there grew a stunted tamarack where a pair of buntings watched us warily .
" I want to go back , " Oscar said again , as the canoe tilted left , then right .
We startled a nesting loon , and she beat her wings , flying so low along the water that she kicked up a wake as she desperately tried to lead us away from her young .
Briefly , as we paused in the water , there came a cooling breeze from the east .
" That 's nice , " Grandpa said .
On our way back to the launch , we watched black male loons dive after fish .
One of the loons unexpectedly broke the surface just five feet from the boat , unconcerned as we slipped past .
I admired his checkerboard wings while Oscar clutched at the canoe 's crossbeam .
As the dark loon faded from view down into the gloomy water , it seemed as though the whole lake were drawing everything down into itself .
I let my hand drag in the water .
After weeks of early summer heat , it was tepid , inviting .
I could imagine sinking into it , getting tangled in the mats of corkscrew weeds , twisting amid the pile of beaver - dragged logs .
After circumnavigating the lake , we pulled the boat up across the wooden frame of the sandy boat launch .
As Grandpa loaded the canoe back on the trailer , Oscar knelt in front of a four - inch fish that , like him , was trying to catch minnows .
Oscar 's hand hovered over the fish , but the fish only sank farther and farther into the shelter of the shaded corner of wood .
Then , a leech undulated along the sandy lake bed .
He was three inches long , twisting in spirals , his back speckled , his belly rusty red .
A small brown leech tugged at my foot , and I watched him lazily until I finally decided to shake him off .
As I put him in his car seat , Oscar said , " We did n't see any turtles . "
I agreed that we had n't .
When we got home , Grandma asked Oscar what he had seen at Lake Olga .
" A worm with spots on its back that wanted to suck my blood ! "
I had to privately agree with his enthusiasm .
The leech , like the lake , was unsettlingly beautiful .

We all want to be rock stars .
From singing along in our cars to performing karaoke in front of strangers , the lure of fame and riches pulls gives us false hopes of what might be if we are just given the chance to show the world how talented we are .
But sadly , most of us are n’t not talented and our singing careers should remain in the shower , not broadcast on MTV ( if they actually showed music videos anymore ) .
But the good news for us is this , even though these amateur performers are n’t very entertaining as singers , they provide more than enough unintentional comedy to keep you riveted to their music videos … much like watching a train wreck , but without the carnage .
10 . “ Why Must I Cry ? ” by Reh Dogg
We ’ll give Reh Dogg this ; the man is absolutely dedicated to his art , and showing off his incredible abs .
He ’s also laying down the vocals live , right there on camera .
Now if only the video had , say , lighting or direction or artistic integrity … that might help a bit .
9. “ Break It Up ” by Carl Lewis
Carl Lewis is an immensely talented and brilliant athlete .
He still holds the world record in indoor long jump even after athletes started munching the fancy new steroids like candy .
He has one of the longest undefeated streaks in history .
He has one of the worst music videos known to man .
We ’re not sure if it ’s the repeated use of Olympics footage , or whatever that thing is he ’s making out with in a hot tub , but either the money was amazing , his ego was huge , or both .
8. “ Come Play With Me ” by Grill Champions
We ’re just going to take a wild guess here and assume that , in light of the song ’s lyrics about grilling vegetables , and in light of the name of the band , it ’s a promotional video .
Granted , we have a long history of food in advertising encouraging us to burn it to death and then rip it apart , but we ’ve never had a creepy techno pop song about it !
Way to break new ground !
7. “ Losing You ” by Jan Terri
Jan Terri has no shortage of talent , or at least desire to succeed , as witnessed by the fact that she actually produced this video and gave it to anybody who stepped into her limo .
Too bad the video itself was shot on …wait , what was this shot on ?
VHS ?
Beta ?
Maybe a webcam ?
Either way , despite a clever use of resources , she never got her fifteen minutes of fame … wait , she eventually got on the Daily Show .
Wow .
6. “ Average Homebody ” by Denny “ Blazin ' ” Hazen
There ’s nothing quite as entertaining as watching white people try to rap .
Especially in the ’ 80s , when rap was a daring , edgy art form expressing urban angst and frustration with the oppression foisted on the Black population by society .
So let ’s try and translate that out into white suburban anomie .
Denny Hazen has actually made an industry out of this video , and good for him , but wow , dude .
5 . “ He Loves a Fat Girl ” by Ellen and Donald
For the sake of anonymity and the fact that , really , we did n’t want to research these people any further , the above is the only name we ’re giving .
Hey , they ’re happy , it ’s legal , more power to them , we ’re just going to be over here , trying to get the image of them making love out of heads by pouring bleach into our eyes .
4. “ Apache ” , by the Tommy Seebach Band
It kind of amazes us we got this far without offering up a video rife with idiotic racism , but in a list like this , it ’s all but inevitable .
Whether it ’s the “ Indian ” outfits or just the fact that they ’re taking a glittery disco chainsaw to a surf rock classic , you just kind of want to punch Tommy Seebach until the cocaine comes back out of his nose .
If you were wondering what a GOOD version of this song sounds like :
3. “ Little Wings ” by Mark Gormley
We have a standing policy of not mocking ( most of ) the singers for this article , because putting yourself out there is really difficult .
Fortunately , production values are fair game .
We do n’t know why they put Mark Gormley on a green screen , or why they started pressing random effects buttons , or why they cut in bland footage of a seagull .
But it could have been so much worse .
As amply demonstrated by the rest of this list .
Be careful , the disorienting camera angels and movements mixed with the water waves backgrounds may make you seasick .
But it also just may be the video itself providing the symptoms of nausea .
2. “ Carribean Moon ” by Kevin Ayers
We do not like this video , and no , we ’re not letting the fact that it ’s from the ’70s mitigate that statement at all .
Whoever Kevin Ayers is , and we ’re sure his fan will object to our dismissing him , we ’re amazed that when presented with the storyboards for this video , he did n’t torch the studio and change his name .
And that ’s the thing ; this took a lot of preparation .
There were storyboards .
People laid this out and paid for it and nobody , at any point , realized what a bad idea it was .
Just skip to the 1:30 mark for some incredible homo - erotic confusion .
1. “ Love in a Pub ” by Leoncie
This is probably the apex of where bad music meets bad video production .
The music is sickeningly sweet , the video is about as unprofessional as it gets , including the opening which is designed to create motion sickness .
In general it ’s the video definition of bad idea .
When the couple in this video saw the final product , we wonder if they screamed at the musician or if they just dropped all pretense , pulled out the Glock , and started shooting .

Larkemett , when it comes to the bourbons , scotches , brandies ( cognacs ) , whiskies , et. al. you 'll want to distinguish between those for mixing , and those for sipping .
If you have a guest who wants to enjoy a good single malt , for example , they 'll remember you forever if you pour them a Macallan or a 15 - year old Glenmorangie .
But on the other hand , if you 're mixing up a Scotch - based drink that has a lot of other heavy or strong - tasting ingredients , the subtleties and nuances of a premium Scotch would be lost .
In that latter case , you can go with one of the more " everyday " Scotches as the base for the cocktail .
Same goes for the others I mentioned at the opening :
You 'll want to have " premium " stuff for the sippers , and " good " stuff for the mixers .
A well - stocked bar will have both on hand .

Tony Blair our very special adviser by dictator Gaddafi's son
Tony Blair has become an adviser to Colonel Gaddafi , the Libyan dictator 's son has sensationally claimed .
Saif al - Islam Gaddafi said the former prime minister has secured a consultancy role with a state fund that manages the country 's £ 65 billion of oil wealth .
In an exclusive interview , Saif described Mr Blair as a ' personal family friend ' of the Libyan leader and said he had visited the country ' many , many times ' since leaving Downing Street three years ago .
Personal friends ?
Tony Blair meets Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi at his desert base
If true , the claims will plunge Mr Blair - now a Middle East peace envoy - into a fresh row over potential conflicts of interest between his public and private roles .
His business affairs have attracted widespread controversy because they are deliberately shrouded in secrecy .
Last night , families of the 270 Lockerbie victims accused Mr Blair of breaking bread with people who ' have blood on their hands ' .
They have in the past raised questions about Mr Blair 's relationship with Colonel Gaddafi especially over a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya that paved the way for the return of the Lockerbie bomber last year .
Saif made clear that the agreement - drawn up when Mr Blair was prime minister - was key to creating a ' special relationship ' between Britain and Libya .
Saif suggested Mr Blair was involved in ' Africa projects ' with his father , alleging : ' He also has some consultancy role with the Libyan Investment Authority . '
Mr Blair was adamant last night he had no relationship whatsoever with the LIA .
However he is advising several firms seeking a slice of the massive revenues from Libya 's oil reserves .
Saif , speaking in his private suite in Mayfair 's five star Connaught Hotel , said : ' Tony Blair has an excellent relationship with my father .
' For us , he is a personal family friend .
I first met him around four years ago at Number 10 .
Since then I 've met him several times in Libya where he stays with my father .
He has come to Libya many , many times .
' He 's adviser to the LIA , the Libyan Investment Authority .
He has some consultancy role . '
Saif defended Mr Blair 's right to exploit his contacts in Libya .
' Many people are unhappy with him [ Blair ] because of Iraq , ' he said .
' It 's much easier to deal with the LIA than the Middle East .
Tony Blair has the right to earn money .
' It 's a good thing to be a businessman .
The LIA is ready to talk to anybody who wants to do business in Libya . '
Last night , Mr Blair 's spokesman said : ' Tony Blair does not have any role , either formal or informal , paid or unpaid , with the Libyan Investment Authority or the government of Lybia .
' He has an excellent relationship with my father '
' He has no commercial relationship with any Libyan companies or any Libyan projects in Africa . '
But sources close to the Gaddafi family said Saif - tipped to succeed his father as leader of his country - stands by his comments .
Colonel Gaddafi is understood to be on first name terms with Mr Blair , who saw his work in Libya as one of the great foreign policy successes of his premiership .
Mr Blair has always insisted he played no role in the return of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Al Megrahi , who was sent home last August by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds after doctors wrongly said he had only three months to live .
But Saif said Megrahi's release was ' always on the negotiating table ' in discussions about ' commercial contracts for oil and gas with Britain ' .
Frank Duggan , president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 , told the Mail : ' If this is true , I guess this is Tony Blair 's reward from the Libyan government for what he has done .
' It 's important for world peace that Libya is brought back into the community of nations but that does n't mean that you have to honour people with blood on their hands . '
Saif , 37 , was a key player in Libya 's bid to end its pariah status and renounce nuclear weapons .
That decision led to Mr Blair 's trip to Tripoli in 2004 , where he shook Colonel Gaddafi 's hand and declared a ' new relationship ' .
The meeting led to lucrative Libyan oil contracts for Shell .
A month before stepping down as PM , Mr Blair visited - Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli again at the same time that BP signed a $ 900 million deal with the Libyan National Oil Company .
Saif said : ' Libya has a special relationship with Britain . '
Since becoming a part - time Middle East peace envoy on leaving office in 2007 , Mr Blair has exploited his contacts to amass a personal fortune in excess of £ 20 million .
He has a lucrative contract to advise JP Morgan , which pays him £ 2 million a year .
Part of his job for them is to develop banking opportunities in Libya .
It is understood that British firms Mr Blair is linked to are also being given contracts to tap Libya 's massive natural resources , and to help rebuild the country 's outdated infrastructure .
The details are sketchy because he has built a labyrinthine business empire of interlocking partnerships designed , it seems , to conceal the sources and scale of his income .
Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski , who chairs the all - party Commons committee on Libya , said Mr Blair should spend more time on his role as a Middle East envoy than allegedly exploiting his links with the Gaddafi family .
He said : ' Mr Blair has a very important job .
It does concern me greatly that he seems to spend so much time with the Libyans , who are not key players in the Arab - Israeli conflict .
' There should be greater transparency to ensure that Tony Blair is not using his current position and his previous position to assist his business interests . '
Sources close to Mr Blair said it was a matter of public record that he has visited Libya since leaving office , where he has discussed a range of issues .
They said he fully supported the decision to integrate Libya back into the international community and is proud of the role he played in the process .
The social web that connects the rich and powerful
Saif Gaddafi sits at the centre of a remarkable social web that has ensnared both Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson .
The men are bound together by their interests in Libyan business and their friendship with the multi-billionaire financiers of the Rothschild family .
Lord Mandelson once remarked that he was ' intensely relaxed ' about extreme wealth , a position he has justified ever since .
It was only natural that he should share an interest in networking and wealth with one of the world 's oldest banking families .
But even the Rothschilds have probably never described him as a ' killer of a man ' .
That was Saif Gaddafi's take on the former Business Secretary .
After Labour 's election defeat , Mr Gaddafi said : ' It 's bad news for the UK that he left because he is a killer of a man .
It 's a loss for the UK . '
The two men met briefly last summer at the secluded cliff top mansion compound of the Rothschild family on the holiday island of Corfu .
Curiously , their stays overlapped by one night and came only a week before the announcement - that the perpetrator of the Lockerbie bombing could be released from prison .
They ' fleetingly ' discussed the fate of the bomber Abdelbaset Ali Al Megrahi but Lord Mandelson 's spokesman said he was ' completely unsighted ' on the impending release .
Last November , Lord Mandelson spent more time in the company of Saif during a shooting weekend at Waddesdon Manor , Lord Rothschild 's mini-Versailles in Buckinghamshire .
Cherie Blair was also a guest .
Earlier this month , the former business secretary was seen zipping around the Swiss ski resort of Klosters in Nat Rothschild 's £ 250,000 Ferrari convertible .
An Anglophile , Col Gaddafi 's likely heir Saif studied for a PhD at the London School of Economics .
He has a £ 10 million London home .
For the young Presidency of Barack Obama , and for the nation , this hellish summer of discontent started in balmy spring , on the evening of April 20th , forty miles off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico .
At first , after the explosion aboard the giant oil rig Deepwater Horizon , the rig ’s operator , BP , estimated the resulting flow at a thousand barrels a day .
A nasty business , yes .
But at that rate it would have taken eight months to approach the level of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and eight years to equal the record for the Gulf , set in 1980 at Ixtoc , off the Mexican coast .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
By May 17th — the day that the chief executive officer of BP predicted that “ the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to have been very , very modest ” — it was obvious that what was unfolding was the single biggest environmental catastrophe in the history of the United States .
By last Tuesday , June 15th , when President Obama commandeered the networks for his first address to the nation from the Oval Office , the per-day estimate had been ratcheted up to sixty thousand barrels — a thousand every twenty - four minutes .
The surface muck was fouling Florida beaches and Louisiana wetlands , leaving doomed seabirds shrouded in black ; just as ominous , huge subsurface blobs were leaching oxygen from the depths , threatening to suffocate an entire ocean ecosystem .
The Times was describing the governmental response as chaotic , “ bedeviled by a lack of preparation , organization , urgency and clear lines of authority among federal , state and local officials . ”
And Obama himself was under attack from all sides , with even admirers berating him for seeming coolly detached and not angry enough .
Against this background , Obama ’s speech was bound to feel unequal to the occasion .
What “ people ” wanted to hear was an answer to Malia Obama ’s now famous question —
“ Did you plug the hole yet , Daddy ? ” — and the answer they wanted to hear was yes , or , failing that , real soon .
This the President could not provide .
Plugging the hole is beyond his power , or , apparently , anyone else ’s .
By Labor Day , perhaps , relief wells , now being drilled at maximum speed , will still the gusher .
Or so we are told .
The emotional catharsis that some were hoping for from the President did not materialize .
No drama from Obama this time .
No blood , either , and no tears , and only a soupçon of sweat .
The speech was coherent — give it that .
It had three parts .
It began with an account , or defense , of the Administration ’s actions in the crisis thus far .
Second came the unveiling of new steps , among them a long - term project to restore the Gulf Coast , to be planned under the auspices of Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , who , although a former governor of Mississippi , is an enlightened and competent public servant .
Finally , the President issued a call , unencumbered by much detail , for a “ national mission ” to achieve a “ transition away from fossil fuels . ”
This was the part that stirred much of the ire that emanated from the right .
Prominent Republicans accused the President of using the crisis — “ seizing on ” it , “ exploiting ” it , “ leveraging ” it — in order , the Party chairman , Michael Steele , said , to deploy “ Chicago - style politics ” to “ manufacture knee - jerk political support for cap - and - trade energy taxes . ”
Meanwhile , some liberal commentators slammed Obama for timidity , including , precisely , not mentioning cap - and - trade .
“ See , I told you , we ’ve been going around in circles .
That ’s us twenty minutes ago ! ”

The President was right , of course , that the ultimate cause of the Gulf disaster is out - of - control consumption of a dwindling resource that must be extracted in increasingly dangerous ways .
The most effective , most efficient way to rein in that consumption and make clean energy price - competitive would be to slap a heavy tax on carbon .
( Ideally , much of the revenue would be rebated to the public as a cut in the payroll tax , since it makes more sense to tax things we want to discourage , such as oil use , than things we want to encourage , such as work . )
This is what some European countries have done , and it may well be what Obama would do if he had the kind of legislative power that European prime ministers have and that many Americans , of all political persuasions , assume that he has , too .
But he does n’t .
As he did with health care , Obama is trying for the maximum that , in his judgment , our rusty , clanking legislative sausage - maker is capable of delivering .
As he noted in his speech , a year ago the House passed “ a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill . ”
That bill languishes in the Senate , where its weaker counterpart is on life support , with the filibuster poised to cut it off .
If part three of Obama ’s speech was cautiously , even uninspiringly , worded , that is because it is part of the delicate legislative strategy of a President who knows that , while the perfect is out of reach , the good ( and maybe even the so - so ) is its ally , not its enemy .
The day after his speech , Obama made up for its deficit of drama by jawboning BP , which under federal law is liable for only seventy - five million dollars in damages , into putting twenty billion dollars in escrow for an independently administered fund to pay for damage claims .
The day after that , at the outset of a hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , the committee ’s ranking Republican , Joe Barton , told the assembled BP executives that he was “ ashamed ” of what Obama had done .
He called it — the escrow fund , not the oil spill — “ a tragedy of the first proportion . ”
The fund , he said , “ amounts to a shakedown , ” adding , “ I apologize . ”
Public outrage forced House Republican leaders to distance themselves from Barton ’s “ shakedown ” remark .
Barton himself was forced to say , one more time , “ I apologize . ”
But this was hardly a spontaneous gaffe .
It followed a script that had been laid down the day before , in a press release from the chairman of the House Republican Study Committee , Tom Price , of Georgia , which called the escrow agreement not just a shakedown but a “ Chicago - style shakedown . ”
The morning after all the distancing and renouncing , the Wall Street Journal editorial page , the guardian of Republican ideological purity , attacked the agreement as having been reached “ under what Texas Republican Joe Barton rightly called the pressure of ‘ a shakedown ’ yesterday . ”
The confused lines of authority that the Times noted are still too muddled .
Though it ’s clear that the President was personally engaged from the start , allowing the opposite impression to take hold was a failure of governance , not just of public relations .
And , as he acknowledged in his speech , his Administration was laggard in cleaning up the corrupt mess it inherited at the Minerals Management Service .
But , unlike his most vociferous Republican critics , he is trying to move the country away from its abject subservience to oil .
A shakedown ?
What Obama is trying for , in his methodical , sometimes maddening way , is a shakeup . ♦

HTC : Only 0.016 % of Droid Eris Owners Complained About Reception
Steve Jobs , with a bit of a smirk on his face , announced only 0.55 % of all iPhone 4 owners called AppleCare regarding antenna or reception issues .
He thought this was a rather small number , but considering there are 3,000,000 iPhone 4 owners , that ’s still 16,500 who actually spent time to call AppleCare .
Anyway , Steve Jobs made it a point to show how other smartphones lose reception when held in a certain way .
The phones he used were the BlackBery Bold 9700 , HTC Droid Eris , and Samsung Omnia II .
While RIM already made their own statement on the matter , HTC backed up the Droid Eris with a number of its own .
Eric Lin , Global Head of PR for HTC , said in a statement to Pocket - Lint :
“ Approximately .016 % of customers .
We have had very few complaints about signal or antenna problems on the Eris . ”
Only 0.016 % of all HTC Droid Owners called HTC ’s customer service regarding antenna or reception issues .
Unfortunately , we do n’t know how many Droid Eris devices were sold , but it ’s still a very telling number .
HTC Droid Eris owners hardly ever call to complain about reception issues because I am sure it ’s hard to death grip the phone .
With the iPhone 4 , it ’s clearly indicated where not to hold your phone and it ’s in a spot where many users hold the phone normally .
It ’s a shame Apple had to show other phones just to prove a point that not all smartphones are perfect .
Personally , I ’m glad HTC fired back with a statement of its own .

Moderate drinking has been linked to a variety of health benefits , including a reduced risk of heart disease , stroke , and diabetes .
According to a new study , drinking alcohol may also ease the pain of -- and lower the risk of developing -- rheumatoid arthritis , a potentially crippling autoimmune disorder .
People who do n't drink alcohol are roughly four times more likely to have rheumatoid arthritis than people who have at least one drink three or more days per week , the study found .
The researchers also found that rheumatoid arthritis patients who drink alcohol tend to have less severe symptoms than their nondrinking counterparts .
And the more often they drink , the milder their symptoms are .
An estimated 1.3 million adults in the U.S. have rheumatoid arthritis , a disorder in which the body 's immune system inappropriately attacks the joints , causing inflammation , pain , and swelling .
Some people experience temporary or intermittent symptoms , but severe cases of the disorder can be disabling .

" Alcohol reduces immune activity , at least to some extent , and [ we ] suspect that this is the main reason that alcohol consumption is associated with a reduction in severity of rheumatoid arthritis , " says the lead author of the study , James Maxwell , a rheumatologist at Rotherham Hospital , in the U.K .
" Alcohol may also have a mild painkilling effect . "
This does n't mean that rheumatoid arthritis patients should head for the nearest bar or liquor store .
Maxwell and his colleagues looked only at how many days per month the participants drank , not how much they downed at each sitting or what they filled their glasses with , so the link between overall alcohol use and rheumatoid arthritis remains a bit fuzzy .
In addition , some rheumatoid arthritis drugs -- such as methotrexate -- can cause liver damage if consumed with alcohol , says Martin Bergman , M.D. , chief of rheumatology at Taylor Hospital , in Ridley Park , Pennsylvania .

" Moderation is the key , " says Bergman .
" This [ study ] is by no means encouraging people to go out and get hammered , but as long as there are no [ drug ] contraindications , there may be some benefits to moderate alcohol consumption if you have RA or are at increased risk for it . "
In the study , which appears in the journal Rheumatology , Maxwell and his colleagues asked 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis and roughly 1,000 people without it to estimate how many days in the past month they 'd had at least one drink .
The researchers measured the severity of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms using questionnaires , joint X - rays , and blood tests that gauge inflammation .
People who'd had a drink on more than 10 days in the past month were less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis than people who did n't drink at all , and if they did have the disorder , they tended to have less severe symptoms according to each of the measures the researchers used .

Is alcohol actually good for you ?
However , the number of days per month a person drinks does n't provide the best picture of alcohol intake , says Eric Matteson , M.D. , the chair of the rheumatology department at the Mayo Clinic , in Rochester , Minnesota .
" How much a person drinks is probably more relevant than how often , " he says .
" There are people who binge drink quite a lot but may not drink every day , whereas someone who drinks wine every day is considered a frequent user . "
This was the first study in humans to examine the link between alcohol consumption and the severity of rheumatoid arthritis .
The findings also confirmed previous research suggesting that regular drinking may lower the risk of developing the disorder .
Health.com :
Is chronic pain ruining your relationship ?
Drinking alcohol does n't necessarily prevent rheumatoid arthritis , however .
Experts believe a complex mix of genetic , environmental , and hormonal factors causes the disorder , so while alcohol consumption may affect a person 's risk , it 's unlikely to be the deciding factor .
More studies will be needed to confirm the apparent benefits of alcohol on rheumatoid arthritis .
The researchers did not follow the participants over time , so they were unable to track how long - term drinking habits -- or changes in those habits -- may affect the disorder .

The study 's design also means the researchers have no way of knowing whether greater alcohol consumption leads to less severe symptoms , or vice versa .
As Matteson points out , " It may be that people with less severe [ rheumatoid arthritis ] - related pain and fatigue are more likely to drink in the first place . "

We live in a world in which blasphemy happens .
What makes this situation possible ?
There was no blasphemy 20,000 years ago , as far as we can tell .
There may be no blasphemy a thousand years from now .
How does blasphemy happen ?
A world where people disagreed over answers to big questions — questions about our past origins , our highest duties now , and our future destinies — need not contain any blasphemy .
In a world where everyone had worldviews but no one worried if theirs was a minority view , then that world would have no blasphemy .
A world where people could question , investigate , test , and re-evaluate each other ’s worldviews , openly and freely , has no blasphemy .
How does the blasphemy begin ?
How could it arise among people ?
When someone feels so absolutely confident and prideful about his or her conviction in a worldview , then blasphemy can start .
When this person does not want to hear or think about a rival worldview , then blasphemy can start .
When this person wants to control whether other people can express a rival worldview , then blasphemy can start .
And when this person also decides that others must not disagree with his or her own worldview , then blasphemy is full grown .
What sort of worldviews are intrinsically capable of inspiring and growing blasphemy ?
Religions are precisely those sorts of worldviews which tend to be hostile towards open questioning and re-evaluation by outsiders .
Monotheistic religions are an especially fertile kind of worldview for growing blasphemy .
Here is a simple recipe for blasphemy :
Easy no - bake recipe for blasphemy a substantial number of believers in monotheistic Religion A a substantial number of believers in monotheistic Religion B one egg of proclaiming one ’s belief on God Carefully separate the egg of proclaiming one ’s belief in God , discarding the white shapeless matter of “ all people really worship the same god ” .
Then take any random believer in religion A who likes the yolk of faith and blend well with the believers of religion B. Stand back while the spontaneous heat of insulted people rises and hardens into outrage .
To double the recipe , simply mix the same blend of a believer in religion B with those of A .
Why this recipe is so easy :
The statement “ My God exists ” is heard as “ Your God does n’t exist ” by believers of a rival monotheistic religion .
There are other recipes for blasphemy that only require one intolerant religion or ideological worldview .
Science is not one of them .
Scientific naturalism gets accused of committing blasphemy when it contradicts one religion or another , but of course a scientific worldview by itself cannot commit any blasphemy — it is the very paradigm of openly free inquiry and re-evaluation .
Nor could scientific naturalism commit blasphemy simply by disagreeing with other worldviews .
Blasphemy depends on the personal reception of disagreement .
Only intolerant worldviews create blasphemy .
Atheists are blasphemers only because there already are intolerant people .
( And atheists get labeled as intolerant only because they refuse to silence themselves . )
Neither science nor atheism invented blasphemy — intolerant religion invented blasphemy , it uses blasphemy , and it continues to perpetuate blasphemy to this day .
The whole matter has gotten entangled with a victim psychology .
Frankly , atheists need to just stop talking about blasphemy entirely , as if atheists really need to waste everyone ’s time by debating whether to create more or less blasphemy .
Atheists should openly advocate for their positive worldviews , whatever those may be , and do it in a fearless way .
Put more time into justifying and explaining what worldview is best .
And quit faulting atheists .
Atheists are NOT the people creating blasphemy at all .
The biggest blasphemers are religious people .
It ’s their fault .
Let them worry about it .
How long must we wait for a world without blasphemy ?
Simply put , health and safety laws and regulations play an essential role in protecting employees from vulnerability in the workplace .
As an employer , you ’re required to carry out a risk assessment of every workplace activity .
Where necessary , you ’ll have to provide your employees with adequate training , supervision , and information to ensure their safety in the [ … ]

" From 2nd from London # 5754 .
We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare .
We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral .
In the event of this not succeeding , we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following basis : make war together , make peace together , generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona .
The settlement in detail is left to you .
You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain and add the suggestion that he should , on his own initiative , invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves .
Please call the President 's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace .
Signed , Zimmermann . "
Of course , the actual message - read :
130 13042 13401 8501 115 3528 …
... was authored in German , and was originally sent to Count Johan von Bernstorff , then in the unenviable post of Germany 's ambassador to the United States .
The " Zimmermann Telegram , " so named for its author , Arthur Zimmermann , Foreign Secretary of the German Empire , was forwarded via absurdly circumlocutious route on to Heinrich von Eckardt , Germany 's ambassador to Mexico .
There , it was intended to persuade Mexico to open a southern front on America 's border , and thereby frustrate efforts to fight Germany on the continent , and elsewhere .
This , believe it or not , is the more drab part of the story .
What happened to the telegram once sent is much more interesting , and draws a dark picture for certain emergent , postmodern players in the intelligence world .
It is a dark , winding and overgrown path we brave to this end , perhaps even longer than most ( or any ) finem respice adventures heretofor , but , as ever , one endeavored to reward the indulgence of the curious ( and patient ) reader .
And if tales of cables and codes and turn of the century machines of war take some little while to evolve into the more current aether of the digital , do not fret .
It is a short distance , really , from one to the other , once the path is known .
High Tension Cables
For years the English cable ship Telconia was credited with cutting five German , transatlantic cables , conveniently bottle necked through the English Channel .
It was , in fact , the British Post Office Ship CS Alert that cut the critical cables , though the Telconia later cut other German lines , occasionally even pulling them up and repurposing them for use by the Allies .
The original cables , bound for Brest , France , Tenerife , Africa , Vigo , Spain along with two that ran via the Azores to New York , were the primary communication links Germany had with the outside world , and therefore the appendages of her diplomatic corps .
A single transatlantic cable running from West Africa to Brazil was left to the Germans , and this was substantially under American control , meaning that it too was eventually made unavailable to the Germans .
Instead , Germany was forced to use a wireless transmitter just outside of Berlin at Nauen , a broadcast channel that might as well have fed directly into British Naval Intelligence .
As one might imagine , the British quickly began to display a keen interest in the design , construction and operation of radio intercept gear , and a host of electronic ears trained intently on the distant tonal soprano singing into the skies surrounding Berlin , quietly and quickly sprang up along the English coast .
The loss of German undersea cables meant that in 1917 , and somewhat quaintly , diplomatic communiques from Germany to her proxies and agents were frequently sent via the glaringly insecure Western Union , their security being entrusted instead to the strength of the cipher used to encrypt them - a vanity that proved , as will be seen presently , quite costly to Germany at the time .
The Americans also permitted Germany to piggyback on their communications infrastructure for a time , ostensibly so that President Wilson could maintain open communications with Germany and broker peace ( indeed , so many American presidents have aspired , some quite cynically , to the title of " peacemaker " ) between the waring states of Europe .
But the Germans also relied on physical couriers and the like in order to assure timely ( or at least competent ) delivery for critical communications .
This meant that , by the time the Zimmermann telegram was being authored , it was ( or , rather , they were ) destined to take three parallel paths .
First , via the transmitter in Nauen , second via a Swedish cable to South America and then the German embassy in Buenos Aires , and finally via a clerk at the American embassy , then over the transatlantic cable operated by the Untied States Department of State and then by hand to the German embassy in the United States , and finally to Mexico .
It is this last route that proved , to borrow a turn of phrase , most fortuitous .
Of course , as both the Swedish and American cables passed over British soil , all three copies were in the hands of British codebreakers almost as soon as they were sent .
Stolen Books
Three years earlier , the German merchant ship Hobart had casually steamed into Port Phillip Heads in Australia .
" Casually " because the Hobart was apparently unaware ( as many German merchants were ) that war had been declared between Germany and Great Britain seven days earlier on August 4th , 1914 .
Having anticipated some of the confusion , the Royal Navy had ordered many British controlled ports to avoid any overt displays of war activity so as to potentially catch a few German ships with their guard down .
Having arrived in port only hours earlier , Captain J. T. Richardson of the Royal Australian Navy watched with interest as the German merchant ship blissfully sailed into port .
( A girl taken in her youth with tales of British wartime romances almost imagines the calm , but steely blue - eyed gaze of the lightly starched Captain Richardson , slowly panning to follow the languid path of the merchant ship over the fine porcelain lip of the cup of tea presented to him the moment he came aboard - but your mileage here may vary ) .
He then ordered a midshipman and six signalmen into civilian clothes quickly borrowed from a harbor pilot crew , swapped his naval cap with a bowler hat ( you ca n't make this stuff up - even in British wartime romances ) and draped an overcoat over his uniform before rowing the party right up to the Hobart .
After boarding the ship looking quite like the respectable chief of a pilot crew , Richardson removed his bowler hat , replaced his naval cap , handed his overcoat to the midshipman , produced a concealed pistol and politely told the Hobart 's stunned master that his ship was now a prize of war .
That very evening , having astutely remained on board with a squad of reserve sailors as guard , Richardson caught the Hobart 's master sliding back a secret panel that was found to contain the Hobart 's Handelsschiffsverkehrsbuch ( merchant ship codebook ) .
Nine days later , the German light cruiser Magdeburg ran aground off the Estonian coast and was abruptly scuttled as the Russians closed in on the frantic German crew .
Though the Germans had endeavored to destroy all of them , the Russians recovered one of the warship 's Signalbucher der Kaiserlichen Marine ( signal / codebooks of the Imperial Navy ) .
The Russians immediately ferried the book to the British , it being personally handed to the then Lord of the Admiralty , Winston Churchill .
In October of that same year , the British sunk four torpedo boats off the coast of the Netherlands that had been heading to mine the mouth of the Thames and the southern coastal waters in Britain .
A month later a British fishing trawler netted a captain 's safe that had been tossed over the side of the " S119 , " the torpedo squadron 's flagship , by Captain Theile , who had been commanding the group at the time .
It contained a German Verkehrsbuch , containing the code the Germans used to communicate with flag officers , naval attaches , warships and diplomatic missions , particularly overseas embassies .
Of course , these three codebooks provided the core of early signals intelligence developed by " Room 40 , " the British code - breaking operation that would decades later become Bletchley Park 's famous ( or infamous ) Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) .
Throughout the war , and in a development that would be negligently repeated three decades later , Germany reviewed the security of its communications practices , including the potential loss of codebooks , but failed to find fault , even while specifically noting the fact that some codebooks had been unaccounted for .
Room 40 had partially broken " Code 0075 " in which the two cable bound copies of the Zimmermann telegram were enciphered .
Possessing two copies enciphered at different times helped them piece together the gaps their incomplete break of Code 0075 had left open .
Despite this , using the telegram was a problem .
Code 0075 was yielding a great deal of intelligence and tipping the Germans off that it was broken would mean starting over .
Equally , it was n't entirely clear that the Germans ( or the Americans or the Swedes ) were aware that American and Swedish cable traffic was being intercepted .
A bit of plausible deniability was required .
Admiral William Hall , then Director of Naval Intelligence and head of Room 40 came up with the answer .
A spy in the Mexico City telegraph office provided the British with the ciphertext copy of the telegram that had been destined for the German Embassy and sent from the German embassy in Washington .
The date on this telegram , moreover , was different from the others , making it possible for the Germans to pinpoint which version had been intercepted .
Finally , this version was enciphered with " Code 13040 , " which had been in use since 1907 and was almost completely broken by the British .
These circumstances permitted the British to reproduce exactly the original text of the Mexico City version and thereby make it apparent that the plaintext itself had been betrayed , rather that the cables or Germany 's codes .
The ruse worked brilliantly .
From a post - incident German report :
Finally , it is definitely improbable that the American government possesses code 13040 , for then the text of the Mexico dispatch would certainly have been made public with the serial number and notations " decipher yourself ' and " acknowledge receipt , " as well as with the serial number of the Washington embassy and the signature of Count Bernstorff , because in so doing its genuineness would have been made even more believable from the very beginning .
Further , it should be borne in mind that code 13040 has been used for many secret messages , among them for an exchange of telegrams between Mexico and New York regarding the delivery of equipment for the wireless receiving station in Mexico .
It can be assumed that if the American government knew of these telegrams , they would have now made them public .
It is more probable that the text of the Mexico dispatch was betrayed .
It was this bit of extra work , after the intelligence discovery , that obscured the tracks of the sources and methods of Room 40 , even protecting the human source at the Mexico City telegraph office , who had only seen the encoded text .
But then , it was such an innocent era :
It should be clearly emphasized that for all officials on whom suspicion could fall from this point on , the best evidence is given by their superiors as well as that officials who have been interviewed declare it to be out of the question that one of their colleagues could have committed such an act .
Rumors of War
The United States was in no mood for war in 1917 .
President Wilson 's name is most often encountered in proximity to the word " neutralist " during this period , and the American public ( a constituency whose consent was far more essential to war mongering than the populations of the European states of the day ) had no taste for what founding father Washington famously termed " foreign entanglements . "
Wilson , in fact , had recently won reelection under the slogan " He kept us out of war . "
Despite Britain 's ceaseless urgings for American involvement , it would be difficult to identify a victorious presidential candidate with a stronger anti-war record , though admittedly Wilson did n't have access to predator drones in 1917 .
Germany had begun unrestricted submarine warfare in February and had managed to kill a number of American citizens aboard British flagged passenger vessels targeted by the Germans .
When the British shared the content of the telegram with the United States Embassy in Britain it was regarded at first with skepticism .
Eventually , however , such sympathetic feelings for Germany as still existed among the United States Diplomatic corps and the White House quickly faded .
For a period it was believed in some circles that the telegram was a fake developed by British intelligence to pull the United States into the war .
Shockingly , Zimmermann himself actually and publicly admitted authorship not once but twice in March 1917 .
The forgery rumors died in the womb .
It will be seen that the operational security ( hereinafter " OPSEC " ) practices of the British were in almost all cases superior to those employed by the Germans .
Zimmermann is perhaps the most obviously careless in this respect , but in the end the British were simply more sophisticated about these things than the Germans .
This , perhaps more than anything , solidified the impact of the Zimmermann telegram and prevented it from scuttling other intelligence operations , sources and methods .
As a result , by the end of March Wilson was demanding authorization from Congress to arm ships against German submarine forces , and on April 2nd to declare war on Germany .
Congress complied on April 6 , 1917 .
Certainly , the sinking of a number of American vessels played a part , but outrage that American communications channels were shamelessly used to plot against the United States played a major role in turning the tide of sentiment once the telegram was deemed authentic .
High Tension Cables II
It will be observed that a lot of bother surrounds efforts to , paraphrasing Henry Lewis Stimson , " read other gentlemen 's mail . "
Of particular interest are a sovereign 's communications with itself .
That is , the peripheral nervous system of states , signaling the arms , hands and fingers of the sovereign 's body , in other words the diplomatic corps .
These channels are highly sensitive because they convey the most precious intelligence : intentions .
The gravity of the Zimmermann telegram was so significant precisely because it exposed the intentions of the German Empire so starkly , and lifted the suspension of disbelief that plagued the politics of the United States , but such communications need not be as dramatic as the Zimmermann telegram to do real damage .
On November 4 , 1979 , " Iranian militants " seized the Embassy of the United States in Tehran .
The Americans were taken almost completely by surprise .
President Carter penned in " Keeping Faith : Memoirs of a President , " that a CIA analyst report from August 1978 indicated that the country " …is not in a revolutionary or even a pre-revolutionary situation . "
Consequently , the Iranians managed to capture the American Embassy along with whatever was in it .
Like Germans racing to scuttle a ship run aground , the Americans had endeavored to shred as many sensitive documents as possible , but the low - budget , simple strip - cut machines they employed were no match for thousands upon thousands of man hours available to the Ayatollahs in the form of former students gripped by the excitement and to - do of revolution , and idle Iranian woman who otherwise would have been weaving Persian carpets .
Thousands of shredded documents from the State Department , Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency were painstakingly pieced together from the strip - cut confetti , assembled , and released together with those documents there had been no time to destroy as a 54 volume set entitled " Asnad - i lanih - 'i Jasusi " ( " Documents from the US Espionage Den " ) and published in 1982 .
Subsequent releases , under a cover page reading " In the name of Allah the most Compassionate and Merciful , " have boosted the volume count to over 70 .
The entire set can be purchased in the United States for $ 400 or so .
Says one retailer :
Each volume contains original documents along with Farsi translations and , for no extra charge , an inflammatory introductory essay .
For instance :
At the beginning , England in order to expand its satanic domination , under the pretext of " efforts to establish a national Jewish government " along with the Zionists proceed to occupy a section of the lands belonging to Muslims .
In reality , they established a base in the heart of the Islamic home land from which all satanic forces of the world could struggle against Islam and attack the Muslims or weaken the Islamic world through their plots and deception .
Basically , the main motive for the foundation of the racist Zionist regime was confrontation with Islam , for if Muslims achieve unity , they will undermine world arrogance .
This is why Imam considers The Day of Qods as the day of Islam .
As the universal domination of England declined , a more power friend and ally , American imperialism , came to the help of Israel .
The seemingly endless flow of American military and economical aid , increasingly encourage this small entity to instigate new plots and disasters everyday . [...]
In general , America monitors and directs the line of events in the Middle East so the Zionist , racist elite which form the criminal government hierarchy of Israel can control the events of the region in all aspects and implement any plot and conspiracy they choose with the aid of the Great Satan . [...]
- Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam
It is difficult not to be disappointed in a movement with enough acumen to seize a country from the U.S. backed Shah ( yes , yes , albeit during the Carter administration , we know , we know ) even under the very noses of the Sazeman-e Ettela 'at va Amniyat-e Keshvar ( SAVAK ) but somehow possessed of such weak propaganda skills that they were not better able to capitalize on the what was supposed to be the knockout intelligence find of the century .
Oddly , the releases , often in random order or with documents missing pages entirely , have been mostly ignored by the public and the press .
While it is possible to point to the obvious bias and agenda driving the releases , if one thing can be said for the " Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam , " it is that they are not remotely shy about disclosing their predispositions up front .
In reality , while the Iranians had assumed , or been led to believe by the Ayatollahs , that the Embassy of the United States was a charged nerve center of nefarious and cunning espionage , dedicated to the destruction of the revolution and the restoration to power of the hated Shah , they were likely giving the United States far too much credit .
In retrospect it is difficult to imagine that any agency , least of all an intelligence agency or one with any foreign policy responsibility , would have been described as " cunning " during the Carter administration .
Indeed , researchers and authors including the likes of Mark Bowden suggest that what intelligence capabilities the Embassy in Iran possessed were routine , ineffectual and otherwise flaccid .
This position is somewhat difficult to disagree with given the massive width and consuming black depths of the abyssal trench that separated America from the reality on the ground in the Iran of 1979 .
Bowden in particular cites the fact that none of the three CIA agents eventually held along with the other American hostages in Iran even spoke Farsi .
Though much was made politically of the find ( " The the greatest loss of classified information since World War II " is the most common superlative , likely a reference to the capture of a large archive of Soviet documents at Smolensk by the German Army in 1941 that were then captured again by the Americans ) , browsing through the texts in Documents from the US Espionage Den reveals far more tedium than scandal .
To wit :
September 2 , 1979 L. Paul Bremer III , Esquire
Deputy Executive Secretary
Department of State Dear Jerry : I have been very busy lately and I 'm a bit behind on my correspondence .
You 've been having your hands full moving into a new job , too , I suppose .
I hope Francie and the kids are settling in all right .
Sharon , I gather from her letters , is beginning to pace a bit in Michigan ; if she can't come out here fairly soon , she will move to Washington when school is out next year .
Do n't say it : you told me so .
Things are quire exciting in Tehran .
Not surprisingly .
I am spending about 85 % of my time helping American businessmen distinguish between revolutionary rhetorical form and back - to - business substance .
The Khomeini crowd really seem to want to get people back to work and they are willing to take the necessary steps ( and make the necessary compromises in revolutionary terms ) to do it if Americans will modify contracts to reflect the changes wrought by the revolution .
I 've had some successes , and my problem most often is to convince some of the American players that if they come out here to talk , they wo n't go up against a wall .
The Zimmermann telegram it is not .
Despite the presence of much tedium and toil , since it seems clear that the Iranians were at least somewhat selective about what they published , it is unusual that , if more damaging material existed , it did not somehow find its way into the published documents .
The " most damaging " material was generally archive analysis housed in Iran but generated outside the country and pertaining to Israel , Saudi Arabia and the like .
Though Iran was something of a regional center for United States intelligence ( unsurprising given the close relationship America maintained with the Shah at the time ) even these documents lack the sort of punch one would expect from such a cache today .
Consider the sorts of revelations that are often touted as the most significant as revealed by the documents :
The United States spies on Israel .
It is difficult to imagine anyone so naive , even in a year that saw Blondie 's " Dreaming " on Billboard 's Top 40 , as to imagine that the United States ( or any sovereign ) failed to spy on allies .
Soviet Oil Production was Over Reported in the 1970s .
No !
Get out !
None of this is to say that no damage was done .
Indeed at least one American intelligence source was apparently executed in response to the disclosures , but to a neophyte - laden regime with little experience in statecraft or intelligence analysis , and in an era where public understanding of intelligence and the product of the modern intelligence analyst was only beginning to mature , the collection was a much more dramatic find in terms of its novelty and propaganda value .
It is this last point that is controlling , and that plays a large part in the remainder of our literary expedition .
The real potential for harm ( or opportunity for gain ) following revealing and novel intelligence " disclosures " is tied to the attention and sensation of the novelty .
Imagining that the United States , for example , never spies on the United Kingdom , historically one of its most steadfast allies , seems a quaint and naive fantasy to anyone even remotely versed in the field .
Certainly , MI5 would not find such a revelation even remotely shocking .
Instead it is the horrified public reaction and the indignant horror expressed by the Fourth Estate in response to such revelations that drives the " I am shocked , shocked to find that espionage is going on in here ! " reaction .
Embarrassing revelations call for outraged reactions by shocked politicians .
The public expects nothing less than blood , no matter what Stewart Baker says .
Even the most lowly ranking fool in the Department of State is aware that the United States thinks and ( when it thinks no one is listening ) says unflattering things about friends , allies and enemies .
That same fool still must profess shock and awe at their revelation , or risk exposing the ugly truth that sovereigns spy on each other to an American public very attached to its willful blindness when it comes to intelligence matters .
The greatest crime in U.S. Intelligence is not missing a call .
The greatest crime in U.S. Intelligence is drawing the public , kicking and screaming , into the realization that nation states are driven by self - preservation , rather than the need to be some altruistic clearing house for the export of surplus grain , foreign aid and the American Dream of Homeonwership™ .
Understanding these implications requires of the individual some rather dramatic hypotheticals .
For instance , imagine for a moment that a live audio stream of your inner monologue has been fed non -stop to your friends ( and enemies ) for the last two months .
Try that on for size briefly .
Imagine all your silent , mental critiques of Polly 's new dress , revealed .
The sneering " I bet I know why she 's with him " thought that bubbled up from your id uncontrollably ( even if it was ultimately , if barely , suppressed by the superego ) transcribed and sent out to a wide email distribution list .
Almost certainly even your closest friends ( if you had any left ) would be enraged by your inner monologue .
These silent offenses are not unique .
They are pervasive .
They are commonplace enough that 110 minute feature films about lawyers unable for some supernatural reason to lie command tens of millions in production financing .
This truth is , however , caustic to the charming fantasy entertained by citizens ( and some subjects ) that their government is always on the side of right .
Toil in this morass of sticky denial at your peril .
And this brings us to the focus of our attentions today .
Modern Intelligence Agencies
Specifically : Wikileaks .
To wit :
WikiLeaks is a multi-jurisdictional public service designed to protect whistleblowers , journalists and activists who have sensitive materials to communicate to the public .
Since July 2007 , we have worked across the globe to obtain , publish and defend such materials , and , also , to fight in the legal and political spheres for the broader principles on which our work is based : the integrity of our common historical record and the rights of all peoples to create new history .
We believe that transparency in government activities leads to reduced corruption , better government and stronger democracies .
All governments can benefit from increased scrutiny by the world community , as well as their own people .
We believe this scrutiny requires information .
Historically that information has been costly - in terms of human life and human rights .
But with technological advances - the internet , and cryptography - the risks of conveying important information can be lowered .
On the strength of this text it is a tall order for even the most casual libertarian to label Wikileaks anything other than " a good thing " ™ .
On paper the organization meets all the core value tests one expects of libertarian endeavors .
A clearing house for otherwise suppressed information .
A safe harbor for whistleblowers , with an audience characterized primarily by their self - imposed captivity .
Possessed of a lapidary respect for anonymity , and dedicated to its preservation .
All of this is not to mention a well developed sense of contempt for the complete failure of the modern Fourth Estate to hold up its commitment to the citizenry .
Despite this , Wikileaks was not without its rocky beginnings .
Deliciously irreverent liberator of secret documents , John Young , founder of the tireless and unrelenting Wikileaks predecessor Cryptome , naturally , an early supporter and advisory board member of Wikileaks , turned on the organization early on .
Said Wired of the break :
... in January 2007 , John Young , a member of the Wikileaks advisory board and the founder of cryptome.org , an online depot for leaked documents , corporate rumors and government conspiracies , left Wikileaks , accusing the group of being a CIA conduit .
After the split , he published over 150 pages of emails sent by members of Wikileaks on cryptome.org .
The emails ( some of which have been since redacted to remove list member names that were in the original disclosures ) paint an interesting picture :

From : John Young Announcing a $ 5 million fund - raising goal by July will kill this effort .
It
makes WL appear to be a Wall Street scam .
This amount could not be
needed so soon except for suspect purposes .
Soros will kick you out of the office with such over - reaching .
Foundations
are flooded with big talkers making big requests flaunting famous names
and promising spectacular results .
I 'd say the same about the alleged 1.1 million documents ready for
leaking .
Way too many to be believable without evidence .
I do n't believe
the number .
So far , one document , of highly suspect provenance .
Instead , explain what funding needs there are and present a schedule
for their need , avoid generalities and lump sums .
Explain how the funds
will be managed and protected against fraud and theft .
Instead , operate on a shoe - string for a few months , best , for a couple
of years , establish WL bonafides by publishing a credible batch of
documents for testing public feedback and criticism .
Show how to
handle the heat of doubt and condemnation .
Use that to support
fund - raising .
At moment there is no reason to believe WL can deliver on its
promises .
Big talk no action , the skeptics say .
BTW , the biggest crooks brag overmuch of how ethical their operations
are .
Avoid ethical promises , period , they 've been used too often to fleece
victims .
Demonstrate sustained ethical behavior , do n't preach / peddle it .

From : John Young Addendum :
The CIA would be the most likely $ 5 M funder .
Soros is suspected
of being a conduit for black money to dissident groups racketeering
for such payola .
Now it may be that that is the intention of WL because its behavior
so far fits the pattern .
If fleecing the CIA is the purpose , I urge setting a much higher
funding goal , in the $ 100 M range and up .
The US intel agencies
are awash in funds they cannot spend fast enough to keep the
Congressional spigot wide open .
Academics , dissidents , companies ,
spy contractors , other nation 's spy agencies , whole countries , are
falling over themselves to tap into this bountiful flood .
But competition
is fierce , and accusations of deception are raging even as the
fleecers work in concert .
Chinese dissidents -- a brand name among many -- are already
reaping huge benefits from covert funding from the US and from
the PRC , along with others in the former Soviets , in Africa and
South America , inside the US , UK and Europe , in the Middle East
and the Koreas , who know how to double - cross ditzy - rich Dads
and Moms .

Funding / who is on this list .
Date : Date : Sun , 7 Jan 2007 11:47:00 - 0500
Cryptome is publishing the contents of this list , and how I was induced to
serve as US person for registration .
Wikileaks is a fraud :
Fuck your cute hustle and disinformation campaign against legitimate
dissent .
Same old shit , working for the enemy .
According to Young , disagreements over fundraising ( Young was suspicious of Wikileaks ' desire to raise $ 5 million , apparently believing a raise of this size would corrupt the organization , or hinted that it was already corrupt ) and the desire of the site 's operators to remain anonymous ( Young outed almost all of them , proving the point that long - term anonymity for the founders was probably impossible anyway ) caused the rift .
Young and Wikileaks seem to have buried the hatchet since , but it is interesting to observe that , from the beginning , Wikileaks was not quite the opaque organization it aspired to be .
Moreover , Young 's early discourse sheds light on the nature of the organization .
Let us revisit this passage :
Chinese dissidents -- a brand name among many -- are already reaping huge benefits from covert funding from the US and from the PRC , along with others in the former Soviets , in Africa and South America , inside the US , UK and Europe , in the Middle East and the Koreas , who know how to double - cross ditzy - rich Dads and Moms .

Can it be that Wikileaks was insufficiently radical for Young ?
Wikileaks probably enjoyed its most significant publicity boost in response to the release of gun camera footage from an Apache helicopter in Iraq filmed during 2007 action against insurgents that resulted in the severe injury and death of several civilians , including two Reuters employees .
Wikileaks , someone disingenuously in finem respice 's view , labeled the video " Collateral Murder " and became the focus of an eagerly received deluge of comment and controversy on its release along side a shorter , analysis video produced in house by Wikileaks .
The Collateral Murder piece was hardly the first time gruesome gun camera video had made the digital rounds .
In fact , to those familiar with Apache gun camera video the clip appeared remarkably commonplace .
After all , such videos have been floating around since Gulf War I , and have become common menu items in video cafes like YouTube , LiveLeak and Vimeo .
But it was gold for Wikileaks , which was concerned enough about funding , and flexible enough about ethics , back in 2008 to propose selling scoops to the highest bidder , and which was quick to tout its newly found financial success :
Raised > $ 150 K in donations since Mon .
New funding model for journalism : try doing it for a change .
It was probably inevitable that publishing novel Apache gun camera footage should become a profitable endeavor .
Be this it may , and while the concept is abused by defense attorneys everywhere , video footage , and particularly gun camera footage , is devoid of context , is inherently disturbing ( the use of 30 mm cannon in an anti-personnel role on seemingly unaware targets - no matter how hostile - is a tough watch indeed ) and prone to deployment as keen propaganda .
Online video analysis of the sort employed by Wikileaks and the anonymous " technical analysis " producers can show the odd , the bizarre and the absurd .
Wittingly or not , on - screen cues distract attention from the larger picture ( or nearby men with weapons ) and make the obvious obscure .
Is that Turkish Cavalry aboard the famous " peace flotilla ? "
In 2006 an anonymous YouTube user published a widely viewed " technical analysis " of gun camera footage from a Fourth Infantry Division Apache helicopter attacking three armed insurgents north of Baghdad .
The video was cut with a softly European accented voice - over that begins " Those five seconds were all the evidence the Apache crew needed to kill three unarmed men ... " and continues " scientifically " " analyzing " the film via on - screen graphics and stop or slow motion playback to show that the U.S. Army had slaughtered three unarmed Iraqi farmers in cold blood .
Unfortunately for the video's anonymous producers , the raw video from which the video was copy - pasted , taken in 2003 , was also available online , exposing a good deal of selective editing ( including a segment where one of the " farmers " races to unwrap a weapon once the attack begins ) , outright timetable manipulation and generally making something of a mockery of the " technical analysis " the piece proffered .
ABC eventually aired the original video with their own ( far less caustic ) analysis before it slipped once more back into the obscurity of YouTube archive servers - that is until May of this year when , in an absolutely incredible lapse in judgment and diligence , Wikileaks linked to the four year old and discredited " technical analysis " video via its
Twitter stream , claiming :
New video suggests
Apache killed Iraqi farmer ploughing field
To the uninitiated the two videos take a remarkably similar path .
" Suspicious " activity is discovered by the helicopter crew , ground forces or a forward air controller .
Helicopter approaches to evaluate .
Hostile intent or other rules of engagement criteria are tested ( with varying levels of diligence ) .
Authorization to engage is sought by the helicopter crew .
It is granted .
30 mm cannon fire and / or Hellfire missiles are dispatched with gruesome effect .
To the old hand , these videos look similar because all such videos effectively follow the same script .
For the unwashed , however , two common threads of objection tend to emerge .
Firstly , a sense of disproportion seems to offend some sense of fair play .
Second , shock that so little due diligence appears to be performed before military forces open fire .
The impact of the first is not lost on the military .
The always excellent Frontline described the issue , with particular reference to the many videos beginning to emerge of helicopters gunning down individual soldiers , as it confronted the Bush administration in 1991 :
NARRATOR : If the allies were going to close the ring on the Republican Guard , the fighting would have to continue .
But in Washington , Colin Powell was worried that further slaughter would stain the military 's reputation .
Gen. COLIN POWELL : You do n't do unnecessary killing , if it can be avoided .
At some point , you decide you 've accomplished your objectives and you stop .
We owned Kuwait City .
The question was how much additional destruction do we want to inflict upon the Iraqi army that was in the Kuwait theater .
NARRATOR : On the battlefield , Apache gunships designed to destroy tank columns were hunting down individual soldiers .
Colin Powell had once said of the Iraqi army , " First we 're going to cut it off and then we 're going to kill it . "
The Iraqis were not completely cut off , but Powell decided there had been enough killing .
He called Norman Schwarzkopf .
It was 7:00 A.M. in Washington , 3:00 P.M. in the desert .
Gen. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF : Colin said to me , " What are your plans ? "
My response to him was , " We plan to continue to execute the operation and continue to drive towards the sea , east towards the sea . "
And he then said to me , " How long would that take you ? "
And my response to him was , " It will probably take until - it will take until the end of tomorrow .
So we could ceasefire tomorrow evening at dark and we would have completely accomplished the plan . "
NARRATOR : Sitting in the Pentagon , Powell knew this meant another day of killing .
The president had to make a decision .
[ 2:00 P.M. February 27 , 1991 ] Gen. COLIN POWELL : After talking to Schwarzkopf , I went over to the White House .
I took the president through the situation on the ground .
I pointed out that we 're starting to see some scenes that were unpleasant and we were in the window of calling an end to it so that there was not unnecessary additional loss of life on the part of American and coalition forces or on the part of Iraqi youngsters .
Of course , a sense that some invisible line of proportionality has been crossed underlies objections to the brutality shown in these videos .
Certainly , high explosives and tissue do not play together well .
But this too is a bit of naivete at work , specifically , that there is in fact a sort of virtue in affording the enemy a " sporting chance , " rather than taking him by complete surprise , from a safe distance , and with such overwhelming force that he is unlikely to get up again after the first few rounds .
The " sporting chance " approach is entirely incompatible with the fact that the United States public has absolutely no taste for causalities .
Having the low KIA cake and eating it too is an impossibility .
The second inclination , that the rules of engagement fall some distance short of Fifth Amendment due process protections , is equally naive .
Of course , the standard this sort of assumption imposes would require us to call any blue on blue fire " murder . "
Even one of the fatally wounded Reuters reporters knew well enough the danger presented to him by nearby American forces to conceal himself behind a wall as completely as possible while pointing a camera their way .
He was well aware he was in the company of armed insurgents and that counter fire might head his way .
( It did ) .
All this is a long and winding way to point out that there is something about Wikileaks that either intentionally or inadvertently demonstrates , enables and , to a very real extent , preys upon naivete .
Sensationalism as a path to funding ( see e.g. , " Quest for Ratings , " ) is an ever present danger in the journalistic world .
Wikileaks , however , was supposed to be above this sort of rank sell - outism .
Assange himself addressed this question defending against accusations that Wikileaks has shifted from releasing data to editorializing .
Assange starts , ironically enough , by calling the notion " part of the right wing reality distortion field , " and then continues :
... it was our hope , that initially , that because we had vastly more material than we could possibly go through , that if we just put it out there , people would summarize it themselves .
That , very interestingly , did n't happen .
Quite an extraordinary thing ...
Our initial idea was that , look at all those people editing Wikipedia .
Look at all the junk that they are working on .
Surely if you give them a fresh , classified document about the human rights atrocities in Falujia , that the rest of the world has not seen before , that , you know , it 's a secret document .
Surely , all those people that are busy working on articles about history and mathematics and so on , and all those bloggers that are busy pontificating about the abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan and other countries and other human rights disasters who are complaining that they can only respond to the New York Times because they do n't have sources of their own , surely those people will step forward given fresh source material and do something .
No .
It 's all bullshit .
It 's all bullshit .
In fact , people write about things in general , if it is not part of their career , because they want to display their values to their peers who are already in the same group .
Actually , they do n't give a fuck about the material .
That 's the reality .
So very early on we understood from experiences like this that we would have to , at least , give summaries of the material we were releasing .
At least summaries , to get people to pick it up , to get journalists to pick it up , to get them to dig deeper .
And if we did n't have a summary to put the thing in context , it would just fall into the gutter and never been seen again . [...]
In cases where I have understood the material is more complex , or other people in our group have understood that the material is more complex , especially military material which has lots of acronyms , you understand , it is not even enough to do a summary .
You have to do an article , or we have to liaise with other journalists to give the material to them on some sort of exclusive basis or semi-exclusive basis to get them to extract it into easily understandable , human - readable form , otherwise it goes nowhere .
Ah , yes .
The step across the line between summarizing ( to make sure your lazy , stupid audience understands how much more important Wikileaks is than Wikipedia ) and editorializing is all too brief .
But then , one man 's summary is another man 's inflammatory introductory essay , no ?
This sounds to finem respice like code for : " Well , we did n't like the lack of analysis or interest in causes we think people should be interested in so we are going to provide the marketing element for these causes .
Well , not all of these causes , but the causes our readers should be interested in . "
Part of the frustration here seems to be rooted in Assange 's impatience with the public , and the slow pace with which material he regards as important and earth shattering is taken up by the rest of an uncaring and unfeeling internet .
Of course , this is likely tied up in no small part with a desperate need on the part of Wikileaks for attention .
Consider the goals of enabling whistleblowing and engaging in unfettered disclosure when juxtaposed with this 2008 statement by Assange :
Given that Wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories , the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it .
If Assanage was already engaging in selective disclosure and information rationing in 2008 , what does this say about the site 's conduct since then ?
This is also a far cry from the original stated goal of Wikileaks , at least as expressed in its early ( c. 2008 ) " About " pages ( since removed ) :
Wikileaks is completely neutral because it is simply a conduit for the original document and does not pretend to be the author of the propaganda of a vested interest .
But it further increases transparency in that those who make comments and contribute analysis make this readily available with the document but clearly distinguished from it .
Wikileaks will publish original documents that were never crafted to be media statements .
The newsworthiness of that will be in the eye of the beholder rather than in eye of the public figure and the journalist .
The potential of Wikileaks is mass uncensored news .
It may be more cumbersome than an online newspaper ( or not , if you know what you 're looking for ! ) but it 's hard to imagine it being more propagandist than most of the media today .

Modern day sculpture art has definitely evolved greatly from the traditional sculpture as it was understood , for example , in Ancient Greece or Rome .
This evolution is traced in many aspects of the art – from the techniques and materials used to the featured characters and understanding of the esthetics itself .
However , there is still one aspect that remained unchanged throughout the whole history of this fine art , and this is the deep meaningfulness of sculptures .
The showcase of modern creative figurative sculptures is a rich collection , showing all the versatility of the modern sculpture art .
Here you will find humans figures and those of some unbelievable monsters or mutants .
Some of the sculptures are made from traditional clay , but in others artists utilized the most unexpected materials , for example , kitchenware .
However , no matter what they are made from , all of these modern sculptures are interesting , expressive , and creative , of course .

A South Australian Liberal candidate is asking for witnesses to come forward after she alleged that she was assaulted on the campaign trail yesterday .
Jassmine Wood , a candidate for Hindmarsh in Adelaide 's western suburbs , says she was outside a shopping centre with a volunteer when they were approached by two men who were critical of the Liberal Party 's border protection policies .
Ms Wood says the men punched her and her volunteer in the face .
" I got hit in the side of the head .
My campaign volunteer was actually down on the ground with somebody sitting on his chest really hitting him in the face , " she said .
" My poor volunteer who was on his first day of the campaign trail got punched in the face many times . "
Ms Wood says she has given police a description of the men .
Police say they are investigating the incident .
Ms Wood wants witnesses to come forward to help police charge the men responsible .
" One was extremely tall so I 'd estimate about 195 centimetres - that was obviously the violent man , " she said .
" He was also with a friend that was slightly shorter than me so both caucasian , dark hair , one with glasses .
" There was a lot of people watching , there was a lot of people who saw it but unfortunately most people just got in their cars and drove off after the fight had ended so we 're looking for people out there who may have seen what happened so we can actually get some witnesses because we would like to press charges . "
Charges were laid , but later dismissed in court .
Today ( 10 July ) a group of anarchists stages a protest at the South African embassy in Moscow .
Their protest raised a number of issues related to the World Cup and , also , the repression of Abahlali baseMjondolo .
The World Cup finishes on Sunday and the trial of 12 residents of the Kennedy Road settlement begins on Monday .
The 12 were arrested after spontaneous resistance to a state backed attack on the movement was stopped by the police .
Their arrest and the legal process afterwards have been highly politicised by the ANC and the state .
Self defence is no offence .
This afternoon , about 13 hours , the South African Embassy in Moscow , a
small group of anarchists held an unauthorized picket in support of social
activists and residents of informal settlements in South Africa .
Participants unfurled a banner " No to repression against activists in South Africa , " had scattered leaflets in the open windows of the embassy and lit the fireworks .
On the banner was the emblem of the movement represented " Abahlali baseMjondolo " ( " Movement Shack Dwellers " ) - a powerful grass - roots protest movement of the poor in South Africa , which is subjected to repression .
Everyone managed to escape from the scene , and a banner left at the neck of
a perturbed police officer .
Text of leaflet :
No to repressions !
STOP REPRESSIONS !!!
No to repressions !!!
STOP
REPRESSIONS !!!
We do this action in order to express solidarity with all oppressed people
in South Africa !
Since the residents of informal settlements , are being
evicted in the transit camps « Blikkiesdorp » , with informal traders , who
at the request of FIFA banned the trade during the World Cup in the tourist
areas .
We express our solidarity with those whose voices are silenced and
silenced in the modern " democratic " South Africa - a movement " Abahlali
baseMjondolo " in Durban , which in September 2009 and underwent a planned
attack in the settlement , " Kennedy road " .
We see how , after coming to power of the African National Congress , the
majority black population continues to live on the brink of
poverty .
Deportations to concentration camps , the demolition of informal
settlements , forcing the poor as a class outside of the cities that are
intended elites should be a place of residence of the rich and the cradle
of their capital - that is what the ANC offers for their citizens who
fought for many years against apartheid and received in return a new
system of exploitation and oppression .
We want to remind the Government of South Africa that the whole world looks
up to you !
As a long time ago , we express our protest , and his anger
policies of oppression and domination in the poorest residents of South
Africa .

1 1/2 cups toasted pecan halves
80g butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1/2 cup light corn syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla essence
Begin by preheating your oven to 180 °C and spread all your pecans for the recipe in one layer on an oven tray .
Keep an eye on them and give them a shake at around 2 minutes .
Once they ’re fragrant and sizzling , remove them and allow to cool slightly .
Take 2/3 of a cup and grind them in a blender or food processor .
If you have a food processor , you can simply add the butter , salt and flour , pulse together – then add the cold water and pulse until it forms a ball .
I only had a blender , so I combined the flour , salt , butter and ground pecans in a bowl , combining into a crumb consistency by hand .
I then added the water , stirred it together and kneaded it a little by hand to get it to the right consistency .
I had to add a little more water , but I think I ’d been generous with the pecans .
Form the dough into a ball , wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes .
Preheat the oven to 200°C .
Flour a surface and roll out your dough the best you can into a quarter inch thick round .
The dough is very crumbly though and hard to keep together , just grab pieces of it and push it into a medium sized pie / tart tin until it evenly covers the base and sizes without any holes .
Prick the pastry several times with a fork to prevent it from rising and place in the oven for 15 minutes , watching that it does n’t brown too much ( mine stayed pretty much speckled white for the entire cooking process ) .
When you remove it from the oven , reduce the temperature to 150°C
While the tin is in the oven , melt the butter for the filling in a medium saucepan and remove from the heat .
Using a whisk , combine the butter with the salt and sugars ( not the syrup yet ) until it forms an even paste .
Add one egg at a time , whisking it together .
Add the vanilla and corn syrup ( tricky , you may need several spoons ) and continue to whisk until it ’s all combined .
Return the saucepan to a low heat and continue whisking constantly to avoid the eggs scrambling at the bottom of the pan .
After about 5 minutes , the mixture should become hot and glossy at which point you remove it from the heat .
If you notice any bits of egg floating around , you can strain the mixture into a bowl before stirring in the rest of the pecans .
Place the hot crust on a flat , level surface and pour the filling in until it ’s just full .
Place in the oven for 45 - 50 minutes .
During the cooking process , the filling will rise – though once cooled , it fill flatten again so do n’t let it worry you .
In my opinion , it tastes best after a night in the fridge – though you can enjoy it warm after an hour of cooling .
Enjoy !
Marijuana Busts : ‘ Where The Money Is ’ For Police
Marijuana is certainly not the most pressing crime problem in the United States — but local police departments , with chronic budget shortfalls , are concentrating more on pot busts than ever before , because “ it ’s where the money is , ” according to one California sheriff .
In an era when law enforcement has been forced to lay off staff , reduce patrols and even release jail inmates , officers have found that going after marijuana growers and smokers makes them eligible for hefty federal anti-drug grants , reports Justin Scheck at The Wall Street Journal .
Shasta County Sheriff
Tom Bosenko said his department is eligible for roughly half a million dollars a year in federal anti-drug funding .
The only problem is , most of the money has to be used to fight pot as part of the multi-agency , federally funded Campaign Against Marijuana Planting ( CAMP ) .
The federal government has , for a long time , allocated money to help local communities fight crime , and influencing their law enforcement priorities in the process .
The budget squeezes in today ’s weak economy has only enhanced this effect , which has become especially noticeable in California , where many or even most residents take a tolerant attitude towards marijuana , but federal dollars force local law enforcement to focus on it .
To make sure Shasta County gets the federal grants , Sheriff Bosenko has spent about $ 340,000 of his department ’s shrinking budget — more than in past years — on a team whose sole duty is to traipse through the woods looking for pot plants .
Though the squad is mostly federally funded , the grants do n’t cover some basic needs and equipment — so the Sheriff has to pay for those out of his regular budget , to make the department eligible for the big bucks .
Other crimes — like robbery and driving while drunk — may have a much larger impact on local communities than pot growing , the Sheriff admits .
But those infractions do n’t have fat federal grants attached to them .
Marijuana does .
According to the sheriff , the anti-pot money is “ $ 340,000 I could use somewhere else in my organization .
That could fund three officers ’ salaries and benefits , and we could have them out on our streets doing patrol , ” Bosenko said .
“ These so - called ‘ eradication ’ efforts have had zero effect on marijuana use , availability , or price , but once again , California law enforcement agencies are perfectly content to throw more tax money down the CAMP rabbit hole , ” said Aaron Smith , California policy director for the Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP ) .
In addition to the $ 3.6 billion being spent by the U.S. Justice Department this year , augmenting budgets of state and local law enforcement , the federal government set aside last year almost $ 4 billion in additional economic stimulus package funds .
The White House is also spending about $ 239 million in 2010 to fund local “ drug trafficking task forces ” — which , in the real world , usually means local cops dressing up like Rambo and tramping about in the woods in a wasteful , quixotic and doomed attempt to stop the burgeoning marijuana industry .
“ It ’s time to stop this insanity of repeating the futile exercise of CAMP and instead replace marijuana prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation , ” Smith said .
“ Only then will we be able to eliminate the clandestine marijuana plantations — just as the repeal of alcohol prohibition did away with the bootleggers of that era . ”
“ It ’s no coincidence that drug cartels do n’t plant vineyards or hops fields in our national forests , ” Smith added .

What is it ?
Why , the Motorola Droid Shadow .

Based on previous information about the handset , we already know it 'll be Motorola 's second Droid , and will be exclusive to Verizon .
It 'll have an 8 MP camera ( capable of shooting 720 p video ) , a 4.3 - inch screen , and will no doubt be running Android Froyo when it 's released June / July .

CubeSat pioneer Bob Twiggs is now working on 5 - cm cubes that can do big science in space .
Whenit comes to laptop computers and cell phones , bigger is n?t better .
The samelogic applies to satellites : the bulkier the satellite , the more time it takesto design and build , and the more expensive it is to put into orbit .
Researchersare now taking advantage of the electronics technologies that have madepersonal gizmos compact and affordable to make satellites that weigh and cost afraction of their predecessors .
These pocket - and backpack - sized satellites arechanging the way astrobiologyresearch is done .
Conventionalsatellites used for communications , navigation or research can be as large as aschool bus and weigh between 100 and 500 kilograms .
Universities , companies and NASA are now building small satellites that weigh less than one kilogram ( picosatellites ) or up to 10 kilograms ( nanosatellites ) .
Thesesmallsatellites can be considered miniature versions of full - size counterparts .
They contain the same components ?
battery , orbital control and positioningsystems , radio communication systems , and analytical instruments ?
excepteverything is smaller , less expensive and sometimes less complicated .
? That ?
sthe beauty of this technology , ? says Orlando Santos , an astrobiologist at NASAAmes Research Center .
?
We can make these things small and still get meaningfulscience out of them .?
TheRise of the Cube
Twodecades ago , Bob Twiggs and his students at Stanford University developed thefirst picosatellite the size of a Klondike ice cream bar .
The AerospaceCorporation launched these picosatellites as part of a mission to demonstratethe feasibility of building little satellites that communicate with each other .
Twiggsthen worked on CubeSat , a 10 - centimeter cube .
?
I got a 4 - inch beanie baby boxand tacked on some solar cells to see how many would fit on the surface , ?
Twiggs says .
?
I had enough voltage for what I needed so I decided that would bethe size .?
JordiPuig - Suari at California Polytechnic State University built a deploymentmechanism called the poly picosatellite orbital deployer , or P - POD , that couldpack up to three CubeSats .
One of these is typically the satellite bus , the brains of the satellitecontaining positioning and radio equipment , while the other cubes carry thescientific experiments .
In 2004 , the researchers sent the first three - cubenanosatellite into orbit .
Sixyears later , CubeSats have become the world - wide standard for small satellites .
They are being used for everything from environmental sensing and fundamentalbiology research to testing new spaceflight systems .
Over60 universities and high schools are part of the CubeSat Project based at CalPoly .
The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Air Force have programs thatfunds CubeSats for atmospheric and spaceweather research .
Aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeinghave also built and flown CubeSats .
Kentucky - basedNanoRacks LLC provides a platform to take CubeSat experiments as cargo aboardthe Space Shuttles to the International Space Station for periods of 30 or 60 days , after which they bring the cubes back .
Thegoal of NASA ?s new CubeSatLaunch Initiative isto radically open up the flight opportunities for nanosatellites .
ThisInitiative shouldalso make it easier for universities to compete for launch access on NASAlaunch vehicles .
Thereare probably between 35 and 40 small satellites orbiting the Earth right now , of which about a quarter might still be working , says Twiggs , now a professorat Morehead State University ?s
Space Science Center in Kentucky .
CuttingCosts
Thebiggest advantage of nano - and pico- satellites is that they are a bargain .
Mostof the cost saving comes at the launch stage .
Unlike conventional satellites , they don?t need a dedicated launch vehicle where they are the primary payload .?
They ?re so small they can hitch a ride on somebody else ?s rocket , ?
Santos says .
NASA ? snanosatellite missions cost $ 2 million apiece as opposed to the tens ofmillions needed for a conventional satellite .
Theiraffordability also comes from being built with off - the - shelf electronic circuitchips such as microprocessors and radio frequency transmitters and receivers .
These are the same components that are inside smart phones , hand - held GlobalPositioning System units , and digital cameras .
Infact , the miniaturization of electronics has been the driving force behindsmall satellite technology , making it affordable , says Twiggs .
?
Electronicstoday are much more power - efficient than electronics of the past ; that helpsus , ? he says .
?
Ten or fifteen years ago we could n?t have found the componentsfor the price that we could ?ve afforded .?
Smallsatellites should n?t add to the problem of space debris since they arerelatively easy to deorbit .
NASA ?s upcoming nanosatellite mission , Organism / Organic Exposure to Orbital Stresses ( O/ OREOS ) , will have a sailpacked into it that will be deployed at the end of the mission .
? Itincreases the satellite ?s surface area and speeds up its fall to Earth , ?
Santossays . ?
It ?s so small it ?ll burn up soon as it enters the atmosphere .?
[ O/ OREOSmission up close . ]
Thelow cost and relatively quick turnaround time of a few months makesnanosatellites invaluable from an education perspective .
Students and youngengineers get to participate in a project from the initial paper design tobuilding and testing to the eventual launch .
This gives next - generationscientists hands - on experience in development , management and mission training .
Astrobiologyin Miniature
ForNASA , low - cost nanosatellites are an ideal platform for science and technology , including fundamental biology and astrobiology research .
? Astrobiologyis ripe for the use of small satellites , ? says Jason Crusan , chief technologistfor space operations at NASA headquarters in Washington , D.C. Performing alarge number of experiments is best for studying biological processes .
?
If youcan increase your flight frequency then you increase the number of experimentsyou need to do but you need a lower - cost solution like nanosatellites to do this .?
Besides , unlike astronomy , experiments for astrobiology lend themselves tominiaturization .
This is due to advances in microfluidics technologies and theminiaturization of optical detection instruments .
For instance , thespectrometer on O/ OREOS is the size of a candy bar .
Santossays that there is an intense interest in astrobiology and life sciences togain access to interplanetary conditions above low - Earth orbit .
That ?s whereyou can study how living organisms and life - related compounds are affected bythe cosmic radiation above the Earth ?s protective atmosphere and by reducedgravity .
?
That ?s how we can study the big questions in astrobiology , ?
he says .?
What happens when we go to space ?
Or are we carrying microorganisms that maycontaminate science experiments ??
Sofar , NASA has launched two nanosatellites into low - Earth orbit between 450 and 550 kilometers above the surface .
GeneSat , which was launched in December 2006 , studied the effects of space on bacteria , while PharmaSat , which went up in May2009 , investigated the effects of antifungal agents on yeast growth in space .
The O/ OREOS satellite , which will be launched late this year into 650 - kilometerorbit , will study the effects of a larger array of space conditions on microbesand important biological compounds .
Inthe future , nanosatellites may allow experiments to reach beyond low - Earthorbit .
They could go into lunar orbit or into solar orbit halfway between the Earth and Venus , or one day even land on the moon .
Envoys of CubeSats that havemore smarts and a built - in thrust mechanism might even be sent out to explorevast swaths of our solar system and beyond .
? Orbitingother planets or landing on the surface , these nano - explorers could search forcompounds that signal the existence of life , communicating their findings witheach other and with controllers on Earth .
Twiggsis now working with researchers at the University of Rome on pocket - sized5 - centimeter cubes .
Because these are an eighth of the volume of regularCubeSats , Twiggs hopes they will cost that much less .
The team is planning tolaunch eight of these pocket cubes packed inside a launcher on a Russianballistic missile by spring of 2011 .
Nano - and picosatellites will not replace their larger cousins ?
there are certainexperiments that cannot be miniaturized or that need more power and hence morearea for solar panels and antennae .
? Everybodydoesn?t drive a little teeny car , there are big trucks to carry things around , ?Twiggs says .?
Instead , small satellites should open up a new way to do researchand education , proving that good things can come in small packages .

For some reason this cheap photoshop gimmick never seems to get any less hilarious .
Saved some hilarious ones of your own ?
Post them please !
If you liked Inception , and especially if you liked the music , take 1 minute and watch / listen to this .
It ’s impressive .
When it comes to spending cuts , Congress is looking in the wrong place .
Most federal nondefense spending , other than Social Security and Medicare , is now done through special tax rules rather than by direct cash outlays .
The rules are used to subsidize a wide range of spending including education , child care , health insurance , and a myriad of other congressional favorites .
These tax rules — because they result in the loss of revenue that would otherwise be collected by the government — are equivalent to direct government expenditures .
That 's why tax and budget experts refer to them as " tax expenditures . "
This year tax expenditures will raise the federal deficit by about $ 1 trillion , according to estimates by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation .
If Congress is serious about cutting government spending , it has to go after many of them ....
If tax expenditures are not cut , taxes on households and businesses will have to rise to prevent an explosion of the national debt , which is now projected to increase to 90 % of GDP by 2020 from today 's 63 % .
When benefits for Social Security and Medicare are set aside , the rest of the outlay side of the budget is too small — 7.5 % of GDP — to provide much scope for reducing annual budget deficits that are now projected to average 5 % of GDP for the rest of this decade .
In contrast , total tax expenditures are now 6.4 % of GDP .

In a sign that the Obama Administration is unwilling to associate it self with the “ Tea Party = Racism ” discussion that the NAACP started last week , Vice - President Biden said this morning that he did not believe it was true :
“ Do you think elements of the Tea Party are racist ? ” This Week anchor Jake Tapper asked Vice President Joe Biden in an EXCLUSIVE interview .
Biden equivocated at first , but then settled on a pretty firm no .
“ Well , the truth is that at least elements that were involved in some of the Tea Party folks expressed racist views , ” he said .
“ I would n’t characterize the Tea Party as racist .
There are individuals who are either members of or on the periphery of some of their things , their — their protests — that have expressed really unfortunate comments .
(…)
“ I do n’t believe , the president does n’t believe that the Tea Party is — is a racist organization .
I do n’t believe that , ” Biden said .
“ Very conservative .
Very different views on government and a whole lot of things .
But it is not a racist organization . ”

On his MSNBC program Countdown tonight , host Keith Olbermann used his nightly Tea Time segment to blast Sarah Palin ’s big solution to the Gulf oil spill , prayer .
Olbermann said , “ Well There you have it .
A Palin presidency preview in microcosm , something bad happened , do n’t worry , God will fix it . ”
Here is the video courtesy of MSNBC :

Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Olbermann went off on Palin ’s call for prayer to repair the Gulf oil spill , “ back to sister Sarah herself .
She has a solution for the Gulf , pray , baby , pray .
Gulf disaster needs divine intervention as man ’s efforts have been futile .
Gulf lawmakers designate today of prayer for solution / miracle .
Well , there you have it , a Palin presidency preview in microcosm .
Something bad happened , do n’t worry , God will fix it .
A quick miracle and presto chango the oil stops .
He continued , “ We should even have the department of homeland miracles also .
If you want to point the to success of prayer in your own life , I wo n’t argue with you , but I think even Billy Graham would admit that relying on honest to goodness structural miracles , fires stopping themselves , buildings falling up , 100,000 barrel a day oil cataclysm sealing themselves , that ’s pretty poor public policy .
Who am I to criticize Mrs. Palin ?
As an Awr Hawkins writes at Human Events , “ Liberals hate Palin because she ’s beautiful .
They despise her , he writes ; beauty pushes them over to the edge to know she does n’t just shoot an assault rifle but makes it look good when shooting it . ”
Even Rich Lowrie can see where this one is going .
This was obvious when she was running for vice president on the McCain ticket and it became known she had had taken part in beauty pageants to get money to pay college tuition .
How dare her she ’s not only beautiful , but she used that beauty for profit ?
Oh , no , Mr. Awr Hawkins , you did n’t just write she used that beauty for profit , did you ? ”
Olbermann then tackled the fantasy that the Left is afraid if Palin , “ We just need to remember the left criticizes that which they fear .
We also have it keep in mind that the fact that all the names they throw at Palin are really code words for dang , that woman looks good .
How can I be both honest and gentlemanly about this ?
Okay .
Code words , no , no , they ’re not .
When I say that woman is an idiot , I mean , that woman is an idiot .
I ’ll leave out the gratuitous shots taken at Hillary Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt .
Liberals hate Palin because she ’s beautiful .
It is the climax of Mr. Lowrie ’s fevered review of Mrs. Palin ’s performance at the vice presidential debate .
he wrote about her , Watching her , winking only at him , to wit , this is how the right wants us to pick our leaders , this is their criteria for our women idiot leaders .
I think I might prefer Mrs. Palin ’s idea . ”
If Olbermann really believes that Palin is an idiot , then he is wrong .
To call Palin an idiot is to overlook her skilled victimization and manipulation techniques .
Sarah Palin is no idiot .
She is a blind , closed minded ideologue , but she is not an idiot .
Palin knows how to manipulate the media .
What other pseudo - political figure gets their Facebook posts covered as news ?
Sarah Palin did not suggest prayer because she is stupid .
She did it to appeal to Republican primary voters , who truly believe that all they have left is prayer now that Barack Obama is president .
Olbermann did hit the nail on the head when it comes to what the Right wants out of their female politicians .
They do n’t want strong , independent , intelligent women .
No , they prefer that a woman plays the subservient role that their patriarchal world view requires .
Women politicians are supposed to look good , repeat the talking points , and be objects of male sexual desires .
The Right wants women who will teach other women their place .
Palin is the poster girl for selling out her gender .
Women on the Left do n’t hate for her looks .
They hate her because every time she opens her mouth she sets the cause of women ’s rights back one hundred years .
Compile - time Function Execution in D
This post will describe the basics of a very powerful feature of the D programming language : the Compile - time Function Execution ( CTFE ) , which allows complicated functions to be fully evaluated at compile - time , irrespective of the optimization levels .
C optimizations
If you are an average C programmer , you know that simple code can be trusted to be evaluated at compile - time thanks to optimizers .
For instance , if you write something like :
void square ( int x ) { return x*x ; } void foo ( void ) { int k = square ( 32 ) ; /* ... */ }
you trust your compiler to evaluate the square at compile - time , when optimizations are on .
When things get more hairy :
int factorial ( int x ) { int result = x ; while ( - - x ) result *= x ; return result ; } void foo( void ) { int k = factorial ( 8 ) ; /* ... */ }
C programmers get immediately less confident about what will happen at run-time .
For instance , would you say that your compiler is able to expand the above code at compile - time or not ?
Actually , the answer is “ yes ” in this particular case ( unless you are using a very old compiler ) , but the point is still valid : this is not C code that one would write if he wants to be sure that the whole calculation be folded at compile - time .
There is also another issue : since the language does not mandate that the value is folded ( and in fact , it is not folded when optimizations are disabled ) , you cannot create a constant out of it , such as by assigning it to a const variable .
When things get hairy
Now , let ’s try with a ( very naive and simple ) solution of problem # 1 of Project Euler :
#include < stdio.h > int euler 1 ( int max ) { int i, res=0 ; for ( i=1 ; i<max ; i++ ) { if ( ( i % 3 ) == 0 || ( i % 5 ) == 0 ) res += i ; } return res ; } int main ( ) { int r10 = euler 1 ( 10 ) ; int r1000 = euler 1( 1000 ) ; printf ( " %d %d
" , r10 , r1000 ) ; return 0 ; }
This program simply calculates the sum of all divisors of 3 or 5 below 1000 .
But if you look at the generated code with GCC under - O3 , you will see that the actual results are not computed at compile - time , but rather calculated at runtime .
I believe any average C programmer would agree that we should not expect this code to be folded at compile time .
Now , meet the equivalent D code :
int euler1 ( int max ) { int i, res=0 ; for ( i=1 ; i<max ; i++ ) { if ( ( i % 3 ) == 0 || ( i % 5 ) == 0 ) res += i ; } return res ; } int main ( ) { int r10 = euler 1 ( 10 ) ; int r1000 = euler 1( 1000 ) ; printf ( " %d %d
" , r10 , r1000 ) ; return 0 ; }
Deja-vu ?
Yes , it is exactly the same , barring the initial include statement that is not required ( actually , there is no preprocessor in D and modules refer to each other with the import statement , but printf is a builtin ) .
Of course , the above example was hand - crafted to make it both valid C and D code , but being D an evolution of C , the basic syntax is the same .
Meet CTFE
And now the hattrick : in D , we can request the compiler to evaluate euler1 at compile - time by simply using the static keyword at invocation time :
static int r10 = euler 1 ( 10 ) ; static int r1000 = euler 1( 1000 ) ;
Great , is n’t it ?
Now the result of the above function call are evaluated by the compiler , irrespective of the optimization levels .
If the function can not be evaluated at compile - time ( usually because it has side - effects , like any kind of I/O ) , it will trigger a compile - time error .
We can verify that the above constants really do appear in the generated code by compiling with gdc - save - temps euler1.d and then inspecting euler1.s :
D6euler14mainFZi3r10i : .long 23 .globl _D6euler14mainFZi5r1000i .align 4 .type _D6euler14mainFZi5r1000i , @object .size _D6euler14mainFZi5r1000i , 4 _D6euler14mainFZi5r1000i : .long 233168 .section .rodata .LC0 : .string " %d %d
" .text .globl _Dmain .type _Dmain , @function _Dmain : .LFB3 : pushq %rbp .LCFI3 : movq %rsp , %rbp .LCFI4 : movl _ D6euler14main FZi5r1000 i( %rip ) , %edx movl _ D6euler 14 main FZi3r10i( %rip ) , %esi movl $.LC0 , %edi movl $ 0 , %eax call printf movl $ 0 , %eax leave ret
Notice how the compiler has calculated the values 23 and 233168 ( respectively , results of euler 1 ( 10 ) and euler 1 ( 1000 ) ) and put them in the data section of the executable .
If you are curious of what happens when the compiler cannot do the whole evaluation at compile - time , it is sufficient to stick a printf ( ) call somewhere in the euler ( ) function .
Since printf ( ) does some I/O , it breaks CFTE , and the compiler will happily tell you about that :
euler1.d:9 : Error : cannot evaluate printf ( " hello , world !\x0a " ) at compile time euler1.d:15 : Error : cannot evaluate euler 1 ( 10 ) at compile time euler1.d:16 : Error : cannot evaluate euler1( 1000 ) at compile time
Closing words
CTFE is simple yet very powerful .
The fact that it is triggered at the call site ( rather than being an attribute of the function , like the inline keyword ) is a very smart design choice : it makes perfectly sense for the same function to be used at both run-time and compile - time , depending on the inputs .
For the C++ guys reading , C++0 x has grown a constexpr keyword that , while looking superficially similar , it is a lot less powerful , since it can only be used on very simple functions ( basically , one - liners ) .
In fact , the keyword is meant to be use while declaring a function , and not at the call - site , so it has to apply only on small functions which can be proved to always yield a constant value .

Teaser Site Code Leaks Images Of Motorola Droid 2
Fresh off the launch of the Motorola Droid X , the rumor mill is churning once again and this time we have pictures of Motorola Droid 2 .
No , these are n’t blurry spy shots , but actual and official images of the Motorola Droid 2 .
Basically , one of Engadget ’s readers was simply looking around at the Droid Does site ’s source code and stumbled upon images of the Motorola Droid 2 .
Unfortunately , no specs , pricing , or availability was embedded anywhere else in the source code , but the pictures do look pretty good .
In case you ’re wondering , the latest rumors about the Motorola Droid 2 seem to indicate an August 23 release and I ’m assuming the typical $ 199 on a two year contract from Verizon .
Anyone else holding off on the Motorola Droid X for a Motorola Droid 2 ?
The old saying teaches that one should never get in a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel , so it ’s really no surprise that the media - adverse ways of Nevada Senatorial candidate Sharron
Angle would eventually get her in trouble .
Recently ,
Angle invited members of the media to her first big press event since her primary win .
However , once the event ended and the press tried to ask her questions , Angle bolted .
The news team from NBC4 , feeling jilted , decided to retaliate with a hilarious news report that plays like a dumped girlfriend ’s LiveJournal poetry about her ex-boyfriend .
There ’s just so much to enjoy here .
First , the story itself , retold here by the Las Vegas Sun :
“ It was the first time since her primary victory that she had agreed to mingle with the media .
Political observers speculated it might signal a shift in Angle ’s post - primary strategy of using the media solely as fundraising mechanisms .
Alas ,
Angle ’s more media - friendly moment was over almost as soon as it began .
In the warehouse of a family - owned clean diesel manufacturer in Sparks , Angle delivered a three - minute speech on her desire to permanently repeal the estate tax .
When invited by the final speaker to stay and answer a few questions , she turned on her heel and rushed out a back door with a small cadre of staff members .
Reporters , including one who is six months pregnant , chased after her , calling out questions on unemployment benefits and other topics she has largely refused to address . ”
Of course there was a pregnant reporter chasing her !
Gosh , if we add a British bobby and a woman with huge breasts , we ’ve got the makings of a classic Benny Hill bit .
But next came the report from News 4 which is just as great .
Not having any answers from Angle to fill up the airtime , the reporters instead put together a brilliantly passive aggressive package .
The best part is probably when they go out of their way and get a professor from the University of Nevada , Reno to watch the tape of Angle ’s escape and detail all the reasons it ’s a bad idea not to talk to the press .
This story is , of course , not the first time Angle has gotten chased by pesky reporters who later took her to task in their segment .
Angle ’s team have accused the media of being biased against the candidate throughout the campaign .
It ’s clear now that , if they were n’t before , Angle ’s successfully making that proclamation true .

The defending National League champs have added a third ace to their pitching arsenal .
Roy -Cole - Roy at the top of the rotation .
The Phillies and Houston Astros agreed to a deal that sent pitcher Roy Oswalt to Philly for J.A. Happ and prospects and Oswalt gave the deal his blessing , said ESPN.com 's Jayson Stark .
Oswalt had waived his no -trade clause Thursday .
The official announcement came later in the day .
The 32 - year - old righty joins Roy Halladay and Cole Hamels as part of a 1 - 2 - 3 punch at the top of the Phils ' rotation .
The final stumbling blocks for getting another Roy on the hill for the Phillies were Oswalt waiving his no - trade clause and what compensation he would get for doing so without demanding that his $ 16 million option for 2012 get picked up .
Fox 26 Sports in Houston was one of the first media outlets to report the deal .
They reported late Wednesday night that the Phillies and Astros came to terms on the trade and the Astros have contacted Oswalt .
Since then the web was all a - Twitter with details about the potential move .
The Phillies sent 2009 Rookie - of - the - Year runner - up J.A. Happ , Single - A outfielder Anthony Gose and Single - A shortstop Jonathan Villar to Houston .
The deal remained in limbo as the sides wrangled over who would pay the remainder of the Oswalt 's contract -- he is owed $ 23 million through 2011 .
The Phils wanted the Astros to pay a significant portion of the contract and it seems that the Stros sent some Benjamins along with Oswalt .
Both Oswalt and Happ are scheduled to pitch for their on Friday -- it appears they will be wearing different colors when they take the hill .

SALT LAKE CITY -- A Salt Lake woman , paralyzed in a plane crash 14 years ago , now has a special someone helping her out in a very novel way .
We say novel because this someone is a dog named Tadaki .
Tadaki anticipates things that Kelly sometimes needs before Kelly knows that she needs them .
– Amy Kernan , Wasatch Champions
KSL News first met Kelly 14 years ago , when she was Kelly Crompton .
A plane crash killed her husband and left her seriously injured .
A crushed shoulder , ribs and broken neck bone slowly repaired , but a broken back left her a paraplegic .
Kelly has now remarried and gone on with her life as Kelly Bussio .
Another companion has also joined the family .
" He 's with me more than anybody .
He 's with me more than my husband or my kids or my friends and co-workers , " Kelly said .
" He just makes me smile every day . "
Raised and trained by Canine Companions and Wasatch Champions , Tadaki is unique to say the least .
" These animals read us better than many humans , " explained Amy Kernan , with Wasatch Champions .
" Tadaki anticipates things that Kelly sometimes needs before Kelly knows that she needs them . "
What is ... Wasatch Champions ?
Wasatch Champions is the Utah Chapter for Canine Companions for Independence , a non-profit organization that enhances the lives of people with disabilities by providing , free of charge , highly trained assistance dogs and ongoing support to ensure quality partnerships .
" He actually taught himself to take the garbage out , " Kelly said .
He did so simply by watching her collect and cinch up garbage bags .
" The next day I cinched up the garbage .
He came over and was telling me something , so I said ‘ take it , ' and he trotted through the house , went out and dropped it in front of the garbage can , " Kelly said .
Tadaki turns light switches on and off and drags laundry baskets to the wash room .
He gets things out of the refrigerator and fetches heavier , non-breakable grocery bags from the car .
How about mopping up spills ?
Tadaki does that too .
Tadaki even helps Kelly Bussio pay for her purchases when they go shopping
The dog listens and acts on cue , pulling Kelly 's wheelchair when needed .
At the mall , Tadaki goes shopping with her and moves at a pretty good clip .
" He can pull me through airports like crazy .
People stop and clap for him as we go by , " Kelly said .
In stores , like Victoria 's Secret , Tadaki presents a credit card to the clerk , waits for the sale , picks up the card , then continues pulling his human companion in her wheelchair , sack in mouth .
The limits of what this dog can do may be limited only by our human imagination .
He 's traveled with Kelly from west to east coasts and on a river trip to the Grand Canyon .
If Tadaki has a motto , perhaps it 's " Bring it on ! "
" He makes me cry a lot because I am so grateful , " Kelly said .
Tadaki also helps Kelly at her job .
He delivers papers and documents to other departments and even knows other employees by name .

As much as I like the Berserk anime series , it simply does not compare to its manga counterpart .
Here you will find English Berserk manga scans .
The main reason to continue the Berserk series through the manga is because the anime series ends on such a cliffhanger .
The anime series basically spans the early volumes of Berserk and goes through Volume 12 .
However , Guts journey does not stop just there !
In fact , the Berserk manga is past Volume 31 and still going !
Berserk has been licensed by Dark Horse Comics .

Support Official Release
Berserk manga has been licensed by Dark Horse Comics so please support them !
I am only hosting these manga scans to promote the series in hopes that it will become more popular .
I personally own Dark Horse 's Berserk manga releases and they are very high quality .
They are a bit expensive , but are worth it considering a masterpiece like Berserk is priceless !
Again , I encourage everyone to support Dark Horse Comics .
The response I received from hosting Berserk manga scans has been overwhelming .
Around the year 2000 or 2001 I remember how the entire Internet Berserk community was hoping that Berserk would be released .
Then after it was released either people complained that it was being released too slow or they no longer cared .
I feel that 's the wrong response and I hope anyone who 's ever viewed these manga scans try to support the English release .
I also understand that not everyone is able to afford purchasing the manga ; I 've received hundreds of emails from fans from dozens of different countries that just do n't have the funds to buy them .
One of my fondest memories was receiving manga scan requests from people serving over seas ; certainly these brave men and women do n't have the option to purchase the manga , which is one of the reasons I 'm still hosting it .
These scans are for people who have no other way of reading it .
I encourage everyone who has a way of purchasing the manga to go out and do so .

Manga Scan Information
The manga scans you will find on this site are ones created by fans .
They are not scanned versions of the licensed English versions .
On the topic of licensed manga series , I do host licensed series unlike many sites that take down manga scans when they get licensed .
I feel that showcasing the series actually helps in sales .
I usually do not host entire series ( usually just the beginning or latter volumes ) so people tend to purchase the actual graphic novels when they find out how good they are .
As for the fansubbed manga scans , they are created by manga scanlation groups .
You can get a full list of groups over at Manga Updates .
These groups create these fansubs for the fans - I simply distribute them online .
Within each series you will certainly see information pertaining to the groups that created the manga scans .

Image caption CNN's Octavia Nasr noted Ayatollah Fadlallah 's stances on women 's rights
CNN has sacked a veteran Middle East editor after she wrote on Twitter that she " respected " a late senior Lebanese cleric said to have inspired Hezbollah .
A CNN official said Octavia Nasr was leaving the US TV news network because her credibility had been " compromised " .
Nasr has described her 140 - character remarks about Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , who died on Sunday , as an " error of judgement " .
She said she had been referring to his " pioneering " views on women 's rights .
' Immediate , overwhelming reaction '
Ayatollah Fadlallah , Lebanon 's top Shia Muslim cleric , died at the age of 74 .
He was customarily described as the spiritual leader of the militant movement Hezbollah when it was formed in 1982 - a claim both he and the group denied .
Ms Nasr was CNN 's senior editor of Middle East affairs and had been with the network for two decades , largely in an off - camera role .
After hearing of Ayatollah Fadlallah 's death , she wrote on the micro- blogging site Twitter : " Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah ...
One of Hezbollah 's giants I respect a lot . "
In a blog post on Tuesday , she wrote : " Reaction to my tweet was immediate , overwhelming and provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues , especially those dealing with the Middle East . "
The offending Twitter post now appears to have been deleted .
The US and Israel view Hezbollah as a terrorist group .
Yes , we have to do another kitty post .
But this one 's different , a matter of international interest .
News from Afghanistan may be grim , but everyone can find solace in these images of lost or abandoned kittens rescued by U.S. marines .

Brian Chambers , Chris Berry and Aaron
Shaw have adopted kittens they found while on duty - and sent them back to the States to wait for them with the marines ' families ( with the aid of these groups . )
Says Chambers , " At only 3 weeks old , their mother had disappeared and they were left alone to live rough and fend for themselves like the other cats in this area .
We looked after them both and they lived in a box in the office , after a week they were allowed to roam around during the day and sleep with us in the hooch at night . "

Of another kitten , Berry explains ,
I found Keykey tangled up in c-wire one day in the beginning of the deployment , I took him in and fixed his wounds .
He was also extremely malnourished so I constantly kept an eye on him and fed him until he got back to good health and he has been by my side ever since .

Obviously , this is a situation where everyone benefits from the affection .

Justice Alito , who was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy and , in large part , Clarence Thomas , acknowledged that the decision might “ lead to extensive and costly litigation , ” but said that was the price of protecting constitutional freedoms .
The majority offered the lower courts little guidance about how much protection the Second Amendment affords .
In a part of his opinion that Justice Thomas declined to join , Justice Alito reiterated the caveats in the Heller decision , saying the court did not mean to cast doubt on laws prohibiting possession of guns by felons and people who suffer from mental illness , laws forbidding carrying guns in sensitive places like schools and government buildings , or laws regulating the commercial sale of firearms .
The important point was a broad one , Justice Alito wrote : that the Second Amendment , like other provisions of the Bill of Rights , must be applied to the states under the 14th Amendment .
Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented .
They said the Heller decision remained incorrect and added that they would not have extended its protections to state and local laws even had it been correctly decided .
“ Although the court ’s decision in this case might be seen as a mere adjunct to Heller , ” Justice Stevens wrote , “ the consequences could prove far more destructive — quite literally — to our nation ’s communities and to our constitutional structure . ”
Though the majority agreed on the outcome , its members differed about how to get there .
The Second Amendment , like the rest of the Bill of Rights , originally restricted the power of only the federal government .
The Supreme Court later ruled that most of the protections of the Bill of Rights applied to the states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment , one of the post - Civil War amendments .
The departure of Mr Hayward is expected to be announced alongside the company ’s half - year results tomorrow .
BP is forecast to post a pre-tax loss of up to $ 25 billion ( £ 16 billion ) , which would be the biggest ever quarterly loss by a British company , after making provisions for the cost of the oil spill .
The idea of looking in to our own wills as to making things happen for us in a positive way .
Is not a new concept it is one that can be dated way back as fare as the beginning of time when our Neanderthal selves first came out of the deep woods and started to think as to what he or she could do to better the way they lived and survived .
Can you imagine if man would have got to the edge of the forest and felt a negative feeling of fear and decided a better life was not worth pursuing and ran naked back to his or her safe zone .
Could we say we may have never discovered fire or anything that has positively changed the human races way of living or his roll as a top predator on the earth .
The idea that we as a race of humans are ones that seek positive strengths in who we are say a lot about our deep rooted past and the courage that we all possess to seek success in what we do and how we go about it .
Many in today ’s age has forgotten the basic strengths of positive thinking and will that brings prosperity because they have lived soft lives where things came easy or are given freely with little pain no sweat of true foraging for the power that is ours for the effort of working for it .
A book I once read stated that man is a product of his environment and his own making .
The truth is man has found life easy to ride on the backs of great positive thinking men who have given of themselves for the betterment of others .
Now imagine if you will that we all have the power to take our lives so much further than we do .
The fact is these men were no greater than you and I .
However what made them seem to be smarter better or more able to gain wealth is one thing that most people do not use .
The will to move out of the woods in to the light of discovery and to say simple positive words ( I know I can and my will be done ) these men never failed even when it appeared that they had stumbled on the big rocks in there paths .
They just discovered that those failures to negative thinkers were the wrong paths to achievement .
So they did not give up however instead forged forward to become great in the mind of negative fearful people .
All through out history we see that these men and women have the thing we all can and want to gain the will to seek out new things regardless as to how many have said they were wrong crazy or would fail .
Christopher Columbus set out to find the new world against the entire populations view that he would fall off the other side of then what was believed to be a flat world , however he simply used positive thinking as to his own understandings that the earth was not flat but round .
In much of MLM I have heard so many companies use negatives and say that the only way to get prospects is to buy them or go through family .
However there are great positive thinkers that say no those avenues simply are old thinking and are out dated wrong negative beliefs that the main population of clients if they truly want a business and the products you sell will come directly to the sources you provide with out any prodding or ransacking them with unsolicited cold calls .
The idea that a man can change his stars by dreams and desires is suggested by the nobles who became noble by taking what they wanted at the tip of a sword .
These men said they would fight until they were down to the last man to get what it was they wanted and they did not give up and say well we are out numbered .
No they said we are positive that we will conquer and be noble in their hearts they had already won and were noble even though others of notable power had not given them the title .
So why did this happen you may ask ?
Because these men and women were all in they were all into the idea that they had won before they had won .
So their strengths in positive thinking as to victory came to be .
It is no different with us in today ’s business we are on a battle field competing with thousands of other business .
However our sword is the way we choose to do work and how truthful we are to those we do business with .
If we as people positively believe we have already gotten our success by helping others succeed then we are invoking the power that made the caveman step out in to the field of discovery and conquer his own fears .
Then we truly are deserving of our position we have worked for .

What Cade Mays ' eligibility means for Vols
Cade Mays gained clearance from the SEC on Wednesday as the conference approved intraconference waivers .
Seeking to blame India for the " last - minute hitch " in talks , Pakistan today said New Delhi appeared to be unwilling to commit to a roadmap for future engagement and made it clear that the dialogue cannot move forward if Kashmir is not discussed .
" If we focus more only on those issues which India gives importance to and ignore those considered important by Pakistan , then I do n't think the talks can move forward , " Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters , a day after his meeting with Indian counterpart S M Krishna .
" Kashmir has been part of our negotiations .
It is a disputed territory .
It is not possible to delink Kashmir from the negotiations , " he said .
He said it would not make sense to discuss aspects like cultural and trade relations while ignoring " core " issues like Jammu and Kashmir , peace and security and Siachen .
" We understand their concerns and want to address those .
But there are concerns of Pakistan which they ( India ) should address , " he said .
Taking a dig at Krishna , Qureshi said he did not step out of the talks to " attend any phone calls " , but the " Indian Foreign Minister received foreign policy directions from New Delhi repeatedly during our meeting " .
" I led Pakistan 's team and I did n't need to make even a single phone call ( to Pakistan leaders ) during the day - long talks .
Krishna is the principal for giving direction to foreign policy ( but ) why were directions being sent repeatedly from Delhi ? "
He said the Indian side had been " selective " in yesterday 's talks but such an approach did not
Continued on page 2
India was selective , not prepared , says Qureshi
conform to the spirit of the meeting of the Indian and Pakistan premiers in Bhutan in April as they had decided to discuss all issues .
He said there was " no deadlock " but acknowledged that there were " difficulties and problems " that both sides would have to overcome .
" It is the nature of India - Pakistan talks that whenever there is progress , there is always a last minute hitch .
There was no hitch from Pakistan 's side . "

Collisions between bicycles and vehicles are as close to a David and Goliath encounter as you ’ll see on modern - day roads .
Bicycles take up much less space , have a fraction of the carbon footprint as cars , but must constantly be aware of vehicular behemoths , even while obeying all of the rules of the road .
But when vehicles are involved in bicycle accidents , the law often favors the driver , according to a new report by Bicycle Times Magazine .
Even when these accidents are fatal , the report found , lawsuits are overwhelmingly diverted away from criminal courtrooms toward civil proceedings .
The reason for this is simple .
When bicycle use boomed in the 1970s , roads did n’t yet have the infrastructure to support a consistent bike - to - work population .
As a result , bicycle accidents clogged up the courts .
“ Until then , motor vehicle offenses were criminal , ” David Hiller of Washington State ’s Cascade Bicycle Club told Bicycle Times .
“ Then , in exchange for waiving the right to due process , and to unclog the courts , the trade off was those cases would be handled in civil court . ”
Currently , only nine states carry criminal penalties for bike - car accidents : Alabama , Arizona , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Nebraska , Nevada , North Carolina , and Utah .
Noticeably absent is California , which had 131 bike fatalities in 2008 alone .
Meanwhile , most car - to - car deaths would have the option of being tried in criminal court .
The purpose of requesting the option of a criminal trial for drivers involved in fatal bicycle accidents is not to lock more people up .
“ While sending every driver who makes a fatal error of judgment to prison is not a realistic solution , ” wrote Oregon lawyer Ray Thomas in a letter to the Bicycle Transportation Alliance in Portland , Oregon , “ the time has come to recognize that driving is a dangerous privilege and serious consequences should follow anytime a needless death occurs because a driver failed to drive carefully . ”
Of course , the major problem facing cyclists who hope to reform accident laws is that 63 percent of the population drives and considers it the responsibility of cyclists to get out of their way .
States are growing more serious about penalties for bike - car accidents , but progress is slow .
So if you ’re a regular biker , be careful out there and remember to give cars the right of way whenever in doubt until David and Goliath become more equal in California courts .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Teen apparel chain Abercrombie & Fitch Co has closed its Hollister store in New York City due to bedbug infestation .
The store , in Manhattan ’s SoHo neighborhood , was closed on Wednesday , the company said .
It said it was in the process of removing the bedbugs and hoped to reopen the store soon .
Abercrombie & Fitch spokesman Eric Cerny had no comment on how the store closing could affect sales and profits .
Last month , FedEx launched a multimillion - dollar online campaign against longtime rival United Parcel Service over a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill making its way through Congress .
FedEx says a provision of the bill , as passed in the House , amounts to a “ bailout ” for UPS .
But that ’s an abuse of the term .
The measure would bring drivers and other non-airline - based employees of FedEx ’s Express division , which handles “ time - sensitive shipments , ” under the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act , instead of the Railway Labor Act .
Under the NLRA , the FedEx workers would be able to unionize locally , on a site - by - site basis , instead of nationally as required by the RLA .
Unionizing , in other words , is somewhat easier under the NLRA .
UPS workers , specifically its drivers , fall under the NLRA and are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
UPS argues that FedEx Express workers who perform the same duties should fall under the same regulations .
But FedEx , which founded its Express division in 1971 as an airline company , says it should remain under the RLA , which covers airlines and railroads .
UPS argues that the proposed amendment “ will appropriately provide equal treatment under labor law to employees performing the same functions at different companies , and will eliminate the special treatment currently given to FedEx Express . ”
FedEx says that “ [ r ] emoving FedEx Express from RLA jurisdiction could expose our customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupt the flow of their time - sensitive , high - value shipments through our global network . ”
FedEx has taken its case to the Web , misappropriating a term with which the public has largely negative associations and applying it to what UPS is trying to convince Congress to do .
FedEx ’s new Web site , brownbailout.com , attacks UPS for pandering to Congress and says UPS wants “ a bailout , plain and simple , and the American people wo n’t stand for it . ”
A running tab on UPS ’ revenue called the “ Bailout - O - Meter ” asks : “ Why does a company that brings in this much money need a bailout from Congress ? ”
And videos on the FedEx–sponsored site lampoon UPS commercials that feature a man explaining the benefits of using UPS through illustrations on a white board .
The FedEx videos feature a man called the “ Brown Bailout Guy , ” who resembles the actor from UPS ’ own commercials .
In one video , he ’s walking near the U.S. Capitol , asking , “ Where ’s my bailout ? ”
But does the legislative change that UPS wants amount to a bailout ?
Not in the traditional sense and certainly not in the way the American public has heard the term used in recent months .
UPS is n’t seeking any money from the federal government because of financial losses .
Even Washington
Post syndicated columnist George Will , who is taking FedEx ’s side in the dispute , says that what UPS is advocating does n’t amount to a traditional bailout .
Will : “ Bailout ” is now both a noun and a verb , and FedEx characterizes what Congress might do for UPS as the “ Brown Bailout . ”
But properly used , “ bailout ” denotes a rescue of an economic entity from financial distress .
Although UPS is suffering from the recession , so is FedEx .
Furthermore , UPS , whose revenue is 36 percent more than FedEx ’s , began advocating this injury to FedEx long before this recession .
The issue now moves to the Senate , where that body of Congress will take up legislation that does not include language that would authorize the regulatory switch .
But this will almost certainly come up during a House and Senate reconciliation of their respective versions of the bill .
We are not taking sides in the matter one way or the other .
Whether FedEx Express workers should be governed by the RLA or the NLRA is not an issue for us to decide .
But FedEx is wrong in this regard :
What UPS is asking for is no bailout .

Young women are becoming more and more dependent on social media and checking on their social networks , according to a new study released earlier today by Oxygen Media and Lightspeed Research .
In fact , as many as one - third of women aged 18 - 34 check Facebook when they first wake up , even before they get to the bathroom .
The study sampled the habits of 1,605 adults using social media between May and June of this year in an attempt to break down their social media habits .
While some of the results are in line with previous studies we 've read , others simply shocked us ( e.g. 42 % of young women think posting photos of themselves " visibly intoxicated " is okay ) .
Here 's a short rundown of how young women are utilizing Facebook and social media in general :
Are Young Women Addicted to Facebook ?
While the study covers all of social media , it 's clear that women in the 18 - 34 range are focused on their Facebook accounts .
More than half of young women ( 57 % ) say they talk to people online more than face - to - face .
A full 39 % of them proclaim themselves Facebook addicts , while 34 % of young women make Facebook the first thing they do when they wake up , even before brushing their teeth or going to the bathroom .
Here are some other interesting stats regarding young women and Facebook :
21 % of women age 18 - 34 check Facebook in the middle of the night
63 % use Facebook as a networking tool
42 % think it 's okay to post photos of themselves intoxicated
79 % are fine with kissing in photos
58 % use Facebook to keep tabs on " frenemies "
50 % are fine with being Facebook friends with complete strangers
What conclusions can we draw from this data ?
It 's not just that young women are using Facebook religiously : it 's that they 're very open with what they post and who they accept as friends .
Combined , it can lead to a privacy mess .
Social Media 's Role in Dating
We already knew that Facebook has radically changed dating , and Oxygen Media 's stats only back up that assertion .
50 % of women believe that it 's just fine to date people they 've met on Facebook , compared to 65 % of men .
6 % of women use it to " hook up " ( 20 % of men do the same ) .
It gets murkier for relationships .
49 % of women believe it 's fine to keep tabs on a boyfriend by having access to his accounts ( 42 % of men think the same way ) .
9 % of women have broken up their relationships via Facebook , as compared to a full 24 % of men .
Luckily , most women do n't believe that breaking up via Facebook is okay : 91 % to be exact .
I do n't want to meet the 9 % who think it 's just fine .

The Oxygen Media / Lightspeed Research survey is filled with a lot of other interesting data points , but it all circles back to the privacy issue .
54 % of 18 - 24 year old women do not trust Facebook with their private information , and 89 % agree that " you should never put anything on Facebook that you do n't want your parents to see . "
That seems contradictory to the 42 % that think it 's fine to post pictures of themselves drunk .
Our habits are changing due to social media technology , particularly Facebook .
It 's not just a connection tool for many women , but a research tool , a dating network , and a way to keep tabs on both boyfriends and enemies .

Fossil fuel power stations respond to changes in electricity demand
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Switching off lights , turning the television off at the mains and using cooler washing cycles could have a much bigger impact on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power stations than previously thought , according to a new study published this month in the journal Energy Policy .
The study shows that the figure used by government advisors to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide saved by reducing people 's electricity consumption is up to 60 percent too low .
The power stations that supply electricity vary in their carbon dioxide emission rates , depending on the fuel they use : those that burn fossil fuels ( coal , gas and oil ) have higher emissions than those driven by nuclear power and wind .
In general only the fossil fuel power stations are able to respond instantly to changes in electricity demand .
Dr Adam Hawkes , the author of the new study from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London , says the government should keep track of changing carbon emission rates from power stations to ensure that policy decisions for reducing emissions are based on robust scientific evidence .
The new study suggests that excluding power stations with low carbon emission rates , such as wind and nuclear power stations , and focussing on those that deal with fluctuating demand would give a more accurate emission figure .
Scientists advising government on for the best ways to reduce electricity demand currently use an estimated figure for emission rates .
The new study shows that , at 0.43 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity consumed , this figure is 60 percent lower than the actual rates observed between 2002 and 2009 ( 0.69 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour ) , meaning that policy studies are underestimating the impact of people reducing their electricity use .
Dr Adam Hawkes , author of the paper , and a Visiting Fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London , said : " One way governments are trying to mitigate the effects of climate change is to encourage people to reduce their energy consumption and change the types of technologies they use in their homes .
However , the UK government currently informs its policy decisions based on an estimate that , according to my research , is lower than it should be .
" This means any reduction we make in our electricity use - for example , if everyone switched off lights that they were n't using , or turned off electric heating earlier in the year - could have a bigger impact on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by power stations than previously thought .
However , this also acts in reverse : a small increase in the amount of electricity we use could mean a larger increase in emissions than we previously thought , so we need to make sure we do everything we can to reduce our electricity use , " added Dr Hawkes .
Dr Hawkes drew upon 60 million data points showing the amount of electricity produced in each half - hour period by each power station in Great Britain from the start of 2002 to the end of 2009 .
He also calculated the emissions of each different type of generator by examining government data showing their average annual fuel use .
Finally , he took these two sets of data to calculate the emissions rate that should be attributed to a small change in electricity demand .
The results show that , for 2002 - 09 , the carbon dioxide emission rate for estimating the effect of a small change in electricity demand is 0.69 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity consumed .
This is 30 percent higher than the average emissions rate across all power stations , which is 0.51 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour , and 60 percent higher than the figure currently used by government advisors , which is 0.43 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour .
Professor Sir Brian Hoskins , Director of Imperial 's Grantham Institute for Climate Change , said : " This is a very important study that could help policy makers make more informed decisions to reduce our carbon emissions .
The government needs a good understanding of the figures it uses to support policy analysis , because this has a big impact on which technologies we employ to reduce our energy use .
With a more accurate picture of what is going on , we will be much better equipped to tackle our carbon dioxide emissions . "

The Anne Frank House Museum in Amsterdam has launched a graphic novel version of the teenage Jewish diarist 's biography , hoping to bring her story and death in a Nazi concentration camp to a wider audience .
Spokeswoman Annemarie Bekker said the publication was aimed at teenagers who might not otherwise pick up Anne Frank 's diary , the most widely read document to emerge from the Holocaust .
" Not everyone will read the diary , " she said .
" The one does n't exclude the other . "
Using the style of comic books to illustrate serious historical topics , even genocide , is not new .
Maus ,
Art Spiegelman 's graphic biography of his father , a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp , won a special Pulitzer prize in 1992 .
The Anne Frank biography , authorised by the museum , is a collaboration between American author Sid Jacobson and artist Ernie Colón , the creative team behind the bestselling graphic novel of the 9/11 Commission report .
Publisher Hill & Wang will launch the illustrated book in the US later this month ; Macmillan is publishing it in Britain in the autumn .
Translations in German , French and Italian are planned .
Bekker said the biography would be included with classroom teaching materials about the second world war .
The museum decided to commission the work after the success of a similar educational project , The Search , about a fictional family in hiding .
Anne Frank wrote the diary from her 13th birthday , shortly before her family went into hiding from the Nazis , and during the two years she and her family remained in a concealed apartment in Amsterdam .
It was published after the war by her father Otto Frank , the only survivor .
Anne Frank died in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp in 1945 .
Unlike his unflappable temperament , his lingering failings should and could be corrected .
And they must be if his presidency is not just to rise above the 24/7 Spill - cam but to credibly seize the narrative that Americans have craved ever since he was elected during the most punishing economic downturn of our lifetime .
We still want to believe that Obama is on our side , willing to fight those bad corporate actors who cut corners and gambled recklessly while regulators slept , Congress raked in contributions , and we got stuck with the wreckage and the bills .
But his leadership style keeps sowing confusion about his loyalties , puncturing holes in the powerful tale he could tell .

His most conspicuous flaw is his unshakeable confidence in the collective management brilliance of the best and the brightest he selected for his White House team  “ his abiding faith in the judgment of experts , ” as Joshua Green of The Atlantic has put it .
At his gulf - centric press conference 10 days ago , the president said he had “ probably had more meetings on this issue than just about any issue since we did our Afghan review . ”
This was meant to be reassuring but it was not .
The plugging of an uncontrollable oil leak , like the pacification of an intractable Afghanistan , may be beyond the reach of marathon brainstorming by brainiacs , even if the energy secretary is a Nobel laureate .
Obama has yet to find a sensible middle course between blind faith in his own Ivy League kind and his predecessor ’s go - with - the - gut bravado .
By now , he also should have learned that the best and the brightest can get it wrong  and do .
His economic advisers predicted that without the stimulus the unemployment rate might reach 9 percent  a projection that was quickly exceeded even with the stimulus and that has haunted the administration ever since .
Other White House geniuses persuaded the president to make his fateful claim in early April that “ oil rigs today generally do n’t cause spills ”  a particularly specious ( indeed false ) plank in the argument for his spectacularly ill - timed expansion of offshore oil drilling .
The Times reported last week that at the administration meetings leading to this new drilling policy the subject of the vast dysfunction at the Minerals Management Service , the agency charged with regulating the drilling , never even came up .
Obama ’s excessive trust in his own heady team is all too often matched by his inherent deference to the smartest guys in the boardroom in the private sector .
His default assumption seems to be that his peers are always as well - intentioned as he is .
The single biggest mistake he has made in managing the gulf disaster was his failure to challenge BP ’s version of events from the start .
The company consistently understated the spill ’s severity , overestimated the progress of the repair operation and low - balled the environmental damage .
Yet the White House ’s designated point man in the crisis , Adm .
Thad Allen of the Coast Guard , was still publicly reaffirming his trust in the BP chief executive , Tony Hayward , as recently as two weeks ago , more than a month after the rig exploded .
This is baffling , and then some , given BP ’s atrocious record prior to this catastrophe .
In the last three years , according to the Center for Public Integrity , BP accounted for “ 97 percent of all flagrant violations found in the refining industry by government safety inspectors ”  including 760 citations for “ egregious , willful ” violations ( compared with only eight at the two oil companies that tied for second place ) .
Hayward ’s predecessor at BP , ousted in a sex - and - blackmail scandal in 2007 , had placed cost - cutting ( and ever more obscene profits ) over safety , culminating in the BP Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 and injured 170 in 2005 .
Last October
The Times uncovered documents revealing that BP had still failed to address hundreds of safety hazards at that refinery in the four years after the explosion , prompting the largest fine in the history of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
( The fine , $ 87 million , was no doubt regarded as petty cash by a company whose profit reached nearly $ 17 billion last year . )

If you ’ve had a great career what happens to all your knowledge and experience when you retire ?
Great Suit
My wife and I had dinner last night with a friend of hers from high school .
Tom , her husband whom I had never met before joined us as well .
I took one look at his suit and guessed “ high - powered lawyer .
“ ( I was right , the suit probably added another $ 250 per billable hour . )
Over dinner we got chatting , and I found out that besides the great suit , Tom was actually a pretty remarkable guy .
He was a trial litigator , one of the guys that slug it out in court in front of a judge and jury .
And Tom was n’t just any trial lawyer .
He was the hired gun that Fortune 100 companies and hedge funds bring in when billions are at stake .
Listening to some of his stories over dinner was entertaining enough , but after awhile I realized I was hearing something else – this guy played strategy while his opponents were using tactics .
Chess and Military History
It turns out that Tom was a student of military history and a chess player .
He described preparing for cases like war .
“ Most trial lawyers play defense .
I ’m on the offense from day one .
In depositions and filing motions I ’ll use misdirection to get the opposing counsel thinking I ’m heading in one direction , and I ’m heading in the other .
When I file for a Summary Judgment , it ’s usually from a direction my opponents never expected . ”
He then went on to give me a tour of 30 years of trial lawyer experience .
So I asked , “ Did you learn any of this in law school ? ”
He laughed .
“ I went to Harvard .
They did n’t teach war there . ”
“ Do any of your junior partners in your firm know how to do what you do ? ” “ Well they watch me , and I guess they learn by osmosis . ”
Then I asked my favorite question .
“ When you retire , what happens to all the knowledge and experience you ’ve acquired ? ”
You Ca n’t Take It With You
I think the question caught him a bit by surprise .
I explained , “ You have a record in winning trials that ’s based on a strategy and methodology you developed and you ’ve likely have moved the state of the art in your profession – and it ’s all going into the trash bin of history – unless you pass it on .
Teach It or Lose It
I asked Tom to think about writing down a longer version of the stories he told me over dinner , almost like an autobiography but focused on his career .
And for each big trial or milestone summarize it with a “ Lessons Learned ” section .
I observed that at the end of this exercise , he ’ll come to one of three conclusions : 1 ) he has a great collection of war stories to tell while he ’s skiing or playing golf or 2 ) he can make a book out of those stories or 3 ) buried in the stories and lessons learned was a strategy that was new , unique and worth teaching to future generations of lawyers .
I suggested that he volunteer to guest teach in someone else ’ class at a local law school ( and where he lived there were plenty ) to see if he enjoyed it .
His war stories would certainly keep students on the edge of their seats .
( If you were a law school student having him come in to your class and say , “ The first time you run into me , I ’d make you wet your pants ” might get your attention . )
But more importantly this would help him decide if he wanted to teach as an Adjunct Professor after he retired .
If as I surmised , he actually did push the state of the art in his field forward and his teaching went beyond war stories to a theoretical framework , most schools would be happy for him to develop and teach a class .
Why Do It ?
I suggested that there were four reasons he ought to take teaching seriously .
First , his accumulated knowledge will disappear when he does .
Second , it ’s incumbent on all of us to make those who come after us smarter than we were .
Third , having students question your assumptions makes you smarter ( and at our age growing new neurons are helpful , ) and finally fourth , for those of us whose career was on a stage , teaching is just another stage with an appreciative audience .
Not Just For Lawyers
Driving home for dinner , I realized that the same advice for Tom and lawyers would work for professionals in any domain ; doctors , engineers , venture capitalists , CEO ’s or even entrepreneurs .
Do n’t let your knowledge and experience die with you .
Lessons Learned
If you do n’t teach it or write it down , the accumulated knowledge of your career is gone .
War stories about your career can be entertainment , or even better if you want to teach , make them the basis of a strategy and methodology worth passing on .
Retirement does n’t have to be only about golf and skiing .

There are hundreds of BitTorrent sites around today and new ones are appearing even as we speak .
However , the vast majority of these trackers do n’t make it past the initial phase – some head straight to the deadpool and are never heard of again .
But here ’s a torrent site that has not failed the test of time – LeechersLair ( LL ) , a veteran General / 0 day torrent tracker is celebrating its 4th birthday .
During the past 4 years LL has overcome various obstacles including forced server shut downs to become one of the best general trackers currently around .
Unsurprisingly , LL staff are celebrating the site ’s 4th birthday in grand style .
First of all the good news for non-members – LL has opened public signups for one whole week .
Previously banned members ( for whatever reason ) too have been granted amnesty to re-register on site .
In addition to open signups there are flash ratio giveaways as well as free downloads planned as part of celebrations .
The message below is quoted from LeechersLair homepage .
It discusses in detail what the staff has planned for LL ’s 4th anniversary and contains useful information for potential new members such as activity requirements .
Hi
As you may have seen on site Wednesday is Leecherslair 's 4th Birthday , nope we can't believe it 's been that long either .
As we do every Birthday we will be giving away ratio and free downloads like there 's no tomorrow .
A lot of which will be flash givaways which means they will only be around for a few hours , so make sure you check back on site regularly so as not to miss out on anything .
Also as a lot of you know during our Birthday 's we also open our doors for 1 week and also have an amnesty where any member who has been banned for whatever reason can rejoin the site , also while the doors are open the invite system will be disabled .
To get your friends or family to register simply get them to come along on the link below and follow the registration process .
http://leecherslairywot.com
For those that have n't been to the site for a while remember we get rid of all unused accounts after 90 days , this includes parked accounts .
This is to make sure that the site remains active as well as clearing up the database , very few trackers actually do this as they want it to appear that they have more members than they actually have , we like to show true figures
Anyhow make sure that you stay active on site for the Birthday week which starts Monday .
The doors to the Lair are now open !!!
Miss it , miss out
Staff@Leecherslair
Although the open signups will bring in a lot of new members , LL is already a well established private tracker with a strong user base .
The site currently has 15000 + active users and tracks ~ 6500 active torrents .
Popular torrents on this site usually have 100 - 200 seeds each .
Content on LL includes both scene releases , P2P releases as well as LL exclusive torrents .
Screenshot below shows some of the packs indexed on LeechersLair .
Although LL ’s birthday falls on the 7th of July , open registrations have already started .
You can now sign up for a free account without having the need to have an invite .
Ratio building should not be a problem as there are already lots of torrents on free leech ( denoted by spinning golden con next to torrent name ) with more free leech set to come as part of birthday celebrations .

Celebrities may have more money than you , more material possessions than you , more plastic surgery and more powerful friends , but they are not immune to being caught committing a crime and getting a horrible mug shot taken .
Over the years many stars including Mel Gibson , Paris Hilton , Heather Locklear and even Bill Gates have been arrested and had a mug shot taken .
But not all celebrity mug shots are terrible or embarrassing ; although , the ones that are , are so bad they often make you forget about the good ones .
Here area few examples of some of the worst celebrity mug shots out there .
Yasmine Bleeth : Jail is certainly no day at the beach , but when you were once a Baywatch babe , those harsh overhead lights can be extremely cruel .
Especially when they set off the baggy , dark - eyed , blotchy skinned , sunken in nose horror of what looks like a year long drug bender .
Nick Nolte : Dirty hair obtained through products like Jonathan Antin ’s Dirt may be “ in ” but dirty hair from a shower - free weekend binge is never cool .
The Hawaiian shirt , however , is a nice touch and does brighten the picture up .
It also shows us the partying mood that got him into this position .
Rip Torn :
There may be no way to look dignified in a mug shot , but there sure is a way to look down right terrible .
Start with a head full of week - old , unwashed hair , add a drunken stupor , and then fall asleep mid-crime so that one side of your hair flops upward like a baby bird learning how to use his wings and you get Rip Torn .
Joyce Dewitt : Doe -eyed surprise is one thing when it ’s caught on the face of a 20 something ingénue , but on a 60 - year old after a drunk driving arrest , it just is n’t very flattering .
After all , by the time you reach 60 you should not be surprised that you can get arrested for driving drunk and that they are going to take your picture if you do .
Phil Spector :
While it ’s not surprising to see a celebrity mug shot in which the celebrity looks like just another average loser , it is surprising to see one in which said celebrity resembles your day laboring alcoholic uncle that no one leaves their children alone around .
No , of course there is nothing wrong with day laborers and no — not every alcoholic ( or uncle ) is a molester — but seriously , if you have one of those , chances are he looks similar to this .
The next time you want to feel morally , ethically and physically superior to your celebrity idols , just do a real quick web search for a mug shot of them .
Chances are real good they will have been caught unprepared for the spontaneous photo shoot and wo n’t have the benefit of Photoshop to even their skin tone , reduce fine lines and sleeping at the wheel wrinkles , and you ’ll feel like a million bucks .
Of course , no matter how bad they look in mug shots , these celebrities probably actually have a million bucks … but at least they do n’t look like it .

I just returned from conferences in Germany and Italy which , as usual , allowed me to easily learn about new technologies .
I have linked to these excellent talks in hopes others can benefit :
Devrim 's talk about Red Hat Cluster software was very interesting .
Postgres relies on OS - specific tools for auto - failover and , though I have recommended Red Hat Cluster several times , I did not know much about it before Devrim explained it .
Similarly , David Fetter has been talking about Writeable Common Table Expressions ( CTE ) for several years , but I only understood their value after seeing his talk .
Another eye - opener for me was Jean - Paul Argudo 's talk about Pgpool - II and its many features .
The surprise talk was Gianni Ciolli 's talk ( image , details ) about writing Postgres code to play chess .

There are two Postgres gems of wisdom I was reminded of today .
The first was something Joe Conway said at PgWest 2010 this year during his tutorial , Building an Open Geospatial Analysis Technology Stack .
He said , paraphrased , " Sometimes it is useful to bring the data to the code , and other times it is useful to bring the code to the data " .
He was discussing the use of the PL / R server - side language , but it applies in many use cases .
The second gem is a video of Josh Berkus 's 2009 talk , 10 Ways to Wreck Your Database .
If you want to relish the word " anti-performance " , this talk is for you .
You will find yourself thinking , " Am I supposed to do that ?
Oh , yeah , that is what I am not supposed to do " .
I had the joy of seeing this talk live , but I enjoyed a second viewing today .
Friday , November 5 , 2010
The most creative talk I saw at PgWest 2010 this year was one by Nathan Boley titled Improving Planner Prediction Accuracy with Custom Selectivity Functions .
First , some background — recent versions of Postgres record the 100 most common values ( MCV ) of each column for use by the optimizer .
Queries that use values that are not in that 100 MCV must estimate the value 's frequency .
The current Postgres code assumes that non-MCV values are evenly distributed .
Nathan 's idea was to use the existing MCV values to estimate the frequency of non-MCV values .
For example , if the MCV values show a normal distribution , it is very possible estimate the frequency of non-MCV values by determining where the non-MCV value appears on the normal distribution curve , e.g. , if it is near the mean , it has high frequency .
A cruder example would be to just assume that non-MCV values near MCV values are more frequent than those farther away .
Such a computation does not need any additional statistics to be collected .
However , only value distributions that have an inherent ordering would benefit , e.g. , measurements and postal codes would benefit , but state codes , because they are arbitrarily assigned , would not .
I am not sure how we can detect inherent ordering .

I gave my MVCC Unmasked presentation yesterday at PgWest 2010 so the talk is now online .
The talk was well - received , with many audience questions .
The slides are heavily annotated , which should make them easier to read for people who did n't attend the talk .
A video was made and I will post here when that is available .
I learned a few things writing this talk :
Query tricks to make MVCC visible
Cleanup would be needed even without MVCC ( deletes , aborted transactions )
Single - page cleanup happens even in non-update ( non - HOT ) cases
One other thing I learned is that the order features are added to Postgres often skews how we view these features — that new features often make more sense thought of in a logical way , rather than considered in the order they were added to Postgres .
I have tried to do that with this talk , and it gave me a new appreciation for Postgres 's technological achievements .

I just returned from five days in Moscow .
HighLoad ++ conference organizers invited Simon Riggs , Robert Treat , and myself to speak at a three - hour Postgres mini-conference as part of their main conference .
Robert did a great job explaining the challenges of managing high - volume systems , and Simon presented the history of Postgres performance enhancements in a way I had never seen before .
Conference attendance was good , so hopefully we helped make the conference a success .
I was surprised that they flew in three Postgres people ( and paid for their expenses ) for a non-Postgres - specific conference .
This might have been a first , but probably not the last , and indicates Postgres 's growing popularity .
For example , O'Reilly 's MySQL Conference is looking to create a Postgres track for their conference ( new submission deadline : November 3 ) .
I had a chance to have dinner with several Moscow Postgres people during the trip , which is always enjoyable .
Anyway , I am home for a three days , and then off to PgWest 2010 .

You have probably seen many posts about the switch of Postgres to use Git .
I thought it would be helpful to explain why the conversion was done .
Postgres has used CVS as its source code management ( SCM ) system since Internet development started in 1996 .
CVS was never perfect — one of the major limitations was that changes to multiple files by a single CVS commit were not treated as a unit .
We found ways to work around that limitation .
Subversion was designed as a replacement for CVS , and fixed the multi- file commit problem .
However , the community had already worked around that problem and did not see switching to Subversion , and the disruption it would caused , as wise .
Five years ago the Linux development team started work on a new source code management called Git that would correct and improve upon many of the source code management systems that came before it .
Particularly for Postgres ,
Git allowed for easier hosting of alternative source trees by developers , and easier code sharing .
For these reasons , and because many developers were already using Git successfully in their personal development , the community decided at PGCon 2010 to convert to Git , and did the conversion in September .
While commiting with Git is similar to CVS , Git feels like CVS broken into 1000 pieces , meaning it offers a lot more flexibility in how source code is managed .
Our developers seem pleased with the result .
Update :
This article explains the history of source code management systems .

Last week I attended a conference in Baltimore , and I am currently in Bolivia doing EnterpriseDB training .
In the next four weeks I will attend conferences in Boston , Moscow , and San Francisco ; my web site has all the details .
( I was busy this time last year too . )
Interestingly , I was able to do most of the Bolivian training in Spanish with the help of Oxiel Contreras , a former online student from Bolivia .
The odd part is that I was a poor high school Spanish student 30 years ago , and have n't studied Spanish since .
Seems hearing so many foreign languages in recent years has affected my brain .

I usually read the Slashdot comments about Postgres releases because it gives me a good barometer of how Postgres is perceived .
I have been doing this for 10 + years , and started at the time when MySQL was the open source database darling , and Postgres was something " you might want to look at " .
For Postgres 9.0 , the comments were very positive .
The comments include these glowing quotes :
The Postgres documentation was mentioned several times :
Even the appearance improvements for the web documentation got a mention .
Finally , a discussion about whether conditional triggers added in Postgres 9.0 is a useful feature yielded this humorous news report :
Two DBA 's shot each other dead yesterday morning after they fell out over the maintainability of column - based conditional triggers .
A police officer at the scene remarked : " If only they had been using MySQL with the default ISAM tables which support no such functionality , then none of this would have happened . "

With the big release of Postgres 9.0 , I want to recommend a new Postgres article by Alan Shimel .
First , the title , " Mirror , Mirror On The Wall , Which Is The Best Open Source DB Of Them All ? " combines the question of which database is best , the new Postgres replication feature ( mirroring ) , and a fair tale quote to create a memorable title .
Second , the article has great content with emphasis on the benefits of our community and license , and includes the quote " They think … the move to PostgreSQL will soon turn into a stampede . "
It also includes a mention of in - place upgrades ( pg_upgrade ) .
It even includes audio of the interview upon which the article is based .
What 's not to love ?

There was a rather philosophical discussion on the email lists last week about why people contribute to Postgres and open source that is definitely worth reading .
I believe the most profound comment was this :
The work on PostgreSQL is adventure , and very good experience , very good school for me .
It 's job only for people who like programming , who like hacking , it is n't job for people , who go to office on 8 hours .
Next I use PostgreSQL for my job — and hacking on PostgreSQL put me a perfect knowledge , perfect contacts to developers , and I can work together with best programmers on planet .
and I can create some good things .
Probably if I work on commercial projects I can have a better money — but life is only one , and money is important , but not on top for me — life have to be adventure !

I have been invited to attend a Postgres security meeting at OmniTI in Maryland on September 8 .
The meeting will include other local Postgres community members , government security experts , and contractors .
The goal of the meeting is for everyone to meet in person and to plan for necessary Postgres security additions and secure installation guidelines .
While this will be US - government specific , I expect all work products to be publicly released and available to benefit the larger Postgres global community .

' depesz ' already wrote a clear blog entry explaining the effect of enabling standard_conforming_strings in Postgres 9.1 .
My blog entry explains why it will be changed in Postgres 9.1 .
To understand standard_conforming_strings , you have to know some Postgres history .
Postgres is written in the C language , and some C syntax was added to Postgres for convenience .
For example , Postgres supports the C syntax for not - equal , != , as well as the SQL - standard non-equal syntax , <>.
This is a good addition of C syntax because it does not affect SQL - standard - compliant behavior .
Another C syntax addition that was added to Postgres when it was developed at Berkely is the interpretation of C backslash escapes in strings , e.g. , in 'abc
def ' ,
embeds a newline into the string .
While this is convenient , it unfortunately breaks SQL - standard - specified behavior .
In the early years , this incompatibility was minor compared to other compatibilities , but as Postgres attained greater standards compliance , this incompatibility started to matter to users porting applications from other databases to Postgres .
This issue was addressed in 2005 with Postgres 8.1 by adding three new capabilities :
a new string designation prefix , E , which specifies escape string processing , e.g. , E'abc
def '
a new parameter standard_conforming_strings , which , when enabled , provides SQL - standard - compliant string behavior in non-E strings by not interpreting backslash escapes ( default : off )
a new parameter escape_string_warning , which , when enabled , issues a warning if a backslash is used in a non-E string , and standard_conforming_strings is off ( default : on )
These changes were made to encourage users to use the new escape string designation ( E '' ) for all strings needing backslash escape processing .
The plan was that once all users were using the new escape string designation for queries , standard_conforming_strings could be turned on so normal strings could stop interpreting backslash escapes .
Of course , it is very hard to know the extent that people have migrated their applications , because , of course , they can just ignore the warnings .
Aside from returning incorrect results , improper processing of escapes might lead to security vulnerabilities , such as SQL injection attacks .
Therefore , it took five years for the development community to be comfortable that the vast majority of users had migrated strings needing escape processing to the E '' syntax .
We also needed to be sure that all backend code and supplied tools handled strings properly .
So Postgres 9.1 will finally have SQL - standard - compliant string processing enabled by default , though such behavior has been available since Postgres 8.1 if enabled by the user .
This brings Postgres closer the the SQL standard .
The next community challenge is to be sure all external libraries properly handle escaping strings before Postgres 9.1 is released , so we have set up a wiki to record which interfaces are ready .

I am speaking at the New York PostgreSQL Meetup Group this Tuesday about the new features in Postgres 9.0 .
( It will be similar to a webcast I did a few months ago . )
I have a few interesting conferences coming up : surge ( Baltimore ) , OpenSQL Camp ( Massachusetts ) , PgWest 2010 ( San Francisco ) , and perhaps PGDay Europe 2010 ( Germany ) .
Update :
We had 13 people attend , which is a good turnout .
Our next meeting is scheduled for September .

Postgres implements Multiversion Concurrency Control ( MVCC ) using several normally - invisible fields , notably xmin and xmax .
The xmin column records the transaction id that created the row , and xmax records the transaction id that expired the row , either through an UPDATE or DELETE .
I often demonstrate MVCC by showing the xmin and xmax columns :
SELECT xmin , xmax FROM mytable ; xmin | xmax ------+------
664 | 0
Unfortunately it is hard to see a non - zero xmax column because by definition a non - zero xmax means the row is expired ( or will be ) .
I only recently realized that I can show a non -zero xmax column by deleting a row in another transaction and keeping the transaction open :
BEGIN WORK ; DELETE FROM mytable ;
and then querying the table from another session :
SELECT xmin , xmax FROM mytable ; xmin | xmax ------+------ 664 | 665
The 665 indicates the row will become invisible if the multi-statement transaction completes .
If it aborts , the system will realize 665 aborted and will ignore xmax .

As a followup to my previous blog post , this humorous Slashdot comment under the title " Reliability " warrants coverage :
> our MySQL server > 3 x 150 GB Raptors > 100 Adaptec SATA RAID controller > RAID 5 Now you have four problems .
Could you Do It Wrong in any more ways ?
This is in response to someone who did n't want to use SSDs for reliability reasons .
Wednesday , August 4 , 2010
The database is usually a critical piece of infrastructure in an organization ; when the database is down , many things stop working , so database reliability is often a serious concern .
While the reliability of database software is important , for Postgres it is often the infrastructure that Postgres depends on that causes outages , not Postgres itself .
We see this regularly on the Postgres email lists .
To get started , a fundamental assumption has to be discarded — that computers are abstract machines and always do what they are told .
While we often treat hardware as abstract devices , in reality they are physical , and are susceptible to failure just like any physical entity .
So , what things can go wrong ?
First , consider disk drives .
This Slashdot comment explains how non-atomic disk drive really are :
Disks have a lot , and I mean a LOT of ECC on them .
It is not a situation of " I need to write a 1 so I 'll place one at this location on the drive . "
They use a complex encoding scheme so that bit errors on the disk do n't yield data errors to the user . …
Then there 's the fact that bits are n't even stored as bits really .
…
They are written using flux reversals , but the level is not carefully controlled , it can't be .
So when you read the data the drive actually looks at an analogue wave .
Yikes — that certainly makes me feel less confident about disk storage , and its abstract , predictable behavior .
Many people are concerned about disk drive , so many people use inexpensive RAID controllers and believe their reliability issues are solved .
Then there is the problem of disks not storing data permanently before acknowledging the write ( writeback caching ) ; this is covered extensively in the Postgres manuals .
RAM is also not an abstraction — it can fail too .
This article does a great job of diagnosing an executable that suddenly stopped working due to a RAM error .
Finally , the motherboard can fail too .
Last month there were extensive reports about Dell distributing faulty motherboards , and covering up the fact , with failure rates up to 97 % !
All this information underscores how fragile hardware can be , and highlights that hardware reliability is a significant aspect of overall database reliability .
Update : Dell has settled the court case over covering up the shipment of defective motherboards .
2010-09-26
Update : More details on the Dell cover up .

I wrote an article about the Postgres development process for the Japan PostgreSQL Users Group ( JPUG ) and they have now published it in English and Japanese .
It highlights many of the processes that make Postgres open source development different , frustrating , and effective , with section titles like " No Single Authority " , " No Bug Tracking System " , and " No Development Roadmap " .
Tuesday , August 3 , 2010
While Steve Jobs tried to blame everyone but Apple for poor iPhone 4 reception , this article calls this long - term good news for the iPhone and smartphones in general because smartphone designers will increase their focus on call quality .
This mirrors the competing interests that are often involved in technological progress :
" Almost everything about technology , to me , is a response to a negative .
Something is n't working right .
Something does n't look right .
Something does n't perform right , " Petroski told me .
" And you try to remove that negative quality and that change is presumably an improvement .
But then you release the new and improved product and people find faults with it .
Because nothing is perfect .
You always have competing constraints . "
Postgres certainly has always dealt with this issue , and fortunately we do n't have to release millions of devices to find out we made a mistake .
We often find out very early , often hours after it is committed , so we usually avoid these pitfalls .
Update : Interestingly , this article argues that most phone conversation is inferior to electronic communication .

Object - Relational Mappers are often a hot topic of discussion among database geeks .
At oscon 's PGDay this year , Christophe Pettus presented the clearest explanation I have ever heard of the complexities of ORMs and the basically unattainable expectations users have for them .
The basic problem is that it is easy to map simple ORM operations into SQL , but complex cases and mass changes require access to SQL for performance .
Christophe explained why ORMs increase programmer productivity , but also why ORMs will never be able to do everything SQL can , so organizations should be prepared to add SQL to their ORM systems where appropriate .
A video recording was made of this talk and hopefully it will be posted soon .

Adding features to Postgres is often a frustrating experience for all involved .
Some features are clear - cut , but many are subject to interpretation and involve much email discussion .
The email discussion is often draining , but this comment from a Slashdot thread about Linux desktop innovation is illuminating .
The comment is about human interface engineereers asking for tiny application changes to improve usability , and while the application developer was originally " distracted trying to decide a fitting way to end the e-mail authors life " , he ultimately agreed that the changes improved the user experience .
I think Postgres developers often feel the same way .
Monday , July 26 , 2010
I mentioned in March that user videos would be created at PG East .
Those videos have now been released .
Hopefully they will be useful in promoting Postgres .

I have decide to attend the surge conference in Baltimore in September .
It is being hosted by Postgres - friendly OmniTI , who just did several Postgres - related presentations at oscon ( Robert Treat , Theo Schlossnagle ) .
As a database internals guy , my focus is so much on the software that I often know little about how Postgres is deployed at high - volume sites ; I hope to learn about that at the conference .
With so much Postgres activity in the United States now , I am doing little travel to international conferences ( schedule ) .
Sunday , July 25 , 2010
I had a great time again at oscon , and feel more energized than ever about Postgres .
Because I attend oscon every year , it is a great event to gauge changes in Postgres adoption and mindshare .
Years ago , Postgres visibility at oscon was minimal , but now Postgres is a major player at the conference .
For example , our booth this year was no longer in the open source section ( A.K.A. the open source ghetto ) , but in the section with commercial vendors .
We had abundant booth staffing , thanks to Gabrielle , and artistically designed staff t- shirts ( image , image , image ) , thanks to Josh Berkus .
I think we were moved to the commercial section because our booth staff and activity often overwhelm smaller booths .
The conference had major tutorials ( 1 , 2 ) and sessions about Postgres , and Postgres as often mentioned in non-database - specific sessions , including the closing session .
I heard one non-database session polled the audience about how many attendees had lost data on specific databases — obviously we did very well in that poll .
So , in summary , great conference , great presentations , and Postgres looked great too !

There is one week until the Postgres Pool Party at my home .
No RSVP necessary .
Friday , July 16 , 2010
An email list posting this week revealed that Postgres will be used on the International Space Station by the end of the year , specifically " to store the data on orbit and then replicate that db on the ground " .
Postgres has always been heavily used by NASA and other government agencies , but this is a uniquely " high " - profile use of Postgres .

Some Postgres users have created an detailed outline of Postgres 9.0 features with practical examples of almost every feature .
If you are curious about what is coming in 9.0 or are confused by the 9.0 release notes , this is a must read .

I am teaching another Drexel University database class this summer called Database Theory .
This class builds on the Database Systems class I taught last summer , and again heavily uses Postgres .
The class covers many of the practical challenges of database management , like replication , internals , security , and managing large systems .
As you can see from the syllabus , I was able to enlist the help of local open source contributors as guest lecturers .
The first class is tomorrow .
Wednesday , June 16 , 2010
If you are near Philadelphia , you are invited to attend the 2010 Postgres Pool Party at my home :

I have simplified my presentation , The Magic of Hot Streaming Replication , to show a hot / streaming setup without the need to archive WAL files .
This greatly simplifies the setup , and is possible thanks to wal_keep_segments , which allows the retention of a sufficient number of WAL files in / pg_xlog for the slave without the requirement of configuring continuous archiving .
When I originally researched hot standby and streaming replication , I focused on it as an extension of continuous archiving , but I now realize that continuous archiving is unnecessary and overly - complicates the setup if all you need is a read - only , standby server , and do n't need the point - in - time recovery features of continuous archiving .

This email thread discusses the advantages ( ease of management ) and disadvantages ( uneven performance , poor reliability ) of running Postgres on Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) using Elastic Block Stores ( EBS ) .
It includes the idea of using multiple EBS volumes in RAID10 , and using multiple EC2 database clusters for redundancy .
One quote is telling , " It 's possible to run a larger database on EC2 , but it takes a lot of work , careful planning and a thick skin . "
A similar thread from a year ago had a similar cost / benefit analysis .
Wednesday , May 12 , 2010
While conventional economics theorizes that increased rewards always leads to better output , this video suggests that many activities , particularly creative ones , produce worse output with increased rewards .
The video shows various cases where this can happen , and even interviews open source contributors as a tangible example of people working without financial reward .
This video answers a question I have been asked many times , " Why do people contribute to open source ? " , and it answers it better than I ever have .
Basically , once people have adequate compensation , people are often motivated more by creative challenges than by money .
A corollary of this is that financial reward can distort creative output .
This might explain why the Postgres user and developer experience feels different from proprietary software — because there are few financial distortions to interfere with the creative work of designing and using Postgres .
Update : Another video about financial incentives

After community discussion , pg_migrator has been renamed to " pg_upgrade " and will be an additional supplied module ( / contrib ) in the main server distribution of Postgres 9.0 ( documentation ) .
( It will appear in Postgres 9.0 beta 2 . ) Pg_Upgrade supports upgrades from Postgres 8.3.X and 8.4.X to Postgres 9.0 .
As you can see from the documentation , many of the restrictions of upgrading from 8.3 to 8.4 are gone , even for upgrades from Postgres 8.3 directly to 9.0 .
This signals a more serious committment from the community to try to provide non -dump / restore major upgrades .
The pg_migrator pgFoundry project will continue , but will not be enhanced to support new major versions of Postgres — it will remain only to support upgrades to Postgres 8.4 .

It is rare for me to hear about a new replication option , but I heard about one involving pgpool - II last week at the New York PostgreSQL Meetup Group .
pgpool - II is not only a connection pooler but supports load balancing by sending data - modification queries to every host , while it load - balances read - only queries across all hosts .
One major problem with this usage is that non-deterministic functions , e.g. , random ( ) , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP , can produce different results when sent to multiple hosts .
pgpool - II 2.3 and later handles some of these cases , but not all of them .
Fully - correct operation requires either developers or administrators to handle unsupported non-deterministic functions .
This new replication option involves using pgpool - II in ' master_slave_mode ' , which causes all data modification queries to be sent to the master , and the master replicates those changes ( without non-deterministic side - effects ) to the other slave nodes in the pgpool cluster .
This diagram ( page 19 ) illustrates this setup .
This new configuration allows pgpool - II to be used in more complex environments with reduced developer and administrator maintenance .
Postgres 9.0's hot standby feature makes this even easier to use .
Update : pgpool 3.0 will improve routing of write queries to the master .
Monday , April 26 , 2010
With the final Postgres 9.0 commitfest completed two months ago , you might be wondering what is delaying 9.0 beta 1 .
Along with the normal cleanup of open items , most of the time has been spent finalizing the behavior of our two big 9.0 features , streaming replication and hot standby ( which I mentioned previously ; presentation available ) .
Someone asked me to explain what that testing process looks like , and the most graphic description I could think of was a massive automobile accident ( image ; those fire trucks are our developers analyzing the failure ) .
It is as ugly as an automobile accident , e.g. :
server does n't start if I stop it while doing a backup with a slave connected
slave cannot connect if configuration options are not set correctly , but poor feedback is given
slave shows massive overhead when applying streaming logs
configuration variables are unsettable and confusing to a normal user
Postgres has a reputation for adding features that are reliable , even if those features are complex .
That does n't happen by accident — all the work happening now is to make sure these features are as robust and as easy to use as possible when 9.0 is released .
I would love to avoid this messy period , but there is no alternatives if Postgres 9.0 is to be as good as all previous Postgres releases .
The good news is we are getting close to being ready for beta .

Initially the lure of Virtual Machines ( VM ) was to allow multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a laptop .
This is particularly useful if you need to run many applications that are only supported certain operating systems , e.g. , MS Office .
VMs have also always been popular for testing and development .
( This video presents a simplified explaination of virtualization . )
However , recently VM usage has grown and are now regularly used on production servers .
This recent community email post highlights the advantages of using VMs for production deployments :
fewer production servers ( e.g. , only two servers can host all VMs )
simpler deployments ( administrators can easily copy VMs to production servers )
more reliable deployments ( VMs provide a self - contained environment , with fewer potential problems during deployment )
better scalability ( VMs can be given more server resources as necessary )
easier testing ( VMs can be copied and tested independently of the deployment server )
improved reliability ( VMs can be easily started on standby servers once they become production servers )
VMs seem to have the greatest benefit for production use when the deployments or workload are dynamic , or many operating systems are involved .
However , there are still legitimate concerns over VM use in production .
The VM does add overhead compared to raw - iron deployments ( 5 - 10 % ) .
Another concern is that the fsync flush to disk properly happens through the VM layer ( email ) .
Postgres has some advantages when used with VMs :
no licensing issues
all data is stored in the file system ( no raw storage )
sessions can make use of added CPUs without reconfiguration
additional memory can be automatically used by the kernel buffer cache
shared_buffers and workmem can be changed , but require modification of postgresql.conf
Postgres security is powerful and flexible
VMs that allow adding memory and CPU without restart ( e.g. , vSphere , Xen ) can take advantage of many of these features dynamically .
In fact , the only configuration setting that can't be modified without database restart to take advantage of " hot " ( non-restart ) resource changes is shared_buffers .
We clearly are going to be seeing more installations of Postgres on VM and cloud architectures in the future .
If you are interested in how cloud computing relates to virtualization , this video explains it well .

Solid - state drives ( SSD ) are getting larger and more popular .
Initially , SSDs appeared to be ideal for databases because they potentially allow fast I/O with non-volatile storage — unfortunately , neither of these is completely true .
Let me explain :
Fast I/O : While SSDs offer random I / O speeds far in excess of traditional hard drives ( because there are no moving platters or heads ) , the sequential I/O speed of SSDs is only marginally better than mechanical drives .
Database activity that causes random I/O , like index scans that do not fit in RAM , will benefit from SSDs ' superior random I/O speeds , but sequential scans only marginally benefit by using SSDs .
( Greg Smith explains the limited use case for SSDs in this email . )
Postgres 9.0 will allow random page cost to be set per tablespace so administrators can indicate that random I/O has the same speed as sequential I/O for SSD - based tablespaces .
Non-Volatile Storage : Because SSDs offer permanent storage , it is often believed that they are an ideal place to store the Postgres Write - Ahead Logs ( WAL ) which are flushed to disk on every transaction commit .
However , SSDs typically write data in 256 kilobyte chunks , meaning the small write operations that occur at every commit are not ideal for SSD drives , and might not even be flushed to permanent storage immediately .
( Many SSD vendors have been vague about this behavior . )
( FYI , Fusion - io drives are getting good reviews . )
This paper explains the internal workings of SSD drives , and the article summary contains this warning :
We find that SSD performance and lifetime is highly workload - sensitive , and that complex systems problems that normally appear higher in the storage stack , or even in distributed systems , are relevant to device firmware .
In summary , SSD drives are not the panacea we hoped , or at least , not yet .
A battery - backed disk drive controller is still the ideal solution for high performance at a reasonable cost .
This Postgres email thread from November and December covers many of these details .

Having just blogged about NoSQL , I think the primary lesson the Postgres community can learn from NoSQL is that not everyone needs all our features , and if it can be easily accomplished , we should allow users to trade features for some of the NoSQL desired behaviors .
We already do that in some cases :
You can improve speed by delaying or eliminating durability ( synchronous_commit , fsync )
You can reduce consistency overhead by not defining constraints
You can use prepared queries to avoid parser and optimizer overhead
Arrays can often be used to avoid join overhead
You can store non-structured data with hstore
You can serve stale data using multi-master asynchronous replication ( Bucardo )
However , there are a few things that will be difficult to allow :
Non-SQL access to data
Reduced overhead by eliminating atomicity or isolation
I can't think of any new behaviors we could optionally allow for potential NoSQL users , but we should be looking to provide them where possible .
Update :
One thing on our TODO list that might help potential NoSQL users is the implementation of a native JSON data type .
JSON is used as a storage format for many NoSQL databases .
Update :
This article is a review of several NoSQL and Web Service databases .
Update : Another article about NoSQL 2010 - 10 - 21
Saturday , April 10 , 2010
There is lots of buzz about NoSQL databases these days , and thanks to my attendance at Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise Conference , I have learned more about them .
I heard a talk about Cassandra , and another about MongoDB .
NoSQL databases differ in several ways from relational databases :
crude or no query language ( clients do much of the processing normally done by SQL )
no joins ( data must be joined client - side )
sacrifice ACID and transaction properties for speed , fault tolerance , or easy addition and removal of nodes
Few are excited about losing these valuable relational database features , but if your query response and infrastructure requirements can't be met by relational databases , and you can accept these limitations ( think social media sites or search engines ) , NoSQL makes perfect sense .

Multiversion Concurrency Control ( MVCC ) is the method used by Postgres to provide high read / write concurrency .
You might not have heard of it , but if you have heard the Postgres locking behavior described as " readers do n't block writers , and writers do n't block readers " , MVCC is what allows that behavior .
Postgres was an early implementor of MVCC , but now most relations systems use it .
I attended the Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise Conference today and heard an interesting talk related to MVCC .
It applied the ideas of MVCC ( which allows for high concurrency ) to the problem of parallel programming , which is becoming more necessary as massively multi-core systems become more common .
Specifically , the talk was about Clojure , by its author Rich Hickey .
Clojure uses MVCC for the access and modification of program data , allowing parallel programming with no locking necessary in the client code ; Closure does all the MVCC , and is ACID - compliant , except without durability ( " D " ) .
Traditional multi-core - enabled programming involves threads and explicit locking , just like pre-MVCC database systems , but Clojure requires none of that .
It is as though a threaded program used Postgres to read and write its variables so it did n't need to do any locking , except the MVCC layer is moved into the client language .
This is certainly a radical approach , but so was MVCC when it was initially implemented in database systems .

I am speaking at New York PostgreSQL Meetup Group on April 20th about Postgres replication solutions .
This will be a much larger group than previous New York City Postgres meetings ; 13 people have already registered .
Tuesday , March 30 , 2010
My slides from PG East are now online , and I will be giving a webcast of that presentation in late April .
The presentation covers the new Postgres 9.0 features of hot standby and streaming replication : how they work , how to configure them , and their current limitations .
The presentation also includes a live demonstration of setting up these features .

PG East was an unqualified success , as others have already blogged about .
This conference might signal a change in the style for dedicated Postgres conferences .
Postgres - specific conferences started only a few years ago , mostly at universities .
I was one of the early proponents of having conferences at universities after seeing the success of fosdem .
I felt the low admission cost made possible with inexpensive university facilities was critical in attracting the mostly - volunteer Postgres developers to the conference .
I am ready to rethink that suggestion having attended PG East .
The conference cost only USD $ 125 , and many things were definitely easier having the event in a hotel :
Informal conversations
Attracting business users to the show
Group excursions
Laptop and bag storage
The ability to facilitate informal conversations is an important part of any event , and one of the things that excite attendees and keeps them coming back .
I thought the convenience of having everyone in a single hotel would be prohibitively expensive , but PG East proved that was n't true .
We did have significant business sponsorship of the event , but I found the sponsorship to be tasteful and it did not detract from the event .
I wonder if other Postgres conferences will take this approach too .
Saturday , March 20 , 2010
I have completed the Postgres 9.0 release notes and you can view them online .
There will , of course , be many adjustments to the release notes before 9.0 final .
Monday , March 15 , 2010
The upcoming PG East Conference is in my home town , Philadelphia .
The conference promises to be a new generation of Postgres conferences , and I want to highlight some of the changes that attendees can expect .
First , as I mentioned before , the hotel venue for this conference is much nicer than typical Postgres conferences .
Also , it is located in an area of Philadelphia that is packed with great restaurants and shops .
The conference opens on Thursday , March 25 , and the day includes two simultaneous talks every hour , including talks about migrating from MySQL , the use of Postgres at myYearbook.com , and hardware benchmarking .
I bet the MySQL talk will be packed .
There are many more business - oriented and end - user - focused talks than previous Postgres conferences .
Friday starts with a keynote by fellow Armenian Ed Boyajian , who is giving a non-technical talk challenging the community to expand its reach .
The day also includes talks by a Forrester consultant ( which I already mentioned ) , by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) about how they use PostGIS to map airports , and , a sure favorite , a talk about the exciting new features in Postgres 9.0 .
A free party is planned for Friday night .
Saturday contains three or four simultaneous talks every hour , with many deeply technical talks .
The big challenge will be picking which talks to attend .
Sunday offers three different five - hour training sessions .
I am hoping to offer tours of Philadelphia for visitors on Monday .
Why Attend :
The conferences has created a web site about why you should attend , including pictures .
Practically , while the talks are exciting , the real value of this conference is for you to see a new dimension of Postgres .
By spending time with many of the Postgres community developers and other Postgres users , you can get a better understanding of what makes Postgres different , not only from proprietary databases , but also from other open source databases .
( PGCon in Ottawa in May has even more developers . )
Postgres developers might not look the most polished , but they have a passion for databases that sets them apart , and that will make you more confident in your choice to use Postgres .
As I have heard many times before , you can't believe it until you 've seen it .
Monday , March 15 , 2010
I have started preparing the release notes for Postgres 9.0 .
I went into great detail last year about how the release notes are created , so I will not bore you with the mind - numbing details this time .
I should be ready with the first draft in a week or two .
Update : I have completed stage # 3 .
2010-03-16 03:33:20 GMT
Update2 : I am over 50 % done stage # 4 .
2010-03-17 22:00:48 GMT
Update3 : I am done stage # 4 .

EnterpriseDB believes in the marketing potential of videos .
You might remember them producing a video of me explaining pg_migrator last year .
This year , they will be interviewing PG East attendees to create a Postgres user testimonial video .
The community has not used videos extensively for marketing , partly because , while it is easy to create a video , it is difficult to create a good video .
( Consider the quality of the average YouTube video . )
Anyway , my guess is that the video will be something like this customer video .
The video will be shared with the community to help promote Postgres worldwide .

Many people are waiting for Postgres 9.0 , so here is a status report about the release .
Two weeks ago we completed the last 9.0 CommitFest and released 9.0 Alpha 4 .
We are now working on a 9.0 open items list .
There are relatively few open items compared to previous major releases because there are now more developers focused on closing open items .
Once we deal with all the items on that list , and any new items that appear , we can release the first 9.0 beta .
Technically , we could release a beta before dealing with all open items as long as we are sure that none of the existing open items will require cluster reinitialization ( initdb ) .
Friday , February 26 , 2010
A month ago I mentioned a surprising number of Postgres activities in Philadelphia .
One month later , those events are past but now there are more .
First , PG
East is shaping up to be a big conference :
The conference agenda looks very full , with both developer and business - oriented talks .
The business - oriented focus is rather new for Postgres conferences , and I think signals more mainstream adoption of Postgres .
It is at the Warwick Hotel .
This lobby photo should give you a good idea of how nice the hotel is — we will simply have to adjust to having a Postgres conference in a fancy hotel .
Noel Yuhanna of Forrester Research will be speaking .
He is the person who authored last year 's Forrester Wave report that found Ingres and MySQL as the leading open source databases ( news report ) .
You can judge for yourself how much " research " went into that report , but we will be nice to him — a bodyguard will be unnecessary .
Registrations are now being accepted .
There is a useful " Reasons to Attend " page that will help people who are undecided .
Second , it looks like I will be co-teaching a database class at Drexel University again this summer , but this time , a new , more advanced class that will highlight Postgres technology .
Drexel wants to expand their database offerings and train skilled Postgres engineers .
Postgres certainly offers students a unique opportunity to understand database technology .

With so many ways of electronically communicating in the Postgres community , why blog ?
I have thought about that question and want to list the various electronically communication methods and their advantages :
Email : Email is great for task - oriented communication .
It reaches a large audience and allows for deliberate , consensus - oriented solutions .
Instant Messaging / IRC :
This allows for quick feedback for dynamic tasks .
I often use it to get a quick opinions before using other communication methods , or for dealing with complex problems that can't be easily phrased in an email .
Blog : I find this best for status reports and thought pieces .
It reaches a large audience that is looking for that kind of information .
Wiki :
The wiki is great for information that is both dynamic and needs to be retained , e.g. , team projects , driver lists .
Documentation :
This is for permanent information that should be seen by all Postgres users .
As you can see , this thought piece is best presented as a blog post .

A few weeks ago I learned there was serious confusion over the client - side Python drivers available for Postgres .
This chart shows many Python drivers , but the recommended libpq - based driver , Psycopg , was listed on the chart as GPL licensed .
This would require programs that use the driver to also be GPL licensed .
However , the license is not actually GPL but a complicated hybrid license .
Fortunately , the Psycopg author has agreed to relicense his Python driver under the LGPL in the next release , and there is hope that Postgres developers will get involved to help add any missing features to the driver .

Postgres does not require copyright assignment from contributors because it is BSD licensed .
Unlike the GPL , there is no enforcement component in the BSD license .
When code and documentation are contributed to the project , the authors give the project the right to distribute their contributions under the BSD license .
However , technically , authors also retain full rights to their contributions .
Of course , there is little practical difference between retaining full rights and obtaining contributions under the BSD license .
Anyway , while all work submitted to Postgres is covered under the BSD license , the existence of individual copyright lines in our source code , e.g. , © Joe Coder , makes company lawyers nervous , so we have a policy of avoiding such content .
Unfortunately , this policy has been active only during the past five years and was not always universally enforced .
For this reason , we occasionally have to ask authors for permission to remove their copyright lines , or in drastic cases , rewrite trivial code segments when the author cannot be contacted .
We perform such cleanups periodically as the personal copyrights are brought to our attention , e.g. , 2006 , 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 .
We believe we have finally removed all personal copyrights from our source code .
Postgres 9.0 will be the first release of Postgres that has no individual copyright statements .
Now , the existence of personal copyright statements is insignificant , but their complete removal will probably allow some corporate lawyers to sleep more soundly .

Leonard Shapiro of Portland State University has created some excellent Postgres university course material .
His first course , Introduction to Databases , teaches databases from a Postgres perspective .
His higher - level course , Relational DMBS / Database Internals , covers many aspects of Postgres in greater detail than is covered in the Postgres manuals .
You might remember I taught a university class last year .
I hope someday to able to teach a higher - level course that makes use of Professor Shapiro 's material , with his permission , of course .

I am not sure people are aware that you can find the source code location of any generated server log message .
When log_error_verbosity is set to ' verbose ' , additional details are output that can help diagnose errors .
Specifically , I have added this to the Postgres 9.0 documentation :
VERBOSE output includes the SQLSTATE error code and the source code file name , function name , and line number that generated the error .
Here is some sample output :
ERROR : 42P01 : relation " lkjasdf " does not exist at character 15 LOCATION : parserOpenTable , parse_relation .
c:857 STATEMENT : select * from lkjasdf ;
Such information can help when reporting errors to the community , particularly if the error message is not in English .

Many computer programmers are introverts because they have chosen the solitary job of creating programs that accomplish specific tasks .
Open source developers are probably even more prone to be introverts because the ( boring ? ) meetings , office chit-chat , and lunch outings are mostly gone , with the only communication being via email , instant messaging , twitter , and blogs .
Open source social interaction is certainly more controlled than traditional communication .
This excellent article describes introverts as generally misunderstood :
Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand , because extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in voluble , and frequently inescapable , interaction with other people .
They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs .
But the street does not run both ways .
Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion .
They assume that company , especially their own , is always welcome .
They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone ; indeed , they often take umbrage at the suggestion .
The Postgres community is probably filled with introverts , and that 's to be expected , considering that our work does not have the kind of regular personal interaction that would keep extroverts happy .
It is no surprise that introverts thrive in our community .
This also makes conferences even more valuable — it is a chance to be with other people who care about the same things we care about , and to tell some jokes .
Of course , the conference talks are always good , but what stays with me after conferences is not the knowledge I have gained , but the people I have met and learned more about .
Update : A good video presentation about introverts

On Monday Josh Berkus requested suggestions for a new Postgres slogan .
Our current slogan , " The world 's most advanced open source database " , was chosen in the early years of the project to distinguish ourselves from other open source databases , and it is easy to see why we should consider a change at this time .
The suggestions fit into several categories , some serious , some humorous .
Continued discussion is taking place on the advocacy ( pgsql-advocacy@postgresql.org ) email list .

I was approached in the fall about speaking at various Philadelphia computer user group meetings .
Now that I am home I have been able to speak at several , and it is clear there is greatly increased interest in Postgres here in the Philadelphia area , and I bet in other cities as well .
For example , in January / February , I am speaking at :
Philadelphia area Linux User Group ( PLUG ) – North
Philadelphia area Linux User Group ( PLUG ) – West
The Mathlab at Drexel University
A Drexel University class
I am also speaking in Albany ( full event list ) , and of course the big event for March is the PG East 2010 conference , also in Philadelphia .
This year the conference has been extended for four days , and one of those days is made up of tutorials , which is great for new Postgres users .
I am giving one on Postgres administration , and there are two others being given at the same time .
I think it is likely there will be a huge increase in the number of conference attendees compared to last year .
For those of you in other cities , you might want to contact your local computer user groups to see if they would be interested in hearing a talk about Postgres .
There is a lot of renewed interest in what our community is doing .

I have always thought there were three possible threats to Postgres :
Control of the Internet domain name
Patent attacks
Hiring of volunteers to work on unrelated projects
The first issue is that our web domains are owned by a single individual , though others are able to modify the domain .
The second involves patent attacks , which seems to be a risk for all software .
The third item is a more general version of the skill siphoning / brain drain email thread I blogged about last year , but with a sinister goal of hiring away developers to work on anything but Postgres .
As Postgres becomes more widely adopted , these attacks become more likely .
Are there other threats I have not listed ?
Are there more steps we can take to protect ourselves ?

Last week EnterpriseDB put out a press release with an inaccurate title .
Instead of being titled , " EnterpriseDB Responds to EU Decision to Approve Oracle 's Acquisition of MySQL " , it was unfortunately titled " Postgres Community Responds ... " .
This has the potential to confuse journalists into thinking that Postgres development is not community controlled , and that 's the last thing we want to happen at this point , with MySQL 's problem in this area starkly highlighted .
This dovetails well with the blog entry I posted a few weeks ago titled , " Do n't Confuse Companies with Community " .

Based on recent discussions , I am wondering if Postgres is poised for a significant adoption increase in the next year .
This is based on a few events :
The upcoming Postgres 9.0 release , which I just blogged about
The unstable economy , which is causing many companies to rethink their software spending practices
The uncertainty surrounding other databases , both proprietary and open source
The last time Postgres appeared poised for another adoption increase was in 2005 , with the release of PostgreSQL 8.0 , when the native Windows port was introduced .
I would say that release marked the point where Postgres became a respected open source database ; prior to that we had a reputation of being slow and hard to manage .
We had made changes for years before that , but the 8.0 release helped solidify our reputation .
The 9.0 release has the potential for Postgres to move from a respected open source database to a respected mainstream database , because , frankly , how many other databases are attracting new users at the rate we are ?
— very few .
Thursday , January 28 , 2010
Last week Dave Page announced that the next major release of Postgres will be numbered 9.0 , rather than 8.5 as previous expected .
This change was made because the next major PostgreSQL release will include built - in log - streaming replication , and that has always been considered a feature worthy of increasing the first version number .
While Postgres has had log - based replication support for a few releases , the 9.0 release will allow logs to be streamed to the slave using network transfer , which greatly increases the frequency at which logs can reasonably be sent .
It also allows the slave server to accept read - only queries ( hot standby ) , again a major feature addition .

It seems the European Commission studying the Oracle purchase of Sun/MySQL has finally realized Postgres is a viable open source alternative to MySQL and has approved the purchase :
The Commission 's investigation showed that another open source database , PostgreSQL , is considered by many database users to be a credible alternative to MySQL and could be expected to replace to some extent the competitive force currently exerted by MySQL on the database market .
This article , titled in part , " If MySQL fails , there 's always PostgreSQL " , puts it even more succinctly .
I know many MySQL people worked very hard campaigning against approval , and I am sure they are disappointed by the outcome .
Postgres users should thank them because even though they lost , their work has increased the visibility of all open source databases , including PostgreSQL .

I mentioned two years ago that I was going to read through the Postgres documentation to see if I could improve it .
Now , two years later , I have read through only 25 % of the manual .
( I will be making a commit to the " Administration " book in the next week . )
My new plan is to solicit volunteers to complete the proofreading of the entire manual .
I have created a wiki describing the process and how to get involved .
Amazingly , someone took responsibility for a book even before I announced the existence of the wiki .
I have also emailed a few people who have offered proofreading assistance in the past .

There have recently been several excellent blog posts by Postgres community members regarding the campaign by MySQL developers to block the purchase of Sun Microsystems by Oracle .
Unfortunately , I think a fatal mistake was made by the MySQL developers years ago when they equated the success of MySQL AB , the company , with the success of MySQL , the software .
They are not the same , but , tragically , it is too late to undo that mistake .
I think the majority of Postgres developers understand the distinction between the success of their companies and the success of the PostgreSQL project .
Most of us agree that the success of the PostgreSQL project is a purpose far greater than our individual or company successes .
While the Postgres project will undoubtedly make mistakes in the future , confusing company success with community success will probably not be one of them .
As credit and economic activity continue to contract , analysts are warning of big problems and unprecedented fiat - money creation by the Federal Reserve System in the near future .
“ Get ready for the cliff - edge , ” warned Royal Bank of Scotland credit chief Andrew Roberts in a note to clients late last week .
He said “ monster ” quantitative monetary easing ( money printing ) is coming and that investors should “ Be long gold .
Think the unthinkable . ”
“ We can not stress enough how strongly we believe that a cliff - edge may be around the corner , for the global banking system ( particularly in Europe ) , and for the global economy ( particularly in the US / Europe ) , ” Roberts added .
“ This all sounds somewhat doomsdayish , so we should update how the real economy / banking is panning out for us .
It is saying : the end - game approaches . ”
The note also suggested investors take a look at Fed boss Ben Bernanke ’s piece " Deflation : Making Sure It Does n’t Happen Here . "
In it , “ Helicopter Ben , ” who once proposed dropping federal reserve notes from helicopters if necessary , explained : " The US government has a technology , called a printing press , that allows it to produce as many US dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost . "
The cost of physically printing the “ dollars ” may be low — but for a look at the true cost of runaway money creation , see Zimbabwe , the Weimar Republic , and other nations that have debased their currencies and destroyed their economies using the “ printing press . ”
Roberts ’ “ monster ” money printing comments grabbed headlines world wide , from CNBC to the Telegraph .
And other analysts agree .
“ With central banks , especially the Fed and the Bank of England , printing money in large amounts ( “ quantitative easing ” ) , the risks are considerable , ” noted Tom Burroughes of Wealth Briefing .
“ Such ‘ monster ’ money creation is reckless , in my view , bearing in mind that the US authorities have already hosed financial markets with new money , ” he said , referring to the RBS note .
“ Alas , it appears that some policymakers seem to have forgotten the argument that ultimately , crises that were caused by years of cheap money will not be solved by even more cheap money , ” Burroughes concluded .
Investment giant PIMCO has also warned of serious central - bank - fuelled inflation in recent days .
" Over the longer term , certainly we have to be wary of higher inflation being a ‘ solution ' to persistent deficits everywhere , ” said portfolio manager Mihir Worah .
“ [ L] ooking further ahead , significantly higher inflation is a real possibility owing first to capacity destruction , and the many unusual measures central banks have taken . "
But despite renewed interest in the issue , warnings about massive inflation of the money supply are not new .
Austrian economists have been sounding the alarm bell for decades — and been proved correct .
And more recently , other prominent analysts have even raised the prospect of hyperinflation in America .
" In the US , we have a totally new school , and it ’s called the Zimbabwe school , " legendary investor Marc Faber told CNBC last year .
" And it ’s founded by one of the great leaders of this world , Mr Robert Mugabe , that has managed to totally impoverish his own country .
And that is the monetary policy the US is pursuing . "
He said U.S. inflation rates could eventually hit 200 percent .
At the moment , as reported by The New American recently , several indicators point toward the possibility of short - term deflation .
The M3 measure of money in circulation is actually shrinking despite massive new money creation .
This is mainly because the velocity of money is very low as banks refuse to lend and businesses and consumers refuse to borrow .
But even if there is some mild “ deflation ” in prices in the near term ( not good in a fiat - money economy ) , analysts say the authorities ’ response will be to “ stimulate ” and print more money , ultimately leading to the possibility of wild inflation .
“ Eventually we ’ll have much higher inflation rates because if deflation comes first , they ’re going to have even more stimulus packages and even more [ money ] printing , ” Faber told Yahoo !
Finance in an interview .
“ It ’s crazy to even suggest additional stimulus , but that is what the Keynesians believe is the right thing to do .
And that will bankrupt Western governments — not just in the U.S. , but everywhere . ”
Other market analysts in Europe have said the Fed is now in a position where it has to print money , no matter what it says publicly .
" The response to the coming deflationary maelstrom will be additional money printing that will make the recent [ quantitative easing ] seem insignificant , " noted analyst Albert Edwards with Societe Generale , one of Europe ’s biggest banks .
Recent “ quantitative easing ” has been in the trillions of dollars , so making that “ seem insignificant ” will require quite a feat .
But with Bernanke at the printing press helm , it is certainly not out of the question .
“ Sufficient injections of money will ultimately always reverse a deflation , " the Fed chief said .
News reports say the theoretical upper limit for the Fed ’s “ easing ” has been set at around $ 5 trillion ( although the government has estimated that Americans could already be on the hook for more than $ 27 trillion ) .
The problem , however , is not a lack of fiat money “ injections . ”
It is systemic .
Bernanke can’t fix it by flooding the world with paper debt - notes — he ca n’t fix it at all , even though it was caused by the Fed .
The whole Federal Reserve debt - money scheme must be replaced with sound money .
As reported by The New American magazine in an article entitled “ Fed Manipulations in the Crosshairs , ” the central bank is manipulating every sector of the economy for the benefit of special interests .
And even if it was in the hands of better “ experts “ who were n‘t rigging the market , the problem of perpetual debt remains : the Fed introduces money into the economy as debt and demands interest on that debt , but where is the money to pay the interest going to come from ?
The Fed is already owed all the money .
Of course , Fed officials do n’t think regular people should be commenting on their actions .
“ For those who want to really know what the best that economics has to offer is , you must look here , ” wrote Richmond Fed economist Kartik Athreya condescendingly in a widely publicized critique of bloggers and anyone with an opinion on economics who has not “ taken a year of PhD coursework in a decent economics department . ”
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard , international business editor for the U.K.
Telegraph , blasted the Fed apologist ’s audacity and raised the question of whether it is " Time to shut down the US Federal Reserve ? "
The devastation caused by the Fed is easy to see even without a PhD .
It should be denounced by everyone , regardless of what Athreya and other cartel spokespeople think about it , lest the central bank finish wrecking the American economy once and for all .
DUBLIN HAD been designated a Unesco City of Literature – a title which is for perpetuity – Lord Mayor Gerry Breen announced yesterday .
Dublin is only the fourth city to be awarded the title : the other cities are Edinburgh , Melbourne , and Iowa City .
In his speech , outside the capital ’s Grand Canal Theatre , Mr Breen alluded to the fact that James Joyce had considered “ there was no greater calling in life than to be lord mayor of a city and that of all the cities in the world , he would like to be Lord Mayor of Dublin . ”
He then declared : “ If I had to choose between being the author of Ulyssesor the Lord Mayor of Dublin , I would always choose to be the Lord Mayor of Dublin . ”
Minister for Culture Mary Hanafin was also present .
In her speech , she noted the designation was “ a great recognition of the vast literary wealth for which we are renowned and will be a welcome boost for cultural tourism ” .
The application was three years in development , overseen by the library service of Dublin City Council , and was submitted in November last year to Unesco ’s headquarters in Paris .
“ Even though it ’s a designation for the city , it ’s an honour for all Irish writers , ” explained Jane Alger of Dublin City Libraries .
“ It means literature will be brought to the top of the cultural arts agenda . ”
There were a number of writers present for the announcement , who had been informed of the designation in recent days , and it ’s surely a tribute to a town which loves to gossip that the embargo of the news held till yesterday .
Some writers were not yet sure what the title Unesco City of Literature meant .
“ It remains to be seen exactly what it means , ” confessed poet Peter Sirr .
“ If it can result in practical initiatives that promote literature , that ’s great . ”
“ I ’m not sure what effect it will have on me personally , but it ’s a pleasure to be associated with it , ” said poet Thomas Kinsella .
Novelist Joseph O’Connor said : “ It ’s happy news at a time when we need some of it .
It ’ll be an encouragement to a crop of younger writers and might bring in the odd tourist . ”
“ Dublin is being seen as a literary city as opposed to the very crass city as it was during the boom .
It ’s a reassertion of literary values , ” said novelist Claire Kilroy .
Paul Howard , author of the Ross O’Carroll - Kelly books , gently disagreed with her .
“ Having made my living from the crassness of the Celtic Tiger , I ’m afraid it ’s all over for me .
Now , it ’s all about values . ”
Among the other writers present yesterday were Pat Boran , Mannix Flynn , Patricia Scanlan , Claudia Carroll , Aubrey Flegg , Sarah Webb , Hugo Hamilton , Siobhán Parkinson , Chris Binchy , Enda Wyley and Theo Dorgan .
HH : Special edition of the Hugh Hewitt Show , which I am going to spend entirely with Christopher Hitchens , Vanity Fair columnist , author of the bestseller , God Is Not Great , and a new extraordinary memoir , Hitch - 22 .
And Christopher Hitchens , welcome back , it ’s great to talk with you .
CH : Very nice of you to have me .
HH : Now Christopher , since we last spoke , your illness you disclosed on the web , and people will want to know off the bat how you are doing , and how your treatment is going .
CH : Oh well , I have , in case people are just tuning in , I have cancer in my esophagus , which has I think spread a little to my lymph nodes as well .
And I ’m two weeks into the chemotherapy course .
So I feel pretty weak , and my voice is n’t what it was , but that ’s supposed to be a good sign in that the amount of poison I ’m taking is presumably working on the bad stuff as well as the good stuff .
And this morning , I found that my hair was beginning to come out in the shower , which is a bit demoralizing , I have to say , even though it ’s the least of it .
HH : Well , I know you ’ve received many well wishes , and I know my audience has been among them , and I ’m very glad you could make the time today to talk about this book .
CH : No , everyone ’s been extremely generous , and including , well , preeminently , yourself .
Thank you .
HH : Well , let ’s turn to this amazing book , because we had this set up for when you were diagnosed , and I ’m glad you ’re back in the saddle and able to talk about it today .
And I think you may be my first guest who has actually ever passed out anti-Soviet newspapers in the streets of Havana in 1968 .
And actually , before you were diagnosed , I had written down this question .
I want to ask it , because it ’s the way I was going to do the interview to begin with .
You ’ve shaken hands with Oswald Mosley , and General Videla of Argentina , and Abu Nidal , and a whole bunch of other people .
Who ’s the most evil person you ’ve met , Christopher Hitchens ?
CH : Well , as Hannah Arendt famously said , there can be a banal aspect to evil .
In other words , it does n’t present always .
I mean , often what you ’re meeting is a very mediocre person .
But nonetheless , you can get a sort of frisson of wickedness from them .
And the best combination of those , I think , I describe him in the book , is / was General Jorge Rafael Videla of Argentina , who I met in the late 1970s when the death squad war was at its height , and his fellow citizens were disappearing off the street all the time .
And he was , in some ways , extremely banal .
I describe him as looking like a human toothbrush .
He was a sort of starch , lean officer with a silly mustache , and a very stupid look to him , but a very fanatical glint as well .
And if I ’d tell you why he ’s now under house arrest in Argentina , you might get a sense of the horror I felt as I was asking him questions about all this .
He ’s in prison in Argentina for selling the children of the rape victims among the private prisoners , who he kept in a personal jail .
And I do n’t know if I ’ve ever met anyone who ’s done anything as sort of condensedly horrible as that , if you know what I mean .
HH : Yeah , and in fact , on Page 194 of Hitch - 22 , you pose that as a question .
It was both arresting to know the detail , but you also write , “ Do you know why ” to you reader .
“ Well , do you , ” you wrote .
And I did n’t .
And I ’m curious as to why you used that technique at that point , asking your reader a question .
CH : Yes , I , well , when I write , as often as I can , I try to write as if I ’m talking to people .
It does n’t always work , and one should n’t always try it , but I try and write as if I am talking , and trying to engage the reader in conversation .
And sometimes , I get letters from people saying they feel they ’ve been personally addressed .
And I always think of that as a success .
HH : Well , that ’s what got me at that point .
CH : So in this case , I ’m taking them , I ’m actually doing , I ’m overdoing it perhaps a little , but I thought it merited it .
I ’m sort of taking them by the lapels and saying I ’m sure you know , you think you know that there were a lot of people , as they called it , were disappeared in Argentina .
The word disappear became a positive .
Well , what am I trying to say ?
You did n’t disappear .
You were disappeared .
It was something that happened to you .
It was done to you .
I ’m sure you know all this , or so you think you know , but actually do you have any idea of how bad it was ?
HH : Actually , I did n’t .
I did n’t even know his name , Christopher Hitchens , I ’m ashamed to say , until I read your memoir .
CH : Well , he ’s one of Henry Kissinger ’s best friends .
Kissinger was his personal guest at the World Cup in Argentina .
He was a highly protected figure in America foreign policy at the time , even under the Carter administration , which is when I think I was meeting him , as a matter of fact .
And he was , in the original sense of the word , really , a fascist .
I mean , he believed that there was an international Jewish conspiracy to take over Argentina .
He admired Mussolini , Franco .
He fully believed in the protocols of the elders of Zion .
My great friend , the late Jacobo Timerman , who was also disappeared for a considerable time , a Jewish newspaper editor in Buenos Aires , said that when he was being tortured in another private prison , his interrogators kept asking him so do n’t you understand who our enemies are ?
Our enemies are Sigmund Freud , because he destroyed the Christian concept of the family , Albert Einstein , because he destroyed the Christian concept of the cosmos , and Karl Marx , because he destroyed the Christian idea of the organic economy .
And do you think it ’s coincidence all these three people are Jews ?
It was a very intense revisiting of the Nazi agenda in the southern continent of the Americas .
HH : He also posed a question to you , which I made a note of , that he argues with you in your recollection of your interview .
Terrorism is not just killing with a bomb , but activating ideas .
Separating that statement from the evil man who said it , cannot that be true , Christopher Hitchens ?
CH : Yes , I daresay it can .
I mean , I was asking , I knew he was going to say that there were various reasons why all this was going on .
And I had ready with me an example I had been given by a human rights group in Argentina of a woman called Claudia Ines Grumberg , another Jewish woman .
She was a quadriplegic .
She ’d last been seen being lifted into a police car with unmarked plates .
And when I , he told about terrorism and bombing , and I mean , there were terrorists in Argentina at that time , I said well look , these allegations ca n’t be true in the case of this woman , because she was n’t able even to move .
He said , and without batting a lash , he said well in that case , she must have been guilty of some ideological offense .
And I remember noticing a couple of his advisors blanching a bit as if they thought well , the supreme leader ’s gone a bit far in saying that .
He ’s admitted too much .
But …and I looked a bit surprised , too , and I think he mistook that , and repeated the answer as if for my benefit , in case I had n’t understood .
And clearly , what was important to him was getting rid of cosmopolitan , Jewish internationalists and people of this kind , because their mere existence in terms of ideas was a threat to his concept of the Argentine order .
HH : What ’s interesting , though , to me …
CH : But yes , I mean , I ’d have to answer you , I ’m not dodging your question .
HH : Yeah .
CH : Yes , I mean , I think there is , if you like , a terrorism by incitement .
I think it has to be very , very , very carefully isolated .
But for example , the horrific pimp and runner of prostitutes in America , and later recruiter of bachelor virgin suicide killers , Sheik Awlaki , now in Yemen …
HH : That ’s who I was going to ask you .
It ’s on my notes .
CH : Yeah , I mean , I agree with the president .
I think he ’s put himself in the crosshairs .
He ’s undoubtedly attempting , while not involving his own precious skin , as I say , he ’s a pimp and a runner of hookers , and well known to be a very worldly guy , but he does n’t mind signing up innocent frustrated , sexually thwarted kids for murder missions .
I think he should be killed .
HH : Now I want to go to the other …
CH : In fact , if I had a wish , if what I ’ve got turns out to be terminal , I would n’t mind my last act being an interview with him , followed by a nasty surprise .
That would be , I ’d feel then I was dying in a good cause .
HH : How much time are you spending on that thought , Christopher Hitchens ?
CH : As little as I can , because it ’s morbid and mock heroic .
HH : All right .
I want to …
CH : But it avoids the boring thought that one is suffering , in effect , for no reason .
I mean , I ’m not suffering in a good cause , or witnessing for any , you know , great idea or anything or principle .
It ’s just boring .
HH : The number of people I ’m sure who are praying for you , including people who come up to me and ask me to tell you that , people like Joseph Timothy Cook , how are you responding to them , given your famous atheism ?
CH : Well look , I mean , I think that prayer and holy water , and things like that are all fine .
They do n’t do any good , but they do n’t necessarily do any harm .
It ’s touching to be thought of in that way .
It makes up for those who tell me that I ’ve got my just desserts .
It ’s , I ’m afraid to say it ’s almost as well - founded an idea .
I mean , I do n’t , they do n’t know whether prayer will work , and they do n’t know whether I ’ve come by this because I ’m a sinner .
HH : Oh , I …has anyone actually said that to you ?
CH : Yeah , oh yes .
HH : Oh , my gosh .
Forgive them .
Well …
CH : Well , I mean , I do n’t mind .
It does n’t hurt me .
But for the same reason , I wish it was more consoling .
But I have to say there ’s some extremely nice people , including people known to you , have said that I ’m in their prayers , and I can only say that I ’m touched by the thought .

HH : Hitch - 22 in bookstores now , and it references this song , Go Where You Want To Go by the Mamas And The Papas .
In fact , there ’s a lot of music in Hitch - 22 , Christopher Hitchens , but I did n’t expect you to be , you know , taken by the Mamas And Papas when you were a young man .
CH : Well , when I was about 18 , I suppose , I was in university , I remember , the album California Dreaming came out .
HH : Yes .
CH : And you know , it was a bit sugary in some ways , but I loved the way it sounded even so .
And that particular song happened to jive with something I was experiencing at the time , and had been for a little while , which was a very strong need to see the United States .
I could n’t quite explain it .
I even had little dreams sometimes about what it would be like going to America .
And when I heard that song , it always gave me this huge yearning to cross the Atlantic .
HH : Now before the break , I mentioned I was going to ask you about the best people you met .
This is , in many respects , a memoir of friendship – Martin Amis and Edward Said , and others throughout your entire life .
Were they the best people that you knew ?
Is that who you look back as being the best ?
Or is it some public figure ?
CH : No , I think they were , I mean , for me , there ’s a cynical remark made by an Englishman , I think he was Hesketh Pearson , actually , who was a friend of G.K. Chesterton ’s , who said a friend is God ’s apology for relations .
And when I was young , my family was perfectly nice .
I write a lot about it , as you noticed .
But it was rather limited .
I think , I do n’t think anyone in my family would really feel I ’d done them an injustice by saying that .
We did n’t see many people .
There were many books .
It was as if I wanted to get away from home .
And so when I was able to choose my own company , I felt that was a huge stage in my own sort of self - emancipation .
And then so friends are family to me .
HH : It is …
CH : Sorry .
HH : There ’s a story in here , about Page 399-400 , when you are Martin go to see Saul Bellow .
CH : Yes .
HH : And Saul Bellow , I want to quote here , “ Saul Bellow did n’t know that I , ” Christopher Hitchens , “ was a close friend of Edward Said’s .
But Martin did , thus , even though I knew he wanted me to stay off anything controversial , I could n’t allow Bellow , could n’t allow Martin to see me sitting there complicit while an absent friend was being defamed .
For all he knew , if the company were sufficiently illustrious , I might even let the cock crow for him .
That would surely never do . ”
I kind of stopped , and I said at this point , friendship may be the most important thing in Hitchens ’ life .
CH : Yes , well it is , I think .
It ’s a form of solidarity , for one thing .
And then it ’s a form of love .
And it deserves respect for that , too , would n’t you say ?
HH : Yes , and how …
CH : And it also does demand something of you .
In particular , I thought well , you know , Martin wanted me very much to meet his father figure , really , in the absence , after the death of his own dad , Saul Bellow , whom , for whom he was a great admirer , and had become a close friend .
I knew it was the best favor he could offer me .
I mean , an introduction to Saul , a dinner with Saul Bellow in Vermont was the most he had it in him to bestow .
And so I knew I wanted to be at my best .
I did n’t want to spoil the evening .
And he knew I had a tendency to get involved in argument .
And he said try to hold it down , because you know , that ’s not what we want to talk about .
And I could n’t have agreed more .
I wanted to talk about literature and reminisce with Bellow , which we did a lot of the time .
But Bellow wanted to vent at great length about an article in Commentary Magazine about my late friend , Edward Said .
And that article , I had my own differences with Edward , and I describe what they were , but this article , I thought , was grossly unfair , and I , after sitting through it for a bit , Bellow did n’t know that I was a friend of the person concerned .
I thought I was going to have to say something , and I ’m sorry .
And I know Martin will hate it .
So this was paying the cost of friendship , if you like , twice .
HH : Yeah .
CH : And Bellow , in fact , did n’t mind so much , and Bellow ’s an old street fighter .
He was an ex-Trotskyist like me , been , took part in many political polemics .
He used to live in Chicago , where you do n’t mince words , you know .
But it was agony much more for Martin than it was for Saul .
And that cost me a bit , too .
HH : How has Martin reacted to news of your illness ?
CH : Well , he ’s coming to see me next week .
He ’s … I guess I do n’t really know yet .
I have n’t seen him in person .
HH : How about Salman Rushdie ?
Have you heard from him ?
CH : Oh , I ’ve heard from , I mean , it ’s been embarrassing , actually , how many people have written to me , or in default of that , or as well as that , written about me , either on the web or in print .
It ’s , I feel you know , when Mark Twain was pronounced dead in the newspapers , he said rumors of his death had been greatly exaggerated .
I read so many nice things about myself now I begin to think that rumors of my life have been a bit exaggerated .
HH : ( laughing )
CH : Apparently , some incredibly saintly person has got sick .
Of course , I mean , I also realize with a twinge that you know , as time goes by , that ’ll become background , too .
HH : Your memoir is soaked with names and stories of these memorable and significant contributors to fiction .
But you wrote at Page 275 , “ I soon realized that I did not have the true stuff for fiction and poetry , and I was very fortunate indeed to have contemporaries , several practitioners of those arts who made it obvious to me , without unduly rubbing in the point , that I would be wasting my time if I tried . ”
How did they do that , Hitchens ?
CH : Well , by their mere existence .
I mean , they did n’t warn me off or anything .
But when I was young , I knew I wanted to write .
I knew it was all I wanted to do , and all that more or less I was able to do as it comes to that .
But anyway , it was more it chose me than I chose it .
And at university and later , I knew a lot of people who would , I mean , at that stage , I could have written poem or a short story .
And I guess , even in current reduced state , I probably still could try something of the sort .
But I was very lucky in meeting people who did it passionately and devotedly , and who just by osmosis , in other words , merely by reading their stuff and talking it over with them , and sometimes being shown it in early forms , I thought now wait a minute , they have a , there ’s an X factor in what they can write that I do n’t possess .
And I have in my book a theory as to what that is , by the way .
I do n’t know if you remember it , but the distinction between people who can write prose and fiction and poetry , and those who can , should stay with the essay form , I think is this .
All my friends who can do it have musical capacity .
HH : Oh , I remember now , yeah .
CH :
In one form or another , they can either play , or they can appreciate , or they can describe a musical event in a fairly educated way .
Since I was very young , in fact , the first thing I found that I really , really , really could n’t do was play a musical instrument at any level , or understand musical theory or notation .
It was n’t that I was bad .
No one ever says they ’re good .
It was I could n’t do it .
It was like being dyslexic .
HH : Well , you also say you have an incapacity for chess and mathematics .
CH : Yes , I ’m deformed .
I ’m very short in all those departments .
And those , I find , generally cluster , the ability at chess and math and music .
So I thought okay , I ’ve got , I ’ve only got one side of the brain , I keep forgetting which one it is , that works .
The other is sort of walnut - sized .
I think I ’d do better to stay with the essayistic form .
HH : Are you aware of anyone who lacks that musical ability who is also a great novelist ?
CH : Well , I get any leisure , I ’ve been encouraged to develop this theory , because it seems that there must be something to it .
I mean , you know , Shakespeare is full of music , for example , so is Proust .
Nabokov is a very strong test .
He did n’t like music .
He did n’t like having it played to him .
But he knew quite a lot about it and appreciated it .
The more one goes into it , the more it seems like quite a useful , possible theory .
But I ’ve only got to its very crude adumbration so far .
– – – –
HH : A little Robert Dylan in the background there , Christopher Hitchens , another of the musical people that you refer to throughout the book , obviously impacting the 60s and your years in university .
Have you kept up the taste for Bob Dylan ?
CH : Yes .
I also think , I mean , as well as being … he ’s no longer a great singer .
His voice is shot .
And not as badly as mine , but it ’s gone .
But he used to have a very beautiful voice .
There ’s a wonderful song , I wish I ’d mentioned it to you earlier .
We could have played Spanish Is The Loving Tongue , a very hauntingly , beautiful song .
And he had a lovely voice , but he was also , I think , a great poet .
And he was the background music to a lot of people of my age .
I do n’t take a lot of stock in generational thought , as you know .
I think generational solidarity is the lowest form of solidarity there is .
But I think that for every decade or so , every generational set , there is a special voice .
And certainly for my lot , it was him .
And I would have liked him if he ’d only written about lost love and blues and so on .
But he also had a few things to say about the war and the civil rights movement , and so on .
HH : You ’ve got a lot of commentary on poetry and poets in Hitch - 22 – James Fenton , Philip Larkin , Auden , Clive James .
Do you think some people have the incapacity for poetry that you have for chess and mathematics ?
Because I think I might be among them .
CH : Oh , I ’d be very sorry to think that .
I mean , well , what do you think of the liturgy , for example ?
What do you think about the Book of Job ?
HH : Well , yes , you ’re right .
I do love that poetry .
CH : For man is born for trouble , As sparks fly upward ?
HH : Yeah .
CH : That ’s poetry .
HH : It ’s harder , though .
And I ’m curious as to …
CH : I actually , I say this to my students , because the art of poetry recitation , say , I mean , just to stand up or even sit down and be able to speak a Shakespeare sonnet seems to have gone , and it ’s certainly no longer taught .
And people , I can do it , and people look at me as if I was doing something almost supernatural .
And I say well look , you all know the lyrics to several songs , and they all do .
Even without knowing it , they know them .
They know them almost just by acquaintance .
HH : That ’s right .
CH : By attrition , perhaps , almost in some cases .
But they think of poetry as something different , as a whole new reservation .
HH : So are poets more tragic than the fiction writers you ’ve known ?
Or are they the same kind of character ?
CH : I think that if I take , say , my two favorite English poets , the ones I most often recur to , are Philip Larkin and W.H. Auden .
Both of them have a great understanding of tragedy , and a keen feeling of , you know , in some ways , the absurdity of the human condition .
But it ’s also from the absurdity that they draw things that are quite mordantly funny as well .
I do n’t think it ’s possible to have a sense of tragedy without having a sense of humor .
HH : Okay .
I ’ve got to ask before we get to the break …
CH : Oh , that ’s why we think so highly of Shakespeare , I think , is that he ’s able to perform on both of those registers with such acuity .
HH : And his history as well .
Let me ask you about Richard Llewellyn , How Green Was My Valley .
CH : Yes .
HH : Would you tell the audience why it had such an impact on you ?
CH : Yes , when I was quite small , I suppose about ten or eleven , I came across a tattered paperback of a book that your older listeners may have heard of or read .
The author was Richard Llewellyn , and the book is called How Green Was My Valley .
It ’s not a question .
It ’s a way of saying in Welsh how green my valley was , how green was my valley .
And it ’s a wonderful account of growing up as a young boy in a very self - enclosed community of Welsh - speaking coal miners in the valleys of the southern part of Wales .
And I was living then on just the other side of the Bristol channel in southern England , in the rural part of the country , and only a few hundred miles away from this .
And this book described to me the life of people almost on another planet , though they were very close kinned .
But they worked underground like the people in H.G. Wells , the Morlocks .
They spoke another language .
They joined unions and went on strike .
There was even a disobliging reference to Winston Churchill in this book .
I ’d never come across a disobliging reference to Winston Churchill before , because as home secretary in 1911 , he ’d sent the British army to put down the Welsh coal miners in a big strike in the Rhonda Valley .
And it was just tremendously eye - opening to me to know the existence of this , not just of the people of another class , but in a way , almost another race and nation and language .
And I got to the stage where I could almost have it memorized .
It meant an enormous amount to me .
It was also a very good bildungsroman , if you want , about this young boy , Hugh Morgan , and his growing up , and the best rites of passage that he underwent .
It was an electrifying read .
I read it again the other day .
It ’s still pretty good .
HH : You know , I think it ’s going to spark , Hitch - 22 is going to spark a revival in How Green Was My Valley .

HH : Christopher Hitchens , I ’d like to talk to you about your mom and dad at this point .
Do you still have your mother ’s last letter to you ?
CH : Yes .
HH : And where do you keep it ?
And how often do you read it ?
CH : I have the same now - rather battered and flaking envelope of all her possessions and , such as they were , and all the relevant documents and the things that she left for me that was given to me by the British embassy in Athens after her funeral in 1973 .
I have it all in one place .
And I look at it not very often these days .
HH : How often do you think of …
CH : But I know it , well , for one thing , I know it by heart .
HH : That ’s …how often do you recollect it ?
CH : For another , I am not a great one for relics or mementos .
I ’m not a great keeper of things .
Actually , one of my big regrets in my life now is there are a lot of letters and things like that from people , interesting people , that I did n’t bother to keep , as I ’ve often had to move in a hurry , and did n’t want to be burdened with carrying too much .
So I ’ve always resolved on the side of not being a packrat , even a sentimental one .
HH : Now you do not disclose the contents , I ’m not going to ask you what they are , but I wonder , have you ever allowed anyone else to read it ?
CH : No .
HH : And will you leave it for your children ?
CH : Yes , I suppose I will .
I do n’t think it ’ll be very meaningful to them .
The problem with it is , actually , I think I must have shown it to my brother , come to think of it , some years ago , but not to my father .
For him , it would have been too painful .
I should perhaps explain why this is ?
HH : Yes .
CH : My mother took her own life in Athens , in company with her lover when their affair just was n’t working out , and it was a time when divorce and adultery was still very scandalous in the English middle class .
And it was n’t working out , and I think my mother could n’t see things getting any better , and did n’t want to go on living .
This was a very , obvious very awful for me to discover , but I had known about the boyfriend , which my father had not .
And awful for my father to discover , because it meant he discovered it through the , the announcement came in the newspapers .
It was actually reported she ’d been murdered .
I mean , he was a very private and reticent man , and it was , I think , terribly shocking to him to realize everyone now knew that his wife was n’t living with him anymore .
And he did n’t want to know , when I came back , he did n’t want to hear that I discovered that in fact it was a suicide act .
It was n’t a murder , so , and did n’t want to discuss it any further .
And he was a very , very , very quiet man in that way .
The second thing was that the note was written , I sort of wish she had n’t done this , but she , in her extremity , she addressed it just to me , I think thinking that I was the one who’d be able to come to Athens .
HH : I see .
CH : And I wish she had n’t done that , because it , you know , it rather left my other male Hitchens out in the cold .
HH : The portrait of your …
CH : And I had to , it took me a while to , I ’d wanted to protect them from that thought , if you see what I mean .
HH : Yes , yes .
The portrait of your mother is achingly tender , and a very powerfully loving portrait of your father as well .
In fact , I knew I was caught by your book after that , because I knew you were going to be just breathtakingly honest in the course of this book .
How difficult was it to write these portraits ?
CH : Well , I knew I ’d have to do it one day , and I knew if I was ever going to do a memoir , I ’d have to confront it .
And the one about my mother I wrote first off , when the publisher first asked me .
And I did it in one night , in one go , and sent it off after I ’d read it , and wept , which I did more than I thought I was going to do .
But I thought also to myself , would it make anyone else cry ?
I do n’t want it to do that .
I do n’t want it to be mawkish .
I want to be better judged than that .
So I said to the publisher , and my editor , a very trusted guy , if this works , then I think I can do the book .
If you do n’t think it does , I ’m not sure I should go on .
And that has taken me since 1973 .
I ’d often thought of trying to write about it , but to put it off .
HH : Well , it ’s not mawkish .
CH : Well , thank you for saying that .
No one else , no one has said it is .
It should n’t , I think , bring a tear to anyone else ’s eye , but it should make people understand why it would to mind .
And then the necessary counterpart , that was a bit harder to write , was about my father , and why his life was so , was such a sad one .
HH : You know , I know a lot of naval officers and Marine Corps officers who fought in the same war as your father did , and as reserved as he is .
And I thought that was an amazing story as well .
But I wanted to ask you about one note on Page 369 about the Commander .
CH : Yes .
HH : “ Apart from the traditional stories of British daring , the only example of heroism and gallantry ever related to me by the Commander , ” your father , “ was of the Francoist General Jose Moscardo , who refused to surrender the besieged Alcazar , even when the Red forces threatened to execute his son , Luis . ”
What did you make of your father picking this one story to tell you , Christopher ?
CH : Well , at the time , I did n’t know it .
He just gave it me as an example of stoicism , courage in the face of the foe .
And I would have been about eight , I suppose .
But as I grew up and got to know him better , and also had discovered a bit more about what had been going on in the generation before I was born , I realized how right wing my father was .
I mean , he was a very , very conservative person indeed , and I think , and I know from his letters , the very few that remain , that he was very strongly pro-Franco in the Spanish civil war .
He had a slight sympathy for Mussolini as well .
He would n’t have , I think , have had any truck at all with any sympathy for Hitler , but he was rather an authoritarian , or an admirer of people who were , rather .
HH : Your brother arrives …
CH : He would often come up with very alarming remarks .
I mean , I remember when I asked him once about , or rather , he actually asked me when I had been reporting from Northern Ireland at a certain stage , he said oh , what do you think should happen there , and I was sort of moaning on about this and that , and power sharing , and civil rights and all this , and he said well , what I think is it needs a jolly good dose of martial law .
That ’s what he sounded like , as if , I think I say it in the book , as if the British had never tried the use of force in Ireland before .
HH : Yeah , you do say that in the book .
CH : And it was time to give it a workout .
HH : It ’s a good laugh out loud line .
– – – –
HH : Christopher Hitchens , your brother , Peter , arrives on the scene of Hitch - 22 relatively late , though with some very sincere , respectful nods .
And I ’m curious , was he friends with any of your friends ?
Could he even pass a day with Martin Amis ?
CH : Oh yeah , he could do that all right , but he ’s just , there ’s a crucial difference in age between us .
I used not to notice things like birth order and age difference and so on until I became a parent myself .
And I actually now think it may have some relevance .
Then , I thought well , what does it mean for me , and realized that my brother was born about a year and a half after me , more like … in other words , near enough to be a rival , if you see what I mean , and not far enough down to be below , to be a baby brother in need of protection .
And so we were , it ’s a narrow , but deep difference between boys at that age .
And it goes on for life , and you go to boarding school as we did eventually at different times , and were in different classes in the same school .
It ’s awkward , or can be .
We were n’t very much alike in temperament .
If I were to liken temperament at all , I was much more like my mother , and he very like my old man .
And , well , as time went on , we grew up .
We were very seldom in the same town , we did n’t go to the same university .
We adopted the same career , interesting .
HH : Yes .
CH : I do n’t think he did it at all to emulate me , and I ’m sure he had the same feeling as I did , that it ’s the only real , being a writer is the only real life for a gentleman .
But he ’s a very different kind of journalist from the one I am , I think , very good indeed at what he does .
HH : And has he reacted to Hitch - 22 yet ?
CH :
We do n’t have that many friends in common , but actually , none of my friends has any difficulty appreciating the point of him .
It ’s just that he can be rather abrupt .
# 8 = Volume 3 , Part 1 = March 1976 Gale E. Christianson Kepler 's Somnium : Science Fiction and the Renaissance Scientist
In 1634 , four years after his death , the most provocative and innovative of Johannes Kepler ’s works was published by his son Ludwig Kepler , then a candidate for the doctorate in medicine .
In one form or another , the manuscript had been the elder Kepler ’s constant companion since his student days at Tübingen University where his introduction to the heliocentric system , revived from the ancient Greeks by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus , had prompted Kepler to devote one of his required dissertations to the question : " How would the phenomena occurring in the heavens appear to an observer stationed on the moon ? "
The theses propounded by Kepler at Tübingen in 1593 contained , in the words of his German biographer Max Caspar , " the first germ of a work which we shall come to know as the last of the books he published , " the Somnium or Dream .
1
It had been Kepler ’s intent to personally supervise the publication of his manuscript and , at the time of his sudden death in 1630 , six pages of the document were in type .
Jacob Bartsch , Kepler ’s son - in - law , undertook the task of completing publication but he , too , died suddenly before it was finished .
The project might well have been abandoned at this point had not Kepler left his widow in dire financial straits .
In an attempt to assist his mother during this economic crisis , son Ludwig brought the thin volume to press in 1634 .
In accordance with the medieval - classical tradition — broken only by Kepler ’s contemporary Galileo , who occasionally published in the vernacular — the original edition was in Latin .
Over two centuries passed before a second Latin edition was published in 1870 in volume eight of the Opera Omnia , a collection of Kepler ’s works edited by Christian Frisch .
This was followed in 1898 by a rather poor and quite obscure German paraphrase under the title Kepler ’s Traum Von Mond by Ludwig Gunther .
Except for these two limited editions and a few surviving copies of the original printing , a seminal work in science fiction remained a literary curiosity for over three centuries , read only by those few authors with a strong interest in the new genre and possessed of the classical background required to read the work in its original Latin .
It is difficult to appreciate to any degree this last work of a great theoretician and scientist without knowing something of the circumstances surrounding its authorship , a task which spanned some thirty - seven years .
For the time in which he lived Kepler ’s lunar exploration is a truly remarkable and revolutionary work , and in the view of historian Lewis Mumford must be appreciated for " the audacity of the concept " as well as for its intrinsic merit as a pioneering work of science fiction .
2
There is little , if anything , in the background and early childhood of Johannes Kepler to suggest that this son of a ne ’er - do - well mercenary of the Duke of Alba and an innkeeper ’s daughter , who was nearly burned at the stake as a witch , would become a central figure in the seventeenth - century scientific revolution in astronomy .
Kepler was born and spent his childhood in Weil - der - Stadt , a small Swabian village located in southwestern Germany .
He lived in the crowded cottage home of his paternal grandfather , Sebaldus Kepler , along with aunts , uncles and numerous brothers and sisters — the latter of whom biographer Arthur Koestler collectively refers to as " this misshapen progeny . "
3
Through some favorable natural phenomena , not yet completely understood by modern science , Johannes was endowed at birth with the gift of genius while the rest of his brothers and sisters suffered from severe mental and physical handicaps .
Kepler , himself , was not entirely immune to the family curse of physical infirmity , for he was bow - legged , frequently covered with large boils , and suffered from congenital myopia and multiple vision .
The latter affliction must have been particularly distressing to one whose love of the heavens defined his career .
Johannes ’ special intellectual endowment was apparent from an early age however , and fortunately those responsible for his education wanted the gift to be as fully developed as possible .
Consequently , Kepler was enrolled at Tübingen University , and it was there that the first seeds of the Somnium , published some forty years later , were sown .
Kepler was an excellent student in all fields of study including theology , but he worked most diligently and happily on astronomical questions .
It was his good fortune to matriculate while Michael Maestlin , one of the most learned and esteemed astronomers of the time , was a member of the Tübingen faculty .
In deference to the teachings of Martin Luther and Phillip Melanchton , Luther ’s advisor on scientific matters , Maestlin , at least in his public lectures , advocated the geocentric system of planetary motion as described by the second century Greek astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in his influential treatise the Almagest .
4
Copernican theory , even when taught on the speculative basis permitted by the Roman Catholic Church until Galileo ’s trial in 1633 , was strictly prohibited at the outset by the Lutherans ; and among his theological colleagues Maestlin was the only advocate of the new astronomy .
Privately , however , Maestlin did discuss the heliocentric universe , and apparently his early recognition of Kepler ’s genius persuaded Maestlin to admit his student to that small circle of intimates who shared his views .
" In the youthful enthusiastic head of his pupil the spark ignited .
Maestlin ’s considerations and repressions were alien to the young and unencumbered Kepler who , open and dauntless , entered into disputation in favor of the new astronomical theory . "
5 Kepler also learned a good deal of practical astronomy from Maestlin , including the ancient Greek technique of estimating elevations on the moon ’s surface by measuring the shadows cast by these protuberances .
And he began to grapple with the question put at the beginning of this paper of how the heavens would appear to an observer standing on the moon .
Kepler knew from studying Copernicus that the earth is moving very rapidly .
Yet those who inhabit the planet are unaware of this rapid movement because they are not able to detect it through the use of their senses .
Kepler quite logically reasoned that a man standing on the moon would share an identical experience ; he could see the earth change position because he would not be a participant in its rotation just as a moonwatcher on earth observes lunar motion in which he does not participate .
This realization and the complex issues it raised became the basic theme of Kepler ’s dissertation of 1593 and , quite inadvertently , the generative force underlying the first work of modern science fiction .
Had the Tübingen faculty been more tolerant of the new astronomy , the theses presented in Kepler ’s dissertation would have been publicly debated and probably long forgotten .
However when the proposal was presented to the authorities for their approval , they vetoed the debate .
One of Kepler ’s closest friends and a fellow student , Christoph Besold , who later became a noted professor of law at Tübingen , appealed to his professor and advisor , Vitus Müller , to permit him , rather than Kepler , to uphold the theses in a disputation ; but after considering the matter , Müller refused .
The fact that Besold requested to debate Kepler ’s theses suggusts that the authorities might have known of the close Kepler - Maestlin relationship , and that Kepler and his friend considered it more likely that Müller and his colleagues would reach a favorable verdict if Besold , a law student , led the debate .
Kepler was no doubt disappointed and perhaps even somewhat bitter about the decision ; yet he was also realistic enough to know that to further protest his fate , when even his highly respected professor of astronomy was condemned to public silence on matters Copernican , would be foolhardy and perhaps damaging to his career .
Still , there was sufficient grit to produce a pearl .
Kepler wisely decided to keep his manuscript until the time when a more favorable climate of opinion might prevail .
He also wanted to do more research , particularly on the Greek classics , and to discover any possible precedents in them that would make his work more palatable to the Aristotelians .
The student dissertation of 1593 was left untouched by its author for the next sixteen years .
Meanwhile , Kepler ’s career as a mathematician - astronomer flourished .
He was graduated from the Faculty of Arts at Tübingen at the age of twenty and enrolled at the Theological Faculty of the University to continue preparing for his chosen vocation — that of a Lutheran clergyman .
His reputation as an excellent mathematician followed him however ; and the Tübingen Senate offered Kepler the position of teacher of mathematics and astronomy in Gratz , the sleepy capital of the Austrian province of Styria .
Fearing himself unworthy of such a post , Kepler reluctantly accepted the offer only after considerable coaxing : his plans for a career in theology were permanently abandoned .
The choice proved a good one ; the young mathematician became a respected teacher and he apparently enjoyed his new surroundings , for Kepler remained in Gratz until January of 1600 .
The rather obscure town provided few distractions from scholarly pursuits , and , since his classes were small , Kepler had considerable free time to devote to mathematics and astronomy .
At the age of twenty - five he published his first book , the Mysterium Cosmographicum , which is a brilliant if highly mystical and error - prone amalgam of Aristotelian and Copernican cosmology .
6
The work attracted the attention of the great Danish astronomer , Tycho Brahe , who was deeply impressed by Kepler ’s synthesis of the old and new astronomy .

This favorable impression ultimately led Brahe to offer Kepler a position as his assistant after the Dane was appointed Imperial Mathematician by the Holy Roman Emperor , Rudolph II .
Kepler worked with Brahe from early 1600 until the latter ’s death in November 1601 , after which Kepler succeeded to the post of his teacher .
Equally important is the fact that after a squabble with Tycho ’s heirs , Kepler inherited the astronomer ’s observational data , unparalleled for its accuracy , on the oppositions of Mars between 1580 and 1600 .
It was through the mathematical analysis of Brahe ’s observations that Kepler arrived at his famous law of ellipses in 1605 .
The conclusions derived from this law provided the basis for his most important scientific work , Astronomia Nova , published in 1609 , the same year in which his interest in the forgotten dissertation of his student days was rekindled .
In his capacity as Imperial Mathematician Kepler resided in Prague , then the capital of the Holy Roman Empire .
During the summer of 1609 , he became involved in a series of long conversations with his friend and ecclesiastical advisor to Emperor Rudolph , Wackher von Wackenfels .
Rudolph had asked Kepler his views regarding the patterns of light and shadows appearing on the lunar surface : the emperor had personally concluded that they are formed by the reflection off the moon of major land masses located on the earth .
In effect , Rudolph was advocating a somewhat modified version of the Aristotelian position and he wanted to know if Kepler agreed with him .
Kepler , of course , did not agree with his patron because as far back as his student days he had known that the shadows on the moon were caused by mountains or other natural outcroppings .
It was a conclusion reinforced by years of additional study and observation both on his own and under Tycho ’s tutelage .
While not an expert on the matter himself , Wackher was interested in Kepler ’s views and encouraged his friend to publish them .
Kepler ’s lifelong intrigue with lunar geography combined with Wackher ’s interest resulted in the composition of the Somnium , a greatly modified version of his student dissertation .

There can be little , if any , doubt that Kepler selected the framework of the Dream to satisfy two major demands : first , fewer objections could be raised among the ranks of those still within the Aristotelian orbit by passing off this Copernican treatise as a figment of an idle slumberer ’s uncontrollable imagination ; and secondly , it enabled Kepler to introduce a mythical agent or power capable of transporting humans to the lunar surface .
In fact to the cursory reader , Kepler must have appeared more mythographer than speculative scientist , and this is the very impression the author intended .
9
The Somnium begins like a classical legend and relates the author ’s " dream " about the adventures of a young man , Duracotus , a native of an island called " Thule " by the ancients , Iceland by seventeenth - century Europeans .
Duracotus ’ father , a fisherman by trade , died at the extremely advanced age of 150 , but the child was still too young to have any recollection of him .
Fiolxhilde , the mother , is a " wise woman , " who supports both her son and herself by gathering herbs which are then cooked , stuffed in little bags of goatskin , and sold at a nearby port to sailors .
The bags supposedly harbor mysterious lucky charms and the healing powers required by seamen on the long and always dangerous voyages across the north Atlantic .
One day , out of curiosity , " Duracotus cut open one of the bags his mother intended to sell to a ship ’s captain , scattering its contents on the ground .
In a fit of anger Fiolxhilde ’s temper got the best of her and she sold her son to the captain in place of the lost herbs .
The following day , the captain set sail for Norway but he stopped in Denmark to deliver a letter from a bishop in Iceland to the astronomer Tycho Brahe , who then resided on the island of Hveen in the Sund between Copenhagen and Elsinore Castle .
Duracotus became quite ill during the voyage ( apparently he carried no bag of his mother ’s charms ) , and he was put ashore when Tycho ’s letter was delivered .
The astronomer questioned the boy at some length , considered him to be quite intelligent , and undertook to train him in the science of astronomy .
Duracotus ’ response is enthusiastic : " I was delighted beyond measure by the astronomical activities , for Brahe and his students watched the moon and the stars all night with marvelous instruments . "
10 After spending five years in Tycho ’s company Duracotus took his master ’s leave and sailed for home .
He found Fiolxhilde much as she was when he left , except that the old woman had suffered terribly as a result of her impetuosity and was overjoyed to see her son alive and well .
A number of long discussions ensued during which Fiolxhilde expressed happiness over Duracotus ’ acquaintance with the new science of the stars .
She confesses to her own special knowledge of the heavens and the fact that her teacher is none other than the " Daemon of Lavania " — the spirit of the moon .
" Most of the things which you saw with your own eyes or learned by hearsay or absorbed from books , he related to me as you did . "
The mother then reveals her ultimate secret : it is possible , with the assistance of the Daemon , to travel to Lavania and , quite predictably , she asks her son to accompany her on just such a lunar voyage .
Duracotus consents and " as soon as the sun set below the horizon , and was in conjunction with the planet Saturn in the sign of the Bull , Fiolxhilde summoned the Daemon and seated herself next to her son who covered their heads with a blanket .
Within a few moments the journey of " fifty thousand German miles " had begun , up through the ethereal regions to the moon .
Up to this point there is little which separates the Somnium from a long literary tradition rooted in the imagination of the ancient Greeks .
After his rebuff at the hands of the Tübingen faculty Kepler had purchased a copy of Lucian ’s satirical work on lunar exploration facetiously titled , A True Story .
From a scientific point of view the work made no sense : Lucian ’s voyage to the moon begins in a whirlwind and concludes by poking fun at the society of his day through a chronicle of " hilarious discussions on the moon . "
The flight of Duracotus and Fiolxhilde is also the result of supernatural forces that are no less mystical than the whirlwind conjured up by Lucian .
A second , and more important source of inspiration for Kepler ’s moon voyage was Plutarch ’s The Face on the Moon , which Kepler read in 1595 .
It is a symposium of Greek scientific thought that includes the views of Hipparchus , Aristotle , and Aristarchus of Samos .
Extensive speculation on the lunar environment as a possible home for life is presented ; and Plutarch even relates the story of a mythical traveler — a Greek Duracotus — who sails to an island whose residents have knowledge of the passage to the moon .
12 Kepler now had the classical precedent he lacked during his student days : he even hoped to publish translations both of Lucian ’s and Plutarch ’s work with the Somnium to show his debt to these classical writers , and hopefully blunt potential criticism of his own moon voyage .
13
It was a task he did not complete .
While Kepler ’s method of flight to the moon is not markedly different from that outlined by Lucian , and although much of his inspiration for lunar exploration is undeniably Plutarchian , the Somnium represents a sharp break with classical tradition ; the first intimation of which occurs during the voyage itself .
We are informed that the flight of four hours is " most difficult and fraught with the greatest danger to life . "
Only those who are slender of body are acceptable , thus ruling out most German males whose general corpulence was apparently distasteful to the slender Kepler .
In jest Kepler carried the matter further by pointing out the Daemon ’s preference for " dried - up old women , experienced from an early age in riding he - goats at night or forked sticks or threadbare cloaks . "
It was to prove a most costly joke for , as we shall see , it later backfired on its author whose own mother was accused of practicing witchcraft by superstitious neighbors and nearly burned at the stake by the authorities .
The take - off for the moon hits the traveler as a severe shock , " for he is hurled just as though he had been shot aloft by gunpowder to sail over mountains and seas . "
In order to counteract what Isaac Newton would later define as the force of gravity , the moon voyagers are put to sleep with the aid of opiates and their limbs are arranged in such a way that their bodies will not be torn apart by the force of acceleration .
14 Since breathing is inhibited by the swift passage of extremely cold air through the nostrils , damp sponges are applied to the face .
Within a short time the speed of flight becomes so great that the body involuntarily rolls itself up into a ball like an endangered spider and " we are carried along almost entirely by our will alone , so that finally the bodily mass proceeds toward its destination of its own accord : " Kepler had introduced the concept of " inertia " to the physical sciences and had extended its operation into the heavens .
Kepler anticipates another major obstacle to the moon voyager when he observes that we agreed not to begin " until the moon begins to be eclipsed on its eastern side .
Should it regain its full light while we are still in transit , our departure becomes futile . "
In other words , Kepler knew that once outside the protective blanket provided by the earth ’s atmosphere , humans could not survive the resulting solar bombardment : the flight must begin at the critical moment when the sun is behind the earth or at a point directly opposite the point of take - off .
During a lunar eclipse the earth ’s shadow would provide the tunnel of darkness required to protect the vulnerable moon voyager ; and it is not by accident that the maximum duration of such an eclipse is four and one - half hours , just one - half hour more than the duration of the voyage itself .
15 A further indication of Kepler ’s mastery of Copernican astronomy is his understanding that since the earth and the moon are both in motion , the shortest route to the latter would not be the straight line advocated by such ancient writers of mythology as Lucian , but a trajectory from earth to a point in space where the moon and the lunar voyagers would arrive simultaneously .
16 Kepler also relates that many additional difficulties arise during the lunar voyage which are too tedious to enumerate .
We are already aware , however , that Kepler possessed a keen grasp of the most serious obstacles to lunar flight and that even though those obstacles were beyond solution in terms of the technological equipment of his age , he believed it was at least theoretically possible — from a scientific point of view — for men to reach the moon .
It is this attitude that sets Kepler apart from all the others who considered the possibility of lunar flight before him .
Upon reaching the surface of Lavania the voyagers are weary , but soon recover sufficiently to walk about .
The Daemon immediately guides his charges to a cave in order to protect them from the penetrating rays of the rising sun .
There they meet other daemons and have the opportunity to recuperate from the effects of their arduous journey before beginning a reconnaissance of the moon ’s geography , flora , and fauna .
They are informed by their spiritual hosts that Lavania consists of two hemispheres : Subvolva and Privolva .
Subvolva always has its Volva ( Earth ) above which corresponds to the earth ’s satellite , the moon , while Privolva is forever deprived of the sight of Volva .
17
Taken together , a night and a day on Lavania are equivalent to one month on earth providing alternating two - week periods of intense , scorching heat followed by a cold unimaginable on this planet .
The extremes of temperature in the Subvolvan hemisphere are mitigated to some extent because of Volva ’s presence which has a moderating influence on the climate .
Geographically , the surface of the moon possesses everything that is on earth , but on a grossly exaggerated scale : the mountains reach unbelievable heights while the fissures , valleys , and craters plunge to precipitous depths unknown in the terrestrial realm .
Of equal interest to the student of science fiction is Kepler ’s detailed analysis of the life forms that inhabit Lavania .
His powers of scientific deduction were matched by a fertile and realistic imagination when postulating biological conditions on the moon .
Although he was trained as an astronomer and mathematician , Kepler was too good a scientist not to understand that the dual effects of the lunar climate and the irregular , hostile terrain would produce plants and animals far different from those that inhabit the earth .
He rejected the temptation , which others had not , of simply recreating a terrestrial civilization on the moon ; for in Kepler ’s Lavania there are no men and women , no civilization as he knew it .
Thus nearly two centuries before Buffon , Lyell , and Darwin , Kepler had grasped the close interrelationship between life forms and their natural environment .
Whatever is born on the moon attains a monstrous size : growth is extremely rapid , dictating a very short life span by terrestrial standards .
Since there are no towns the " Privolvans have no fixed abode , no established domicile . "
They are nomadic creatures who roam in crowds over their entire hemisphere :
Some use their legs , which far surpass those of our camels ; some resort to wings ; and some follow the receding water in boats ; or if a delay of several more days is necessary , then they crawl into caves .
Most of them are divers ; all of them draw their breath very slowly ; hence under water they stay down on the bottom .
Kepler considered the natural protection of large bodies of water and of caves as indispensable to an environment whose temperatures far exceed those of the hottest regions on earth .
And although he does not elaborate on the subject , he suggests that the lunar inhabitants are not the dumb animals they might at first appear to be .
Their ability to construct boats to escape the far - reaching effects of the sun provides evidence of this .
Feeding is a nocturnal function which , if prolonged until after sunrise , often leads to death .
The skin of the moon - dwellers , the majority of whom resemble massive serpents , is spongy and porous and , if exposed to the full force of the sun , becomes scorched and brittle .
Food consists primarily of plants whose surface " is like rind " and of the carcasses of the large number of creatures who die each day .
Such is the gigantic race of short - lived creatures that the historian of literature Marjorie Hope Nicolson likened to those of the antediluvian age on earth : lunar pterodactyls or ichthyosauri that bask for a brief moment in the rising or setting sun , then creep forever into the impenetrable Lavanian darkness .
18 At this point the Somnium comes to a rather abrupt and premature conclusion .
Kepler informs us that , " A wind arose with the rattle of rain .
I returned to find myself and found my head really covered with the pillow and my body with the blankets , " an allusion , no doubt , to the beginning of the moon voyage when Duracotus and Fiolxhilde covered their heads prior to the take - off .
The actual text of the Somnium , exclusive of the lengthy footnotes which were completed several years later and represent the third and final stage of composition , comprises only about twenty type - written pages .
Had the work been published at this point it would have been a slender volume indeed ; but Kepler clung to his plan to publish it in conjunction with translations of Plutarch and Lucian , and then only after it had been circulated among his most trusted colleagues in manuscript form .
As was noted above , Kepler ’s primary concern was with the opposition he might provoke among the Aristotelians ; he wanted some idea of the type of reception he could expect .
In 1610 , a few months after the text of the Somnium was completed , Kepler received some welcome and exciting news from Italy .
His fellow scientist , Galileo Galilei , had constructed a number of telescopes and had used them to observe celestial phenomena not visible to the naked eye .
The astounding results were published in Galileo ’s revolutionary little work , The Starry Messenger , in which the Italian astronomer announced the discovery of sunspots , Jupiter ’s four moons , countless " new " stars , and most importantly — from Kepler ’s point of view — the mountains and craters of the moon .
Here was visual confirmation of much of what Kepler had theorized in the Somnium , and it marked the beginning of the end of Aristotelian cosmology .
Yet Kepler , unlike the overly euphoric Galileo , was realistic enough to know that the new discoveries , no matter how revolutionary and enlightening , would not bring about an immediate and universal acceptance of Copernicanism , but at least the Aristotelians were clearly on the defensive .
At this point the future of the new astronomy and of the Somnium looked almost as bright as the new stars seen for the first time through Galileo ’s telescope .
The lunar geography was probably read privately in manuscript form for the last time in 1610 .
Through a rather complicated and unfortunate series of events , Kepler lost control of a copy in 1611 and a number of individuals — many of them unknown to Kepler personally — gained access to it , including some that the author would not have approved of .
The Somnium was written for scientists and was little understood , except on the most superficial level , by those lacking a scientific background .
Kepler suggests that it became the subject of gossip in the tonstrinae , the forerunner to the modern coffeehouse .
19
Some of those who knew Kepler and his family , or at least thought they did , discovered sufficient autobiographical material in the manuscript to feed the fires of ignorance and superstition then engulfing Germany .
They equated Johannes with Duracotus and made particular note of the similarities between Katherine Kepler , the astronomer ’s mother , and Fiolxhilde , the fictional peddler of magic charms and herbs .
Especially damning was the description of Fiolxhilde as a " wise woman " in league with celestial spirits , nor did Kepler ’s joke about the Daemon ’s preference for old witches as traveling companions help .
To make matters worse , Katherine Kepler was well known for her vile temper and generally cantankerous disposition , not to mention the fact that the aunt who had cared for her as a child was burned at the stake as a witch .
The stage was set , charges were leveled , and in 1615 Katherine Kepler was arrested on suspicion of practicing witchcraft .
In his attempt to evade the scorn of the Aristotelians by concealing his pro-Copernican work in the guise of classical mythology , Kepler had inadvertently set a trap for himself and his mother , for they had become the unwitting victims of the seventeenth - century European witch - craze .
Johannes Kepler ’s reputation as a noted mathematician - astronomer by no means served as a guarantee that Katherine Kepler would escape the fate of thousands of others who had already died at the stake for their alleged complicity in what authorities envisioned as a mass satanic conspiracy .
Kepler was well aware of the seriousness of the charges and he put all else aside to work for Katherine ’s exoneration .
A long , tedious , and taxing legal battle resulted : only after five years , part of which his mother spent in prison , was the old woman released ; but the damage had been done .
Katherine Kepler died in April of 1622 from causes directly attributable to the rigors of her imprisonment ; her son had been able to do little significant work while trying to obtain his mother ’s release ; and the publication of the Somnium , at least for the present , was out of the question .
Historical circumstances , as during his student days at Tübingen in 1593 , had again deprived Kepler of the opportunity to publicly air his views .
Under these conditions , could it have truly mattered to Kepler whether or not his desire to speak out had been thwarted by a narrow - minded faculty senate impervious to all scientific inquiry deemed anti-Aristotelian , or a group of superstitious and half - crazed witch - hunters who had mistaken fantasy for reality ?
The tragedy of Katherine Kepler ’s long and painful ordeal weighed heavily upon her son for the remainder of his life .
He felt a deep sense of personal responsibility for the old woman ’s demise even though any reasonably objective observer could find no grounds for culpability on his part .
There was little left for Kepler but his work , and he set out to complete a number of projects postponed by his mother ’s arrest and imprisonment .
Of primary concern was a handbook of Copernican astronomy without which fellow scientists would not know how to correlate the laws Kepler derived from Tycho ’s observations with the work of Copernicus to arrive at an operable model of the heliocentric system .
20 Another project of importance was the planetary position predictions that would confirm the validity of Kepler ’s theory of elliptical orbits as set forth in the law of 1605 .
Only after overcoming several major obstacles , which biographer Arthur Koestler likens to the Ten Plagues of Egypt , were the Rudolphine Tables , named in honor of Kepler ’s deceased patron , brought to press .
21 Meanwhile , Kepler returned to the manuscript of the ill - fated Somnium which had been neglected since 1610 .
During the last decade of his life , from 1620 to 1630 , Kepler wrote the 223 footnotes to the Dream which are much longer than the text itself .
It is within these footnotes that the true scientist stands forth , for they contain the scientific core of the lunar geography .
This , the third and last stage of composition , was undertaken as a result of Kepler ’s dissatisfaction with his scant attention to scientific detail in the earlier version of the manuscript .
The point is made by Kepler himself in a letter written to his friend , Matthias Bernegger , dated December 4 , 1623 :
Two years ago , immediately after my return to Linz I have started to work again on the astronomy of the moon , or rather to elucidate it by remarks ....
There are just as many problems as lines in my writing , which can only be solved astronomically , physically , or historically .
But what can one do about this ?
The people wish that this kind of fun , as they say , would throw itself around their neck , with cozy arms ; in playing they do not wish to wrinkle their foreheads .
Therefore , I decided to solve the problem myself , in notes ordered and numbered .
22 Perhaps because of his mother ’s ordeal , coupled with the rising popularity of the new astronomy , Kepler no longer feared or even cared about the possible consequences of publishing a work founded on Copernican principles .
The insecurity that had resulted from Kepler ’s lifelong fear of Aristotelian sanctions against his work had finally been overcome .
He had paid a price that few men of his or any other generation are willing to pay , and then , just before the manuscript could be published , death unexpectedly deprived him of the satisfaction of seeing his long labor in print .
In his analysis of the Somnium Kepler ’s biographer Max Caspar muses over the question :
What would the Dream have been like had Kepler written about a " moon state " the way his contemporary , Campanella , composed a " sun state " ?
23
The question arose at Kepler ’s own suggestion in the same letter to Bernegger in which he had outlined his reasons for adding footnotes to the Somnium .
Kepler asks : Campanella wrote a City of the Sun .
What about my writing a " City of the Moon " ?
Would it not be excellent to describe the cyclopic mores of our time in vivid colors , but in doing so — to be on the safe side — to leave this earth and go to the moon ?
More in his Utopia and Erasmus in his Praise of Folly ran into trouble and had to defend themselves .
Therefore let us leave the vicissitudes of politics alone and let us remain in the pleasant , fresh green fields of philosophy .
24 Caspar considers it unfortunate that Kepler did not carry out his plan ; but it is a view this writer does not share .
25
No one , of course , can know the type of lunar society Kepler might have created had he not wanted to stay out of the sticky realm of social and political speculation : he was a genius and of all human qualities none is more unpredictable .
Still , it is difficult to believe that any work of social criticism he might have authored could have matched Kepler ’s contribution either to scientific theory or the new literary genre , science fiction .
There is little in the historical record to show that he possessed the political insight of either a Sir Thomas More or an Erasmus , but everything to show that he was a scientific genius with few peers .
To have turned the Somnium into a polemic for social and political reform would have almost certainly detracted from its real value as a unique contribution to science fiction and might have negated its value in the field of scientific theory as well .
Kepler ’s other major biographer , Arthur Koestler , paints the picture of a man astride the crest of a great " watershed " in Western intellectual history : on the one side is the medieval world where science is dominated by religion and the teachings of the ancient Greeks ; on the other side is the modern world in which science finally becomes a discipline unto itself .
Kepler leans one way , then the other ; but he can never quite extricate himself from the medieval mentality of the times and cross over onto the plain of modern thought .
In many ways it is a fair characterization , but one that fails to take sufficient account of the one work that preoccupied Kepler off and on for some thirty - seven years and reflects the various stages in his intellectual maturation as a scientist .
The Somnium is itself a watershed , for it marks both the end of an old era and the beginning of a new one .
After his introductory tribute to the classicists , the modern scientist takes command .
The Daemon of Lavania is nothing less than Kepler ’s own subtly masked voice speaking with confidence and authority about the unlimited possibilities that he , believes science holds for mankind .
Gone is the fantasy - utopian world of Lucian and Campanella ; in its place is an imaginative modern work anchored in fact and rich in rational scientific theory .
If Kepler ’s little fictional work was to be overlooked by historians of science for over three and one - half centuries , later writers of cosmic voyages in the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries did not make the same mistake .
The Somnium was known to Jules Verne , H.G. Wells and , I believe , at least indirectly , to such contemporary writers of science fiction as Arthur C. Clarke .
Kepler opened the way for a new vision of the universe as the home of a plurality of worlds .
26 Seen from the perspective of the twentieth century , there is no reason to dispute the assertion that Kepler ’s Dream is the fons et origo of modern science fiction .
27 Fortunately , even after the passage of three hundred and fifty years , history has a way of correcting injustice and apportioning credit where it is due .
It has not been until the last few years that Kepler ’s many works have finally been given the attention merited by their major contributions to later scientific and technological developments , not the least of which are twentieth - century man ’s lunar voyages .

One of the new twentieth - century scholars of the Somnium , Marjorie Hope Nicolson , shares the view that much of the work was written in the summer of 1609 .
However , Professor Nicolson writes , " there are details which could not possibly have been known to Kepler before the spring of 1610 . "
She is referring to Galileo ’s publication of The Starry Messenger which made known detailed observations of the lunar surface with the telescope .
It is a point worth keeping in mind , but one which does not significantly alter the historical account .

The reader may have already surmised that there is a substantial amount of autobiographical material in the Somnium .

ABSTRACT
Following an account of the painful fa mily circumstances and risks attending the posthumous publication of Somnium in 1634 , this essay contends that the work marks the beginning of a new era .
After an initial tribute to the classicists , the modern scientist takes over .
The Daemon of Lavania is nothing less than Kepler ’s own subtly masked voice , speaking with authority about the unlimited possibilities of science .
Gone is the fantasy - utopian world of Lucian and Campanella ; in its place is an imaginative modern work anchored in fact and rich in rational scientific theory .
And if Kepler ’s small - scaled fictional work was overlooked by historians of science for over 350 years , writers of cosmic voyages during the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries did not make the same mistake .
The Somnium was known to Jules Verne , H. G. Wells , and , I believe , to such contemporary writers as Arthur C. Clarke .
Kepler opened the way for a new vision of the universe as a home to a plurality of worlds ; indeed , Kepler ’s Dream may be seen as the fons et origo of modern science fiction .
Only in the last few years have Kepler ’s writings finally been given the attention merited by their historical importance and their contribution to later scientific and technological developments , including twentieth - century man ’s lunar voyages .

LLVM Backend for DDC .
With the blessing of Ben Lippmeier I have started work on an new backend for his DDC compiler .
Currently , DDC has a backend that generates C code which then gets run through GNU GCC to generate executables .
Once it is working , the new backend will eventually replace the C one .
The new DDC backend will target the very excellent LLVM , the Low Level Virtual Machine .
Unlike C , LLVM is specifically designed as a general retargetable compiler backend .
It became the obvious choice for DDC when the GHC Haskell compiler added an LLVM backend which almost immediately showed great promise .
Its implementation was of relatively low complexity in comparison to the existing backends and it also provided pretty impressive performance .
This GHC backend was implemented by David Terei as part of an undergraduate thesis in the Programming Languages and Systems group an UNSW .
Since DDC is written in Haskell , there are two obvious ways to implement an LLVM backend :
Using the haskell LLVM bindings available on hackage .
Using David Terei's code that is part of the GHC compiler .
At first glance , the former might well be the more obvious choice , but the LLVM bindings have a couple of drawbacks from the point of view of using them in DDC .
In the end , the main factor in choosing which to use was Ben 's interest in boostrapping the compiler ( compiling the compiler with itself ) as soon as possible .
The existing LLVM bindings use a number of advanced Haskell features , that is , features beyond that of the Haskell 98 standard .
If we used the LLVM bindings in DDC , that would mean the DDC would have to support all the features needed by the binding before DDC could be bootstrapped .
Similarly , the LLVM bindings use GHC's Foreign Function Interface ( FFI ) to call out the the LLVM library .
DDC currently does have some FFI support , but this was another mark against the bindings .
By way of contrast , David Terei's LLVM backend for GHC is pretty much standard Haskell code and since it generates text files containing LLVM's Intermediate Representation ( IR ) , a high - level , typed assembly language , there is no FFI problem .
The only downside of David 's code is that the current version in the GHC Darcs tree uses a couple of modules that are private to GHC itself .
Fortunately , it looks like these problems can be worked around with relatively little effort .
Having decided to use David 's code , I started hacking on a little test project .
The aim of the test project to set up an LLVM Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) in Haskell for a simple module .
The AST is then pretty printed as a textual LLVM IR file and assembled using LLVM 's llc compiler to generate native assembler .
Finally the assembler code is compiled with a C module containing a main function which calls into the LLVM generated code .

Hispania have failed to score a point so far since joining the grid Hispania Racing have split from Italian chassis manufacturer Dallara after only six races on what the team say are " amicable terms " .
Hispania have failed as yet to score a point in their maiden F1 campaign .
The Spanish team say that part of the reason is that since their arrival on the grid " no further chassis development was made by Dallara " .
Hispania added that they intend to improve the chassis via their own development programme .
The team endured a troubled start to their debut season , with an internal takeover and subsequent name change from Campos Meta to Hispania in the build - up to the 2010 campaign .
And the Spanish marque only just made it on to the grid for the season - opener in Bahrain in March after a race against time to be ready .
A statement from the team said : " Hispania Racing , and Dallara Automobili , have agreed that what they have achieved in such a short period of time was more than could have been reasonably expected .
" The two parties wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavours . "
Former Williams , BAR and Red Bull designer Geoff Willis is working with Hispania on a consultancy basis as they seek to develop a competitive package .

This article was written and reported by C. J. Chivers , Carlotta Gall , Andrew W. Lehren , Mark Mazzetti , Jane Perlez , and Eric Schmitt , with contributions from Jacob Harris and Alan McLean .
A six - year archive of classified military documents made public on Sunday offers an unvarnished , ground - level picture of the war in Afghanistan that is in many respects more grim than the official portrayal .
The secret documents , released on the Internet by an organization called WikiLeaks , are a daily diary of an American - led force often starved for resources and attention as it struggled against an insurgency that grew larger , better coordinated and more deadly each year .
The New York Times , the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel were given access to the voluminous records several weeks ago on the condition that they not report on the material before Sunday .
The documents — some 92,000 reports spanning parts of two administrations from January 2004 through December 2009 — illustrate in mosaic detail why , after the United States has spent almost $ 300 billion on the war in Afghanistan , the Taliban are stronger than at any time since 2001 .
As the new American commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David H. Petraeus , tries to reverse the lagging war effort , the documents sketch a war hamstrung by an Afghan government , police force and army of questionable loyalty and competence , and by a Pakistani military that appears at best uncooperative and at worst to work from the shadows as an unspoken ally of the very insurgent forces the American - led coalition is trying to defeat .
The material comes to light as Congress and the public grow increasingly skeptical of the deepening involvement in Afghanistan and its chances for success as next year ’s deadline to begin withdrawing troops looms .
The archive is a vivid reminder that the Afghan conflict until recently was a second - class war , with money , troops and attention lavished on Iraq while soldiers and Marines lamented that the Afghans they were training were not being paid .
The reports — usually spare summaries but sometimes detailed narratives — shed light on some elements of the war that have been largely hidden from the public eye :
• The Taliban have used portable heat - seeking missiles against allied aircraft , a fact that has not been publicly disclosed by the military .
This type of weapon helped the Afghan mujahedeen defeat the Soviet occupation in the 1980s .
• Secret commando units like Task Force 373 — a classified group of Army and Navy special operatives — work from a “ capture / kill list ” of about 70 top insurgent commanders .
These missions , which have been stepped up under the Obama administration , claim notable successes , but have sometimes gone wrong , killing civilians and stoking Afghan resentment .
• The military employs more and more drone aircraft to survey the battlefield and strike targets in Afghanistan , although their performance is less impressive than officially portrayed .
Some crash or collide , forcing American troops to undertake risky retrieval missions before the Taliban can claim the drone ’s weaponry .
• The Central Intelligence Agency has expanded paramilitary operations inside Afghanistan .
The units launch ambushes , order airstrikes and conduct night raids .
From 2001 to 2008 , the C.I.A. paid the budget of Afghanistan ’s spy agency and ran it as a virtual subsidiary .
Over all , the documents do not contradict official accounts of the war .
But in some cases the documents show that the American military made misleading public statements — attributing the downing of a helicopter to conventional weapons instead of heat - seeking missiles or giving Afghans credit for missions carried out by Special Operations commandos .
White House officials vigorously denied that the Obama administration had presented a misleading portrait of the war in Afghanistan .
“ On Dec. 1 , 2009 , President Obama announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan , and increased focus on Al Qaeda and Taliban safe - havens in Pakistan , precisely because of the grave situation that had developed over several years , ” said Gen. James L. Jones , White House national security adviser , in a statement released Sunday .
“ We know that serious challenges lie ahead , but if Afghanistan is permitted to slide backwards , we will again face a threat from violent extremist groups like Al Qaeda who will have more space to plot and train , ” the statement said .
General Jones also decried the decision by WikiLeaks to make the documents public , saying that the United States " strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security . " ”
“ WikiLeaks made no effort to contact us about these documents – the United States government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted , ” General Jones said .
The archive is clearly an incomplete record of the war .
It is missing many references to seminal events and does not include more highly classified information .
The documents also do not cover events in 2010 , when the influx of more troops into Afghanistan began and a new counterinsurgency strategy took hold .
They suggest that the military ’s internal assessments of the prospects for winning over the Afghan public , especially in the early days , were often optimistic , even naïve .
There are fleeting — even taunting — reminders of how the war began in the occasional references to the elusive Osama bin Laden .
In some reports he is said to be attending meetings in Quetta , Pakistan .
His money man is said to be flying from Iran to North Korea to buy weapons .
Mr. bin Laden has supposedly ordered a suicide attack against the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
These reports all seem secondhand at best .
The reports portray a resilient , canny insurgency that has bled American forces through a war of small cuts .
The insurgents set the war ’s pace , usually fighting on ground of their own choosing and then slipping away .
Sabotage and trickery have been weapons every bit as potent as small arms , mortars or suicide bombers .
So has Taliban intimidation of Afghan officials and civilians — applied with pinpoint pressure through threats , charm , violence , money , religious fervor and populist appeals .
FEB . 19 , 2008 | ZABUL PROVINCE Intelligence Summary : Officer Threatened
An Afghan National Army brigade commander working in southern Afghanistan received a phone call from a Taliban mullah named Ezat , one brief report said .
“ Mullah Ezat told the ANA CDR to surrender and offered him $ 100,000 ( US ) to quit working for the Afghan Army , ” the report said .
“ Ezat also stated that he knows where the ANA CDR is from and knows his family . ”

MAY 9 , 2009 | KUNAR PROVINCE Intelligence Summary : Taliban Recruiter
A Taliban commander , Mullah Juma Khan , delivered a eulogy at the funeral of a slain insurgent .
He played on the crowd ’s emotions , according to the report : “ Juma cried while telling the people an unnamed woman and her baby were killed while the woman was nursing the baby . ”
Finally he made his pitch : “ Juma then told the people they needed to be angry at CF [ Coalition Force ] and ANSF [ Afghan National Security Forces ] for causing this tragedy ” and “ invited everyone who wants to fight to join the fighters who traveled with him . ”

The insurgents use a network of spies , double agents , collaborators and informers — anything to undercut coalition forces and the effort to build a credible and effective Afghan government capable of delivering security and services .
The reports repeatedly describe instances when the insurgents have been seen wearing government uniforms , and other times when they have roamed the country or appeared for battle in the very Ford Ranger pickup trucks that the United States had provided the Afghan Army and police force .
NOV . 20 , 2006 | KABUL Incident Report : Insurgent Subterfuge
After capturing four pickup trucks from the Afghan National Army , the Taliban took them to Kabul to be used in suicide bombings .
“ They intend to use the pick - up trucks to target ANA compounds , ISAF and GOA convoys , as well as ranking GOA and ISAF officials , ” said a report , referring to coalition forces and the government of Afghanistan .
“ The four trucks were also accompanied by an unknown quantity of ANA uniforms to facilitate carrying out the attacks . ”

The Taliban ’s use of heat - seeking missiles has not been publicly disclosed — indeed , the military has issued statements that these internal records contradict .
In the form known as a Stinger , such weapons were provided to a previous generation of Afghan insurgents by the United States , and helped drive out the Soviets .
The reports suggest that the Taliban ’s use of these missiles has been neither common nor especially effective ; usually the missiles missed .
MAY 30 , 2007 | HELMAND PROVINCE Incident Report : Downed Helicopter
An American CH - 47 transport helicopter was struck by what witnesses described as a portable heat - seeking surface - to - air missile after taking off from a landing zone .
The helicopter , the initial report said , “ was engaged and struck with a Missile ... shortly after crossing over the Helmand River .
The missile struck the aircraft in the left engine .
The impact of the missile projected the aft end of the aircraft up as it burst into flames followed immediately by a nose dive into the crash site with no survivors . ”
The crash killed seven soldiers : five Americans , a Briton and a Canadian .
Multiple witnesses saw a smoke trail behind the missile as it rushed toward the helicopter .
The smoke trail was an important indicator .
Rocket - propelled grenades do not leave them .
Heat - seeking missiles do .
The crew of other helicopters reported the downing as a surface - to - air missile strike .
But that was not what a NATO spokesman told Reuters .
“ Clearly , there were enemy fighters in the area , ” said the spokesman , Maj . John Thomas .
“ It ’s not impossible for small - arms fire to bring down a helicopter . ”
The reports paint a disheartening picture of the Afghan police and soldiers at the center of the American exit strategy .
The Pentagon is spending billions to train the Afghan forces to secure the country .
But the police have proved to be an especially risky investment and are often described as distrusted , even loathed , by Afghan civilians .
The reports recount episodes of police brutality , corruption petty and large , extortion and kidnapping .
Some police officers defect to the Taliban .
Others are accused of collaborating with insurgents , arms smugglers and highway bandits .
Afghan police officers defect with trucks or weapons , items captured during successful ambushes or raids .
MARCH 10 , 2008 | PAKTIA PROVINCE Investigation Report : Extortion by the Police
This report captured the circular and frustrating effort by an American investigator to stop Afghan police officers at a checkpoint from extorting payments from motorists .
After a line of drivers described how they were pressed to pay bribes , the American investigator and the local police detained the accused checkpoint police officers .
“ While waiting , ” the investigator wrote , “ I asked the seven patrolmen we detained to sit and relax while we sorted through a problem without ever mentioning why they were being detained .
Three of the patrolmen responded by saying that they had only taken money from the truck drivers to buy fuel for their generator . ”
Two days later when the American followed up , he was told by police officers that the case had been dropped because the witness reports had all been lost .

One report documented the detention of a military base worker trying to leave the base with GPS units hidden under his clothes and taped to his leg .
Another described the case of a police chief in Zurmat , in Paktia Province , who was accused of falsely reporting that his officers had been in a firefight so he could receive thousands of rounds of new ammunition , which he sold in a bazaar .
Coalition trainers report that episodes of cruelty by the Afghan police undermine the effort to build a credible security force to take over when the allies leave .
OCT .
11 , 2009 | BALKH PROVINCE Incident Report : Brutal Police Chief
This report began with an account of Afghan soldiers and police officers harassing and beating local civilians for refusing to cooperate in a search .
It then related the story of a district police commander who forced himself on a 16 - year - old girl .
When a civilian complained , the report continued , “ The district commander ordered his bodyguard to open fire on the AC [ Afghan civilian ] .
The bodyguard refused , at which time the district commander shot [ the bodyguard ] in front of the AC . ”
Rivalries and friction between the largest Afghan security services — the police and the army — are evident in a number of reports .
Sometimes the tensions erupted in outright clashes , as was recorded in the following report from last December that was described as an “ enemy action . ”
The “ enemy ” in this case was the Afghan National Security Force .
DEC .
4 , 2009 | ORUZGAN PROVINCE Incident Report : Police and Army Rivalry
A car accident turned deadly when an argument broke out between the police and the Afghan National Army .
“ The argument escalated and ANA & ANP started to shoot at each other , ” a report said .
An Afghan soldier and three Afghan police officers were wounded in the shootout .
One civilian was killed and six others were wounded by gunfire .

The first time the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald realized it could make money by turning armchair speculation about weekly movie grosses into an actual futures - trading market was nine years ago .
The company had just bought Hollywood Stock Exchange ( HSX.com ) , an Internet game that had , in the late nineties , become a kind of rotisserie league for movie buffs who fancied themselves experts in predicting weekend hits and flops .
HSX was ( and is ) simple
Sign up , and you ’re promptly given $ 2 million in fake money to bet on any movie ’s performance in its first four weeks in U.S. theaters .
As I write , Peter Jackson ’s The Hobbit : Part One is trading at $ 154.51 a share , which means HSX players expect it to gross $ 155 million in its first month — not bad for a movie that does n’t exist .
If that price rises , shareholders make “ money ” ; if expectations for the film sink , their “ cash ” diminishes ; meanwhile , skeptical “ investors ” can “ short ” the movie and hope it underperforms .
It was Cantor Fitzgerald ’s notion to remove those air quotes and have movies go where cotton and soy have gone before — into the real world of commodities trading , where fortunes expand or evaporate based largely on the collective hunch of the moment .
Four months after Cantor Fitzgerald bought HSX , 658 of its employees were killed in the World Trade Center attacks .
It took until 2008 for the company to raise the idea again .
And this time , the concept came unexpectedly close to being realized — so close that in April of this year , its advocates found themselves testifying in front of a congressional subcommittee on agriculture , trying to convince skeptical representatives that the fate of an Adam Sandler movie was as worthy a subject for speculative capital as your average pork belly .
It was not to be .
Opposition from virtually the entire Hollywood Establishment was heated — and united .
“ In my 30 years in the business , ” says A. Robert Pisano , interim chief of the Motion Picture Association of America , who led the anti-trading coalition , “ I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen so many historical antagonists — labor and management , theater owners and distributors , studios and independents — join together this way . ”
But they did , successfully lobbying Congress to insert a provision in the financial - reform bill , signed into law on July 21 , that outlaws movie - futures trading .
The day after the bill passed the House , Cantor Fitzgerald started laying off HSX ’s staff .
Game over .
Or , more precisely , “ Attempt to turn game into non-game in which your irrational exuberance about Taylor Lautner could actually bankrupt you ” — that ’s over .
Unfortunately , the primary argument of HSX ’s supporters looked like a disingenuous attempt to sell a gambling enterprise as a piece of economic stimulus , with this premise :
The film business is inherently risky and always needs new capital , but potential speculators are leery because movie performance is so unpredictable .
Therefore , a futures market that accurately forecasts grosses will make the biz more attractive to investors … who , presumably , would n’t already have blown their dough in that brand - new futures market .
But as any HSX player knows , the game ’s consensus wisdom is often dramatically wrong .
( Just before opening , The A - Team and The Karate Kid each traded at about $ 95 — guesses that proved $ 23 million too high for the first film , $ 64 million too low for the second . )
The creation of a speculative market , particularly one in which speculation itself could damage a movie by lending what Pisano calls a specious “ aura of financial authenticity to gossip , ” would be more of a wild card than a stabilizing force .
And even if a futures market could miraculously transform Hollywood into less of an IED for investors , the potential for abuse looms awfully large .
Any new business where the criminal possibilities occur to you before the legitimate ones is probably doomed ; it does n’t take much of a mental leap to envision an army of Wilshire Boulevard Bialystocks and Blooms overseeing scams in which one could intentionally produce a bad movie with bankable stars and noisy marketing , short it , and make a mint when it underperforms .
( Although then we ’d have an explanation for Knight and Day . )
It ’s not surprising that an industry steeped in financial shadiness feared such an idea .
Despite the casual fluency with which many moviegoers now speak about per-screen averages and week - to - week holds , the way grosses are tallied is largely shielded from scrutiny .
A company called Rentrak ( which bought Nielsen ’s box - office business ) compiles the data , and the chief watchdogs preventing a studio from misreporting its grosses are … other studios .
As a self - policed system , this works quite well .
But numbers can still jitter all over the place : Universal estimated that its hit Despicable Me had opened to $ 60 million on a Sunday ; the next day ’s real tally ?
$ 56 million .
That ’s typical — studios overshoot the mark on weekend box office all the time and correct it the next day ( the movies may be the only business in America in which you can blame your own seven - figure mistakes on the weather ) .
What ’s $ 4 million among friendly rivals ?
Nothing .
But what ’s $ 4 million to angry investors who want to know why that money vanished , or whether any of the 3,476 theaters showing the movie underreported their totals ?
It ’s an invitation to a Florida - election - size quagmire of lawsuits , accusations , and demands for transparency every single week .
Such chaos would almost inevitably lead to a call for mandated government - agency oversight of Hollywood accounting , and that , to studio thinking , would be Armageddon — albeit an Armageddon that would be celebrated by everyone who has ever been promised a net - profits check that did n’t arrive .
In the space of just a couple of days this month , a jury demanded Disney pay $ 270 million in damages for wrongfully withholding profits on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , another found that actor Don Johnson was owed $ 23 million by the producers of Nash Bridges , and Nikki Finke ’s Deadline website posted a leaked balance sheet in which Warner Bros.
appeared to demonstrate that the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , which grossed $ 938 million worldwide , is somehow $ 167 million in the red .
Given that statistic , perhaps stockholders should inquire whether any studio movies ever realize a net profit , and if not , why the people who run those studios are still employed .
These are the kinds of quaint accounting eccentricities on which , one imagines , the government might want to weigh in someday .
For now , that day has been deferred , which may be the only reason to mourn the loss of the loony futures scheme that would have hastened its arrival .
Those balance sheets could certainly use scrutiny — but not because they ’re entangled in a marketplace in which value is predicated on nothing more than the audacity of hype .
Endangered Species East German Trabants Heading for Extinction
The beloved Trabant , a trademark of communist East Germany , is dying out fast .
The number rattling around on German roads has dwindled to 35,000 from close to one million shortly after reunification .
Last year 's cash - for - clunkers program appears to have persuaded many owners to ditch their brand loyalty .

The idea that money does not buy happiness has been around for centuries , but now scientists have proven for the first time that even the thought of money reduces satisfaction in the simple pleasures of life .
In the study led by Jordi Quoidbach of the University of Liege in Belgium , over 350 adult volunteers were recruited .
The subjects were university workers with jobs ranging from cleaners to senior positions .
They were given questionnaires asking them about how much they earned , how much they saved , their attitudes to money , and measuring their savoring ability .
Savoring is feeling positive emotions such as contentment , gratitude , joy , awe or excitement during an experience .
The results showed that the subjects who were wealthier had a self - assessed lower level of savoring ability , and this undermined the positive effects of money on their happiness , although they were overall slightly happier than the less well - off subjects .
The volunteers were then randomly assigned into one of two groups .
The subjects in one group were shown a picture of a stack of money as a reminder of wealth , while the second group were shown the same picture but blurred beyond recognition .
After being shown the picture the subjects were given further psychological questionnaires designed to measure their ability to savor pleasant experiences .
The results were that if the subjects were shown the clear picture of money first they scored lower in their ability to savor experiences .
In a second test 40 students were given a binder that included a questionnaire asking them about their attitudes to chocolate .
The binder also contained a photograph , marked as being part of an unrelated study , of a stack of money or a neutral object .
They were then given a piece of chocolate to eat .
Two observers , who had no knowledge of which picture the subject had viewed , used stopwatches to time how long the subject savored the chocolate , and gave them a rating on how much they appeared to be enjoying the chocolate .
The results were that subjects who had viewed the picture of money spent an average of 32 seconds savoring the chocolate , while those who had viewed the neutral picture spent 45 seconds on average and appeared to derive more enjoyment from it .
The conclusion the authors reached was that access to money undermines a person ’s ability to savor the simple pleasures of life , and even looking at a photograph reminding them of wealth could reduce their satisfaction levels .
The study adds to other research in psychology looking at why , once people have enough to cover their basic needs , having more money has little effect on the enjoyment of life .
The paper is published in the Psychological Science journal .

Biological systems are extremely complex .
This nugget of wisdom may seem trivial but it is a lesson the scientific and medical communities have been learning over and over again for a couple of centuries .
Every time we think we understand a biological system we find there is a deeper level of complexity , or another layer of interactions we had not previously taken into consideration .
This is why we need high quality clinical trials to feel confident about the net health effects of any intervention .
A treatment may make sense based upon our current understanding of human biology , but that ’s not enough .
We need to know what it actually does to people .
This is a lesson , however , that the supplement industry has not learned ( and does not appear interested in learning ) .
I have nothing against supplements themselves , only how they are regulated and marketed .
I prescribe supplements all the time , when they are evidence - based .
But the supplement industry has pulled off a marketing coup – the holy grail of marketing : turning their hype into accepted conventional wisdom .
For example , the public generally believes that “ natural ” is always better , that supplements are always safe , and that we all need to take supplements – the more the better .
None of these things are true .
A more subtle marketing deception often employed by the supplement industry is the use of pre-clinical basic - science evidence to support clinical claims for their products .
In other words , they cite studies in which some marker in a petri dish is increased in the presence of their supplement , then extrapolate several steps to an ultimate clinical application .
One of the most common manifestations of this I encounter is looking at some marker of immune function , claiming that it is increased , then extrapolating from this that the supplement “ boosts the immune system ” and then further extrapolating that it will therefore help the body fight off cancer .
Antioxidants are another example – extrapolating wildly from pure basic science evidence that antioxidants reduce oxidative stress .
When clinical studies started coming in showing no benefit the antioxidant sellers claimed that the doses were n’t high enough .
Now we have data showing that high doses of antioxidants are associated with increased risk of heart disease .
It turns out ( gasp ) that the biological system was more complex than we though .
Oxygen free radicals are also used as signaling chemicals that trigger important cell functions , and suppressing them has – unintended consequences .
Now we potentially have another story to add to the law of unintended consequences – calcium supplements and heart disease .
Osteoporosis – the thinning of bones through loss of calcium – is a serious medical problem for the geriatric population .
After about age 50 ( and post - menopause for women ) men and women start to lose calcium from their bones .
The best way to prevent this from becoming a problem is to maximize your bone density by age 50 , and this is done through weight - bearing exercise .
Exercise after age 50 will also help stave off bone loss to a lesser degree .
There is an ongoing controversy about the use of calcium supplements , calcium plus vitamin D , and the use of prescription medications to increase bone density and reduce osteoporosis .
This is a complex area of medical evidence , but the quick version is that calcium supplements by themselves are likely not of any significant benefit in preventing and treating osteoporosis and reducing fractures .
Calcium plus vitamin D has modest benefit for bone density .
In some patients with osteoporosis and not responding to supplements and exercise alone , pharmacological treatment may be necessary to reduce the risk of fractures .
It also is likely true that calcium and vitamin D supplements are only helpful if a person is deficient in one or both .
If you are getting sufficient calcium and vitamin D from your diet , taking additional supplements is likely of no benefit .
This is a quick summary of a lot of evidence , and there are still many open questions that need to be addressed by further research .
Meanwhile the pharmaceutical industry is doing what they can to push prescriptions for osteoporosis and osteopenia ( a milder form of bone loss ) .
And the supplement industry is pushing calcium and vitamin D supplements .
In addition to the fact that there is little evidence to support the use of these supplements in most people , there is the question of safety .
Again – there is the common assumption that supplements can do no harm , so even if the evidence for efficacy is weak there is nothing to lose from taking supplement for nutritional “ insurance . ”
This is not a good assumption .
A new study published in the BMJ , in fact , suggests that calcium supplements are associated with a 30 % relative increased risk of heart attack ( but not death , and only a tiny increase in stroke risk ) .
This is a meta - analysis of previous studies , and the authors found :
Calcium supplements ( without coadministered vitamin D ) are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction .
As calcium supplements are widely used these modest increases in risk of cardiovascular disease might translate into a large burden of disease in the population .
A reassessment of the role of calcium supplements in the management of osteoporosis is warranted .
So calcium supplements are of questionable benefit , and may increase the risk of heart attacks .
The authors point out that prior studies did not find the same increased risk from a diet high in calcium , so it only seems to apply to calcium supplements .
This is yet more evidence for the general principle , supported by clinical evidence , that it is better to get your nutrition through a healthful varied diet than through supplements .
This study also demonstrates the utility for researchers to keep going back and asking questions about interventions .
Biological systems are complex , and we have to look at interventions from multiple angles before we get a handle on their net health effects .
And this study is not the final word – it takes many studies over years of research for a consistent picture to emerge .
All we can say at any point in time is the best interpretation of existing research .
Right now for osteoporosis it seems that the best strategy for bone health is to have a healthful diet with sufficient calcium and to exercise regularly ( funny how evidence seems to be coming back to that same conclusion ) .
Regular doctor visits will also determine if this is insufficient and you need further targeted therapy .
NEW ORLEANS , June 24 ( UPI ) --
A federal judge in New Orleans Thursday denied the Obama administration 's request to stay his ruling lifting an offshore drilling ban while it 's under appeal .
In his ruling , U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman denied the motion to stay his decision issued Tuesday granting a preliminary injunction on the six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling .

The administration asked Feldman to delay his decision to lift the ban until an appeals court reviewed the matter later this summer .
In his two - page decision , Feldman extended the time the federal government had to report its compliance with the injunction from 21 days to 30 days , " in light of the defendants ' pending appeal . "

Paul Pogba returns to the France squad for the first time since June last year after being included on Thursday by coach Didier Deschamps for the upcoming friendly against Ukraine and UEFA Nations League double - header against Portugal and Croatia .
American officials are searching for Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks in an attempt to pressure him not to publish thousands of confidential and potentially hugely embarrassing diplomatic cables that offer unfiltered assessments of Middle East governments and leaders .
The Daily Beast , a US news reporting and opinion website , reported that Pentagon investigators are trying to track down Julian Assange – an Australian citizen who moves frequently between countries – after the arrest of a US soldier last week who is alleged to have given the whistleblower website a classified video of American troops killing civilians in Baghdad .
The soldier , Bradley Manning , also claimed to have given WikiLeaks 260,000 pages of confidential diplomatic cables and intelligence assessments .
The US authorities fear their release could " do serious damage to national security " , said the Daily Beast , which is published by Tina Brown , former editor of Vanity Fair and New Yorker magazines .
Manning , 22 , was arrested in Iraq last month after he was turned over to US authorities by a former hacker , Adrian Lamo , to whom he boasted of leaking the video and documents .
As an intelligence specialist in the US army , Manning had access to assessments from the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as frank diplomatic insights into Middle East governments .
In one of his messages to Lamo , obtained by Wired magazine , Manning said : " Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available . "
Although it is likely that WikiLeaks has broken US laws in de-encrypting the video from Baghdad and publishing secret documents , the tone of an American official who spoke to the Daily Beast sounded more desperate than threatening .
" We 'd like to know where he is ; we 'd like his cooperation in this , " the official said .
It is , in any case , not clear what legal measures US officials could use to stop publication of the cables .
Assange has created an elaborate web of protection – with servers in several countries , notably Sweden , which has strong laws protecting whisteblowers .
WikiLeaks ' response to the news that the Americans are trying to track down Assange came on Twitter .
" Any signs of unacceptable behaviour by the Pentagon or its agents towards this press will be viewed dimly , " it said .
After Manning was arrested , WikiLeaks said in a Twitter message that allegations " we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect " .
Before his arrest , Manning told Lamo he was in part motivated to leak the video and documents by being ordered to look the other way in the face of injustice .
Messages from Manning , obtained by Wired , say he found that 15 Iraqis arrested by Iraqi police for printing " anti-Iraq " literature had merely put together an assessment of government corruption .
" I immediately took that information and ran to the [ US army ] officer to explain what was going on .
He did n't want to hear any of it .
He told me to shut up and explain how we could assist the [ Iraqi police ] in finding MORE detainees , " Manning wrote .
" Everything started slipping after that .
I saw things differently .
I had always questioned the [ way ] things worked , and investigated to find the truth .
" But that was a point where I was … actively involved in something I was completely against . "
The Pentagon has declined to comment on the grounds that what is in the documents is classified .
Graphing variables is a critical skill in science .
If something depends on something else -- like the speed of sounds depends on air density , or the surface gravity of an object depends on its size -- then if you plot the two things on a graph , you should see a pattern .
The result is a line , or a curve .
If the two things do n't depend on each other , you get a random collection of dots : a scatter plot .
About a hundred years ago , two astronomers plotted the brightness of stars against their color ( from blue to red ) and what they found was amazing : a clear connection between the two !
In fact , stars fell into several groups , and over the years we 've learned about why that happens .
Most stars are stable , like the Sun , and fall into the Main Sequence of the plot .
Some are old , some young , some dying , some dead .
And they all have their place in what we now call the Hertzsprung - Russel diagram , or H - R diagram for short .
It 's one of the most useful tools astronomers have ever created .
And now my friend Stuart who runs Astronomy Blog has done it one better : he 's created an H - R diagram of media stars .
It 's awesome :
That 's really funny , and I wish I had thought of it .
The vertical axis is fame , as denoted by Google results , and the horizontal axis is peer - reviewed papers .
I 'm actually only first author on I think two papers , but I was listed as author on a lot due to my work on Hubble .
So I do OK on this diagram .
I note that Brian Cox is more luminous than me , but then , he 's an actual rock star .
If there were a branch for white main sequence stars , he and I would be in a dead heat .
Next up , I hope : a space - time diagram showing warping due to massive astronomers .

surprising to discover the clerical regime knuckling after an initial
bombing run -- we'd have to strike until they stopped .
And if we had any doubt
about where their new facilities were ( and it 's a good bet the clerical
regime would try to bury new sites deep under heavily populated areas ) , and
we were reasonably suspicious they were building again , we'd have to

Reuel Marc Gerecht 's screed justifying an Israeli bombing attack on Iran coincides with the opening of the new Israel lobby campaign marked by the introduction ofexpressing full support for such an Israeli attack .
What is important to understand about this campaign is that the aim of Gerecht and of the right - wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu is to support an attack by Israel so that the United States can be drawn into direct , full - scale war with Iran .
That has long been the Israeli strategy for Iran , because Israel cannot fight a war with Iran without full U.S. involvement .
Israel needs to know that the United States will finish the war that Israel wants to start .
Gerecht openly expresses the hope that any Iranian response to the Israeli attack would trigger full - scale U.S. war against Iran .
Gerecht suggest that the same logic would apply to any Iranianby which we really means any attack on a U.S. target in the Middle East .
Gerecht writes that Obama might be That 's the key sentence in this very long Gerecht argument .
Obama is not going to beto join Israeli aggression against Iran unless he feels that domestic political pressures to do so are too strong to resist .
That 's why the Israelis are determined to line up a strong majority in Congress and public opinion for war to foreclose Obama 's options .
In the absence of confidence that Obama would be ready to come into the war fully behind Israel , there cannot be an Israeli strike .
Gerecht 's argument for war relies on a fanciful nightmare scenario of Iran doling out nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists all over the Middle East .
But the real concern of the Israelis and their lobbyists , as Gerecht 's past writing has explicitly stated , is to destroy Iran 's Islamic regime in a paroxysm of U.S. military violence .
Gerecht first revealed this Israeli - neocon fantasy as early as 2000 , before the Iranian nuclear program was even taken seriously , in an essay written for a book published by the Project for a New American Century .
Gerecht argued that , if Iran could be caught in athe U.S. Navy should .
The purpose of such a military response , he wrote , should be toAnd lest anyone fail to understand what he meant by that , Gerecht was more explicit :
In 2006 - 07 , the Israeli war party had reason to believed that it could hijack U.S. policy long enough to get the war it wanted , because it had placed one of its most militant agents , David Wurmser , in a strategic position to influence that policy .
We now know that Wurmser , formerly a close adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu and during that period Vice President Dick Cheney 's main adviser on the Middle East , urged a policy of overwhelming U.S. military force against Iran .
After leaving the administration in 2007 , Wurmser revealed that he had advocated a U.S. war on Iran , not to set back the nuclear program but to achieve regime change .
Wurmser told The Telegraph .
The U.S. attack was not to be limited to nuclear targets but was to be quite thorough and massively destructive .
Of course , that kind of war could not be launched out of the blue .
It would have required a casus belli to justify a limited initial attack that would then allow a rapid escalation of U.S. military force .
In 2007 , Cheney acted on Wurmser 's advice and tried to get Bush to provoke a war with Iran over Iraq , but it was foiled by the PentagonAs Wurmser was beginning to whisper that advice in Cheney 's ear in 2006 , Gerecht was making the same argument in The Weekly Standard :
The idea of waging a U.S. war of destruction against Iran is obvious lunacy , which is why U.S. military leaders have strongly resisted it both during the Bush and Obama administrations .
But Gerecht makes it clear that Israel believes it can use its control of Congress to pound Obama into submission .
Democrats in Congress , he boasts
Even though Israel has increasingly been regarded around the world as a rogue state after its Gaza atrocities and the commando killings of unarmed civilians on board the Mavi Marmara , its grip on the U.S. Congress appears as strong as everMoreover , polling data for 2010 show that a majority of Americans have already been manipulated into supporting war against Iran - in large part because more than two - thirds of those polled have gotten the impression that Iran already has nuclear weapons .
The Israelis are apparently hoping to exploit that advantage .
writes Gerecht .
Netanyahu must be feeling good about the prospects for pressuring Barack Obama to join an Israeli war of aggression against Iran .
It was Netanyahu , after all , who declared in 2001 , - Gareth Porter ( " The Real Aim of Israel ’s Bomb Iran Campaign , CommonDreams .

Apocalyptic thought has a tradition that dates to the Persian prophet Zoroaster in the 14th century BC .
Recently , anxiety has grown over the prediction of the end of the world in the Mayan calendar .
It 's true that the Mayan odometer will hit zeros on 21 December 2012 , as it reaches the end of a 394 - year cycle called a baktun .
But this baktun is part of a larger 8,000 - year cycle called a pictun , and there 's no evidence that anything astronomically untoward will happen as the current baktun slides into the next .
However , that has n't stopped the feverish speculating that sells books and cinema tickets .
What kind of catastrophe would it take to end the world ?
Astronomical intruders provide a potentially serious threat .
Impacts can be caused by stray rubble from the Asteroid Belt and the rocky snowballs that travel in highly elliptical orbits in the comet cloud .
There are many fewer large bits of debris than small bits , so the interval between large impacts is much longer than the interval between small impacts .
That 's good news .
Every century or so , a 10 - meter meteor slams into the Earth with the force of a small nuclear device .
Tunguska was the site of the last , in 1908 , and it was pure luck that that meteor landed in the uninhabited wilderness of Siberia .
Every few thousand years , Earth can pass through unusually thick parts of the debris trail of comets , turning the familiar light show of a meteor shower into a deadly firestorm .
Roughly every 100,000 years , a projectile hundreds of meters across unleashes power equal to the world 's nuclear arsenals .
The result is devastation over an area the size of England , global tidal waves ( if the impact is in the ocean ) , and enough dust flung into the atmosphere to dim the Sun and kill off vegetation .
That could ruin your day .
Then there 's the " Big One " .
About every 100 million years , a rock the size of a small asteroid slams into the Earth , causing global earthquakes , kilometre - high tidal waves , and immediately killing all large land animals .
Creatures in the sea soon follow , as trillions of tons of vaporised rock cause drastic cooling and the destruction of the food chain based on photosynthesis .
There 's good evidence that this happened 65 million years ago and our tiny mammal ancestors were the beneficiaries as the giant lizards were extinguished .
A hundred million years sounds like a safe buffer , but the next one could happen at any time .
But you can take it off your worry list – astronomers have it covered .
A network of ground - based telescopes scans the skies for bits of rogue rubble larger than a few hundred meters .
That 's ample time to dust off the nuclear arsenals for an interception mission if we had to .
Unfortunately , the Dr Strangelove approach creates lethal shrapnel travelling in the same direction as the original object ; a smarter strategy is to send a spacecraft alongside it and gently " tug " it with gravity onto a slightly different trajectory .
When massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel , the result is a titanic explosion called a supernova .
The dying star brightens to rival an entire galaxy and emits high - energy particles that can destroy the ozone layer of a planet like Earth if it occurs within 30 light years .
The demise of large North American mammals 41,000 years ago has been linked to a supernova , and several other mini-extinctions may be tied to the cataclysm of stellar death .
A supernova is a small squib compared to a hypernova .
In this dramatic and rare event , the violent collapse of a very massive star ejects jets of gas and high - energy particles at close to the speed of light , and for a few moments the star outshines the entire universe in gamma rays .
If a hypernova went off within 1,000 light years , and Earth was within the narrow cone of high - energy radiation , we 'd experience an immediate global conflagration .
It 's brutal luck if a hyper nova ever goes off with its beam aimed at us .
On longer time scales , attention turns to the sheltering Sun .
Our constant companion is midway through its conversion of hydrogen into helium .
In about 5 billion years , its guttering flame will be extinguished .
The Sun 's diffuse envelope will engulf the Earth and turn it into a lifeless cinder .
This is death by stellar cremation .
If that seems like a comfortably distant prospect , the biosphere will actually die much sooner .
The Sun burns hot as it gets older , and in 500 million years a turbocharged version of global warming will turn the Earth into a global desert .
That gives us plenty of time to find better real estate .
Titan looks promising .
It already has the nitrogen – just add oxygen and presto !
Our second home .
And those wild - eyed rocket scientists who want to save us from asteroids have a thrilling plan up their sleeves : deliberately bring an asteroid in close , and with each pass it will transfer a little energy to the Earth and nudge it further from the Sun .
After a few million close calls we 'll have migrated to a more hospitable orbit .
*****
Stars come and go but galaxies seem eternal .
A galaxy like the Milky Way acts like it has all the time in the world .
Its spiral arms are cauldrons where new stars form out of gas that falls in like a fine rain from intergalactic space .
Stars like the Sun will some day die , but in Orion and Taurus freshly minted stars are switching on for the first time .
The bright fizz of supernovae is a sideshow ; most stars die modestly and leave behind fading embers .
Stellar lifetime is a strong function of mass because low mass stars are misers with their hydrogen .
The lowest mass stars will eke out a dim existence for over a trillion years .
The end of the Milky Way will come slowly , in a stellar lockdown .
Massive stars live short lives and die explosively as supernovae – leaving behind a neutron star or a black hole , neither of which emits any light .
Stars like the Sun and those less massive will die as white dwarfs – that is , as slowly cooling , carbon - rich embers .
Gradually the cycle of star birth and death will be irrevocably broken .
More and more mass will be trapped in compact stellar remnants or cooling white dwarfs .
In galaxies across the universe the lights will gradually go out , and after tens of trillions of years the universe will have faded to black .
But as bleak as it sounds , the end of starlight does n't mean life must end .
A star shines by converting a tiny proportion of the energy locked in pure matter into radiation .
The ultimate source of starlight is gravitational energy .
There are many ways other than fusion to turn gravitational energy into heat or radiation , so even after the stars have all faded enterprising civilisations could live by harnessing the energy of black holes .
New artificial stars could be created if nostalgia dictated .
*****
Fifteen years ago , it was discovered that the cosmic expansion is getting faster .
The cause is inferred to be dark energy – a manifestation of the pure vacuum of space that has an effect opposite to gravity : it repels rather than attracts .
Its existence was indicated by the fact that distant supernovae are fainter than expected in a decelerating universe .
Dark energy is an embarrassment : fundamental theories do n't predict it , and no one knows how a pure vacuum can have such a bizarre property .
In some theories , dark energy is not the cosmological " constant " of Einstein 's original formulation , but varies over time and space .
If dark energy grows , it will cause the universe to unravel in about 20 billion years in a crescendo called the " Big Rip " .
First galaxies , then stars , and finally atoms will be torn asunder by dark energy .
Nothing can survive ; it 's an outcome of crushing finality .
Absent the big rip , cosmic acceleration will steadily remove galaxies from view .
After 100 billion years , most galaxies will recede faster than the speed of light , leaving frozen final images on the edge of our horizon as if at the boundary of a black hole .
The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies will merge and our view of the universe will end at the edge of this super - galaxy .
On even longer time scales , familiar gravitational structures become unglued .
In about 10 ^15 years , planets detach from their dead stars and drift through interstellar space .
In about 10 ^19 years stars detach from galaxies and float off into intergalactic space .
In most theories that unify fundamental particles in terms of a single super - force , the proton is not stable and will decay in something like 10^35 years .
This vast time scale is to the age of the universe what the age of the universe is to a millisecond .
The decay of protons heralds a final drawn - out phase of disintegration in the universe , as everything falls apart .
After protons decay , there are no stable atoms , presenting a challenge for life .
The curtain falls with the slow evaporation of black holes by a process called Hawking radiation .
The largest black holes evaporate on the inconceivable time scale of 10^98 years .
We imagine the last inhabitants of the universe huddled around the evaporative glow of gamma rays from the last black hole , telling timeless stories about time .
It was fun while it lasted .

Yesterday I was fortunate enough to sit down for a quick chat with the infinitely talented Neil Patrick Harris on the set of Columbia Pictures The Smurfs , where he was forthcoming with plenty of juicy details about his upcoming projects and career .
The most interesting – and definitive – piece of information that he gave me was that he will , in fact , re-team with Kal Penn and John Cho for A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas , which is currently filming in Michigan .
Even though he was mowed down by Beverly D’Angelo ’s madame in the 2008 sequel Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay , NPH will make a glorious , unexplained return to the series .
Additionally , he talked briefly about the success of his Joss Whedon collaboration – the internet sensation Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - A - Long Blog – and said that he ’d love to go for round two with Whedon , Nathan Fillion and crew .
Unfortunately , he could n’t talk more about the status of a follow - up as all of the players are busy with work ( Whedon is now directing The Avengers , while Fillion has a hit TV show in Castle ) .
Speaking of Whedon / Harris collaborations , the pair worked on an acclaimed episode of Glee , which Harris described as a truly amazing experience .
When asked about whether or not he ’d return to the hit FOX series , he said that he ’d love to , but “ the networks like to keep their actors … on their network ” , ( referring to his long - standing contract with CBS for How I Met Your Mother ) and verified that he does n’t think that he ’d have the time or authority to work on another episode .
Sad , but honest …
So , just to recap : NPH will grace the screen in the third Harold and Kumar flick , he ’d love to sequelize Dr. Horrible , but does n’t think that anyone has the time to get it made and he will not likely return to FOX ’s Glee .

Without warning , at the age of 10 , Anne Watts was introduced to her ' new ' mother .
But what had happened to the old one ?
As we stood in the hall next to our hastily packed little bags , we looked around for Mummy .
I climbed the stairs two at a time , flew into the bedroom where she lay , fully dressed on the neatly made bed .
Tendrils of her black hair curled damply on her forehead .
Her eyes were closed .
" Bye , Mummy , see you soon . "
A quick kiss on her cheek and off I went , without a backward glance .
My sister Susan and I were in the care of " Auntie " Eileen , the kindly sister of the scolding cook .
With the trusting naivety of children we had jumped with joy at the offer of a holiday in Liverpool with her and " Uncle " Stan , leaving our mother and father behind .
Excitement built steadily as the car sped through spectacular Welsh countryside .
Finally , Stan 's comfortable old banger swept off a busy street and came to a halt in front of a large grey place that looked more like a school than a holiday destination .
Confusingly , Uncle Stan chose to remain in the car and , after a quick hug and a kiss from him , we followed Eileen into the large draughty entrance hall clutching our few belongings .
Here Eileen kissed us tearfully , quickly signed some papers and left us sitting confused on a bench outside an office door .
Bewilderment turned to panic as we were led off to a bare room where a grim - faced woman examined us for nits , and teeth and fingernails for " filth " .
We were washed roughly and dressed in strange clothes before being separated and led off to dorms where there were lots of other strange girls .
Susan was five and I was nine , and we were alone , seemingly abandoned by our parents .
It had n't always been like this .
Born in Liverpool in June 1940 , with Hitler throwing all that his Luftwaffe had to offer at Britain , I had been evacuated to the safe mountains of North Wales with my mother .
Clare Rosetta was a dedicated nurse , wife and mother .
My swashbuckling father , Arthur Frederick , was a merchant navy captain , a glamorous figure , appearing sporadically , all hugs and shiny buttons , bearing gifts and tall tales from exotic lands .
So my war years were happy and carefree in a pretty little village near Snowdonia .
On 8 May 1945 there was joy and celebration in Europe as the war ended .
" Daddy 's coming home " was my mother 's ecstatic cry and , sure enough , in 1946 my father retired from the sea and began transforming our home into a family hotel .
My sisters Susan and Joan were born in 1945 and 1947 .
Then Father employed Edith Rigby , a brilliant cook , to enhance the reputation of the hotel .
She had a terrible temper .
She also seemed friendly with Daddy and we quickly learned to keep away from the kitchen .
After her arrival , the easy nature of family life began to change .
Mother 's health seemed to decline .
Visits to " heart specialists " in Liverpool were mentioned in hushed tones .
Occasionally , raised voices could be heard echoing up the stairs .
I would creep out in my nightdress and sit hugging my knees , face pressed against the banisters , frightened but not sure why .
The unease built to a head , and then the Liverpool " holiday " popped up …
After the shock of separation from our family , time passed in a blur of lessons , scrubbing floors , making beds and interminable inspections and tongue lashings .
But then , on my 10th birthday , Mother visited with a gift – a silk scarf .
She held me tight and wished me a happy birthday , saying : " Always remember , Anne , I love you more than I love life itself . "
Then , tearfully , she turned away .
I watched her walk off , heels tip - tapping on the polished wooden floor , up the long corridor .
She did not look back .
Soon afterwards , I was summoned to the head 's office .
Miss Beard gently told me my mother " had gone to live with Jesus " .
She said : " She wants you to know that she is happy now , and loves you very much . "
That she was dead was all I knew , and so , at the age of 10 , I shut down .
Do n't show them anything was my credo .
I insisted on telling Susan myself .
I do n't remember how , but somehow I did .
We had no comprehension of where our world had gone – we were just two little girls clinging to each other for dear life .
But it appeared that our salvation was near at hand : Daddy was coming .
My relief was enormous .
Daddy would save us from this place .
He arrived , but he looked awkward , his smile lop - sided and unfamiliar .
And why was the scolding cook with him ?
Miss Beard said : " Anne , Susan – this is your new mother . "
That was it .
No more hugs or kisses .
Do n't show them anything .
But I did .
I wet myself .
We packed our bags , two little girls in shock , and went home to Wales , where we found all traces of Mother had been removed from home .
It was as though she had never existed .
Even in family albums her head had been razored out .
It was bizarre and upsetting to see her body , but no face .
On the few occasions I tried to talk to my father about it , he answered gruffly , telling me not to listen to any lies about us , that we should always look ahead in life , never back , and that when I was older I would understand .
What I understood was that the subject , like so much with Daddy , was a closed book .
" Get on with life , Anne , " he would say .
And so we did .
But Mummy lived on in my heart .
In December 1950 , just five months after the death of my mother , flaxen - haired Paul was born .
It was only much later , when I did the sums , that I realised that Edith 's pregnancy with Paul had precipitated the disasters that had befallen us .
My philandering father had got the cook pregnant and had panicked .
Everything came to a messy head .
Mother could not cope – a divorce and a pregnancy would have been terrible in those times .
Susan and I were bundled out of the way until somehow things were sorted out .
It was n't for another five years , when I was 15 , that I found out Mother had hanged herself when a chambermaid let it slip .
Where was my father in all this ?
He was there , focused on the business .
He never intervened in any difficult situation between his daughters and his new wife ; he seemed to blot out any discord or unhappiness by working hard .
We loved him and he loved all of us , but there were no more hugs and kisses ; all displays of affection had disappeared with my mother .
And Mother ?
What of her ?
It was n't until half a century later that we children finally laid her to rest .
In the summer of 2005 – 20 years after my father had died – Joan , my youngest sister , was on holiday in Snowdonia .
While there , she visited the graveyard of Ynys Cynhauarn church just a mile from our childhood village , where our mother had been buried in an unmarked grave .
Joan found herself suddenly angry and upset at the enormity of what had happened , and decided it was time to set the record straight .
Painstakingly , Joan researched parish records and talked to local officials , and was able to identify the spot where we believed our mother to have been buried .
In 1950s Britain , suicide was illegal and deemed shameful , to be kept secret .
Despite being a churchgoer , Mum was buried , without fuss , in unconsecrated ground .
Once Joan had the necessary details , we three sisters decided it was time to do something positive to confront and counteract the tragedy that had silently dogged us for 56 years .
We had arranged for a headstone , and now the moment had come when we would relive those childhood emotions , numbed with shock and trampled on with such disregard so long ago – and , in so doing , heal our painful wounds .
The first sight of the headstone , a beautiful blue - grey slab of Welsh slate placed two weeks earlier , looked as though it had always been there .
Then the tears came , softly healing the hurt of long ago .
We had walked into the churchyard as three grieving middle - aged women .
We walked out of it , arms linked , as three little sisters who had found redemption for their mother and resolution for themselves .

Native Alaskans living on the edge of the Arctic Ocean fear new oil drilling could destroy their unique way of life , but many Alaskans believe the Arctic 's energy reserves could be economically and politically important .

The town of Barrow on Alaska 's northernmost tip is one of the most remote places on earth .
No roads cross the Arctic tundra to get here , and the nearest city - Fairbanks - is 90 minutes away by air .
It 's a place of extremes : in winter it stays dark for more than two months , but now , midnight looks like midday as townsfolk hurl children one by one into the air on a mat made of seal skin .
The blanket toss is part of Naluqatak , a spring festival held in Native Alaskan villages across Alaska 's Arctic north slope .
Most people in Barrow are at least part - native and hundreds have turned out , many in traditionally - made coats of animal fur , to celebrate another catch : whale .
Twice a year Native Alaskan communities like this hunt whale .
It 's legal and not commercial , and for thousands of years people in the Alaskan Arctic have depended on the meat .
Major environmental groups do n't condone the hunting but tolerate it as an intrinsic part of a subsistence culture .
It 's not really subsistence any more , but tribal elders say chicken or steak bought in a shop is not enough - their bodies crave whale blubber .
At the spring whaling festival , everyone rejoices and shares in the harvest .
Local meats are cooked and served , including caribou stew and goose soup .
But the main attraction is boiled whale meat , including the giant mammals ' organs .

Dismembered parts of a bowhead whale are on display , laid out on a wooden pallet in the middle of a makeshift arena by the Arctic shore .
It is cut into brick - sized chunks and distributed .
People will savour its meat through the long frozen winter .
But many here worry the whales will bypass Barrow 's waters if offshore oil exploration goes ahead , and they have filed lawsuits to stop it .
Oil company
Shell has spent billions of dollars to lease tracts of seabed from the US government and drilling should have started by now .
But the Obama administration stepped in and called a temporary halt after the BP oil spill thousands of miles away in the Gulf of Mexico .

The delay effectively puts back Shell 's plans till next year but the company says it will be back .
" The Gulf of Mexico may have been a wake - up call for some but not for Shell , " says Pete Slaiby , vice - president of Shell Alaska .
" We would not have put the money down on these leases had we not felt we could go in and drill these leases safely . "
Earlier this year , before the order to postpone , Shell reassured the US government it could work safely in Arctic waters .
It said it would be drilling at a depth of 150 ft ( 46 m ) , not 5,000 ft as in the case of BP 's leaking well , making it easier to deal with a blowout .
Shell also pointed out the cold Arctic waters would render any spilled oil more viscous , so it would not spread as far .
( The converse is that the warm waters and sunshine in the Gulf of Mexico help break down oil . )
And the company said it would position state - of - the - art vessels by the drill site so it could respond to a spill within an hour .
Contamination fears
Critics argue no response plan can predict the rapidly - changing conditions of the Arctic and say response vessels may be useless if a spill happens when the sea is choked with ice , as it is much of the year .
Image caption Many Native Alaskans fear contaminating Alaskan waters would impact hunting
Nevertheless , the majority of Alaskans favour offshore drilling in the Arctic - the state derives 90 % of its revenue from oil and gas .
Even though the waters are controlled by the federal government , many , including some among the indigenous people , believe Alaska 's Arctic Ocean reserves will bring jobs and could help reduce America 's dependence on foreign oil .
But in Barrow and other Native Alaskan towns , most do n't want to risk contaminating the Arctic waters .
" The ocean is our garden , " one woman here said .
" It 's where we get our food from .
Not just the whale but the seal and walrus as well , and all the other stuff . "
A woman handing out whale meat said : " If you look at the Gulf of Mexico , they were cutting corners .
If they do that here they 'll be cutting our livelihood .
We can't have that . "
You 're guaranteed to get a mosquito bite this summer , no matter how diligent you are .
If the itching is more than you can stand and you do n't have itch cream on hand , check your drawers for nail polish or Scotch tape .

Earlier today , Reader Michael McElrath wrote in to sing the praises of Scotch tape as a mosquito bite itch reliever .
We 've heard in the past that both Scotch tape and nail polish can work wonders to relieve an itchy bug bite , and while we 've still been unable to find any solid non-anecdotal evidence as to why , the predominant theory seems to be that sealing the bite off from the air can make a big difference .

If that 's the case , a solid coat of nail polish is probably the better option if you 've got a choice .
Alternatively , Twitter user Lemcott and Floridian offers this as an explanation :
The itch is actually caused by blood rushing to fill in the small entrance , but not be able to due to the proteins the mosquito used as an anti-clotting device .
Thus it inflames , and the blood pressure sets off the nerve endings .
Tape / nail polish actually keep the area around the entrance more stable , letting it heal faster / become less inflamed .
Scratching also only irritates the area further , meaning a longer heal time = more itching .
If you can drop a little science or just more anecdotal claims on this ( or refute it completely ) , let 's hear your expertise in the comments .

RNC Chairman Michael Steele backed out of an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Friday , citing food poisoning .
Later than evening , the RNC alerted donors via e-mail that an August fundraiser featuring Steele alongside conservative media personality Andrew Breitbart would be postponed .
The event , entitled " RNC Election Countdown , " was to take place in Los Angeles between August 12th and 14th .
In response to Steele 's absence at the NABJ convention , the RNC released a statement .
" He is disappointed to miss the opportunity to take part in this valuable dialogue and looks forward to engaging with NABJ in the very near future , " it read .
Observers question whether Steele 's schedule modifications indicate a desire to avoid the criticism recently leveled at Breitbart , who came under fire for publishing a misleading video clip of former USDA official Shirley Sherrod that led to her firing .
Sherrod announced her intention to sue Breitbart in remarks to the NABJ convention on Thursday .
Twitter - die Scheinheiligkeit des Internets 25.07.2010 ca. 3 Minuten Lesezeit
Es ist Samstag Abend , kurz nachdem in Duisburg mehrere Menschen gestorben ( derzeitiger Stand : 19 ) und Hunderte verletzt wurden .
Ja , es ist scheiße , was da passiert ist .
Mir tut es Leid um die Menschen und die Angehörigen der Verstorbenen .
Es wurden Fehler gemacht seitens der Veranstalter , aber auch der Menschen selbst .
Soweit dazu mein Standpunkt .
Was aber auf Twitter abging spottet jeder Beschreibung .
Sofort wurden diverse Hetzjagden ausgelöst , als ginge es um das Ende der Welt .
Auf einmal tun wieder alle so , als wären sie persönlich dafür verantwortlich , dass es den Verantwortlichen an den Kragen geht .
Gemischt wurde dies mit Twitterern die auch noch 2 Stunden später meinten , dass die Welt ausschließlich auf ihre News warten und mussten dringend berichten , dass in Duisburg was passiert sei .
Im Internet sind 2 Stunden eine lange Zeit .
Das wäre , als würde die Zeitung von nebenan heute berichten , dass die USA in Afghanistan einmarschiert wäre .
Am Schlimmsten wurde es , als die Bild.de - Hetzkampagne los getreten wurde .
Dort wurden auf einigen Bildern größtenteils abgedeckte tote Menschen gezeigt .
Es wurden direkt ein paar Beschwerden beim Presserat mit Hinweis auf den Pressekodex eingereicht .
Fazit : Scheinheiligkeit in Perfektion .
Die ( deutschen )
Twitterer sind doch sensationsgeil wie niemand aus anderen Medien .
Wenn aber ein Medium mal die ganze Wahrheit zeigt ( und ja , dazu gehören auch tote Menschen ) , dann wird rumgeschrien .
Mal abgesehen davon , dass der Pressekodex zu einer Zeit ( die 70er ) entstand , als den Deutschen die heile
Welt vorgegaukelt wurde , sind es doch keine Gesetze , sondern freiwillige Regeln .
Und wenn die Bild.
de - Redaktion , über die man sowieso immer streiten kann , diese Regeln nicht beachten will , dann ist das eben so .
Es zwingt euch niemand , diese Webseite aufzurufen .
Genauso wie bei rotten dot com .
Am Ende hatte bild .
de durch diese Meldung noch mehr Besucher und das ist dann eher der oft verhasste Katastrophentourismus .
Aber eben im Web .
Wenn wir mal an Zeiten zurückdenken , als die Menschen noch überwiegend mit Kutschen gefahren sind ( vor 1900 ) : Da standen Kinder noch daneben , wenn die Großeltern im Heimathaus starben .
Da waren die Deutschen noch nicht so weichgespült wie heute , wo jeder Tote gleich Schrecken auslöst .
Und nochmal : jeder
Tote ist erstmal tragisch für die Angehörigen .
Aber das Leben geht weiter , Leute .
Menschen können mit so etwas umgehen !
Die Bauern haben früher keine Trauerwochen eingelegt , wie heute .
Das Feld und Vieh musste trotzdem weiterhin bewirtschaftet werden .
Das wird auch heute noch so in großen Teilen Afrikas , Asiens und Südamerikas so gehandhabt .
Warum das alles scheinheilig ist ?
Der Twitterer @maennig hat es auf den Punkt gebracht : “ Liebe Betroffenheitsspezialisten , wir haben täglich 11 Tote durch Verkehrsunfälle , 26 durch Suizid , 191 durch Alkohol und 329 durch Rauchen . ”
Ich ergänze noch : “ Es sterben täglich ca. 400 Kinder weltweit an Masern . ”
Wisst ihr : Es gibt einfach viel wichtigere Probleme auf der
Welt die täglich diskutiert und u.U. gelöst werden könnten .
Aber die Sensationsgeilheit benebelt die Sicht der Dinge so sehr , dass man wieder ein riesiges Drama draus macht .
Ach ja und dann kommt da noch der Kindergarten hinzu : “ Mimimimimi , der hat gesagt , dass ich hier nur rumjammer .
Bitte entfolgt ihn alle .
Der hat mir mein Spielzeug geklaut ! ” ( Anmerkung : Überzogen , aber der Tenor ) .
Merkt endlich : man folgt jemandem auf Twitter wegen der Kommunikation und weil einen interessiert , was derjenige schreibt .
Nicht , weil die Meinungen grundsätzlich übereinstimmen müssen ( womit wir wieder bei den Weichspülern wären ) .
PS .
Ich habe die Kommentare in diesem Beitrag deaktiviert , weil ich erstens die lauthals schreienden Bashing - Kommentare vermeiden will und zweitens sollten die Leser lieber ihre eigenen Gedanken dazu bloggen , wenn es denn nötig ist .
Bashing - Kommentare auf Twitter werde ich im Übrigen ignorieren .
Nachtrag : Die @talinee hat auch mal was dazu geschrieben : Manche Trägodien bringen Helden hervor , andere dagegen Monster
SOMERVILLE — Rona Mohammedi went to Somerset Medical Center the night of Feb. 11 with severe chest pains .
After hearing she would need an electrocardiogram , she asked for a female to conduct the test .
A Muslim , Mohammedi wears traditional garb , including the hijab , or head scarf .
The Basking Ridge woman believes it is her religious duty to maintain modesty before strange men , and an EKG calls for wires to be applied to the chest , shoulders and wrists .
Instead of heeding her request , officials let her languish in the emergency room for five hours until 3:10 a.m. , when her husband sought a transfer .
She is suing the hospital for discrimination and violating the Patient Bill of Rights .
The complaint filed May 14 in Superior Court in Somerville raises the question of how far hospitals must go for religious accommodations .
The rights listed in state statutes say patients can expect treatment without discrimination , and respectful care consistent with sound medical practices .
Mohammedi's lawyer , Tariq Hussain , said the hospital failed those basic tenets .
" According to the patients ' bill of rights that exist in New Jersey , hospitals are required to make reasonable accommodations for patients for various reasons , " he said .
" Patients should not be denied service or discriminated against based on religion . "
Spokeswoman Kathleen Roberts said , " We recognize how important it is for our patients to be able to continue to practice their faith and cultural traditions , especially when they or a loved one are coping with a health issue .
We strive to accommodate our patients ' religious beliefs and cultural customs , such as providing areas for prayer . "
In the answer lawyer Raymond Fleming filed for the hospital June 28 , officials denied the claims and say she was appropriately informed of her options and left against medical advice .
Hospitals make several accommodations to fit an array of beliefs , said Kerry McKean Kelly , spokeswoman for the New Jersey Hospital Association .
The standard in the law is reasonable accommodation .
" The first responsibility is to stabilize the patient and provide safe and quality health care to all of the patients present .
What is considered reasonable can vary day by day ... based on variables like the number of patients in the emergency department . "

• Montgomery school district breaks ground in offering heart screenings to N.J. students
• Somerset Medical Center is cooking up Jersey Fresh meals
• ConocoPhillips resolves religious bias claim
• Court orders UPS to pay Jersey City man for religious discrimination
• Hospitals settle suits by Cullen survivors
Hospital officials at Jersey City Medical Center serve a diverse community and often field such requests , said spokesman Mark Rabson .
" We make every effort to make sure that if a person needs and requests a female practitioner in maternity or in the emergency room or radiology , we go out of our way to make sure those people are available , " he said .
" We 'll either call somebody in or work with the patient to have them transferred . "
Mohammedi went to Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City , where accommodations were made without her asking , Hussain said .
Chief Medical Officer Ira Nash said , " We serve a very culturally diverse community and we have a very diverse staff .
That naturally creates an environment where people have appropriate sensitivities to cultural differences and individual patient needs . "
Many Muslim women believe they must cover everything but their face and hands in front of men who are not relatives , said Engy Abdelkader , author of " A Muslim Woman 's Guide to Her Civil Rights : When Faith Practices Trigger Discrimination in America . "
" There are definitely a number of hijab - related lawsuits that have been filed , " she said .
" There have been settlements in those cases and compromises that have been reached .
The religious beliefs are respected , and by the same token the concerns of the other party are also recognized , whether they are homeland security concerns or personal safety issues . "
The Patient Bill of Rights does n't mention lawsuits , said Michael F. Schaff , chair of the health care department at Wilentz , Goldman & Spitzer and a board member for the American Health Lawyers Association .
Generally , in New Jersey courts , that means you can sue " but it 's got to be a breach of a standard of care owed by the hospital , " he said .
" There is no obligation to require hospitals to have a physician on staff 24 hours a day , seven days a week based on their sex , religion or nationality . "

Fred Perry 's status as Britain 's last men's singles winner at Wimbledon will go into a 75th year after Andy Murray 's 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) 6 - 4 defeat by Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals this evening .
Hopes were high the fourth seed could end the long wait for a home champion but he found the world number one in top form and the writing was on the wall when Nadal took the tightest of tie - breaks in the second set .
Murray broke early in the third set to give a tense Centre Court crowd hope but Nadal hit back to level before reeling off his fourth successive game to claim victory .
The Spaniard , who was unable to defend his title last year because of injury , slumped to the turf in celebration , while for Murray there were tears of despair as another grand slam opportunity slipped away .
Nadal , who will face Tomas Berdych in the final , paid tribute to his opponent , saying : " It was a very , very good match for me , to beat Andy you have to play your best tennis . "
There was a real sense of anticipation inside a packed Centre Court , where a crowd which included David Beckham let out a huge cheer when Murray won the first point of the match .
It was initially as tight as had been predicted , with neither player willing to give an inch .
The fourth seed 's serve was holding up well while Nadal looked fit and in something approaching top form .
The crucial moment of the opening set came in the ninth game , and it was Murray who cracked first .
The 23 - year - old had served two aces down the middle and chose to go there again at 30 - 30 but this time Nadal read it and , having put Murray in trouble with the return , powered away a winner .
He then took the break point when his opponent hit a forehand just wide .
Nadal promptly took a 40 - 0 lead when serving for the set and , although Murray retrieved two points , the world number one clinched it thanks to another error from the Scot 's racquet .
Murray pushed hard for a break at the start of the second set but it just would not come .
The world number four was playing an intelligent match , engaging Nadal in a chess - like battle of minds , but too often what should have been the killer shot instead produced an error .
The crowd willed their man on but he had reason to curse one spectator when a chance did finally arrive at 15 - 40 in the eighth game .
A mobile phone ring was followed by a netted return on the first break point , while on the second his length dropped too short and Nadal made him pay in the manner to which his rivals have become so accustomed .
A second - set tie - break had been crucial in Murray 's quarter - final win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga , the Scot edging it to level the match , and that was his task again , for a two - set deficit would surely be too much .
A return winner gave Murray the first mini - break but that was quickly cancelled out by a netted forehand .
Successive aces took the 23 - year - old 5 - 4 ahead and he was gifted a set point on his own serve as Nadal double - faulted .
The Spaniard made up for that uncharacteristic error , though , defying a deafening roar from the crowd by seizing on a second serve and then winning the point with a superb volley .
And luck was on his side , too , a net cord beating Murray to give Nadal a set point of his own .
And this time it was decisive , as the fourth seed scrambled in vain to retrieve a forehand , giving the top seed the game and one foot in the final .
If the crowd 's belief that Murray could win the match was wavering , it was vital the man himself did not entertain such thoughts , and he proved that in the best possible fashion by breaking Nadal to love in the opening game of the third set .
It almost seemed too easy after the travails of the second set but for once he did not give Nadal any free points and his big shots found their mark .
Murray initially held on to his advantage comfortably but he knew at some point the pressure would come from the world number one , and come it did in the eighth game .
The fourth seed withstood one break point thanks to a big serve but he missed his chance to take the game when he volleyed wide , and a double fault and netted forehand ensured he paid for it dearly .
Nadal sensed blood and sure enough a match point arrived in Murray 's next service game , the belief finally seeming to have drained out of the home hope .
And one was all he needed as Murray fired a drive volley long .
Murray had no complaints about the result and did not feel he let himself down with his own performance .
" I 'm disappointed , " he said .
" I 'm annoyed I lost this match .
I wanted to reach my first final here .
" I had chances in all the sets .
I have n't seen the stats but there were maybe five or six points in the match .
He just played better than me .
" You 're not going to be able to play every shot on your own terms against one of the best players in the world .
" I was dictating and it was tough , I did n't feel like I was n't in a rhythm .
I won a lot of points on my serve .
" I did n't lose my serve again until late in the match so obviously I was doing something right . "
Murray paid tribute to the 2008 champion , who made him fight for every point .
" The one thing I did n't do particularly well is return well , " he added .
" His serve is harder to return than a lot of people think .
" He does everything really well .
There are certain shots you need to play to both sides to not let him get into a rhythm .
I got myself in good positions but I just could n't take them .
" He played great , he 's playing very well , and obvously has got a lot of confidence now . "
The following is a Los Angeles Times article by reporter Hector Tobar .
LOS ANGELES ( LA Times ) —
The year Rosalío Muñoz got his Vietnam War draft notice was also a very good year for American cinema .
It was the summer of 1969 and he spent hours in darkened L.A. movie theaters .
“ I saw ‘ Easy Rider , ’ ‘ Alice ’s Restaurant , ’ ” he told me .
“ I ’d sit in those theaters and do a lot of thinking . ”
Movies featuring outlaws were then the vogue – ” Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ” was the big hit of the year .
Muñoz eventually decided to resist the draft .
He joined a movement whose climax was the Chicano Moratorium , an East L.A. antiwar march and civil rights rally on Aug. 29 , 1970 .
That day was , at once , one of the most hopeful and tragic in the history of Los Angeles .
Three people were killed , including Times columnist Ruben Salazar , who was struck by a tear gas canister fired by a sheriff ’s deputy .
But a powerful spirit took root in the city .
“ After that , we felt we owned the streets , ” Muñoz said .
“ We got our voice . ”
The idea that L.A. ’s Latino barrios could remain a world separate and unequal from the rest of the city was dead forever .
I spoke to Muñoz last week in a basement gallery downtown .
All around him were photographs commemorating the moratorium ’s 40th anniversary .
There are young men with raised fists who called themselves the Brown Berets .
And a group of marching women known as Las Adelitas de Aztlan .
A stylized portrait of Muñoz adorns a 1970 poster .
Today young people learn the story of Muñoz and his generation of L.A activists almost exclusively in classes devoted to Mexican American history .
It bothers me that this is so .
If you look closely into that episode of L.A. ’s past , you ’ll see it ’s impossible to separate Chicano history from white history or black history .
It ’s all our history .
“ We ’re part of the democratic traditions of this country , ” Muñoz told me , referring to himself and the 30,000 others who rallied that day at an East L.A. park .
By his own account , the young Rosalío was not a likely candidate to become part of a Chicano Studies syllabus .
Now 64 , he grew up in Highland Park when it was mostly white .
His mother was a sixth - generation Mexican American and his father had a PhD .
His friends were Italians and Anglos .
He was known as Ross .
“ It was ‘ Happy Days , ’ ” Muñoz said , referring to the TV sitcom set in the 1950s .
Doug Smith , his friend and a future Times ’ reporter , nominated Ross to be student body president at Franklin High .
Ross won .
Later , in college , Muñoz studied European history .
He did n’t know much about the Chicano movement .
“ Muñoz , look in the mirror , ” a Chicano activist finally told him .
“ You ’re an Indian .
And you will be part of our movement . ”
After he was elected student body president at UCLA , he signed a pledge , along with hundreds of other student body presidents across the U.S. , to resist the draft .
“ For anyone who did n’t grow up in that era , it ’s just about impossible to understand the enormous pressure the Vietnam War put on young people , ” said Smith .
Everyone knew someone who had been killed in Vietnam .
Activists told Muñoz that his minor celebrity as a student leader would help the antiwar movement gain support among Latinos – “ sort of like Muhammad Ali , ” he said .
Seeking inspiration , he attended a speech by the draft resister David Harris , but concluded his call for passive resistance “ was n’t going fly in the barrio . ”
It what seemed like a cosmic coincidence , Muñoz was scheduled to report to the downtown L.A. induction center on Mexican Independence Day .
So he wrote a speech about how Mexican Americans were dying in disproportionate numbers in Vietnam .
“ I accuse the draft , the entire social , political , and economic system of the United States of America of creating a funnel which shoots Mexican youth into Vietnam to be killed , ” Munoz wrote .
His literary inspiration was Emile Zola ’s “ J’Accuse . ”
And Smith gave him some writing tips .
National antiwar leaders were then organizing a moratorium , hoping to bring mainstream America out on the streets against the war .
The Chicano Moratorium had similar goals – to bring the ordinary people of L.A. ’s barrios into the maelstrom then sweeping through the U.S. to protest the war in Vietnam and fight for civil rights .
They succeeded .
The people marching that day were n’t just student radicals but also families with children and future intellectuals and elected leaders who would later join the mainstream of L.A. civic life .
Sheriff ’s deputies swept through the park just as Muñoz took the podium , transforming the rally into panicked flight .
But Muñoz would prefer you not focus on the day ’s violent end .
“ To me , the most important thing was how unified we were , ” he said .
L.A. is today a more united place , I think , thanks to Chicano Moratorium .
That might seem like an odd thing to say about a demonstration with a strong Brown Pride message .
But the movement it started eventually brought dramatic changes to many of our public institutions , from the LAPD to the Board of Education .
Its legacy is a more open , democratic city .
“ Some people say that was the high point of the movement , ” Muñoz said of Aug. 29 .
“ But it was really only the beginning . ”
If you have some time this summer , wander down to the basement of the Mexican Cultural Institute next to Olvera Street , and soak up a bit of our local history .
The pictures will be up until July 25 *.

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Protestant preacher Ian Paisley said on Friday it was a mistake to have invited Pope Benedict to Britain and criticised the Catholic Church ’s response to the child sex abuse scandal .
Former Democratic Unionist Party leader Dr Ian Paisley arrives at his constituency offices in Ballymena where he announced his retirement as MP for north Antrim , Belfast March 8 , 2010 .

The preacher , who stepped down from the post of Northern Ireland first minister in 2008 , said the pope should not have been invited for the four - day visit in September during which he will meet the queen at her official residence in Scotland .
It will be the first official papal visit to the country .
“ I think it is a mistake , ” Paisley said , when asked what he thought of the visit .
“ I think he should not be invited to the country . ”
He told the BBC World Service that authorities had kept the trip to Scotland and England “ secret . ”
“ You go and ask a question of any minister and he says he does n’t want to have anything to do with it , ” he added .
“ The Queen is only meeting them on Scottish soil , not on English soil . ”
The queen is the supreme governor of the Church of England , the mother church of the Anglican Communion .
Relations between the CoE and Vatican have been tense after Pope Benedict made an offer to disaffected Anglicans to convert .
Paisley also criticised the Catholic Church ’s handling of the child abuse scandal in Ireland , accusing it of having failed to “ take a strong stand . ”
“ I believe that any man that destroys a child ’s life , as we have seen scores of young people in this day and generation -- and then the church having to wait until it is uncovered -- is an absolute disgrace . ”
In March , the pope apologised to victims of abuse by Irish clergy following reports last year which said priests had abused children for decades in Catholic - run institutions , and that Church authorities had covered up cases in Dublin until the mid-1990s .
Hundreds of cases of sexual and physical abuse of youths by priests in recent decades have also come to light in Europe and the United States .
Various campaigners plan demonstrations during the pope ’s visit , including author and atheist campaigner Richard Dawkins who has said he will try to have the pope arrested to face questions over the scandal .
Pro-gay activists are planning protests against his comments on the government ’s Equality Bill , while secularists complain at the 8 million pound bill being picked up by the taxpayer .

Federal Register Website Gets an Anniversary Facelift
Need to know how the Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Office is proposing to deal with amendments to Montana law regarding required revegetation periods following the removal of siltation structures ?
No ?
Well , some lawyer in Helena probably does .
And , for that , he 's going to have to turn to the Federal Register .
Yesterday marked the 75th anniversary of the Federal Register Act , and , via the Legal Writing Prof Blog , I discovered that the Federal Register website has now become Federal Register 2.0 .
Granted , I was n't a heavy user of the old version , but this new one seems pretty easily navigable and user - friendly .
Though , if you need a walkthrough ( and some history ) , you should watch this video :
Thanks , FDR !

Cable Ties
And More , has supplied and work with our manufacturing partners to ensure we offer the best quality cable ties and zip tie accessories for over 25 years .
We have the experience and test data to prove our wire tie quality is second to none .
Common Zip Tie Applications ?
One of the most common applications for cable ties is supporting and holding cables , wires , and other objects in place .
Therefore , the quality of the cable ties are of utmost importance .
Cable ties and more uses virgin nylon resins in the manufacturing of most types of cable ties to ensure consistently good quality .
How Are Cable Ties Made ?
Nylon Cable ties are manufactured carefully by cyclical injection molding method wherein nylon resins are melted and then injected into the mold cavity .
It ’s shape and size depend on the mold used during the manufacturing process .
The zip tie molding process involves two sets of molds .
The first half contains the self - locking head mechanism called ratchet , and the second mold includes the tip of the cable tie that is designed to slide into the ratchet .
When these two molds come together , molten nylon 66 or nylon 12 resins are then injected into the cavity , and the space between creates the shape of the zip ties .
After inserting the molten nylon resins , the newly formed zip tie is allowed to solidify within the mold cavity .
After the appropriate amount of time , the cable tie is removed from the mold .
All freshly made zip ties are then gathered for quality inspection .
When nylon wire ties are determined to contain defects relating to the molding process , the particular mold that created them is set to be replaced by a non-defective one .
If it determined that there are no defects on the mold , the cable tie quality inspector will identify other possible causes that could have caused the fault .
Other possible reasons for a zip - tie defect during molding include :
An unclean machine resin mold pipe
Faulty pressure controls on the machine
Using recycled nylon resin ( all of our nylon cable ties are made with virgin nylon 66 )
Mixed plastic nylon was used or an inappropriate heat transfer from recycled matter .
How Are Cable Ties Used ?
Cable ties , are also known as zip ties or tie wraps in some areas of the United States .
Zip ties are said to have an unlimited number of applications , such as : in households , offices , manufacturing industries , automobile industries , marine industries , electronic industries , and many more .
Cabletiesandmore.com ensures that we offer different sizes and types of cable ties that would be suitable for each specific type of application and their requirements .
An example of this is the Stainless Steel zip tie that is recommended for applications that can resist various chemicals , salts , and acid exposure .
Further , another example is the Velcro Ties and Straps , which are ideal for temporary , and reusable strapping and bundling of wires .
Cabletiesandmore.com is proud to boast its offering of high quality yet affordable cable ties that are available in different materials , lengths , and colors .
End-users must know the requirements of their application to utilize the right capacity and strength of cable ties properly .
What are the different cable tie sizes ?
As part of AMC's bid to overtake HBO as Best Channel You Used to Watch for Movies but Now Has Really Good Shows ( debate over if this has already happened to surely continue in comments ) , the cable station unveiled a new trailer for their upcoming original series The Walking Dead at Comic Con.
Based on the popular comic and directed by Frank Darabont ( of Shawshank Redemption and Shawshank Redemption 2 : Magic Clarke Duncan fame ! ) , the series premieres in October - - but thankfully , because of people with digital recording equipment and bootlegging ambitions , you can see the Con trailer here :

The story we tentatively plan to provide in GHC 6.14.1 is a haskell2010 package that provides exactly the API specified by the report ( by definition , since the source was used to generate the report :-) .
The modules of haskell2010 overlap with base , so it will be impossible to depend on both haskell2010 and base , without using non-portable extensions like PackageImports .
I had n't realised before , but this situation is better for portability , because it discourages people from using base package modules in pure Haskell 2010 code .
The downside is exactly the reverse : if you wanted to use modules from base , then you do n't get to use the pure Haskell 2010 modules too ( although the base versions are virtually identical at the moment ) .
So , if things stay like this , then you can write pure Haskell 2010 with GHC in two ways : - using Cabal : say " extensions : Haskell2010 " and " build - depends : haskell2010 " .
Maybe Cabal should have a new " language " directive , because " extensions " is a bit strange .
- using GHC standalone : say " - package haskell2010 - hide - package base " .
- XHaskell2010 will be the default for standalone GHC , although for Cabal we 'll probably require you to say what the language is , in the interests of being explicit and for backwards compatibility with existing packages .

I have n't looked at the new jhc yet , but I have a question about the GC support : is it conservative or accurate ?
If accurate , how are you finding the pointers - a shadow stack ?
Cheers , Simon
When director Greg Mottola ’s Paul was filming in New Mexico last August , I was invited – along with a few other online journalists – to visit the set and watch some filming .
With Paul written by and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost , I ’ll admit to being incredibly happy to be there since Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are two of my favorite films from the last decade .
If you ’re one of our few readers who has n’t seen those movies , I need you to stop what you ’re doing and buy them .
Trust me , once you watch them both , you ’ll understand when geekdom loves Pegg and Frost .
Even though both actors were busy on the set of Paul , we managed to get some time with them in the afternoon .
They talked about making their first “ American ” movie , where the idea of Paul came from , how they were adapting to working with a CGI creature as a main character , working without Edgar Wright , and so much more .
If you ’re a fan of Pegg and Frost , you ’re going to love the interview .
As usual , I ’ve provided a full transcript and the audio after the jump :
As usual , you can listen to / download the audio from the interview by clicking here or you can read the transcript below .
This is one of those interviews I really recommend listening to rather than reading the transcript .
Paul gets released March 18 , 2011 .
–
How has it been like ?
Does it feel very different making this movie than the last two , doing it in America also ?
Nick Frost : Yeah .
Simon Pegg : Yeah .
I kind of feel we ’ve been hidden away .
We kind of just blocked ourselves off and we ’re just fucking monkeys … Sorry to swear .
It ’s always interesting working in America just because the catering ’s so different .
In England , you get a breakfast , lunch …
NF : Sandwiches .
SP : Sandwiches … Here , it ’s just food all the time .
It ’s really hard not to just eat all the time , is n’t it ?
NF : Yeah .
You ’re talking to the wrong person .
SP : We ’ve been here for like six months nearly because we did Steven Spielberg ’s Tintin at the beginning of the year and now this .
I just really love working with American crews .
There just seems to be …I think in England there ’s no overtime , so if you go over , you have to ask nicely and they do n’t particularly like it , quite rightly , because they are n’t getting paid to do it .
But here , there is overtime , so nobody gives a shit about things running over .
So everyone ’s just in it to win it the whole time .
NF : You know , we did ten night shoots back to back and it was just fucking crippling .
But then , the crews , even at 5 am , were just laughing .
You know , everyone ’s really just enjoyed it , I think .
I ’d like to think so anyway .
SP : It ’s been really good fun and working with our cast as well , who were just extraordinary .
I know it always ends up sounding like a bit of a sort of love fest when you talk to actors about their fellow actors ‘ cause no one really bitches .
We ’ve really felt like we ’ve had to raise our game on this movie , just because everyone ’s so fucking good .
Like Jason Bateman and Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio and Kristin Wiig are so , so funny .
Sigourney Weaver was absolutely lovely , just so up for it .
Blythe Danner is …incredible .
John Carrol Lynch , who will forever be France McDormand ’s husband in Fargo for me .
It was such a laugh , you know .
NF : And Zodiac .
SP : And Zodiac , of course .
But yeah , a couple of times , Nick and I have had to go and think , “ You better fucking start working harder , otherwise we ’re just gonna vanish in this film . ”
{ Laughs} .
And then Paul on top of that , with Seth doing Paul ’s voice .
NF : We ’ve forgotten Seth ’s in it , as well .
SP : I know , because he ’s not on set .
NF : We kind of did him first off .
We did mo-cap in Los Angeles like four months ago and we did his bits .
And then we came out here and a few times in the last couple of weeks I said to Simon , “ You know , Seth Rogen is in this film as well . ”
Now Nira [ Park , producer ] said you came up with the idea during rain while you were shooting Shaun of the Dead .
SP : { Laughs} Yeah that ’s right .
One of the biggest ironies of this shoot has been the sheer unpredictability of the New Mexican weather , in that the very motivation for doing this film was , “ Let ’s go somewhere hot and make a film about where something hot is .
I know , let ’s make it in the desert .
Yeah , it ’s an alien , it ’s Area 51 , yeah .
And then these guys , and they help him get home . ”
That was it .
And I drew a poster for Nira of Paul giving the finger and it said , “ In America , everyone ’s an alien . ”
And that was the pitch and it sat on Nira ’s notice board for …it ’s been sat on there since 2003 .
We always joked about doing it .
And here we are on this incredible Comic - Con set .
NF : We had that same feeling that you get sometimes when you go into a pitch meeting with the studio and they say , “ So what have you got ? ”
“ We have n’t really got anything . ”
And then you have to say , “ Oh …how about an alien ?
And he ’s got attitude ! ”
{ Simon ’s miniature schnauzer , Minnie , walks towards the journalists}
SP : This is not Colin from Spaced .
This is Minnie .
Is this your dog ?
SP : Yeah , she ’s gonna be in it .
She ’s dressed as Princess Leia tomorrow .
{ Laughs} .
So now that you guys have done Tintin and are obviously huge experts on special effects , does that make it so much easier to be playing opposite nothing in only scenes with Paul ?
Or is it tough to be there with that empty space ?
SP : It is tough .
We ’re working with [ London - based VFX company ]
Double Negative , who we ’ve known for a long time .
They did Shaun and Hot Fuzz and have since done plenty of things : Hellboy 2 , Cloverfield … And we ’ve got [ VFX company ]
Spectral Motion doing the puppetry that we do use and the live lighting reference puppets and animatronics .
But it ’s hard to talk to a red light , or Mr. Eyeballs is this pole with two ping - pong balls on the top .
NF : We have to shoot Paul so many times .
Like , we did a scene in a night shoot the other day where , because the sun was coming up , I had like ten minutes to do my single .
And then we re-shot Paul ’s stuff the other day and he had like an hour and a half .
{ Laughs} .
Why ?
That ’s not fucking fair !
But we ’ve got a little guy in a costume and we ’ve got a child at points playing Paul .
SP : Christoff , who ’s our small actor who does reference and sometimes suits up is an amazing drummer–has n’t acted before , but has been tirelessly present on this set .
NF : He has been .
They call him The Anvil .
SP : That ’s his nickname , The Anvil , it ’s pretty good …
But we have to shoot him so many times , you know .
We do it with those two guys , then we do it with no one there or then we do it with Joe Lo Truglio …
Then sometimes we do it with a gray ball .
Then Joe Lo Truglio , then nothing .
So , you know , for each one shot we get , Paul has eight .
We would have been wrapped by now .
{ Laughs} .
NF : Paul ’s a complete asshole .
Wait , Joe ’s a stand - in for Paul ?
SP : What Joe has done , in an act of extraordinary selflessness , he ’s not only playing Agent O’Reilly , but whenever Paul ’s on set he does Paul ’s off - lines .
And sometimes stands in for him .
But Joe ’s been onset all the time , which has been great ‘ cause he ’s a fantastic guy , he ’s such fun .
I knew him from Superbad and from Pineapple Express .
I ’d never seen The State , but just from that one little thing he does in Superbad , that amazing cameo where he plays that creepy little guy .
NF : “ You on Facebook ? ”
SP : { Laughs} “ You guys on MySpace ? ” { Laughs}
So this will be your first and last CGI movie .
SP : Well the very motivation for this was , we thought how cool it would be to have a film that was essentially a kind of …almost like an indie pic , you know , like a road movie .
But have it the sense that this incredible–and it has to be incredible–sprite , you know , this character who is not real , he ’s a CG character , and how the context of the movie would offset that character to make him look even more real , because it ’s handheld …
Though , having said that , Greg [ Mottola , director ] ’s bringing some incredible flourishes to this .
There ’s a lot of motion in the camera …
He ’s really Spielberging it up , which is great .
NF : I mean he has to be credible , but he also has to be fairly forgettable , do you know what I mean ?
If after ten minutes , you ’re still looking at him thinking [ diffident moaning ] , I do n’t think we ’ve done it right .
He just needs to immediately just become a character and not some kind of amazing CG .
SP : So you know , it depends on how it turns out .
If it does n’t work , then yes , it is our last .
NF : We ’ve both been scanned by the way , so if anything happens to either of us
SP : My problem with Jar Jar Binks was never particularly the technology , it was the idiocy of the character .
That was everybody ’s problem with it .
SP : Yeah , it was n’t the fact that it was a CG character .
NF : And the eyelines .
SP : Yeah , Ewan McGregor going , “ What am I looking at ? ”
You guys are together again , but you ’re different characters obviously .
How is the dynamic between these two characters different from what we ’ve seen before ?
NF : I think Clive [ Frost ’s character ] is more of a butch this time than …
SP : The bitch .
NF : … Danny Butterman and Ed .
SP : For starters , this is a two - hander .
It ’s not me .
The central characters in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead were my characters , Nicholas Angel and Shaun , and Nick ’s characters just stole the show , that ’s what they did .
Whereas this is like we ’re both the lead in this film and Nick ’s character is probably a little bit more confident , a little bit more assured than mine .
Graham [ Pegg ’s character ] is a bit more messy , less proactive .
Paul ’s kind of like Ferris Bueller , you know , he kind of affects everybody around him and never really is affected himself .
NF : It ’s important that we did something slightly different .
Not that we work hard at it .
You know , we ’ve been friends for 15 years , but the relationship that we have is , I think , quite important to me …
It ’s important to us .
Now do your characters have much of a backstory at all or are they just two fans going to Comic - Con and hanging out ?
SP : I do n’t think we ’ve got particularly Stanislavkian about their background .
NF : Oh I have !
SP : Have you ?
NF : You did n’t read the …
SP : I did n’t read the Bible [ An Actor Prepares ] … Yeah , we kind of know where they ’re from and what they ’re about , but the important thing in the movie is where we find them and where they are at that time .
So they ’re two British guys living sort of like …rural north London …
NF : West London .
SP : West London .
And have saved up for this trip , they ’re going to start at Comic - Con and they ’re going to go to Area 51 and they ’re going to eventually go down to Roswell .
They want to go to the UFO hotspots , and by sheer coincidence they meet an alien .
{ Laughs} .
NF : It could happen .
Your producer was talking about how she felt you guys were doing more improv on this movie than you had on the last two .
I was just curious , you said that Seth had come in and already recorded a whole bunch of stuff .
Have you guys shot stuff thinking , “ Okay , we need Seth to come back in this scene so he can play off what we just did here ? ”
SP : Yeah , Seth will have to come back and always was gonna .
What we did initially in Los Angeles was very preliminary and it was just to get a sense of the performance and what Seth would be doing .
But working with people like Kristin [ Wigg ] and Bill [ Hader ] and Jason [ Bateman ] and Joe [ Lo Truglio ] as well , they ’re very good at improvising , so–although , we ’re pretty anal about what we write .
{ Laughs}
SP : There has been room to just loosen up a little bit …
NF : What , are you laughing at “ anal ” there ?
{ Bigger laughs}
SP : No , we are .
We ’re quite nasty but we make sure that we get a take of what ’s written .
NF : You ca n’t have someone like Bill and Joe and Jason Bateman , it seems silly having them on set and not letting them do what they want really Every one of them brings something into the role , you know .
We ’re not American , so the script that we wrote , we had to run it by Greg to make sure that all of our terminology was correct and just weird little things …
Just to make sure that it all seems very naturally coming out of the mouths of American actors and it sounds like it ‘s an American script .
We know enough about America to write a pretty damn good stab at that .
Your characters are all knowledgeable and up - to - date on American pop culture and what ’s going on ?
NF : God I hope so .
The attention to detail –the t- shirts you ’re wearing and what ’s going on at Comic - Con–I ’m wondering what sort of things are hidden in the film that you guys as fans are just really excited [ about ] ?
SP : We ’ve got a great thing in here that we ’re not allowed to say , obviously …
No , there ’s lots of stuff .
There ’s the presence of …you know , Shauns and Angels and Dannys in there was Nancy [ Steiner ] , our costume designer , who just did that for a laugh .
I hope anyone who notices that will take it in good fun and not as being self - indulgent .
So there ’s plenty of little things in there .
The notion is that Paul has been on Earth for about 60 years living in this base , just basically having an affect on popular culture .
He ’s in touch with a few of the creative minds in America and has helped him out in a few things .
And so Paul is responsible for a lot of what we know …
So he has certain abilities that you ’ve seen elsewhere and the reason you ’ve seen them elsewhere is because it was his idea .
Which has enabled us to retroactively rip off every film ever .
When we were doing the shots earlier in the theater [ referring to a scene where the journalists were extras ] , there was that moment where you two as fans are going bananas for somebody on stage .
Who out there in pop culture would make you guys flip out ?
SP : We decided we can give you an exclusive , although do n’t tell anyone .
We were trying to think of who it ’s gonna be [n stage in the mystery role …
We thought maybe Twiki .
{ Laughs}
SP : Just a guy like waving .
And you say , “ Bidi- bidi - bidi . ”
So Nick , I remember two years ago you were at the Superbad premiere and it just seems that everything ’s kind of spread out from there .
You ’ve worked with Greg , Edgar ’s worked with Michael [ Cera ]
… Have you felt it at all that maybe something happened that night where all of these things generated out of there ?
NF : Greg made me drink this potion that night …
I do n’t know , I mean I think when you watch something like Superbad–when we watch Superbad–you think , “ God , that ’s fucking great . ” [ Greg and Michael ] are like an American us .
So it just kind of makes sense that we would branch out slightly and want to kind of reach out to Greg and Michael …
SP : We ’re fans of each others ’ stuff …of course we were going to find each other eventually , because we like the same stuff and we admire each other .
You know , like Jason and Jeffrey Tambor , and I ’m a massive fan of Arrested Development , which we were watching last night , going “ Oh my God , there ’s Agent Zoil and there ‘s , uh … ! ”
And having picked up bit of SNL on the Internet–we do n’t get it in the U.K. , crazy , I do n’t know why–and seeing Kristin in Knocked Up and various other films , you see these people and think , “ God , they ’re great .
I wish I could work with them ! ”
We are so fucking lucky that we ’re in a position to offer those people parts , and even luckier that they say , “ Yes . ”
So for us , it ’s a bit of a dream come true .
We ’re getting to work with the people we like , and I think it ’s just that thing of , you know , not to be too much of a hippie , but souls kind of find each other and they gravitate towards each other , do you know what I mean ?
{ Laughs}
SP {imitating journalist} : “ At this point , Pegg became a bit of a hippie … ”
I ’ve seen a lot of Star Wars stuff out there [ on the Comic - Con set ] .
Does this mean that George Lucas does n’t have any hard feelings about Tim ’s reaction to the prequels ?
SP : Was n’t my idea .
I said , “ No Star Wars things . ”
You know , I ’ve got a lot of friends at Lucasfilm because I think they all agree with me [ on the quality of the prequels ] , but they just do n’t tell their boss .
{ Laughs} .
When you worked with Spielberg on Tintin , did you pick his brain at all about the aliens coming to Earth thing ?
SP : Oh yeah , we ’d sit with him between takes and he ’d just tell us stories about Close Encounters and stuff .
Did they have any ideas that substantially influenced you ?
SP : Yeah , absolutely .
The film very much draws in the tradition of films like Close Encounters and E.T. , that kind of sense of wonder …
We were hoping to have a score which is , I mean , obviously John Williams would be an amazing person to get but he ’s expensive .
He does n’t work for nothing .
But to have that Spielbergian feel , definitely .
His influence on the film is very evident , moreso than you would be surprised to find out .
NF : A lot of the time we ’d run off set really laughing , would n’t we ?
Steven would tell a story about Close Encounters and we ’d say , “ Okay , thanks ! ” and he ’s gone off the set and we ’d shut the door and go “ WOO ! ”
Are you guys , in the film , eating any ice cream and are you making a point to make sure that you say it ’s a different kind of ice cream [ than Cornetto ] ?
SP : No , there is no ice cream consumed .
This is not a Cornetto film , this is a different thing .
NF : This is part one of the Pepsi and Klondike Trilogy …
SP : Edgar has insisted , and quite rightly , that this film never be sold as part of the box set with our other two films , and I think Edgar ’s right .
This has to be seen as something different .
We will be at pains to stress that this is n’t the third one .
This is a different kind of film altogether .
I ’m not saying that The World ’s End will be a similar film to the other two , but this is mine and Nick’s .
We ’ve written this together , it ’s a different director .
Same production company , but we want it to feel like it ’s a different thing .
You know , obviously the temptation is to see it as that because it ’s Nick and mine .
There were a couple of little line references in the script which we took out .
I think at one point we were taking off in the RV and somebody said , “ Punch that shit ! ” , and we realized it was a Hot Fuzz line , and we did n’t want anyone to think that we were trying to …
NF : Yeah .
SP : You know , obviously those little references [ on the Comic - Con floor set ] are sweet enough , because only the people that “ get ” it will know what the fuck we ’re talking about .
But no ice cream allowed .
Certainly not Cornettos .
You ca n’t get ‘em here !
What are they called here ?
NF : Drumsticks .
The movie ’s called Paul , you ’re on the road .
Is there a Christian theme ?
Paul on the road to Damascus ?
SP : I never thought of that , but yes there is a thread in the movie about evolution vs. faith .
NF : It wo n’t go down so well in the middle states .
SP : Paul ’s very presence represents a contradiction to certainly creationist values and Kristin Wiig ’s character , Ruth , is a furious Christian and has a whole worldview rocked by the appearance of Paul and so has to question the notion of her faith and divinity in general .
So there is a serious little thread going through it which we had quite fun with .
Can you talk about working with Greg and not working with Edgar [ Wright ] and how that differs ?
NF : Edgar …
{ Laughs}
SP : Edgar ’s been e-mailing us today .
It ’s just different , you know .
I mean we love Edgar we will work together again .
We obviously have a third film to make in that particular other series we were involved in together [ the Blood and Ice Cream / Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy ] .
Greg is more laid - back than Edgar .
That ’s not saying Edgar ’s in any way hyper .
Edgar is an intense director and he ’s very concentrated .
Greg seems to be a little bit more sort of serene on set , but no less involved in the artistic process of making the movie .
I really like Greg… When we go into our mode with shooting with Edgar , he becomes …he ’s the director and we ’re the actors , and he does n’t need to say that much to us anyway , so he ’ll just come and go , “ You know what I mean ? ” “ Yeah . ” “ Okay . ”
And that ’s it .
And Nick , who ’s known Edgar for ten years , will come up to me between takes , “ Does he like me ?
Does he like me ? ”
Sometimes he says , “ Edgar . Edgar .
Edgar ! ” you know , because he ’s just so hung up on thinking about what the camera ’s doing .
But it ’s been nice working with a different director and finding a different dynamic and …this is a Greg Mottola film , it ’s not an Edgar Wright movie .

Posted on July 16 , 2010 , Phil Owen The Cover of NCAA Football 11 Looks a Little Different in Tuscaloosa
You might have noticed that I am a fan of the University of Alabama Crimson Tide .
I was present at last year ’s SEC Championship Game in Atlanta when the Tide rolled all over Tim Tebow and the Florida Gators to the tune of a 32 - 13 final score , and , yes , I cheered and mockingly gator chomped when they showed Timmy crying his eyes out on the jumbotron at the Georgia Dome .
I have , no exaggeration , never been happier than I was on that day .
That said , I endorse this custom NCAA Football 11 art , which can be found at Gamestop in Tuscaloosa , the home of the Tide .
Roll Tide , y’all .
He cried for our sins , indeed , and we made his ass quit .

Though beautiful , glass pipes present a bit of a Catch 22 : if they 're effective , you 're inherently ill - suited to be handling one .
Capitalizing on this fact , Pipes 2 The People .
Launching today ( naturally ) from a couple of enterprising roommates in the Mission , P2P 's a subscription service that sends you a high - end piece of randomly chosen glassware once a month for a recurring fee of $ 12.99 , which adds up to well below the wholesale value of what you end up getting / breaking , allowing you to save up for more 2nd Degree Burn Doritos .
You 're guaranteed to get gems from each of P2P 's several " classes of glass " , which range from compact travel pieces ( chillums , one - hitters , spoons ... ) , to table pieces worth $ 75 + ( inside - out n' brilliantly colored double bubblers , Sherlock bubblers , etc. ) , to novelty pieces like a bulbous elephant whose trunk you lip while plugging its butt as a carb , and others that thankfully do n't involve that .
While included with your pipe 'll be bonus items like Formula 420 Cleaner , papers , lighters , and " once it 's legal , fully packed bowls " ( ha ! ) , P2P 's site 'll rock fun features like a " stoner photo of the month " contest , with the winner receiving a gratis " water filtration unit " , also the name of another spinoff Law & Order , where Detective Stabler just sort of figures out why someone 's Irish Spring does n't take a lather .

If you can pull it , ditch work early today and hit the Noc Noc on Haight at 4:20 for a launch party , where there 'll be pipe giveaways and cheap drinks , which 're inherently ill - suited for people pretending to be ill , in suits .
The former head of a military contractor is on trial in Long Island for fraud , having allegedly used company funds to buy porn for his son , a burial plot for his mother , prostitutes for his employees and a ruby - encrusted American flag belt buckle worth $ 100,000 .
David H. Brooks , the founder and former chief of body armor manufacturer DHB , is facing charges of fraud , insider trading and using millions of dollars in corporate cash to fund , as the New York Times puts it , " personal extravagance . "
Using the company coffers -- which were flush with Pentagon money -- Brooks allegedly bought gifts for his family , including pornographic videos for his son , plastic surgery for his wife and textbooks for his daughter .
He also bought luxury cars , country club memberships and a stable full of racehorses .
The prostitutes ?
They were to boost morale .
From the NYT :
His lawyers also defended the hiring of prostitutes for employees and board members , arguing in court papers that it represented a legitimate business expense " if Mr. Brooks thought such services could motivate his employees and make them more productive . "
And then there 's the belt buckle , which prosecutors have reportedly been waving around in the courtroom : $ 100,000 worth of diamonds , rubies and sapphires in the shape of the American flag .
And there 's more : Brooks spent $ 10 million on his daughter 's bat mitzvah , hiring 50 Cent , Tom Petty and Aerosmith to perform .
The leather - bound invitations cost $ 40,000 alone .
Brooks , who left the company in 2006 , is also accused of running a $ 190 million scam .
Brooks allegedly lied about his company 's inventory by several million dollars , boosting the stock price just before selling all his shares .
He also faces charges of tax evasion and obstruction of justice .
As the trial , which has heard the testimony of 70 witnesses , drags on , Brooks is apparently digging himself even deeper .
He may also face additional charges stemming from an episode last week when he was caught for a second time trying to smuggle into jail prescription anti-anxiety pills , which were similar to medication he was already taking at an unusually high dose .
The pills had been hidden in pens that a supporter of Mr. Brooks 's had placed near the defendant 's seat in the courtroom .
The jury heard closing arguments in the case yesterday .

At its best , the Metroid series is about solitude ; you 're left alone on a strange alien planet and its up to you to figure out where to go and what to do .
And while the first game introduced the concept , it was with Super Metroid , released nearly a decade later , that the developers at Nintendo perfected it .
The game begins heavy on the exposition , with series heroine Samus Aran outlining what has happened so far .
The story is n't all that necessary though , and it's not long before you 're on a self - destructing space station running for your life .
From there you move on to a strange alien planet in search of a stolen metroid .
And it's here that the game actually reveals itself .
Though it has the appearance of an action game , at its heart , Super Metroid is about exploration .
You make your way through a series of interconnected rooms and caves , unsure of exactly where to go .
The series pioneered a new form of backtracking , and it's on full display in Super Metroid .
As you progress you come across areas that are inaccessible , forcing you to turn around and search elsewhere .
But they 're not inaccessible forever .
A large part of the Metroid series is collecting power - ups , and most of the time when you come across a new weapon or ability , there 's an " ah ha ! " moment where you remember just where to use it .
To make things easier , Super Metroid introduced the concept of a map to the series .
Though it gives only a bare outline of your surroundings , pointing out important rooms and items , it 's incredibly useful , especially given the size of the world you are exploring .
And , if nothing else , it eliminates the need to play with a pad of graph paper at your side .
Additions like the map seem small at first , but many of them are important changes that have gone on to become series mainstays and make the original Metroid feel archaic in some ways .
Super Metroid featured an inventory screen that let players switch between weapons , introduced power - ups like the grapple beam , and , like Metroid II on the GameBoy , allowed players to actually save their progress , without resorting to a password system .
But what 's most impressive about the game is its atmosphere .
The Super Nintendo may be woefully underpowered by today 's standards , but that has n't diminished the atmospheric nature of Super Metroid one bit .
The feeling of being alone on an alien world is incredibly powerful , and this has a lot to do with the game 's dark and foreboding soundtrack .
You do n't have to look far to see the influence that Super Metroid has had on other games .
The Castlevania series managed to make a return to the gaming consciousness with Symphony of the Night , a game that is very similar to Super Metroid .
So much so , in fact , that similar games — that is , open - ended , side - scrolling action games — are now frequently referred to as " Metroidvania . "
Of course , subsequent Metroid games followed a similar path as well .
Even the original Metroid Prime , which , despite its shift to 3D and a first - person perspective , feels very much like the SNES game .
Even more recent 3D action games like Batman : Arkham Asylum owe a lot to the structure of Super Metroid .
Whether or not we 'll ever get to see another 2D , side - scrolling Metroid game remains to be seen , and with Metroid : The Other M on the way the series appears to be moving in a different direction .
But this form of exploration , which had been done before Super Metroid but was perfected there , can give games an amazing sense of pace .
And you can always dust off your SNES or hit the Virtual Console to relive the experience .
Image caption MPs say they must be well paid because of the responsibility they have
MPs in Kenya have voted to boost their own salaries , making them among the world 's best paid politicians .
Under the new legislation , the Kenyan prime minister will take home over a third more than his British counterpart .
He will also earn almost 10 % more than the US president .
The vote has provoked anger from the general public and the media , correspondents say .
The parliamentarians have voted to be paid a basic $ 44,000 ( £ 29,000 ) a year .
But extra allowances can bring the salary up to up to $ 126,000 ( £ 84,000 ) after tax - a rise of 18 % .
The allowances include $ 370 ( £ 250 ) a day for turning up in parliament .
If you feel MPs are being paid heftily , join parliament Assistant minister
Average annual income in Kenya is about $ 730 ( £ 490 ) , while most of the population earns less than $ 1 ( 66 p ) a day .
If approved , the legislation would take effect during the next parliament , expected in two years ' time .
BBC East Africa correspondent Peter Greste said the MPs ' debate on their salaries was extraordinarily quick .
The Daily Nation newspaper reported that one MP described the pay - increase as " a move towards restoring honour to the profession of politics " .
One politician was quoted as saying that the amount of money paid to MPs could not compensate " for the heavy responsibility they shoulder in the economic , political and social development of the country " .
It also quoted an assistant minister as trying to dismiss criticism of the vote by saying :
" If you feel MPs are being paid heftily , join parliament .
[ And if you are in parliament ] if you feel you have enough , give a chance to your colleagues . "
An editorial in the Standard newspaper argued that Kenyans might be able to stomach the huge numbers involved if it meant the selfless delivery of services and an end to corruption .
Oil Spill Reaches Mississippi Shores ( VIDEO )
Posted in BP British Petroleum , Deepwater Horizon , Environment , Gulf Coast , Mississippi Maritime News on June 28 , 2010
HORN ISLAND , MS – Folks at Lake Mars Landing in Jackson County , Mississippi say their worst nightmare has come true .
Sticky globs of oil are washing up in Mississippi waters .
WATCH VIDEO
“ It ’ll stop boating , it ’ll stop fishing here from Missouri – it already closed all the waters , ” Little said .
Ocean Springs , Miss. , Mayor Connie Moran is livid , saying the city is ready to take further action themselves to protect the sensitive marshes and beaches throughout Jackson County .
“ The unified command ’s failure to skim the oil north of Horn Island yesterday is inept and inexcusable , ” Moran said Sunday .
“ Had they deployed those resources , the impact to Jackson County would ’ve been far less today .
“ Now , I ’ve requested from the Coast Guard to bring in skimmer and support vessels either to be staged in Ocean Springs or to exclusively monitor the Mississippi Sound here in west Jackson County at the mouth of the Biloxi Bay .
There ’s still stuff out there that we ca n’t even see because of all the dispersant .
This is just outrageous and unacceptable . ”

A pipeline carrying oil from the US state of Indiana to Ontario , Canada has spilled more than 800,000 gallons ( 3 m litres ) of oil into a creek which flows into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan .
A spokesman for the firm running the pipeline , Enbridge Energy Partners , said a malfunction had caused the leak .
The spill has killed fish and endangered wildlife in the region .
Officials said the pumps which feed the pipeline had been shut down as soon as the leak was discovered .
The 30 - inch ( 76 cm ) pipeline carries 8 m gallons of oil per day between the towns of Griffith , in Indiana , and Sarnia , in Ontario .
The pipeline , called the Lakehead System , is one of the largest in the world .
A pungent odour now hangs over the Kalamazoo River valley , local media report .
The oil originally spilled into the Talmadge Creek in Calhoun County , Michigan , north - west of the Kalamazoo River .
The cost of marijuana would drop as much as 80 % and consumption would rise if Californians vote for Proposition 19 , the legalization measure on the November ballot , researchers at Rand ’s Drug Policy Research Center have concluded in a detailed analysis of the issue .
The Santa Monica - based , nonprofit research institute predicted the cost of marijuana , which runs between $ 300 and $ 450 per ounce , could plunge to about $ 38 by eliminating the expense of compensating suppliers for the challenges of operating in the black market .
The researchers were not certain how much that decline in price might spur use , but noted that one typical estimate is that a 10 % drop in price increases use by about 3 % .
Other factors , such as the elimination of legal risks , could also increase usage between 5 % and 50 % .
The report noted that it was impossible to predict tax revenues from the initiative , which leaves that decision up to individual cities and counties .
Based on a statewide $ 50 per ounce tax proposed in a legalization bill introduced by Sen.
Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) , the report said state tax revenues could range from $ 650 million to $ 1.49 billion .
“ California voters and legislators face considerable uncertainty because it is very difficult to estimate how much more marijuana will be consumed in the state or how the change will affect tax revenues , criminal - justice costs and healthcare costs , ” the study concludes .
The 54 - page report , with 14 pages of footnotes , is called “ Altered State ? ” and was paid for by Rand .

MADRID ( AP ) 
Tour de France winner Alberto Contador will leave Astana at the end of this season after the Spanish cyclist rejected the team 's offer to extend his contract .
Contador said Wednesday he will study his options before deciding which team to ride for next season .
" Alberto Contador has rejected the Astana team 's ultimatum , which had asked for an answer on its renewal offer on the upcoming seasons by Tuesday , " Contador said in a statement .
" Alberto Contador will calmly study all of the possibilities on offers for the coming season , and he has n't dismissed any of them . "
Contador did not divulge the offers he was studying .
In three seasons with the Kazakhstan - based team , Contador has won two of his three Tour titles , a Giro d'Italia and Spanish Vuelta title .
Contador arrived at Astana alongside team boss Johan Bruyneel in 2008 , on the heels of his first Tour victory with the Discovery Channel team .
But Tour organizers denied Astana a place in the race that year due to doping violations .
Instead , Contador became only the fifth cyclist to win all three of cycling 's premier events with Giro and Vuelta triumphs — and the fastest to accomplish the feat .
Contador overcame the return of seven - time Tour champion Lance Armstrong with Astana last year to win cycling 's classic event for the second time before taking his third Tour title on Sunday .
But Astana struggled to pay wages last year , and Bruyneel left the team at the end of last season alongside Armstrong .

Authorities have arrested California woman Lisette Lee , 28 , who arrived in Columbus , Ohio , on Wednesday aboard a private jet carrying 506 pounds of marijuana packed into 13 suitcases .
Lee , who falsely claimed to be an heiress to the Samsung Electronics fortune , says she was paid $ 60,000 by a " friend " to escort the load , which is valued at over $ 500,000 , but denies any further knowledge .
( Watch a local report about the 500 - pound drug seizure . )
Though substantial , the authorities ' score does not rate among the biggest marijuana raids in U.S. history .
Here , five standouts :
1. School daze
In March , 2007 , law enforcement authorities in Houston , TX , seized more than 19,000 pounds of marijuana stored inside two yellow school buses in a remote area Southwest of the city .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents believed the massive cache , which had an estimate street value of $ 13 million , was part of a Mexican drug - smuggling operation .
2. High seas
One hundred and fifty miles off the coast of San Diego , a U.S. Coast Guard unit discovered 26,000 pounds of pot aboard the 63 - foot yacht Arrakis in November , 1984 — reportedly the largest West Coast bust to date .
" Boy , are you guys in for a big surprise , " Arrakis passenger Phillip Kashnig reportedly declared as Coast Guard officers boarded the yacht .
When asked why , Kashnig replied witlessly , " Because this boat is loaded with marijuana . "
3 . Ring of firearms and narcotics
In a " significant blow " to the Mexico - based " Victor Emillio Cazares - Gastellum " drug trafficking ring , U.S. authorities seized 27,229 pounds of marijuana , as well as 9,512 pounds of cocaine , 705 pounds of methamphetamine , 11 pounds of heroin and approximately $ 45.2 million dollars .
The 2007 bust , dubbed " Operation Imperial Emperor , " led to the arrest of more than 400 members of the cartel and the confiscation of $ 6 million in property assets , 100 weapons and 94 vehicles .
4. Northern light - ups
Federal drug agents captured 50,000 pounds of marijuana stashed into a " nondescript " Queens , NY , home in 2009 as part of a crackdown on a Canadian drug - smuggling operation .
" These guys were doing it very big , " an officer familiar with the case told the New York Daily News .
" The street value of what we seized is $ 150 million . "
The marijuana was originally grown in hydroponic farms inside British Columbia homes then driven east and smuggled across the border inside cars with secret compartments .
Ten people were arrested .
5 . The billion dollar bust
In July 2009 , law enforcement authorities confiscated at least 330,000 marijuana plants — worth a staggering $ 1 billion — from fields in Fresno County , CA .
" Operation Save Our Sierra " lasted more than a week and a half , and resulted in the arrest of 82 suspects with links to Mexican drug cartels .
" Fresno County is roughly the size of Connecticut , and the drug traffickers target these areas because they know there is not that significant of a law - enforcement presence , " Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims told CNN .
" The chances of getting caught are slim . "
Or , rather , were .

OTTAWA – Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a controlling leader running a “ garrison party ” in permanent campaign mode , says his former campaign director Tom Flanagan .
In a paper written for presentation at a conference in Montreal , Flanagan offers an insider ’s analysis that draws on his and Harper ’s past experience with the Reform and Canadian Alliance parties .
The University of Calgary political scientist and author casts a critical eye on Harper as prime minister , suggesting his leadership style has created a party that is more like the “ old - line parties ” that Reform and the Canadian Alliance used to criticize .
He says although there is evidence that the Liberals are starting to adopt some of the Conservatives ’ tricks of the trade , including centralizing memberships lists , fundraising , and message discipline , the Conservative Party ’s continual girding for electoral battle risks turning off grassroots members who view a political party as a way to advance policy , not just win elections .
Flanagan writes that Harper took many lessons from Preston Manning , who was a manipulative leader , saying he learned how to control a populist movement .
“ He used to grumble privately about Manning ’s manipulations , but he was absorbing the lessons .
Indeed , he ultimately ended up with a view of leadership far more aggressive than Manning ’s , after he saw the Canadian Alliance experience of how populism could get out of control . ”
Once Harper decided the route to electoral victory was to merge the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties , writes Flanagan , he aggressively set out to meld the two , win the leadership , and structure the party ’s fundraising , policy development and executive bodies so that he was the ultimate decision - maker .
Flanagan writes that Harper ’s shaping of the party structures and determination not to allow “ intermediate ” groupings such as youth wings , or separate political entities for regional , ethnic , aboriginal or other different groups under the party ’s umbrella means that “ there are no points of refuge in which opposition to the leadership could coalesce . ”
He says the past 10 years , and minority governments since 2004 have “ deeply affected ” government and political culture in Canada , where there is a permanent election campaign underway .
Federal politicians , he writes , “ are like child soldiers in a war - torn African country : all they know how to do is to fire their AK - 47s . ”
Harper ’s government controls its cabinet ministers , MPs , Conservative staffers , and party operatives through rigid message discipline .
Staffers are instructed never to talk to the press and risk losing their jobs if they do .
MPs must adhere to official talking points , he adds .
“ Just as chronic warfare produces a garrison state , permanent campaigning has caused the Conservative Party to merge with the campaign team , producing a garrison party .
The party is today , for all intents and purposes , a campaign organization focused on being ready for and winning the next election , whenever it may come . ”
Flanagan raises a question about whether the “ garrison party will survive the specific circumstances of the present , i.e. , the leadership of Stephen Harper and the need for constant election readiness in a period of minority government . ”
Flanagan says the Liberals are already following the Conservative example in rewriting their party ’s constitution to assert national control over membership rules and grassroots fundraising ; enforcing more effective message discipline ; running negative ads between writ periods .

“ If the era of permanent campaign and its arms race logic continues , the Conservative organizational model may well persist and even be imitated by other parties trying to survive in the Darwinian world of electoral competition . ”
But he also says that there is a risk that some party members “ may turn away from the party if it becomes nothing but an electoral machine .
Thus , it is possible that too long a period of constant election readiness may exhaust a party and undercut its effectiveness even in purely electoral terms . ”

California ’s largest for - profit health insurer is moving to dramatically raise rates for customers with individual policies , setting off a furor among policyholders and prompting state insurance regulators to investigate .
Anthem Blue Cross is telling many of its approximately 800,000 customers who buy individual coverage -- people not covered by group rates -- that its prices will go up March 1 and may be adjusted “ more frequently ” than its typical yearly increases .
The insurer declined to say how high it is increasing rates .
But brokers who sell these policies say they are fielding numerous calls from customers incensed over premium increases of 30 % to 39 % , saying they come on the heels of similar jumps last year .
Many policyholders say the rate hikes are the largest they can remember , and they fear that subsequent premium growth will narrow their options -- leaving them to buy policies with higher deductibles and less coverage or putting health insurance out of reach altogether .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like this , ” said Mark Weiss , 63 , a Century City podiatrist whose Anthem policy for himself and his wife will rise 35 % .
The couple ’s annual insurance bill will jump to $ 27,336 from $ 20,184 .
“ I think it ’s just unconscionable , ” said Weiss , a member of Blue Cross for 30 years .
Woodland Hills - based
Anthem declined to say how many individual policyholders will be affected or what a typical increase will be under the new pricing , which will vary from one individual to another .
But the company defended its premiums , even as it tried to strike a sympathetic tone .
“ We understand and strongly share our members ’ concerns over the rising cost of healthcare services and the corresponding adverse impact on insurance premiums , ” the company said in a statement .
“ Unfortunately , the individual market premiums are merely the symptoms of a larger underlying problem in California ’s individual market -- rising healthcare costs . ”
About 2.5 million Californians have individual insurance policies , accounting for a small portion of the state ’s overall insurance market .
By contrast , nearly 21 million people in California are covered by health maintenance organizations .
Individual policies are often the only option for those who are uninsured , self - employed or do not receive health coverage through employers .
Insurers are free to cherry - pick the healthiest customers in the lightly regulated individual market .
They can raise rates at any time as long as they notify the state Department of Insurance and prove that they are spending at least 70 % of premiums on medical care .
The size of the individual rate increases prompted state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner recently to call for a review of Anthem ’s charges .
“ Commissioner Poizner is very concerned by these large rate increases , ” spokesman Darrel Ng said .
Poizner directed his department to retain an “ independent outside actuary to examine Blue Cross ’ rates ” to ensure that the company spends at least 70 % of the premiums on medical care , as required by state law , Ng said .
Anthem said it had already hired an actuary who found that the rates were sound .
Anthem is not the only health insurer imposing double - digit rate increases .
Competitors such as Blue Shield of California and Aetna also have raised premiums significantly in recent years , insurance brokers said .
But they said the impending Anthem increases are the largest they have seen .
“ Do they really think they are going to keep clients this way ? ” asked Bill Robinson , a Palm Springs broker who has informed his Anthem clients that they will face increases of as much as 39 % on March 1 .
Anthem sent letters to agents a few weeks ago informing them of the March 1 increases and followed up with similar notices to policyholders last week .
That ’s when Mary Feller of San Rafael learned that the rate for herself and her husband will jump 39 % , or $ 465 a month , driving the couple ’s annual premium to $ 19,896 from $ 14,316 .
Feller , 56 , said the premium for her 26 - year - old daughter also will rise 38 % , costing the family an additional $ 1,572 a year .
As a result , starting March 1 , the Fellers ’ health insurance bill will surpass the family ’s monthly mortgage payment on their home north of San Francisco .
“ It ’s breathtaking , ” said Feller , an entertainment journalist .
“ We ’re going to have to cut back somewhere else .
This kind of stuff strikes fear in the heart . ”
Feller said she was troubled by another part of the Anthem letter .
Besides detailing the premium increase , it said : “ Anthem Blue Cross will usually adjust rates every 12 months ; however , we may adjust more frequently in accordance with the terms of your health benefit plan . ”
She and others voiced anger about the increases as Anthem ’s parent company , WellPoint Inc. , sees big profits .
Last week the company announced an eightfold increase in profit for the last three months of 2009 , a surge attributed largely to the sale of subsidiaries .
Broker and insurance industry analysts said the California rate increases will leave individual policyholders with few good options :
Anthem subscribers such as the Fellers can switch to a company plan with a higher deductible .
Or they can try to switch insurers , a dicey proposition because carriers in the individual market can reject applicants who have preexisting medical conditions .
“ It ’s putting people ’s backs up against the wall , ” said Shana Alex Lavarreda , director of health insurance studies at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research .
“ They are finding new ways to create new problems for consumers . ”
The insurer said it had a team of workers to help customers balance costs and insurance .
“ Anthem offers a variety of health benefit plans , ” the company said , “ and we are dedicated to working with our members to find health coverage plans that are the most appropriate and affordable for their needs . ”

This study concerns the controversial case of Alger Hiss , who was suspected of spying for Soviet Military Intelligence .
It does not concern his guilt or innocence but whether the U.S. Army Military Intelligence used an undercover spy-catcher to penetrate Hiss ’s defense and to plant evidence forged to secure his perjury conviction .
If so , Hiss ’s conviction — which ushered in the McCarthy era and thrust Richard Nixon to national prominence — represents an alarming intrusion of our military into civil affairs .

The Sansai Worm Farm is the dream of two brothers who started this business in their hometown of Cleveland , Ohio with the hopes of making Cleveland an example of how environmental and urban renewal can be accomplished at the same time .
The dream was realized in 2005 with the purchase of a 32 acre property .
The 17 acre facility , located in a converted inner city bombsite manufacturing factory , is also known as the former TRW Automotive Valve Plant in Collinwood .
Now known as The Richard Melvin Building , the manufacturing facility has become the home to millions of red wiggler composting earthworms , who eat material , which othewise would go to landfills , for the harvest of worm castings which are premium organic plant additives .
Sansai saves our planet from adding to dangerous methane levels produced at landfills .
It also had plans to employ up to 400 people , from our neighborhood , in the next four years .
Right now Sansai has been told to move out , and the worms are in lock - down .
Though an Arizona corporation is currently in possession of the Worm Farm , their Attorney Charles A. Nemer , had promised the Melvin brothers that volunteers would be allowed into the building , to care for the livestock -- the worms -- who need food and water , and do not belong to the out of state company , but to the Sansai Worm Farm .
More than a hundred volunteers , who have been given written and legal permission by Mr. Nemer to take care of the worms , have been turned away at the door .
Only three of the volunteers have been allowed in , the same volunteers , who are nearing exhaustion , and worms have begun to die .
Each day , the attorney for the Sansai Farm makes sure that the volunteers ' paperwork is in order , and each day , they are turned away anyway .
Right now the Melvin brothers and Sansai Worm Farm are in negotiations to buy the building back .
If Mr. Nemer does not follow through on his promise , by the time the legal wrangling is finished , and the Melvins are back in possession of their property , the livestock may be dead .
To volunteer to help , contact the Worm Farm at www.sansaitech.com.

Earth angels need angels on Earth
Due to some unforeseen hurdles of starting up an environmental business in the city of Cleveland , the property ’s 1st short term loan was due January 2006 , just after the business finally received the green light to begin operations in December , 2005 .
When the real estate loan was refinanced , there was about a $ 2 million dollar penalty paid to the first out - of - state private lender by an associate lender , from the same state .
This expense was passed on to the CEO of Sansai and due to the bad economy and the banking crisis , the delay of financing the 2nd short term , high interest loan has resulted in a challenging financial situation for Sansai .
The building became owned by the - out - of - state lender and Sansai Environmental was told to move out , after a four year culmination of the manufacture of pure soil product that once sold retail can pay the lender in full , if unimpeded in its sale .
Earthworms have been labeled by soil scientists as earth angels .
Every creature on this green Earth contributes something to the planet ’s ecosystem , and one of those creatures is the earthworm .
Now 60 million earth angels are in immediate jeopardy from suffocation and / or starvation !
Every day now , all but two or three of the volunteers wishing to help out have been turned away at the door .
Why ?
Because of money and timing .
But should live creatures suffer ?
With a large population of earth angels , it is critical to air out , water and feed hundreds of cubic yards of indoor earthworm habitats that are over 100 feet long by 6 feet wide .
Thanks to Tim Smith and The Cleveland Greenhouse Project , there is a long list of volunteers who have signed up to help with offers of time and energy to take care of the livestock , but they are n’t always allowed in by the new out - of - state owner .
Sansai appreciates the help of the wonderful volunteers showing up to get to its valuable inhabitants for immediate care and feeding .
Sansai ’s earth angels have created tons of valuable earth angel product ready to sell to gardeners .
Sansai hopes not to lose the home for 60 million earth angels due to greed .
Saving this company will help save our home — Earth !
Sansai ’s products Magic Dust and Magic
Mist are the most economical and purest earthworm casting products in the world ; free of chemicals and pesticides .
Magic Dust and Magic
Mist are part of the new revolution to reverse the damage to the Earth that chemicals have caused .
Sansai Environmental Technologies www.sansaitech.com has reintroduced the magic of the earthworm to mankind on a large scale and applied the best of modern agricultural sciences and mass production processes to it , in order to be able to distribute it worldwide .
The earthworm eats organic decaying material , in effect helping to clean the environment .
Their bodies remove possible contaminants and convert the organic material into nutrient - rich castings that feeds all vegetation with plant booster ingredients that assist plants to naturally grow healthier , stronger and larger .
Angels never arrive too late to help .
Many have been in contact with Sansai to restructure its financing .
Sixty million earthworms want to call Cleveland their home not their tombstone .
The world 's largest indoor earthworm casting production facility can survive , today , in this world , right in the heart of Cleveland , Ohio .
On the very near horizon , there is a solution .
Sansai and The Cleveland Greenhouse Project are in the midst of a fundraiser for providing earth angels with new homes for those who vermicompost in schools , at home or the office .
With teamwork , the communities in Cleveland can make a difference by showing others how to make it commonplace for earth ’s inhabitants to use its food scraps for feeding earth angels who will then create the safest and purest of organic potting soil .
For those who have the spirit to add to the positive input of saving Sansai , PLEASE GET INVOLVED AND SIGN UP TO BE A VOLUNTEER THROUGH THE WEBSITE : www.sansaitech.com.

A familiar story for Spain .
Good ball retention , a struggle until Torres departs , and Villa saves the day , scoring in a 1 - 0 win .
That could quite easily be a description of their previous game , against Portugal .
Spain lined up with their usual lopsided 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation and the expected XI , whilst Paraguay made six – yes , six – changes to the side that scraped through against Japan in the previous round .
Spain started with a different shape to the one depicted on the diagram on the left .
Andres Iniesta began the game on the left rather than the right , which meant David Villa played centrally and Fernando Torres worked the right - hand side channel .
This only lasted for a quarter of an hour , however , before Spain returned to the shape shown .
Paraguay ’s formation was a fairly standard 4 - 4 - 2 .
Their midfield and defence played very narrow – trying to replicate Switzerland ’s successful approach – and Spain rarely looked to stretch them by playing down the flanks .
Interestingly , whereas most of Spain ’s opponents have deployed their midfield very deep to pick up Xavi and Iniesta , Paraguay were reasonably happy to give those two space between the lines , and instead attempted to cut off the supply to them .
Therefore , they looked to press Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso far more than Spain are used to , hence their noticeably wayward passing throughout the opening period of the game .
The one player who did look threatening was Sergio Ramos , who had a lot of space at right - back , but he created little of note .
Iniesta saw more of the ball when he stayed in wide positions , whilst Alonso started to drop deeper than Busquets in order to buy some time in possession .
Paraguay ’s approach was uncomplicated – defend solidly , press in midfield , leave the attacking to the two forwards .
Nelson Valdez and Oscar Cardozo stayed central and had few defensive responsibilities , though they did look to close down Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique from goal - kicks , meaning Spain were n’t able to play out from the back .
Torres still disappoints
Spain ’s main problem was again Torres – seemingly lacking in both fitness and confidence .
Balls slid into the channels saw him lose out to defenders in terms of both pace and strength ( an underrated feature of his game ) , although on a couple of occasions this was equally the fault of the passer – Xavi noticeably overhitting one through - ball .
The secondary problem ( or , a related problem , if you like ) was again a lack of width .
Iniesta played so centrally that Spain often looked like they were playing a narrow ’ square ’ of four central midfielders , and though Ramos was constantly free , they were n’t able to stretch Paraguay ’s defence enough , with the inevitable conclusion that balls played through the centre of the pitch were often intercepted .
A fairly stale first half came to an end at 0 - 0 , and the first ten minutes of the second period were no more exciting .
The inevitable withdrawal of Torres came on 55 minutes – although he was replaced by Cesc Fabregas , rather than Fernando Llorente ( as happened against Portugal , with some success ) , or a wide player .
Fabregas ’ individual performance was reasonably good – he certainly contributed more than Torres , with driving runs from the centre of midfield , but the substitution actually worsened Spain ’s problem .
When Torres was on , they had two players looking to start in wide areas – Iniesta and Villa .
With Villa going upfront and Fabregas deployed centrally , they were essentially just packing another player into a zone they were already overstocked in .
Paraguay threatened on a slightly more consistent basis , mostly with balls over the top for Valdez .
Spain played a high line , and both Pique and Puyol looked uncomfortable – despite them being used to this style of defence at Barcelona .
Pique has n’t looked himself throughout the tournament , and conceded a penalty for a ludicrous challenge from a corner .
Cardozo – usually so reliable from the spot , as he ’s shown for Benfica in the past year – failed to beat Iker Casillas .
Spain got a penalty of their own seconds later when Villa was tripped – but Xabi Alonso also saw his ( re- taken ) penalty saved .
Pedro brings width
The game was more stretched than in the first half , but the general pattern of play was the same .
Spain only really stepped it up in the final 15 minutes , when Alonso was withdrawn and Spain , mercifully , had some natural width in Pedro .
He stretched the play high up the pitch , forcing one of the full - backs out wide and creating gaps in the Paraguyan defence .
He was also crucial in the eventual winner – Iniesta slipped past two challenges , laid the ball to Pedro , whose shot hit the post , before Villa just about converted the rebound .
The goal did n’t necessarily demonstrate what Pedro was bringing to the side , but it was fitting that he was heavily involved , and his advanced position would not have been one taken up by another player if the substitution had not been made .
Xavi dropped deeper and did Alonso ’s job well , and Spain did n’t suffer from the departure of one of their central midfielders – they still kept the ball .
And they did that for the rest of the game , apart from one chance that fell Roque Santa Cruz ’s way .
Tiki - taka involves talented , creative players but is as much a defensive tactic as it is an attacking one , argues Sid Lowe .
Throughout this tournament , you ’ve never been completely convinced Spain are going to take the lead , but once they do , you never think that they might lose it .
It ’s been the pattern of the game against Honduras , Chile , Portugal and now Paraguay .
Conclusion
What is going on with Spain , then ?
Are they an impressive , unfussy side who are content to go 1 - 0 up and close out the game , or are they attempting to play a more exciting brand of football and not completely clicking ?
Your opinion on that decides whether you think they have been excellent , or slightly underwhelming so far .
Either way , it probably does n’t matter at this stage in the competition – two more boringish 1 - 0s will do them nicely .
Still , Vicente del Bosque has selection and formation decisions to make ahead of the semi-final with Germany , and Spain have clearly been better when Torres has n’t been involved .
Maybe his presence in the side from the start is part of a more complex del Bosque plan about how Spain should win games – wear opponents down by keeping the play central and having the immediate Torres - Villa threat , before switching to wider , more fluid approach where Fabregas and Pedro / Silva / Navas can cause problems from different areas .
It ’s an approach often used by Jose Mourinho – at both Chelsea and Inter he ’s often suddenly switched between 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 and 4 - 3 - 3 / 4 -2-3- 1 formations midway through games , both for attacking and defensive reasons ( see here for an example against Chelsea in last season ’s Champions League ) .
Torres is n’t firing on all cylinders , but Spain have won the four games he has started , even if they ’ve got the goals after his departure .
His form would indicate he should be dropped , but maybe del Bosque thinks the alternatives to him are better used as impact subs .

As I said in this news , I ’ll test as soon as possible the GL_ARB_get_program_binary extension with an OpenGL 2 context .
Well , it ’s done !
NVIDIA driver R259.09 exposes this extension for an OpenGL 4 context but also for an OpenGL 2 context .
So let ’s see to what an ascii GLSL shader looks like .
Here is the GLSL vertex shader :
void main ( ) { gl_Position = gl_Vertex ; } ;
and here is the pixel shader :
void main ( ) { gl_FragColor=vec4( 1.0 , 0.4 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; } ;

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc ’s safety record would bar the company from getting new U.S. offshore oil and gas exploration leases for up to seven years under bill language passed on Wednesday by a U.S. House committee .
The Committee on Natural Resources voted to pass an amendment by Representative George Miller , a California Democrat , that would prevent BP and other companies from getting new leases from the Department of the Interior unless they pass safety and environmental requirements .
The amendment did not mention BP specifically , but it would not allow any company to get leases that had more than 10 fatalities at drilling and production facilities or refineries that resulted from violations of federal or state health and environment laws within the last seven years .
“ The Miller amendment would prohibit BP or any other company with an egregious worker and environmental safety record from new offshore oil and gas drilling , ” Miller ’s office said in an email after the vote .
The measure was added to a sweeping bill that the committee expected to clear on Thursday morning , but which would have to pass both the full House and Senate before reaching President Barack Obama ’s desk .
BP pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from the 2005 blast at its refinery in Texas City , Texas , that killed 15 workers and injured 180 .
The Justice Department is interviewing witnesses in its criminal and civil investigations into the April 20 explosion of the rig that damaged BP ’s well that is gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico and harming multibillion dollar fishing and tourism industries across five states .
The department has asked BP and other companies to preserve documents related to the explosion and subsequent spill , the worst in U.S. history .
About 4 percent of BP ’s revenue is related to new deepwater developments in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the British energy services firm John Wood Group .
A BP spokesman said the company had no comment about the Miller amendment .
Representative Bart Stupak , who chairs a separate House subcommittee investigating the BP oil spill , said he supported giving the Interior Department the discretion to block BP from getting future leases because of the company ’s bad safety record .
He downplayed concerns raised by some that BP needs continued drilling access to U.S. waters so it can earn money from the oil it produces to pay for billions of dollars in Gulf Coast cleanup costs and liability claims in the years ahead .
“ I ’m not going to allow BP to drill more so they make more money so they can pay us , and as they do that then there ’s more environmental damage , ” Stupak told reporters while speaking at the Platts Energy Podium .
“ It ’s a pretty big corporation .
I ’m sure they can find some money . ”
Separately , the Natural Resources Committee approved an amendment to establish an independent national commission to study the events leading up to the oil spill disaster .
To Ferrari , Fernando Alonso's victory in the German grand prix last Sunday was a well - deserved triumph and anyone who thought otherwise was ill - informed or had a grudge .
There have been a lot of those people about in the aftermath of the race at Hockenheim and , here in Budapest , the events in Germany will not be buried , much to Ferrari 's annoyance .
The fallout from the instruction to Felipe Massa to let Alonso past to win the race last weekend has hung over the circuit since the bulk of the teams ' entourage arrived in Budapest on Tuesday .
Little else has been talked about around the track this week .
The atmosphere around Massa 's team has been awkward at best as Ferrari have reacted defensively to the spotlight being turned upon them .
They want to move on .
Unfortunately , no one else is ready to do the same .
When the drivers joined their teams the following day , Alonso marched past a bank of photographers , stopping only to shake hands with a favoured few and he has done his best all week to avoid questions on the issue .
Ferrari's thinking at the last round was to get Alonso back into title contention after just one podium finish in the previous five races , and everyone in the team , including the Spaniard , have been at pains to point out that Massa is not now the No2 driver at Ferrari .
" It is not No1 or No2 drivers , " said Alonso , in a brief appearance in front of the press .
" It is more about respect for each other and respect for racing for the scuderia , which means a lot .
We all said everything in Germany and that is it .
Our main focus is concentrate on this race .
" There is nothing really to say about any opinions .
Many things have been said in the last couple of days .
The only thing for us is that the car is competitive and we can do well here .
What is the opinion of some of the drivers or team principals is up to them .
We respect everything but we concentrate on our job . "
When pressed about his relationship with Massa , Alonso kept up the deadpan persona that has been evident since he took off his helmet at Hockenheim after the victory put him 34 points off the leader Lewis Hamilton in the drivers championship .
" We are both drivers who want to win , we are both competitive and we want to score as many points as possible , " insisted the 29 - year - old .
" We are team‑mates but we do fight because we have the same car .
What we make different at Ferrari is that we do not touch and we work together very well . "
Most of the opinions aired since Hockenheim have been critical of Ferrari 's tactics in Germany and the team has reacted by simply batting the accusations away .
Earlier in the week the Ferrari president , Luca di Montezemolo , had issued a statement on Ferrari 's official website that was aimed at the team 's critics .
" With all the comments made recently , most of them misguided , there is only clear and concrete truth : Ferrari is strong and winning again , " he said .
" That is what I , everyone in the company and our fans wanted .
" Everyone at Ferrari was naturally delighted with the fantastic one - two finish in the German grand prix , which proved that the car had improved considerably over the past few races , even if the results had been lacking .
" While the quickest car outright in qualifying was still a blue Red Bull , the next two cars on the grid were both red and , in race conditions , it seemed that the Cavallino [ the prancing horse on Ferrari 's team badge ] was quicker than the Bull . "
That Ferrari deserved to win the race has never been in doubt , it is just that to many the wrong car won .
The way that Massa was instructed to move aside and let his team - mate past on the 49th lap of the race with a clumsily coded message – " Fernando is faster than you " – is against the rules , as the stewards made clear when they handed the Italian team a $ 100,000 ( £ 65,000 ) fine and referred the matter to the World Motor Sport Council .
But the feeling remains at Ferrari that they did nothing wrong at Hockenheim despite not appealing the fine .
" Enough of the hypocrisy .
This has always happened , " said Di Montezemolo , who was sporting director of Ferrari in the 1970s .
" If one races for Ferrari , then the interests of the team come before those of the individual . "
That is certainly true .
At the 1956 Italian grand prix , the British driver Peter Collins was forced to hand his car over to Juan Manuel Fangio during the race .
The Argentinian went on to finish second , clinching his fourth world title in his only season in Maranello .
Twenty - three years later , also at Monza , Gilles Villeneuve obediently followed Jody Scheckter across the line to give his team - mate the title .
Villeneuve later admitted that he was praying for the South African 's Ferrari to break as every lap passed but he had agreed not to challenge for the lead .
Team orders and the concept of No1 and No2 drivers were widely accepted in Formula One until 2002 , when Ferrari took them to extremes .
When Jean Todt , now the president of the FIA , instructed Rubens Barrichello to allow Michael Schumacher to overtake him yards from the line at the Austrian grand prix , he made it quite clear that the team only favoured one driver and he had won four of the first five races that season .
Schumacher was not fighting for a championship , as Alonso now clearly is , that day as he already had it in the bag .
The current Ferrari team principal , Stefano Domenicali , has clearly been exasperated by the endless questioning over the team - orders scandal and today he tried to put the matter to bed until the World Motor Sport Council meets to discuss the issue at the beginning of September .
" There is not a problem with first and second drivers , " Domenicali said .
" We consider the team as a general interest and we consider Formula One as a team sport . "
That seems to be the crux of the matter .
Scuderia Ferrari , the oldest and most revered team in grand prix racing , have a philosophy that is against the current rules of the sport .

At Backblaze , we provide unlimited storage to our customers for only $ 5 per month , so we had to figure out how to store hundreds of petabytes of customer data in a reliable , scalable way — and keep our costs low .
After looking at several overpriced commercial solutions , we decided to build our own custom Backblaze Storage Pods : 67 terabyte 4U servers for $ 7,867 .
What we actually provide for our customers is online backup for home and business online backup for work .
However , in this post , we ’ll share how to make one of these Storage Pods , and you ’re welcome to use this design .
Our hope is that by sharing , others can benefit and ultimately , refine this concept and send improvements back to us .
Evolving and lowering costs is critical to our continuing success at Backblaze .
Below is a video that shows a 3 - D model of the Backblaze Storage Pod .
Continue reading to learn the exact details of the design .
You can download the full 3 - D model of the Backblaze Storage Pod here .
Backblaze Needs Plenty of Reliable , Cheap Storage
To say that Backblaze needs lots of storage is an understatement .
We ’re a backup service , so our data center contains a complete copy of all of our customers ’ data , plus multiple versions of files that change .
In rough terms , every time one of our customers buys a hard drive , Backblaze needs another hard drive .
A long time ago we stopped measuring storage in our data center in gigabytes or terabytes and started measuring in petabytes .
To get a sense of what this looks like , here is a shot of me deploying new Pods in our data center .
The small stack of six Pods in the rack I ’m working on contains just under half a petabyte of storage .
To offer our service at a reasonable price , we need affordable storage at a multi-petabyte scale .
No One Sells Cheap Storage , So We Designed It
Before realizing that we had to solve this storage problem ourselves , we considered Amazon S3 , Dell or Sun Servers , NetApp Filers , EMC SAN , etc .
As we investigated these traditional off - the - shelf solutions , we became increasingly disillusioned by the expense .
When you strip away the marketing terms and fancy logos from any storage solution , data ends up on a hard drive .
But when we priced various off - the - shelf solutions , the cost was 10 times as much ( or more ) than the raw hard drives .
Here ’s a comparison chart of the price for one petabyte from various vendors :
Based on the expense , we decided to build our own Backblaze Storage Pods .
We had two primary goals : keep upfront costs low by using consumer - grade drives and readily available commodity components and be as power and space efficient as possible by using green components and squeezing a lot of storage into a small box .
The result is a 4U rack - mounted Linux - based server that contains 67TB at a material cost of $ 7,867 , the bulk of which goes to purchase the drives themselves .
This translates to just three - tenths of one penny per gigabyte per month over the course of three years .
Even including the surrounding costs — such as electricity , bandwidth , space rental , and IT administrators ’ salaries — Backblaze spends one - tenth of the price in comparison to using Amazon S3 , Dell Servers , NetApp Filers , or an EMC SAN .
What Makes a Backblaze Storage Pod ?
A Backblaze Storage Pod is a self - contained unit that puts storage online .
It ’s made up of a custom metal case with commodity hardware inside .
Specifically , one Pod contains one Intel Motherboard with four SATA cards plugged into it .
The nine SATA cables run from the cards to nine port multiplier backplanes that each have five hard drives plugged directly into them ( 45 hard drives in total ) .
Above is an exploded diagram , and you can see a detailed parts list in Appendix A at the bottom of this post .
The two most important factors to note are that the cost of the hard drives dominates the price of the overall Pod and that the rest of the system is made entirely of commodity parts .
Wiring It Up : How to Assemble a Backblaze Storage Pod
The power wiring diagram of a Backblaze Storage Pod is seen below .
Power supply units ( PSUs ) provide most of their power on two different voltages : 5V and 12 V .
We use two power supplies in the Pod because 45 drives draw a lot of 5V power , yet high wattage ATX PSUs provide most of their power on 12V .
This is not an accident : 1,500 watt and larger ATX power supplies are designed for powerful 3 - D graphics cards that need the extra power on the 12V rail .
We could have switched to a power supply designed for servers , but two ATX PSUs are cheaper .
PSU1 powers the front three fans and port multiplier backplanes one , two , three , four , and seven .
PSU2 powers everything else .
( See Appendix A for a detailed list of the custom connectors on each PSU . )
To power the port multiplier backplanes , the power cables run from the PSUs through four holes in the divider metal plate that holds the fans at the center of the case ( near the base of the fans ) and then continue to the underside of the nine backplanes .
Each port multiplier backplane has two molex male connectors on the underside .
Hard drives draw the most power during initial spin- up , so if you power up both PSUs at the same time , it can draw a large ( 14 amp ) spike of 120V power from the socket .
We recommend powering up PSU1 first , waiting until the drives are spun - up ( and the power draw decreases to a reasonable level ) , and then powering up PSU2 .
Fully booted , the entire Pod will draw approximately 4.8 amps idle and up to 5.6 amps under heavy load .
Below is a picture of a partially assembled Backblaze Storage Pod ( click on the photo for a larger image ) .
The metal case has screws mounted on the bottom , facing upward , where we attach nylon standoffs ( the small white pieces in the picture below ) .
Nylon helps dampen vibration , and this dampening is a critical aspect of server design .
The circuit boards shown on top of the nylon standoffs are a few of the nine SATA port multiplier backplanes that take a single SATA connection on their underside and allow five hard drives to be mounted vertically and plugged into the topside of the board .
All the power and SATA cables run underneath the port multiplier backplanes .
One of the backplanes in the picture below is fully populated with hard drives to show the positioning .
A note about drive vibration : the drives vibrate too much if you leave them sitting as shown in the picture above , so we add an “ anti-vibration sleeve ” ( essentially a rubber band ) around the hard drive in between the red metal grid and the drives .
This seats the drives tightly in the rubber .
We also lay a large ( 16 ″ x 17 ″ x 1/8 ″ ) piece of foam along top of the hard drives after all 45 are in the case .
The lid then screws down on top of the foam to hold the drives securely .
In the future , we will dedicate an entire blog post to vibration .
The SATA wiring diagram is seen below .
The Intel Motherboard has four SATA cards plugged into it : three SYBA two - port SATA cards and one Addonics four - port card .
The nine SATA cables connect to the top of the SATA cards and run in tandem with the power cables .
All nine SATA cables measure 36 inches and use locking 90 - degree connectors on the backplane end and non-locking straight connectors into the SATA cards .
A note about SATA chipsets : each of the port multiplier backplanes has a Silicon Image SiI3726 chip so that five drives can be attached to one SATA port .
Each of the SYBA two - port PCIe SATA cards has a Silicon Image SiI3132 , and the four - port PCI Addonics card has a Silicon Image SiI3124 chip .
We use only three of the four available ports on the Addonics card because we have only nine backplanes .
We do n’t use the SATA ports on the motherboard because , despite Intel ’s claims of port multiplier support in their ICH10 south bridge , we noticed strange results in our performance tests .
Silicon Image pioneered port multiplier technology , and their chips work best together .
A Backblaze Storage Pod Runs Free Software
A Backblaze Storage
Pod is n’t a complete building block until it boots and is on the network .
The Pods boot 64 - bit Debian 4 Linux and the JFS file system , and they are self - contained appliances , where all access to and from the Pods is through HTTPS .
Below is a layer cake diagram .
Starting at the bottom , there are 45 hard drives exposed through the SATA controllers .
We then use the fdisk tool on Linux to create one partition per drive .
On top of that , we cluster 15 hard drives into a single RAID6 volume with two parity drives ( out of the 15 ) .
The RAID6 is created with the mdadm utility .
On top of that is the JFS file system , and the only access we then allow to this totally self - contained storage building block is through HTTPS running custom Backblaze application layer logic in Apache Tomcat 5.5 .
After taking all this into account , the formatted ( useable ) space is 87 % of the raw hard drive totals .
One of the most important concepts here is that to store or retrieve data with a Backblaze Storage Pod , it is always through HTTPS .
There is no iSCSI , no NFS , no SQL , no Fibre Channel .
None of those technologies scales as cheaply , reliably , goes as big , nor can be managed as easily as stand - alone Pods with their own IP address waiting for requests on HTTPS .
A Backblaze Storage Pod Is a Building Block
We have been extremely happy with the reliability and excellent performance of the Pods , and a Backblaze Storage Pod is a fully contained storage server .
But the intelligence of where to store data and how to encrypt it , deduplicate it , and index it is all at a higher level ( outside the scope of this blog post ) .
When you run a data center with thousands of hard drives , CPUs , motherboards , and power supplies , you are going to have hardware failures — it ’s irrefutable .
Backblaze Storage Pods are building blocks upon which a larger system can be organized that does n’t allow for a single point of failure .
Each
Pod in itself is just a big chunk of raw storage for an inexpensive price ; it is not a “ solution ” in itself .
Cloud Storage : The Next Step
The first step to building cheap cloud storage is to already have cheap storage , and above we demonstrate how to create your own .
If all you need is cheap storage , this may suffice .
If you need to build a cloud , you ’ve got more work ahead of you .
Building a cloud includes not only deploying a large quantity of hardware but , critically , deploying software to manage it .
At Backblaze we have developed software that de-duplicates and chops data into blocks ; encrypts and transfers it for backup ; reassembles , decrypts , re-duplicates , and packages the data for recovery ; and monitors and manages the entire cloud storage system .
This process is proprietary technology that we have developed over the years .
You may have your own system for this process and incorporate the Backblaze Storage Pod design , or you may simply seek inexpensive storage that wo n’t be deployed as part of a cloud .
In either case , you ’re free to use the Storage Pod design above .
If you do , we would appreciate credit at Backblaze and welcome any insights , though this is n’t a requirement .
Please note that because we ’re not selling the design or the Storage Pods themselves , we provide no support nor warranties .
Coming next :
In the next few weeks , we ’ll talk about iPhone vibration sensors , Swiss cheese Pod designs , why electricity costs more than bandwidth , and more about the design of big cloud storage .
Credits and Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
The Backblaze Storage Pod design would not have been possible without an enormous amount of help , usually requested with little notice , from some amazingly smart and generous people who answered our questions , worked with us , and provided key insights at critical moments .
First , we thank Chris Robertson for the inspiration to build our own storage and his early work on prototypes ; Kurt Schaefer for advice on metal work and the concept of “ furniture ” for circuit boards ; Dominic Giampaolo from Apple Computer for his advice on hard drives , vibration , and certifications ; Stuart Cheshire from Apple Computer and Nick Tingle from Alcatel - Lucent for low - level network advice ; Aaron Emigh ( EVP & GM , Core Technology ) at Six Apart for his help on initial design work ; Gary Orenstein for insight into drive reliability and the storage industry in general ; Jonathan Beck for invaluable advice on vibration , fans , cooling , and case design ; Steve Smith ( Senior Design Manager ) , Imran Pasha ( Director of Software Engineering ) , and Alex Chervet ( Director of Strategic Marketing ) at Silicon Image who helped us debug SATA protocol problems and loaned us 10 different SATA cards to test against ; James Lee at Chyang Fun Industries in Taiwan for customizing SATA boards to simplify our design ; Wes Slimick , Richard Crockett , Don Shields , and Robert Knowles from Western Digital for their help debugging Western Digital drive logs ; Christa Carey , Jennifer Hurd , and Shirley Evely at Protocase for putting up with hundreds of small 3 - D case design tweaks ; Chester Yeung at Central Computer for coming through quickly and repeatedly with locally supplied parts when it really mattered ; Mason Lee at Zippy for power supply advice and custom wiring harnesses ; and Angela Lai for knowing just the right people and providing gracious introductions .
Finally , we thank the thousands of engineers who slaved away for millions of hours to bring us the Pod components that are either inexpensive or totally free , such as the Intel Processor , Gigabit Ethernet , ridiculously dense hard drives , Linux , Tomcat , JFS , etc .
We realize we ’re standing on the shoulders of giants .

Three judges have been shot dead at a court in China 's southern Hunan province by a man armed with a submachine gun , reports say .
Three other judges were injured before the man , who was also carrying two more weapons , killed himself .
Officials told the BBC the attacker was a 46 - year - old local man who worked as head of security at a post office .
Correspondents say shootings are relatively rare in China , as few people have access to firearms .
The shooting happened during just before 1000 ( 0200 GMT ) at the Lingling District People 's Court , said Xinhua .
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai says the man , named by officials as Zhu Jun , had reportedly borrowed his weapons from a colleague saying he needed to inspect them .
He barged into an office at the courtroom and opened fire on the officials .
A spokesman for the local propaganda department told the Associated Press news agency the judges had been discussing a case unrelated to the gunman .
Xinhua said the man had been motivated by revenge - he was reported to have divorced his wife three years ago and was unhappy at the way the court divided their wealth .
China has seen a series of knife attacks in school in recent weeks which have left 17 people dead and dozens injured .
The country has in the past had a comparatively low rate of violent crime , meaning the recent violence has been all the more shocking .
I Lost My Only Son in the War : Prelude to the Okinawan Anti-Base Movement 戦争でわたしの一人むすこも戦死しました — — 沖縄基地反対運動への序曲 C. Douglas Lummis and Ahagon Shoko June 7 , 2010 Volume 8 | Issue 23 | Number 1 Article ID 3369 I Lost My Only Son in the War : Prelude to the Okinawan Anti-Base Movement Ahagon Shoko and C. Douglas Lummis Translated and Introduced by C. Douglas Lummis
The following is a translation of parts of Chapters 1 and 2 of Ahagon Shoko ’s Beigun to Nomin ( GIs and Farmers ) ( 1973 , Iwanami Shinsho ) .
It describes the beginnings of the struggle between the farmers of Iejima ( a small island just off the main island of Okinawa ) and the US military which was trying to confiscate their land .
Ahagon ’s memory is revered in Okinawa as the leader of that movement , though he denied that he played that role .
Ahagon Shoko was born in 1903 ( or “ probably ” so ; according to him his father may have changed the date on his birth records to save him from the draft ) in a village on the Motobu Peninsula of Okinawa Island .
His family was poor but educated , and claimed an aristocratic background .
From an early age he showed himself to be a restless spirit .
Seeking an education he traveled as far as Kyoto , worked for a time for a minister there , and converted to Christianity at age 17 .
At 22 he traveled to Cuba , escaped from the exploitive company that recruited him , and worked in the sugar fields there for five years , followed by another five years in Peru .
Back in Okinawa , he moved to the island of Iejima , just off the tip of Motobu Peninsula , and opened a small general store , which apparently prospered .
According to his own account , he was considered something of a crank in those days .
Then the war came : on April 16 , 1945 , the allied forces invaded Iejima Island , and in the ensuing battle half of the residents were killed .
The following selection begins there .
In this translation the names of the Americans are retranslated phonetically from the Japanese , and so there is no way to be sure of the spelling .
‘ Sheehan ’ and ‘ Johnson ’ are probably correct , as is ‘ Captain Hook ’ ( though it seems too good to be true ) .
On the other hand ‘ Cox ’ might be ‘ Koch ’ , and ‘ Rabbit ’ seems unlikely , though it ’s interesting to think of one of these GIs as a character from an Updike novel .
The person referred to as the Chairman was the titular head of the mostly powerless Okinawan government , which at that time operated under the rule of the US Military .
C. Douglas Lummis
I lost my only son in the war .
Although he was n't old enough yet he was conscripted and taken to Urasoe on the main island , where he was killed .
The details are not clear .
My wife says she still has the feeling that he will come home , and she is not yet resigned … .
Also my brother in law , my wife 's grandmother and grandfather , brothers and sisters and many other relatives were killed .
Of the 1500 households on Iejima , there is hardly one in which there were no victims .
In no household do they talk of the war .
It was so painful that merely recalling it is enough to make you lose consciousness .
The villagers of Iejima were made prisoners and taken to the Kerama Islands .
That was where that devil , Captain Akamatsu , had given the command for mass suicide .
Six young people from Iejima were among Akamatsu 's victims .
They were ordered by the U.S. military to go to Akamatsu 's camp under a white flag with a proposal that he surrender , but Akamatsu arrested them and killed them on the spot .
We learned this from the fact that they never came back , and also from information we got from survivors .
From Kerama we were moved to Nakijin , and then to Motobu and Ishikawa .
And then , whenever the GIs at Motobu and Ishikawa moved , the villagers again had to move with them .
Finally in March , 1947 we were returned to Toimi on Iejima , but were able to return to our homes at Maja only at the end of that year .
Of the about 100 households at Maja before the war , only 75 returned .
But we put the suffering of the war behind us and turned our energies to farming , and since we had on the average one hectare of farmland per family , as compared to an average six and a half tsubo on the main island , we were comparatively well off , and putting this advantage to good use we raised our productivity higher than the other villages on the island , and for four years between 1949 and 1952 we received the first prize flag from the Industrial Exhibition ( 産業共進会） 。 Maja was well on its way to recovery , and to a settled life .
We thought , let 's forget the war , it is enough if we have peace .
It was just then that an unhappiness equal to war , an unhappiness even greater than war , came to Maja .
The basis for our troubles had already been set up before we got back .
Unbeknownst to the farmers of Iejima , while we were away 63 % of the island had been confiscated by the U.S. military for their use .
Three airstrips had been completed , including the one that had been originally built for the Japanese military .
With this accomplished , now the U.S. military wanted to pay the farmers consolation money [ in Japanese the ironic expression is namidakin : " tear money " ] and use the rest of the land they had confiscated as a training area .
Finally returning home in 1947 after a war experience so horrifying that no one would talk about it , then struggling against real starvation , finally achieving a recovery to normal life around 1953 , the farmers of Maja were able to enjoy the fruits of peace for only a fleeting moment .
Like the people of all of Okinawa , the farmers of Maja do not talk of the war .
Simply remembering is so painful it could drive you mad .
Similarly , people do not like to talk about the time after the war when the U.S. military invaded and took their land .
Everyone is silent about it .
The people of Maja fought back .
Ｍore than that , they suffered .
But now I must tell the story .
The Farmers of Maja and the Petition Regulation The Beginning of the Land Problem It was July 19 , 1953 .
A Nisei named Goto , who was with the land department of the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus , came to Maja saying that he was a land surveyor who had surveyed land in a variety of places including Korea , and that he had come to investigate the land at Maja .
He looked over the land and left .
I was away from the island when he came , but when I heard about his visit after I got back I thought nothing of it .
Then on July 24 he came back again to Iejima , saying he wanted to look at the land once more .
At that time the people of Maja still trusted the Americans , and so the Village Head Oshiro and seven other villagers cooperated and showed Goto around .
Then he asked them to put their seals on some English documents , saying that they would be paid later for their day 's work , and they affixed their seals without any suspicion .
Later they were astounded to discover that the documents were agreements to evacuate their land , but at the time they had not the slightest idea that this is what the documents were .
There is a background to this .
During the war we were taught the slogan " destroy the English and American devils " , and that while to die at home lying on a tatami mat was a dog 's death , if we died on the battlefield we would be worshipped in Yasukuni shrine .
If we were taken prisoner we would have our eyes and noses gouged out and then be massacred .
Pretty girls would be assaulted , and so for them to be killed right away by their parents with a hatchet or a club would be a happiness - and in fact there were some parents who killed their daughters .
But then when the war ended the American Pacification Unit came , and not only did they not cut off our arms and legs , they handed out canned goods , smiling like former Ambassador Reischauer , and protected us from the unpredictable GIs .
The farmers , who until then had been treated like dirt , for the first time came to see value in American democracy and in the words of Lincoln .
America had won , so there would be no more war , whereas if Japan had won there would have been war again .
In the Battle of Okinawa which began in April , 1945 , on Iejima with its population of 7500 , 1500 civilians , 2000 Japanese soldiers and 800 American soldiers were killed , in a situation so cruel you can only avert your eyes .
Starving in the ditches , where we were attacked by fleas and lice , it was beyond imagining .
Only if there is no war , everything will be fine .
At the time I was a blind believer who was happy to believe in the Americans , and when my brother , who had been to college , said that there was something wrong with American colonial policy , and that it was going to bring us trouble , at that time I had no idea what he was talking about .
But I began to understand when , in June , 1954 the U.S. military , saying " We will allow you to continue farming , if you suffer any losses we will compensate you , this will not interfere with your life , rather with the compensation money you will live better , " gave the Maja families of Chinen Kokichi and Chinen Hana , and the Nishisaka families of Gima Matsuzo and Shimabukuro Koko five days to evacuate their homes and move to specified locations .
Site of the bulldozed Ahagon family home .
The places that the four families were ordered to evacuate to were not far from where they lived .
We only learned it later , but apparently this was a test by the U.S. military to see how much resistance there would be to relocation .
At the time they gave no reason for the evacuation order , and I did n't believe that they were going to use that location as a training area .
In those days the farmers were still innocent , and while they inclined their heads and asked , " I wonder what they are going to use it for ? " they believed that , if they resisted the U.S. military , Iejima would never recover , and that rations distributed by the GIs would be cut off , whereas villages that cooperated would be favored and would recover quickly .
And so the four families of landowners ( the owners of the property ) uneasily agreed to evacuate , and not a single person in Maja objected .
However when the promised generous payment for moving turned out to be a mere 20,000 yen , and the landowners took their claim to the Civil Administration , they were turned away with the comment , " 20,000 yen is plenty compared to 5000 yen . "
And though they were told they were free to continue farming , not only were they not free to farm , every time they planted something it would be burned up in the military exercises .
This was the beginning of the land problem .
After that the situation developed rapidly , and our view of the U.S. military soon changed .
On September 27 of that year a military land advisor named Smith ( a big , rather charming fellow , tall , with a red face and white hair , in his forties ) and a land requisition officer named Sheehan ( fat , with a carefree face , contemptuous , who never got angry and never changed his opinion , in his thirties ) , along with an interpreter and two or three other soldiers came to the village office .
The interpreter was the nisei Goto , who had come before .
He was a large , dark skinned man around thirty , contemptuous of Okinawans and with a face that announced him as a citizen of the victorious country and bespoke of the heavy responsibility of acting in loyalty to America .
When he entered the office he said [ in broken Japanese ]
" Good morning everybody , how are you , Iejima girls very good looking , I like , I take Okinawa girl for wife " and so on , joking , singing , dancing .
And to the landowners , " You farming too hard , take money go to Naha rent house , eat good food , get rich easy , farming no good , your head be potato head " and on and on , frolicking and dancing around the office .
I was reminded of the cruel method used in the days of Lincoln , where the slavemaster Legree along with Sambo and Kimbo would sing and dance at the slave market to liven up the slaves so they could be sold at better prices .
On that day the military , through interpreter Goto , informed village head Oshiro Takekichi that they were requisitioning 1,500,000 tsubo , an area 5000 feet in radius , and that 152 families were to evacuate their homes immediately .
( Later the military said it was 3000 feet ; their figures were haphazard . )
Seven days later , on October 4 , seven GIs came .
They always came by airplane .
At that time the city office was a forty - tsubo building built after the war out of American lumber , the roof was made of shards of red tile that had been broken during the war .
Inside was a single bare room with no partitions , and the tables , chairs and bookcases were all junk thrown away by the US military .
Still , it had a wooden floor , and villagers and employees always took their shoes off before entering , but the US soldiers always came in with their shoes on .
They were truly unmannerly , and somehow threatening .
At one o'clock , with a map of Iejima spread out on the table , and through a small interpreter , 24 or 25 years old , who barely spoke Japanese and who could have been Japanese or Korean , we had the following conversation .
Present were six from the U.S. military , the Village Head and his assistant , five from Maja including the Township Head , and six from Nishisaki .
I was among those from Maja .
All the memos and records from that meeting have been preserved , and so it is possible now , twenty years later , to give an accurate account of what took place .
Military : ( pointing his finger at the map )
This area is going to be used by the military , so no agricultural products are to be brought in .
Everything on the ground that is within this red line should be taken outside .
Village Head :
Take it outside , and what should we do then ?
Military : We 'll tell you later .
Concerning assessment of value , we 'll decide that later .
That you will evacuate is decided .
What you do next , we 'll tell you later .
The military assesses money for moving expenses only .
Do n't think you are going to get more .
Expenses for moving graves we see at 100 % .
Expenses for moving water tanks we see at 100 % .
You can take them out .
The military has done evacuations many times , our assessments are accurate .
Village Head : Outside of here there is n't any other land , so it will be hard to move out .
Military : ( pointing on the map to a place on the north shore where the Japanese military had an ammunition dump during the war )
What is this ?
Village Head :
You can't farm there .
There is no water , and the ground is stones ; it 's not a place where you can make fields .
Military :
If it is hard to live make a plan and inform the Civil Administration .
We understand that it is hard .
Find fields where you can farm and let them know .
The military land survey will be done on the fifteenth of this month .
Can we meet with your representatives on the fifteenth at the Judicial Department of the Ryukyu Government ?
What time will be good ？
Village Head :
The fifteenth between two and three will be fine .
And we request that there be no evacuation .
Military : That is impossible .
Thank you for your help in our survey of the village .
Saying this , the soldiers left in their airplane a little after four .
This was an emergency .
On the fifteenth , VIllage Head Oshiro and officials from Maja and Nishisaka left for the government offices carrying a petition requesting discontinuance of the evacuation .
When they arrived in Naha they went without eating to meet with the Chief Secretary , the Home Affairs Secretary , and the Chairman of the Military Land Federation .
All promised to " do their best to achieve a good result " .
This was the first time anyone from Iejima had come to the government offices since the war , and they also visited the legislature building .
But they discovered that the people who until then they had thought were great figures displayed in their words and in their actions a fear of the military and avoided making a clear statement , which made them feel chagrined , and made them think that these people were to be pitied rather than to be counted on .

When we learned that the petition we had brought earlier had not yet been translated , but was stuck in a drawer from which the official there took it out for us , the irresponsibility of this , and the fear it showed of the US military , disillusioned us greatly .
The party that arrived back at Iejima from Naha at six that evening held a meeting at the Nishisaki township office .
In that 12 tsubo office with its walls full of holes the whole village gathered , but only half could get inside , so people stood in the doorway and outside under the eaves .
We were amazed to discover that the government does n't know anything about the Iejima land problem .
We should n't think that just because we lost the war we can't stand up to the US military ; we have to solve this problem no matter how much negotiation it takes .
The land right is with the landowners , and whether we evacuate or not is something we will decide .
After these and other impressions and opinions were given the meeting was opened up for questions .
Q : Has there been a meeting in the legislature on the land problem ?
A : Not yet .
( Someone says " The Village Head is n't trying hard enough . " )
Q : I heard that after the land survey the GIs went around telling people to put their stamps on documents , but is that true ?
A : That is true .
The GIs who said they were done with the survey and the interpreter went around coercing people .
The meeting adjourned at eight in a mood of uneasiness .
The problem became bigger , deeper , and more pressing .
On October 7 Oyama , chairman of the Ryukyu Government 's Land Committee and eight members of the legislature came to the island and held a meeting at the Nishisaka township office .
The villagers all made appeals to them .
In those days everybody was wearing US military " darky clothes " ( that 's what we called them ) and nobody was shaved .
The following is extracted from the record of that meeting .
Oshiro Man'ichi ( 52 , Nishisaka ) : Last June the US military bulldozed under 3000 tsubo of sugar cane , sweet potatos and soybeans .
This has put ten families into great trouble .
The US military made a survey for compensation , but so far no one has received one mon of money .
Ishikawa Kiyotomi ( 62 , Maja ) :
They do military exercises without telling anyone , and bombs are dropping everywhere .
Still we are not going to evacuate this place , so please appeal to the military not to evacuate us .
Asato Shoei ( 58 , Maja , an outstanding farmer ) :
After losing the war and experiencing every kind of suffering , just when we had the happiness of being able to return to the island and to a settled life then again this happens .
We will not be able to give our children an education .
Please , allow us to live .
I beg of you .
Chinen Kokichi ( 28 , Maja .
He had been a Soviet prisoner of war in Manchuria , and then , while imprisoned in the Soviet Union , jimmied open a lock with a nail and escaped the day before he was to be executed .
Originally from Ibaragi Prefecture , a member of the Manchurian Volunteers ) :
The only time we can be in our fields is before eight in the morning before military exercises start , and in the evening after four .
That is n't even enough time to pick the crops that are ready for harvest .
3000 tsubo of watermelon fields were burned up by bombs , but I have n't gotten one mon from the military .
Their behavior is unbearable .
Ahagon Shoko ( 52 , Maja ) : Begging your pardon , we farmers understand nothing about orders and directives , but we need to stay alive .
We would like to cooperate with the military , alive .
As to humanity and morality , I think there is no difference between America and Okinawa .
So I ask you in the legislature , please follow that way when you speak .
The landowners , men and women together , entreated , " Please , please " with pathetic voices , and then trudged heavily back to their homes .
When Ahagon said we know nothing of orders and directives , he was speaking the truth .
At that time we had not read the orders and directives issued by the military ; we had n't even known that they existed .
The response that Oyama Chojo , Chair of the Legislature 's Special Committee on Land , gave to the farmers ’ pleas was deliberately vague : " You should think it over well , and then either look for some place to move to , or else , if you are going to stay - I have to mention that possibility - then I can't tell you what you should do . "
The next morning , after seeing the government officers off at the wharf , the township officials gathered and consulted on what to do .
1 . It is because we put too much trust in the U.S. military that we are facing this problem .
That is the cause of it .
2 . We will ask the Chairman to come to the island himself , see the problem with his own eyes and hear the voices of the landowners directly .
And we will ask him to explain to us the meaning of the orders and directives .
3 . We will carry out our petition in a legal and humanitarian manner .
We will keep our solidarity to the end , and no matter what happens , fight on to protect our land , so as not to be evicted from it .
Looking again at the notes I took at the time , I see that in addition to the facts I recorded there is writing in red ink between the lines .
I do n't remember which parts I wrote then and which later , but anyway that is something I can't leave out of this account .
For example on the same day , October 8 , on the four o'clock passage from Toguchi of the village - owned boat Iemaru , there arrived the Interior Affairs Bureau Chief of the Ryukyu Government Miyasato Sho , the Administrative Section Chief Noha Tojiro , the Administrative Secretary Nakamoto Choi , the General Affairs Section Chief Kakazu Saburo , as well as reporters from the Okinawa Times and the Ryukyu Shimpo .
They met with the Village Head and people from both townships , but where I wrote down the Interior Minister 's initial greeting there is written between the lines in red ink , " The greeting was form only , showing no sincere sympathy . "
And the following outline of the greeting by Administrative Section Chief Noha is written entirely in red ink : " We can well imagine your feelings .
And we can not but feel sympathy .
We have no words with which to apologize to you .
If we look for the cause of this unhappiness , I think we will find that the fault lies in the war .
The government wants to do all that it can , but please understand the position the government is in now .
Please understand the position Okinawa is in , and do n't only worry , but also act .
Just now I was scolded for offering only tears of sympathy , but I am sincere .
Forgive me .
I will communicate your wishes directly to the Chairman .
Please take care of yourselves . "
The talk of " tears of sympathy " was a response to Ishikawa Seiken of Maja , who was unhappy with the government and who had shouted angrily , " We do n't need your tears of sympathy !
We want to appeal directly to the Chairman and to the U.S. Military and bring these evictions to a halt ! "
Noha 's response to this - " I am sincere " - was half sincere and half evasive .
The next day the Bureau and Section Chiefs were taken in a farm co-op truck on an inspection tour of the two townships , guided by the Township Heads and other representatives .
They visited Ujabaru , Gohezubaru , Yamanakabaru , and Kijakubaru , and saw that all the land that could be cultivated had been cultivated by its owners , and all the rest was covered with stones because of the airport construction .
It was made clear that there was no other place for the people of Maja and Nishizaki to live or to farm .
Chief Noha and the others were forced to recognize that this was so , and had no words in response .
Trapped between the farmers and the military , they set themselves to trying to soften up the farmers .
Oct. 12 , 12:30 .
At the Village Office there was a meeting of members of the Village Council , the Village Land Committee , and some of the officials from the two townships .
The Chair of the Village Council Tamashiro ( later to become Village Head ) addressed the group , saying that the seizure of land was a concern of the entire village ; that the whole village should rise up and join together in support of the petition , so as to bring it to a halt .
The Chair of the Land Committee Maeda Kosuke ( 64 ) said , " We in the Council and the Land Committee were surprised to learn about this only the day before yesterday .
This is a huge problem for the Village . "
So finally the land problem of Maja and Nishizaka Townships became a problem for the village as a whole .
Then they all got in the farm co-op truck and drove out to Toimibaru in Maja , which the Military wanted to take as a firing range .
In the area they wanted there were fields green with sugar cane , wheat and potatoes , there were forested hills and uncultivated fields to provide material for compost and feed for animals and firewood .
One after the other the Council and Committee members criticized the Military 's highhandedness , saying , " You come out here , your stomach is full without even eating , correct ?
If we owned this land , we would never leave it .
The Military is talking irresponsible nonsense .
We have to use the strength of the whole village to stop them . "
( In the notes I took at the time , everything after " There were fields green with sugar cane " is written in red ink .
It is because between the peaceful ways of farmers and the violent ways of soldiers there is a contradiction , and that was the essence of the problem . )
When we got back to the Nishizaki Township office many people were gathered there .
After a few words from Village Head Oshiro , we were given the following explanation from the Ryukyu Government ’s Industrial Section Chief Tamashiro Tetsuo : According to the notification from the U.S. military , 78 families ( that is , all families ) were to be evacuated from Maja , and 74 ( from a total of 142 ) from Nishizaki , for a total of 152 evacuations .
Evacuation investigations had been completed for 116 families .
Everyone felt that the problem was rapidly closing in .
Council Chair Tamashiro addressed the group as follows : " The first time the Village Council was given official notice of this was October 10 .
We had no idea that the matter would become this big .
This is a truly serious problem , for which we have no precedent .
" The land that the Military is scheduled to confiscate amounts to 1,700,000 tsubo .
Within that 488,000 tsubo are under cultivation .
In addition it includes forested hills and fields that are essential to farmers .
The Council 's position is that it will petition in accordance with your will .
Everything depends on the will of the landowners .
We believe that Chairman Higa will do his utmost .
We also expect that the CIC will be coming around , so please exercise great caution ; we do n't want anyone being led astray by the CIC .
The farmers cried out one after another , " We are standing on the boundary between life and death !
Taking a farmer away from the land is like taking a fish out of water - there is nothing left but to die ! "
On October 13 at 5 pm Kuwae Choko , Chair of the General Land Committee of the Ryukyu Government , the Vice Chair and three other officials arrived on the island .
A meeting with the landowners was held at Nishizaki .
The more contact there was with the outside , the more chances the farmers had to express their opinions , and to organize their thoughts and put them to the test .
Namisato of Maja ( this old man later threw himself in front of a US military bulldozer with his hands joined in prayer , was beaten , tied up with rough straw rope , then wrapped in a blanket so the rope could n't be seen and taken to the military court at Kadena ) made the following appeal : " I have a family of seven , and everything has been destroyed right to the middle of our fields .
Now we have neither tea nor tobacco .
Soon the winter winds will come .
I am no longer afraid of bullets . "
Chinen Hirokichi of Maja took up Old Man Namisato ’s words and declared , " If we are afraid of bullets , then our whole families will die . "
Oshiro Yukichi of Nishizaka asked , " Is it better to have a lot of landowner 's names on the petition ? "
But Chairman Kuwae said , " That I can not answer . "
In my notes the following is added in red ink : " As for clothing , government officers , legislators , Land Liaison Committee members all came to the island dressed up splendidly in the garb of officials complete with neckties , yielding nothing to the Americans .
This was because the U.S. military in Okinawa judged people 's character by their clothes .
But whether it was to impress the Americans or whether it was to keep up their dignity before the farmers , their appearance seemed wasted on the ragged and emaciated farmers , and was completely out of harmony .
" The farmers , on the other hand , were all dressed about the same .
They were all happy to wear floppy GI hand - me - down " darkie clothes " .
Or rather , they were not at all conscious of what they were wearing .
Nor did they pay any attention to what the officials were wearing .
They only gazed fixedly at the face and the eyes of the speaker in a spirit of entreaty , with nothing at all in their minds but whether it was possible for the seizure of their land to be prevented .
" The women had their hair tied up artlessly with old towels ; there was not one with a permanent wave .
Eight out of ten , both men and women , were barefoot .
Four - , five - , ten - year old children , and also middle - school youths , sharing the fear and anxiety of the adults , surrounded the officials and listened silently .
" There was no table anywhere , and the officials spoke standing with the people crowding at their feet and looking up at them .
The officials carried out their responsibility without energy or confidence or hope , and the words they forced themselves to say had neither warmth nor sincerity . "
After Chairman Kuwae and the others left , the villagers remained and talked over the best way to present their petition to the Military two days hence .
1 . Keep your eyes on the GIs at all times .
2 . Keep your spirit keyed up .
3 . Engage in no idle talk with the soldiers while the talks are going on .
4 . Maintain good manners .
5 . If a solution is reached , we should pay calls on Interior Department Chief Miyasato , Administration Section Chief Noha , Chairman Kuwae , the members of the Special Committee on Military Lands , and others to convey our thanks .
These and other ideas were discussed , and the meeting broke up late that night .
The next day , October 14 after 5 pm , five Americans and an Interpreter named Shimabukuro came to Ahagon 's house saying they were Christian missionaries , spent about 15 minutes there making small talk , and left .
Ahagon supposed they were probably CIC , but gave no more thought to it .
The Meeting with the Military October 15 , 1954 .
Fair .
The day arrives when the petition is to be delivered to the Military .
At 9 am , led by Village Head Oshiro , about 80 men and women from both townships boarded the two village - owned boats , Iemaru and Iemaru II .
They were wearing mostly GI surplus clothes , shod variously in rubber boots , army boots and geta , and carrying bundles wrapped in cloth .
When we arrived at the harbor at Toguchi about 40 minutes later , two buses that had been sent by the government were waiting .
For many of the farmers this was the first time that they had ridden on a bus .
After returning to Iejima from the US prison camps at Kerama and Henoko , they had been busy working to restore both their own lives and village life , and there had been no opportunity to leave the island , nor reason to do so .
There were some who had never even seen a bus before .
No doubt the government expected that as soon as the farmers got on the buses they would go into an ecstatic trance , and forget all about the present business of carrying a petition to the Military .
The Village Head and the other leaders kept silent , their faces somber .
Now they were going into the fight .
What should they do , who had never fought the Military before ?
What kind of place would it be ?
What should they say ?
With their minds fully occupied with what was to come in three hours , by the time they got to the US base at Kadena they were in a daze .
Driving by this airbase , the pride of the military , said to have no equal inside the US , they felt they were passing by a foreign country .
At 1 pm they arrived at Naha .
Many of the women were seasick and carsick .
Carrying their cloth - wrapped bundles on their arms and led by the Village Head , the group arrived at the government building .
The Village Head inquired at the Chairman ’s office , and learned that the meeting was to be on the third floor .
But when they started up the stairs , they were told that only the Village Head and one representative of the landowners would be allowed up , and that all the rest would have to wait downstairs .
To this the people raised a protest , saying it was too cruel to keep them out after they had come all the way from an outer island with a petition , and demanded to be let in .
Finally six representatives were admitted , while the rest were told to wait downstairs .
At 2 pm the meeting began .
There was Judge Cox from the US Civil Administration and , together with Captain Hook about ten from the Military , all in uniform and lined up ominously .
The Village Head and the others , in their ragged clothes , sat down .
They were filled with anxiety , but their determination never to let go of their land shone in their eyes .
From the Ryukyu Government there was the Chairman , the Chief of the Judicial Department , and Administrative Section Chief , and also some newspaper reporters .
We learned later that the Chairman had been told by the Civil Administration that he need not come , but that he had insisted on coming anyway .
The interpreter was an American woman , about 27 or 28 .
The meeting began .
As one of the US military men made an opening statement , the people who had been left downstairs could be seen crowding outside the glass door , silently gazing at the proceedings within .
The interpreter spoke .
Interpreter :
As for the purpose for which the land is to be used , it is to be used for the defense of the Ryukyus .
We want to hear from the Village Head what plans you have made for evacuation .
Village Head : I will answer that after I have heard an explanation from the Military .
Civil Administration :
At first we only evicted one part [ indicates four houses ] but only that is not enough to ensure safety , and that is the reason for the present problem .
When we realized the danger we expanded the number of evictions .
We want to hear what plans the Village Head has made to deal with this problem , and after hearing that we will think about what to do .
At the present moment , nothing is clearly decided concerning the evictions .
Nothing is decided at present , but we made an investigation for the purpose of learning what demands would arise , and what kind of aid we should offer , should the time come .
Now I request the Village Head to tell us what you want to tell us .
( The US Military always says things that make no sense .
Their strategy is to say nothing clearly , use up the time , and send you away . )
Village Head :
When the Air Force told the landowners it wanted to use their land , we answered that if we leave there is no other land for us to go to .
Civil Administration : Neither on the island or off the island ?
Village Head :
That is right .
Civil Administration :
What about off the island ?
Village Head :
There are children and old people among us , and we are not going anywhere .
If we were to move it would amount to close to 1000 people .
This is not a matter that can be dealt with by a village head , and so we are asking for the intervention of Chairman Higa .
Civil Administration :
If you have no clear plans for evacuation either on or off the island , then stay where you are .
Continue cultivating your fields until our plans are clear .
At this time we will not say that you must evacuate .
Continue cultivating your fields as before .
Mr. Ogden [ the military Vice - Commander ] and Mr. Johnson [ the Civil Administrator ] often accept difficult situations .
Village Head :
If there is no eviction , there is nothing to be said .
Civil Administration :
There is no eviction order at present , but we want you to make plans for what to do in the event that one is issued in the near future .
Military Land Officer :
At the Land Office we have not yet received any eviction papers .
Air Force :
If the landowners insist on continuing to live there despite the danger , what will you as Village Head do when actual danger comes ?
Village Head : I will look into that .
Air Force : On October 4 I came and spoke at the Iejima Village Office representing the Air Force .
And I want to thank you for taking the trouble to come here today .
You will remember that at that time I said that the Air Force wants to use , plans to use , that land .
And the [ evacuation ] plan that we asked you to make at that time , did you bring it ?
Village Head : As Village Head I was not able to go into that question .
Air Force :
We want you to think about what you are going to do when the time comes to evacuate .
The meeting ended at 4 pm .
The farmers group then went to the public hall at Sakae - cho in Mawashi City ( now part of Naha ) that had been rented by the Ie Village Association in Naha .
In the plaza in front of the hall Oshiro reported the contents of the meeting to the people who had been kept waiting outside .
" We have understood from today 's meeting that the Civil Administration exists for the sake of the people .
And the Air Force thinks only of the Military .
But in the end the Military said we can continue using our homes and fields as before .
Judging from what they said , I think the Air Force has other plans , so please put your full energy back into farming .
" In dealing with this problem you landowners have acted with true sincerity , and I think the gods have understood this and have given us their answer .
" After the meeting when I met with Chairman Higa , he told me that if we take this problem to any of the political parties that will only confuse things and make a solution more difficult .
But if we leave it up to the government it can be solved more quickly .
I believe his words have an important meaning , and I think we should trust him and count on his efforts . "
The Village Head sent a telegram to the Village Office saying , " Solved .
Be at ease .
Village Head . "
The landowners rejoiced as if in a dream , and could not sleep that night .
But it turned out that this was unfounded , what we call " rejoicing over rice bran . "
Before a month had passed we received another eviction notice from the Military , and realized for the first time that we had been deceived .
The Petition Regulations I want to set down with as much detail as possible the events between the April eviction of four households and the November Petition Regulations .
During the war we were treated brutally by the Japanese military .
As a result of that , we at first saw America as the country of democracy , the country where Lincoln had lived , and we trusted it .
At first , even when we could n't understand the Military 's orders and directives , even when we confronted them in meetings , we thought that though the Military was fearsome the US Civil Administration must be on our side .
I myself also thought so .
I had blind faith in them .
But little by little , as America betrayed us , our eyes were opened .
Again and again we were betrayed , until in our rage we thought , we can retreat no more .
Though not in the way the government meant during the war , they are devils after all .
They bite .
We must take care not to be bitten .
If they are devils , how should we fight them ?
If they are beasts , we are humans , and beasts are no match for humans .
We will teach them what humans are .
I learned from America .
When they want something , they try one means after another to get it .
Sometimes they come as devils , sometimes as angels , sometimes as snakes .
They put on a performance .
So we must also use one means after another to protect our land .
At first we believed that if we approached them in full sincerity we would get through to them .
But then two missionaries disliked by the Military , Rickard and Burberry , came to Iejima and told us , " The military decides everything on the basis of what it needs and what it does n't need , on the basis of their own gain and loss . "
After that we began to learn how to get the better of them .
When they came to the island and spoke wildly about how they would kill us with poison gas or shoot us down with guns , we went directly to the newspaper office and had their words published , making the devil 's behavior public and bringing shame down on the US military .
It is because we fought that we learned these things .
If we had n't fought , our minds might have stopped in the same place as that of Yokoi Shoichi , the former Japanese soldier who was found hiding in the jungle in Guam in 1972 .
Or maybe we would have been even worse .
From the day after the meeting with the military , the farmers went back to cultivating their land , which had been uncared for since September and was getting overgrown with weeds .
And , filled with hope , they began repairing their houses and opening new fields on land that had been trampled hard under US encampments during the war , land where each tsubo yielded a wagonload of stones .
Then just a month later , on November 15 at 3 pm , the US Military Land Officer Sheehan and an interpreter came to the Village Office .
The Village Head was not there .
Sheehan :
If the Village Head is n't here I can't go into details , but we came today to do an investigation .
Do you have the name list from the last investigation ?
Assistant Village Head : The Village Head is not here , and I do n't know .
In the future please do n't come here directly , but talk to the Chairman first .
That is the proper legal procedure .
Sheehan : I 've already talked to the Prime Minister , but I came here today to give the Village Head directly some advance warning .
That 's the reason I came .
The farmers from both townships were outraged , and wondered whether the Military had deceived them or whether they had forgotten the promise they had made a month before .
That night both townships held meetings and decided that if another land survey began they would come out in full force to prevent it .
And they also appointed a group to take another petition to the government the next day .
The members were [ list of names follows ] .
The next day this group first visited Isahama at Ginowan Village ( now a city ) in the center of Okinawa Main Island , which had had a land problem before Iejima did .
There they met with Village Councilman Takashi Yasuyoshi , who had been at the center of the opposition struggle , to learn from him about methods of protest .
There they learned how the Military had used every kind of strategy - showing up early in the morning or in the middle of the night , threatening and coaxing , trying to deceive people by giving them presents .
The group from Iejima were relieved to hear that if the US Military arrested people they did not execute them .
( But later when the US dispatched troops to Iejima , this [ minimal ] confidence of the villagers of Isahama and Iejima was proved to have been misguided . )
On the 17th the protest group arrived at the Ryukyu government offices .
At 9 am Village Head Oshiro and Section Chief Noha climbed the stairs to meet with Sheehan .
They returned about forty minutes later , looking worried .
With an anxious face Oshiro told us , " A terrible thing has happened .
Yesterday the Military went to the Island to make a survey , and 400 people came out to obstruct them , and pulled up the survey stakes .
I have just been given a very angry reprimand by the Military . "
Noha sat with his body wilted and his head drooping , saying nothing .
Ahagon said , " Well , this sounds serious .
But I do n't believe that the people of Iejima really obstructed the survey .
I think they must have tried to make an appeal .
I do n't believe that those mild - mannered people could stand up to the Military .
There must be some mistake , so please do n't worry . "
At that time I did n't know the word " provocation " , but I thought there was something suspicious going on .
That afternoon we met Miyasato , the Interior Minister of the Ryukyu Government .
Miyasato :
If the Japanese Military had been obstructed like that , it would have meant real trouble .
You have to look at the good side of the American Military .
Landowner :
We do n't want the American Military to be like those militarists who ruined the country .
Miyasato :
You are not on an equal footing with them , so it would be better if you let them do the survey .
Landowner : We understand .
We will return and see what happened .
All we want to do is to preserve our lives .
We have no thought of obstruction or bargaining .
The landowners remembered what had happened before .
Their earlier petition had ended up stuck in a drawer , so they could not count on this one receiving better treatment .
So they went to the Administrative Section and asked what had happened to it .
The workers in the section all began rushing around looking for it , and finally found it in somebody 's drawer .
The landowners were rendered speechless with amazement and disgust at the government 's irresponsibility and lack of interest .
We also could read clearly in the faces and attitudes of the government workers the fear that if they said anything kind to us and the Military found out about it they would lose their jobs .
November 20 , 9 am .
All the townspeople of Maja came to the town office to hear the result of the petition .
In those days there was one meeting after another .
In the process the people came to understand how crafty the US Military is , and also that the Ryukyu Government could not be depended upon .
At the same time their own resolve strengthened .
Oshiro , the Village Head , gave the following report : " First there was a meeting between me and the Administrative Section Chief and Smith and some others from the Military .
The meeting was closed , and no reporters or farmers were let in .
I was told that the military survey team had been obstructed by 400 farmers and that the survey could not be carried out .
The same thing was reported in the newspapers the next day , and so I apologized .
" The military said they sympathized with the farmers , but if you obstruct them it will not be in your interest in the long run .
Sunday is their day off , but they said they would be back on Monday to survey , and that we should not interfere . "
But then the real story of the " obstruction " was given by Nosato Takematsu ( a small , energetic old man with salt - and - pepper hair , from Maja ) .
On the 16th the survey was doing much damage to the crops , and so the farmers said to the interpreter , " Please stop .
Please call it off until the Village Head and the farmers ’ representatives get back . "
That was all .
It happened at the plaza , and they made the request sitting down , because they were hungry .
It was no more than an appeal : please let us live .
At the same meeting Ishikawa Seishoku ( white hair , about 70 ) said , " Rather than evict us it would be better if they would gather us all in one place and just kill us off all at once .
I want the Village Head to tell the military that . "
Ahagon spoke as follows .
" In carrying our petition this time , the Village Head has made efforts beyond the call of duty .
And he received a reprimand ; it has been a very hard time for him .
" I have been thinking .
Why was the Village Head reprimanded ?
Whose fault is it ?
It is the fault of the Military for trying to take away our precious land for nothing .
If they did n't take away our land we'd be too busy even to gather for meetings . "
Then after saying how disappointed he was at the irresponsibility of the government , he continued as follows .
" The position of the Chairman is like that old harlot 's song .
' Better than the love of the rich samurai is the love of this one , who loves from the heart . '
He has to obey the Military to keep his position and his livelihood , but also he can't just stand by and watch us die .
Remember this is Chairman Higa , who was a middle - school teacher before the war , and who is good at English .
Surely he does n't think it is all right for us Okinawan farmers to be killed .
But it has become a money world , and we can't expect him to work for us .
" Now friends , true cooperation means to cooperate with the just behavior of forever - prosperous America ; it does not mean to cooperate with the kind of militarization that brings the country down .
Perhaps some of you think it is futile to oppose the US Military , which even the Japanese Military could n't defeat .
But we have a teaching in the East .
The Sage says " 非理法権天 " : Unreason yields to reason , reason to law , law to power .
One should conduct oneself according to heaven ’s way .
I believe our resistance is just .
I believe that the gods and the Buddha will lend us strength .
Let us take courage based on our conviction , and protect our land . "
The villagers , clinging to hope in the midst of their anxiety , adjourned the meeting .
After that events began to move even more rapidly .
On November 22 and 9:30 am , US Military survey team leader Warrant Officer Rabbit and seven or eight others arrived by airplane .
Also two policemen、 and Police Officer Uehara who was stationed at Ie , the Village Head , Land Committee Chair Maeda , Council Chair Tamashiro , and many farmers from both townships were present .
The following exchange took place .
Beginning with the Village Head , all the farmers said , there is a petition under consideration right now , so please call off the survey .
But Rabbit refused , saying , " I have come all the way from Korea to Iejima to do this survey , and I have no authority to call it off .
I am only following orders . "
Finally Rabbit left for the survey site .
About 150 villagers gathered , broke up into groups of 14 or 15 people , and surrounded each member of the survey team and entreated them , " Please do n't do it , please , please . "
This continued until 3 pm , without a break for lunch .
Then somebody got the idea , how about expressing our request not only with words but with things .
So from the several households we gathered together about 40 or 50 eggs , and said , " Please listen to our request .
There are n't many , but these are raw eggs from our village .
The Military does n't have such a thing , does it ？
Please take them . "
Rabbit accepted them in good spirit , and immediately called off the survey .
The villagers were relieved , but made one more request .
" We want to meet the superior officer who gives you orders , but we have neither the money nor the energy to leave the island .
And even if we went to where your superior officer is , he would n't meet with us .
But we want to meet with him and have a good talk with him .
Could you please bring him here ?
" Rabbit 's obstinacy vanished , and he took on a friendly attitude .
" That will be easy , " he said .
" I can't do it tomorrow , but the day after tomorrow without fail I will bring you lots of superiors , so please wait for me . "
The farmers all bowed , and Rabbit left after four .
The farmers , exhausted and pale , saw him off .
However on the following day , one day before Rabbit 's " promise " , there was an eerie roar , a medium - sized airplane landed at one of Iejima 's three airstrips , and some GIs and a Japanese - American got out .
They looked too proud and arrogant to be a work team .
Some villagers greeted them with a " Good morning " , and asked them why they had come .
From the experiences that had been coming down on them one after another , the villagers knew they were dealing with " devils " .
But if they are devils , we are humans .
Humans offer greetings : " Good morning " when it is morning , " Good day " when it is midday , " Good evening " when it is evening .
So when we meet devils , let us offer them greetings too .
Let us greet them whether they respond or not .
This was the foundation , and the frame of mind , of the Iejima struggle .
And making these greetings often resulted in the GIs being quite beautifully entrapped by the farmers ' leading questions .
GI : We have no business with you .
We are different from yesterday 's survey team .
We came to deliver the communications troops on Iejima their pay .
And with that they walked arrogantly and affectedly over to the western quonset hut ( that 's their name for the kamaboko huts ) where the communications troops were housed .
The Village Head , the School Principal and the Council Head hurried after them .
And before ten minutes had passed they learned that these Americans who said , we have no business with you , we came to deliver paychecks , were in fact Walker , Kusumi Shoko and others of the Kadena Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) .
GI : We have come from Kadena OSI to investigate the incident of the 16th .
Who is it who pulled up survey stakes and obstructed the survey ?
If you do n't tell us you will all be in trouble .
But in the face of the facts given him by the Village Head and the farmers , Walker was in the end unable to fabricate a riot .
So in the end he said , " When we get back we will question the survey team again , but it does seem to be a fact that tires were slashed , " and with that exit line , departed .
The farmers were saddened by the Military 's attempt to change their entreaty into a case of violent obstruction , and also by the newspapers which , whether under military orders or whether they actually believed the military 's story , had written about the " obstruction incident " without knowing the situation or coming to look .
With pale faces and heavy steps , they returned to their homes .
But beyond that , this cheap and arrogant behavior of the Military , saying we have no business with you , we have come to deliver pay , and then ten minutes later saying we have come to investigate an obstruction incident , led the honest farmers to ask disgustedly , Is this the behavior of the American gentleman ?
And in the end it rid them of the last traces of their respect for the Americans , and replaced it with spite .
We farmers saw ourselves as having full value as first - class Japanese citizens , and were confident that , spiritually , we were far superior , and from that time forward we ceased to fear even the American high officials .
That afternoon after 1 pm a group of twenty - some people gathered at the home of the Nishizawa Township Head Oshiro Yukichi , and on the basis of what had happened so far , drew up a set of " Petition Regulations " .
Petition Regulations
* Do not become anti-American .
* Do not become angry and speak insultingly .
* Say nothing to the GIs other than what is necessary .
Behave properly .
Speak absolutely no lies or falsehoods .
* Always remain seated at meetings .
* When meeting with the US military , never carry baskets , sickles , sticks or anything else in your hands .
* Do not raise your hands above your ears .
( If we raise our hands they will say we used violence , and take photographs . )
* Never raise your voice ; speak quietly .
* Always negotiate in the spirit and attitude of humanity , morality and religion .
Do not be led astray by orders and directives based on mistaken law , but always make your appeal on the basis of what is right .
* Never be afraid of the Military .
* Hold fast to the conviction that we farmers , as producers , are superior in humanity to the soldiers , and maintain the frame of mind that it us up to us to educate the soldiers , who are destroyers .
* These regulations , which are for the purpose of winning our appeal , are to be maintained to the end .
The above is hereby agreed .
The landowners of Maja and Nishizaka .
( To be signed and sealed . )
After that we agreed to the following petitioning policy .
* If the Village does n't pay the expenses of petitioning we will be unable to continue , so immediately bill the Village for expenses .
* It seems that the Military is trying to find a way to put our leaders in jail , so warn all villagers always to obey the Petition Regulations , and to set up no established leaders or representatives .
* Those farmers who have lost their land by being evicted from the firing range should tell the Military directly , and not through representatives , how they do n't have enough to eat , and should demand compensation .
* In choosing representatives the appropriate person should be selected for each occasion .
* When holding discussions and making appeals , request to the Military that these encounters take place in front of all the villagers .
* When the representatives are done talking , the villagers themselves should speak from their own standpoints .
* The Military tries to have meetings with as few representatives as possible , in a closed space , and for as short a time as possible , and we should do our best to resist this .
* Even when the Military comes with a highhanded and arbitrary attitude , we should maintain the manner of human beings and first - class citizens , and even if we receive no politeness from them we should never forget to offer them proper greetings .
* For interpreting or for witnessing [ their interpreter ] we should go through the Village Head and call upon Uchijima Takegi , the Junior High School Teacher .
The Petition Regulations were only put on paper in their final form around 1960 , and today an abbreviated version is inscribed on the back wall of Solidarity Hall ( completed in 1970 ) .
But the first Petition Regulations were just a record of what we talked about , written down on a scrap of paper .
People from mainland Japan ask us , who first thought of the Petition Regulations ; who first put them together ?
But nobody did .
" Let 's offer them greetings " ( In Okinawan dialect , " Aisatsu sabira " ) was the foundation of the Iejima struggle , the Maja struggle .
As for myself , I was weaker than the others .
That was because I trusted America .
Up to then I had blind faith .
My family was small and we were well enough off , and I can remember overhearing people say , " He might skip out , we must n't let him get away . "
And I can remember saying to the others , " I will do as you do , tell me what you are going to do . "
At that time I had opened a little variety story at Kawahira , down near the harbor and far from Maja , and so unlike the others I would n't be without food from the day my land was taken .
So in a lot of ways I was weaker than the others .
So if you ask me who wrote the Petition Regulations , the answer is , I do n't know .
There is n't much difference among the people of Maja .
When you farm , your knowledge and ability get to be about the same .
So even if I said I was the first to suggest it , it was everyone 's idea .
It may be that I acted as a kind of counselor , and made some suggestions or proposals , but thinking back on it today it is strange to me that we could have put such a thing together then .
Two or three years ago a young man who came over from the mainland said that " petition " is too mild .
Petitioning is not really fighting , was his idea .
I explained it to him this way .
" I do n't necessarily think it was a splendid fight .
But here on this isolated island , where there are no support groups , no newspaper reporters , no one watching , no one listening - if we are killed here , it 's all over .
So there was no other way . "
A non-resisting resistance : prayers , pleading , higan* , entreaty , these are what I earnestly promoted .
* higan : a Buddhist prayer for all mankind .

In the summer of 1947 a semi- derelict 200 - berth Chesapeake Bay steamer carrying 4,500 Holocaust survivors , renamed the Exodus , set out from France to run the British blockade of Palestine .
The survivors had been rotting in displaced persons camps since the end of the war , waiting to find a country that would take them .
The organisers of the expedition , the Zionist movement , were operating a policy of illegal immigration as both a humanitarian rescue operation and as a calculated move to politically gerrymander the country 's Jewish population .
They did n't expect to be able to land , but they knew that the rickety vessel with its pitiful human cargo of refugees would show up the British as cold - hearted colonial masters .
The Exodus could equally have been called End of Empire .
As the ship approached Haifa , the commander received a radio signal from the Zionist leadership not to risk the lives of the passengers by a confrontation .
But the incalcitrant Polish captain refused to turn back .
Hemmed in by three British destroyers , the crew and passengers found themselves boarded , and retaliated with whatever weapons came to hand – a consignment of cans of kosher corned beef .
The British killed three people , one bludgeoned to death by a rifle butt in the face .
A few days later the passengers were transferred to another ship and sailed back to Germany , back to the refugee camps , under withering press headlines : " Return to the death land , " read one .
The gripping events in the eastern Mediterranean , shown on the news reels , evoked massive public sympathy , particularly in America where Britain was seen as the old colonial regime .
The media coverage was a PR catastrophe for Britain .
To the ship 's captain , Ike Aronowitz , when I met him in 2007 shortly before his death , Ernest Bevin 's decision to repel the Exodus was a gift from a God who had " sent us Ernest Bevin to create a Jewish state " .
Against the single image of a ship full of Holocaust survivors being beaten by squaddies , the British had to set a complex narrative , too complicated for a public looking for a simple story of victims and oppressors .
The British spoke of the needs and wishes of the existing Arab population of Palestine ; a new Jewish state implanted in the Middle East against the will of its native inhabitants was not to be the happy ending of a tragic Jewish story .
Yet the Exodus was to be instrumental in cementing support later that year for the UN partition vote which divided Mandate Palestine , and the largely erroneous novel and film of the same name in the late 1950s would create a lasting mythology .
The image of the boat had greater power than the warnings from the Foreign Office or the pleas of Arab leaders .
The events early this week of the boarding of the Gaza aid flotilla should have jogged the memories of Israel 's political leaders and its military .
The sight of Israeli politicians , diplomats and army spokespeople trying to assert a more complicated story than that of innocent civilians brutally murdered by an act of piracy has not washed with the public .
No amount of showing videos of the peace activists attacking the abseiling Israeli soldiers will answer the question : what were the soldiers doing there in the first place and why would the passengers not defend themselves against their attackers , exactly as the refugees had done in 1947 ?
Israel 's political reasoning , of a Hamas - controlled Gaza strip , of the threat to the Jewish state from Gaza in the south and Hezbollah in the north , backed by the nuclear - ambitious Iran , falls on deaf ears .
Legal arguments by maritime experts that Israel was within its right to assault the ship in international waters can't compete with the authoritative presence on another of the vessels of the internationally bestselling novelist Henning Mankell , who risked his own life to bring aid to the starving millions of Gaza .
Palestinian solidarity movements have not , until now , attained the critical mass of the campaign against apartheid South Africa .
Perhaps , like the Exodus in 1947 , the Gaza aid flotilla will be the tipping point in the long agony of the Palestinian people , when wavering public opinion finally turns decisively against Israel and the whole Zionist project of a national home for the Jews .
When public sympathy is outraged by what has been described as a massacre , the fine points of what is to be the solution to the rival claims of Arabs and Jews for the same piece of territory are not the point .
We look back on the ship Exodus and wonder if our parents and grandparents should have thought harder and emoted less .
But emotions are what you feel , you can not help it .
Human empathy for the inmates of a vast open air prison undergoing collective punishment will always trounce the warnings of the thinktanks .
The image of the Gaza flotilla has etched itself on the mind , whatever the unforeseen consequences of our collective outrage .
College Kids Invent Motorized Couch , Get It Banned From Campus
Two BYU students have apparently brought every lazy college kid ’s dream to life by creating a motorized couch .
That ’s right , now they never have to get off their couch to go anywhere .
Unfortunately for these geniuses , the administration at BYU decided to ban their invention from campus – but they still enjoy taking it through the Wendy ’s drive thru .

China has launched an operation to clean up a large oil spill in the Yellow Sea after two oil pipelines exploded in the port city of Dalian late on Friday .
Oil - skimming vessels and other ships have been deployed to remove the slick , which is reported to cover 50 sq km ( 19 sq miles ) .
Fires started by the blasts late on Friday burned throughout the weekend .
No deaths or injuries were reported .
Around 2,000 firefighters battled the flames , which broke out after a pipe carrying oil from a tanker to a storage tank blew up , causing another nearby pipeline to explode .
The authorities have closed the port , which regularly receives foreign vessels carrying crude oil , and is also a main export point for petrol and diesel .
The pipelines belong to the China National Petroleum Corporation , Asia 's largest oil and gas producer by volume .
Officials said the flames gave off gas containing sulphur and an aromatic hydrocarbon - but that they were not fatally toxic .

Delicate super - cold experiment falls for science .
The canister containing the experiment is dropped down a 146 - metre - high tower in Bremen , Germany .
Science
It is any researcher 's nightmare : you spend months setting up a delicate experiment and then , just as it is about to take data , you drop it .
That 's exactly what a team of German scientists did again and again in an effort to understand gravity better .
Their nearly indestructible experiment , the results of which are published in this week 's Science1 , could soon lead to ultra-sensitive tests of gravity or better sensors for spacecraft .
Gravity is mercilessly impartial — on Earth , it accelerates heavy and light objects alike with a tug of 9.8 metres per second squared .
That property is the cornerstone of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which states that gravity is indistinguishable from any other type of acceleration .
But some physicists wonder whether gravity 's tug might be fractionally different on objects of different mass , or whether it might change its behaviour at short distances — such as those at which the rules of quantum mechanics come into play .
The problem is that any deviation would be miniscule .
Current experiments , which use twisting pendulums or precise laser measurements of the changing distance between Earth and the Moon , can detect incredibly small variations in gravity 's expected tug .
So far , no changes have been seen .
Physicist Ernst Rasel of the Leibniz University of Hanover in Germany and his colleagues want to detect even smaller gravitational variations .
The idea is to chill a cluster of atoms to a temperature that is within a fraction of absolute zero .
At that extreme , the atoms all assume the same quantum - mechanical state and begin to behave collectively as a sort of super - atom , known as a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .
Researchers would like to split the super - atom cloud , send each half along a separate path and then recombine them .
When the halves join , they generate a characteristic interference pattern of light and dark fringes , just like the pattern that a laser beam generates when it is split and recombined .
Researchers might be able to use that interference pattern to detect tiny differences in gravity 's behaviour , and also to see how it acts on a quantum - mechanical object .
Research in free fall
It 's an ingenious plan with two major problems : first , the super - cold atom clouds are extraordinarily hard to make .
Second , the best way to test gravity is to make sure that no other forces are acting on an experiment .
Short of launching it into orbit , the best way to do that is to drop the whole experimental apparatus so that it goes into free fall .
Incredibly , Rasel and his team have now licked both problems .
They devised a special self - contained canister that can automatically generate a BEC .
They then dropped the canister from the 146 - metre - high drop tower at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity in Bremen , Germany .
" I was very worried , " Rasel says of the moments before his team first dropped their experiment .
" It was coming towards the end of a PhD thesis of a student , " he adds , explaining that it would have caused serious problems if anything went wrong .
But the canister worked perfectly .
Rasel and his team carried out 180 drops and were able to measure multiple atom clouds over about a second of free fall , a considerable time for such a tiny object .
Redefining gravity
" It 's a marvellous technical accomplishment , " says Eric Adelberger , a physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle , who conducts gravitational measurements with twisting pendulums known as torsion balances .
Rasel 's team has not yet split the cloud in two to make gravitational measurements , but assuming that it can be done , it will rival other techniques , he says .
" They can measure extremely tiny acceleration differences , ones that are much smaller than a torsion balance is likely to do . "
Rasel says he would eventually like to put a version of his experiment into continuous freefall by launching it into orbit around the earth .
Such an experiment would be able to conduct numerous gravity measurements with very high - precision , he says .
But first , the team will have to overcome some lingering but serious difficulties .
Most immediately , Rasel says that the team will have to get rid of stray magnetic fields that are disturbing the atom cloud .

BECs could be useful for more than just science experiments , adds Dana Anderson , a physicist at JILA on the campus of University of Colorado at Boulder .
Because ultra-cold matter is so sensitive to jolts and jiggles , atom clouds could make supersensitive sensors for inertial guidance systems .
Although the Global Positioning System is the main way aircraft navigate day - to - day , inertial guidance is still an important back - up for when GPS is not available because of jamming or an outage .
" Nearly every vehicle that 's in the air has an inertial guidance system , " Anderson says .

Website that exposed video says Washington
Post withheld video of attack for over a year and did n’t release to public
Federal officials have arrested a 22 - year - old intelligence analyst whom they accuse of leaking classified materials to the web site Wikileaks.org , which released video showing the US military killing innocent civilians in Iraq .
In the wake of the arrest , Wikileaks issued a statement alleging that the Washington Post had a copy of the video showing the attack but did n’t release it for over a year .
A statement on the group ’s Twitter feed said , “ Statement : Washington Post had Collateral murder video for over a year but DID NOT RELEASE IT [ sic ] it to the public . ”

“ Collateral murder ” is the title the group gave to a video they released at the National Press Club in April , which shows a US military missile strike on a van in Baghdad that killed a Reuters photographer and his driver , as well as several unarmed civilians .
The Post described the video as “ long sought ” when it was released earlier this year .
But one of its reporters wrote a book that documented the attack , and acknowledged at the time that he had seen a copy of the secret video , and offered a frame - by - frame account .
Wikileaks ’ assertion would seek to place the Post in the company of prominent media organizations like The New York Times , which held off publishing a story about the Bush Administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program for a year at the behest of the Bush Administration .
But their claim presupposes the fact that the Post actually had a copy of the video , rather than simply a reporter who reviewed it .
Wikileaks has offered no additional details .
It also seems to discount the fact that the Post offered a frame - by - frame account of the attack both in their newspaper and in a book by one of their staff members .
The Post has withheld information on national security grounds before ; notably , it declined to name the Eastern European countries where the US had secret CIA prisons .

According to Wired.com , the Feds recently arrested an analyst they believe involved with leaking information surrounding the attack :
SPC Bradley Manning , 22 , of Potomac , Maryland , was stationed at Forward Operating Base Hammer , 40 miles east of Baghdad , where he was arrested nearly two weeks ago by the ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Criminal Investigation Division .
A family member says heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s being held in custody in Kuwait , and has not been formally charged .
Manning was turned in late last month by a former computer hacker with whom he spoke online .
In the course of their chats , Manning took credit for leaking a headline - making video of a helicopter attack that Wikileaks posted online in April .
The video showed a deadly 2007 U.S. helicopter air strike in Baghdad that claimed the lives of several innocent civilians .
He said he also leaked three other items to Wikileaks : a separate video showing the notorious 2009 Garani air strike in Afghanistan that Wikileaks has previously acknowledged is in its possession ; a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat , which the site posted in March ; and a previously unreported breach consisting of 260,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables that Manning described as exposing Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ almost criminal political back dealings .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Hillary Clinton , and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning , and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , in searchable format , to the public , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Manning wrote .
In response , Wikileaks issued several statements from its Twitter account .

“ We never collect personal information on our sources , so we are are unable as yet to confirm the Manning story , ” one read .
“ Allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect , ” said another .
ADVERTISEMENT
A Post reporter suggested in a profile piece just last month a possible reason an organization might withhold the video : fear of being labeled anti-American .
“ Edited and unedited versions of the video have been viewed nearly 8 million times , provoking shock but also condemnation , ” the reporter wrote .
“ Some critics blasted WikiLeaks as an incarnation of “ Baghdad Bob , ” the nickname of the former Iraqi information minister under Saddam Hussein .
Since the video was released , Assange and other WikiLeaks officials have defended their airing of the its disturbing images as an important counterbalance to those served up by television and Hollywood .
“ We ’re being desensitized by watching fake violence , but we ’re not seeing the real stuff , the real pain and real cruelty , ” Schmitt said .
“ How can you have an opinion about this war if you do n’t know what it looks like ? ”
Io , the most volcanic body in the solar system , is seen in front of Jupiter 's cloudy atmosphere in this image from NASA 's Galileo spacecraft , now orbiting the giant planet .
Credit : NASA
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Io is one of the four moons of Jupiter that Galileo discovered after he turned his new telescope heavenward .
They shocked him and his contemporaries because they demonstrated that heavenly bodies can orbit objects other than the Earth .
Io in particular continues to amaze scientists .
It orbits closer to the cloud tops of Jupiter than our moon does to the earth , and is strongly subjected to Jupiter 's powerful gravitational field and its intense radiation belts .
One consequence is that Io is the most volcanic object known anywhere , with lava flows , erupting with plumes of sulfurous material , and a changing atmosphere of noxious gases .
The 1979 Voyager flyby observations revealed many of these details , but many puzzles remain .
It is estimated , for example , that one ton of material needs to be ejected into Io 's atmosphere every second in order to replenish the gases that escape from its atmosphere , but it is not known whether it all comes from volcanic gas or perhaps from the evaporation of surface ices .
CfA astronomers Arielle Moullet and Mark Gurwell , together with two colleagues , used the Submillimeter Array to image the surface of Io in key diagnostic lines of sulfur dioxide and , for the first time , in sulfur monoxide and sodium chloride .
They write in the latest issue of the journal Icarus that these three species of gases appear to be concentrated on the anti-jovian side of Io , although with different spatial distributions .
The scientists conclude that ice sublimation is most probably the origin of the sulfur dioxide , while the sulfur monoxide may in turn be a product of the sulfur dioxide interacting with radiation .
The sodium chloride , on the other hand , most likely comes from volcanoes .
The group also derives temperature and density information for the gas .
The new results help to sort out competing models of this bizarre satellite , and highlight the disruptive role that volcanoes can play in other solar system bodies besides the earth .

Rand Paul in ' 02 : I may not like it , but ' a free society ' will allow ' hate - filled groups to exclude people based on the color of their skin '
Here 's another wrinkle in the controversy over U.S. Senate candidate Rand Paul 's arguments , made Wednesday to NPR and Rachel Maddow , over whether the Civil Rights Act was necessary to prevent discrimination .
In a May 30 , 2002 , letter to the Bowling Green Daily News , Paul 's hometown newspaper , he criticized the paper for endorsing the Fair Housing Act , and explained that " a free society will abide unofficial , private discrimination , even when that means allowing hate - filled groups to exclude people based on the color of their skin . "
( Hat tip : Page One Kentucky .
I have purchased the letter from the newspaper 's online archives , but will not post it here out of respect for the copyright . )
" The Daily News ignores , " wrote Paul , " as does the Fair Housing Act , the distinction between private and public property .
Should it be prohibited for public , taxpayer - financed institutions such as schools to reject someone based on an individual 's beliefs or attributes ?
Most certainly .
Should it be prohibited for private entities such as a church , bed and breakfast or retirement neighborhood that does n't want noisy children ?
Absolutely not . "
In language similar to the language he 's used talking about the Civil Rights Act , Paul criticized racism while defending the right of businesses to discriminate .
" A free society will abide unofficial , private discrimination , " wrote Paul , " even when that means allowing hate - filled groups to exclude people based on the color of their skin .
It is unenlightened and ill - informed to promote discrimination against individuals based on the color of their skin .
It is likewise unwise to forget the distinction between public ( taxpayer - financed ) and private entities . "
Jesse Benton , a spokesman for Paul , cautioned that Paul 's statements about federal laws in no way mean he 's interested in repealing laws that prevent discrimination .
" The federal government has the power under the Civil Rights Act to make sure citizens do n't discriminate on race , " said Benton .
" He 's not going to repeal it .
The only people who are talking about changes to civil rights legislation are people on the left are people who want to use this as a political attack tool .
Not any serious people talking about policy . "
Imprisoned for 27 years for a rape he did n’t commit , Michael Anthony Green walked out of jail a free man on Friday and in the process was able to leave behind some of the anger that had fueled his survival behind bars .
Accompanied by his attorney , Green walked out of the Harris County Jail and into the arms of about 20 family members who cheered him .
“ Live life , ” Green said , when asked what he is going to do now .
ADVERTISEMENT
Green , 44 , was released after the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office reopened his case and new DNA tests it commissioned showed he did not commit the 1983 rape of a woman who had been abducted .
During a court hearing Friday , a judge ordered that Green be released on a $ 500 bond , allowing him to be free while the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals makes a final ruling on his innocence .
Asked what kept him going the last 27 years , Green said that in part it was his anger .
“ I took and channeled my anger into studying the law , ” said Green , clutching a photograph of his mother , who died while he was in prison .
“ That ’s how I lived , day by day … doing what I did .
Get up in the law , try to find me a way out . ”
Some of the anger that Green had held onto for so many years came to the surface on Thursday , when he had been originally scheduled to be freed on bond .
His release was delayed to give him time to calm down after he became upset that he was put in handcuffs and leg restraints one final time as he was taken from the county jail to the courthouse , said Bob Wicoff , his attorney .
Green said he got upset because one of the deputies escorting him tightened his handcuffs and threatened him .
Wicoff called it a misunderstanding but said Green was justified in his anger as his life had been taken away .
Green entered prison at age 18 .
Some of the nieces and nephews who greeted him on Friday had n’t been born when he was locked up .

Green said that while in prison , he did n’t give up hope , writing to state lawmakers , the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office and others proclaiming his innocence and asking that his case be reviewed .
In 1983 , four men abducted a woman from a pay telephone in north Houston , taking her to a remote location where three of them raped her .
The men drove off , leaving the woman there , and were later chased by police .
The men abandoned their car and fled on foot .
Green was detained by officers that night as he walked in the area .
The victim could not identify Green in person when he was first detained but later picked him from a photo lineup as one of her attackers .
Green was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to 75 years in prison .
He was the only person convicted in the case .

After District Attorney Pat Lykos was elected in 2008 , she formed the Post - Conviction Review Section and it chose Green ’s case as one of the first to look at .
The review team found the only remaining evidence in the case Ã¢â‚¬â€ clothing worn by the victim during the rape Ã¢â‚¬â€  and had it tested .
The results excluded Green .
Authorities were able to identify the four men who abducted the women .
But because the statute of limitations on the rape has run out , they can not be prosecuted .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The tragedy in the Green case is not only was an innocent man in prison , the victim was denied justice , society was denied justice and the real criminals were free , ” Lykos said Friday .
Lykos declined to criticize her predecessors when asked why it took so long for Green ’s case to be reviewed .
She said DNA testing was not available when Green was convicted , it did n’t come to the forefront until the 1990s and that even now Harris County Ã¢â‚¬â€  the country ’s third - largest county Ã¢â‚¬â€ does n’t have the resources to do all the testing it needs to do .
Green said he was grateful for the efforts by the district attorney ’s office .
ADVERTISEMENT
He and his attorney blame bad police work for his wrongful imprisonment , saying improperly suggestive identification procedures that were used in photo spreads and a live lineup helped lead to the victim incorrectly identifying Green as one of her attackers .
Houston police have declined to comment on Green ’s case .
Wicoff said Green forgives the victim but is unsure if he will ever forgive the police .
Adrian Taylor , 50 , Green ’s older brother , said he ’s disappointed it took so long for his brother to be released but now he wants to help him look to the future .

“ I now have to get him to forgive , forgive and move on , ” Taylor said .

Climate change , housing crisis , China , and recycling .
Here are four highly complex and controversial topics that come up again and again in the news , in election debates , and in discussions with friends and family .
Despite all the media coverage , it ’s difficult to get a balanced view .
Individual news articles tend to present a simplistic , one - sided stance on a complex problem .
Furthermore , these issues are politically polarizing so it ’s easy to find yourself in a filter bubble and only see one side of the story .
This year , I resolved to read books to get a well - rounded understanding of some of the world ’s most pressing and controversial issues .
A book can go into much greater depth than an article , and should ideally be well - researched and present both sides of an argument .
Issue 1 : Climate Change
The Climate Casino by William Nordhaus
This book , by a Nobel Prize winning economist , talks about climate change from an economic perspective .
Climate change typically evokes extreme responses : conservatives deny it altogether , while environmentalists warn of doomsday scenarios .
The reality is somewhere in the middle : if we do n’t do anything about climate change , average surface temperature is projected to rise by 3.5C by end of the century , and would cost 1 - 4 % of world GDP .
It ’s definitely a serious concern , but probably wo n’t cause the collapse of civilization either .
There have been thousands of papers at the IPCC studying various aspects of climate change , but there are still large uncertainties in all the projections .
There is a small chance that we might cross a “ tipping point ” like the melting of polar ice caps , where the system changes in a catastrophic and irreversible way after a certain temperature point .
It ’s poorly understood exactly what temperature triggers a tipping point , thus adding even more uncertainty to models .
Every time we emit CO2 , we are gambling in the climate casino .
The three approaches to dealing with climate change are mitigation ( emit less CO2 ) , adapting to the effects of climate change , and geoengineering .
We can reduce emissions quite a lot with only modest cost , but costs go up exponentially as you try to cut more and more emissions .
It ’s crucial that all countries participate : climate targets become impossible if only half of countries participate .
Economists agree that carbon tax is a simple and effective way of reducing carbon emissions across the board , and is more effective than direct government regulation .
A carbon tax sends a signal to the market and significantly discourages high - carbon technologies like coal , while only increasing gas and electricity costs by a modest amount .
Currently , climate change is a partisan issue : opinions on climate change is highly correlated with political views .
The scientific evidence is insurmountable , and gradually the public opinion will change .
Issue 2 : Rise of China
China is an emerging superpower , projected to overtake the US as the world ’s biggest economy in the next decade .
There ’s been a lot of tension between the two countries recently , looking at the trade wars and Hong Kong protests .
I picked up two books on this topic : one with a Chinese perspective , and another with a western perspective .
China Emerging by Wu Xiaobo
I got this book in Shenzhen , one of the few English books about China in the bookstore .
It describes the history of China from 1978 to today .
In 1978 , China was very poor , having experienced famines and the cultural revolution under Mao Zedong ’s rule .
The early 1980s was a turning point for China , where Deng Xiaoping started to open up the country to foreign investment and capitalism .
He started by setting up “ Special Economic Zones ” in coastal cities like Shenzhen and Xiamen where he experimented with capitalism , with great success .
The 1980s and 1990s saw a gradual shift from communism to capitalism , where the state relinquished control to entrepreneurs and investors .
By the 2000s , China was a manufacturing giant and everything was “ made in China ” .
During the mid 2000s , there was a boom in massive construction projects like high speed rail and hundreds of skyscrapers .
Development at such speed and scale is historically unprecedented — the book describes it as “ a big ship sailing towards the future ” .
This book helped me understand the Chinese mindset , although it is quite one - sided and at times reads like state propaganda .
Of course , being published in China , it leaves out sensitive topics like the Tiananmen massacre and internet censorship .
China ’s Economy : What Everyone Needs to Know by Arthur R. Kroeber
This book describes all aspects of China ’s economy , written by a western author , and presents a quite different view of the situation .
Since the economic reforms of 1978 , life has gotten tremendously better , with the population living in extreme poverty falling from 90 % in 1978 to less than 1 % now .
However , the growth has been uneven , and there is a high level of inequality .
One example of inequality is the hukou system .
Industrialization brought many people into the cities , and now about 2/3 of the population is urban , but there is a lot of inequality between migrant workers and those with urban hukou .
Only people with hukou has access to social services and healthcare .
However you ca n’t just give everyone hukou because the top - tier cities do n’t have infrastructure to support so many migrants .
Another example of inequality is in real estate .
Around 2003 , the government sold urban property at very low rates , essentially a large transfer of wealth .
At the same time , local governments forcefully bought rural land at below market rates , exacerbating the urban - rural inequality .
Chinese people like to invest in real estate because they believe it will always go up ( as it had for the last 20 years ) .
In the early stages of economic reform , the priority was to mobilize the country ’s enormous workforce , so some inefficiency and corruption was tolerated .
China focused on labor - intensive light industry , like clothing and consumer appliances , rather than capital - intensive heavy industry .
Recently , as wages rise , cheap labor is less abundant , so you need to increase economic efficiency for further growth .
However , China struggles to produce quality , more advanced technology like cars , aircraft , and electronics ( lots of phones are made in China but only the final assembly stage ) , and mostly produces cheap items of medium quality .
China will be the world ’s largest economy in the next decade , although this does n’t mean much after accounting for population size .
Despite its economy , it has limited political influence , and has no strong allied countries , even in East Asia .
It also struggles to become a technological leader : most of its tech companies only have a domestic market , and do n’t gain traction outside the country .
It ’s clear that China has vastly different values from Western countries : they do n’t value elections and democracy , rather the government is good as long as it keeps the economy running ; these ideologies will need to learn to coexist in the future .
Issue 3 : Canadian Housing Bubble
When the Bubble Burst by Hilliard MacBeth
Real estate prices and rent has risen a lot in the last 10 years in many Canadian cities ( most notably Toronto and Vancouver ) so that housing is unaffordable for many people now .
Hilliard MacBeth has the controversial opinion that Canada is about to hit a housing bubble , with corrections on the order of 40 - 50 % .
Many people blame immigration and foreign investment , but the rise in real estate prices is due to low interest rate and the willingness of banks to make large mortgage loans .
Many people assume that house prices will always go up .
This has been the case for the last 20 years , but there are clear counterexamples , like USA in 2008 and Japan in the 1990s .
The Case - Shiller index shows that over an 100 - year period , real estate values in the USA have approximately matched inflation .
We ’re likely overfitting to the most recent data , where we develop heuristics for the last few decades of growth and extrapolate it indefinitely into the future .
A few years ago , I asked a question on stackexchange about why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term — there is strong reason to believe the annual growth of 5 - 7 % will continue indefinitely .
For real estate , there ’s no good reason why it should increase over the long term , so it ’s more like speculation than investment .
Instead of an investment , it ’s better to think of real estate as paying for a lot of future rent upfront , and for young people to take on debt to get a mortgage is risky , especially in this market .
The author is extremely pessimistic about the future of Canadian real estate , which I do n’t think is justified .
Nevertheless , it ’s good to question some common assumptions about real estate investing .
In particular , the tradeoff between renting and ownership depends on a lot of factors , and we should n’t jump to the conclusion that ownership is better .
Issue 4 : Recycling
Junkyard Planet by Adam Minter
The recycling industry is in chaos as China announced this year that it is no longer importing recyclable waste from western countries .
Some media investigations have found that recycling is just a show , and much of it ends up in landfills or being burnt .
Wait , what is going on exactly ?
This book is written by a journalist and son of a scrapyard owner .
In western countries , we normally think of recycling as an environmentalist act , but in reality it ’s more accurate to think of it as harvesting valuable materials out of what would otherwise be trash .
Metals like copper , steel , and aluminum are harvested from all kinds of things like Christmas lights , cables , cars , etc .
It ’s a lot cheaper and takes less energy to harvest metal ( copper is worth a few thousand dollars a ton ) from used items than to mine it from ore , which would take 100 tons to produce one ton of metal .
There ’s a large international trade for scrap metal .
America is the biggest producer of scrap , and it gets sent to China because of the cheap labor and China has a lot of demand for metal to build its developing infrastructure .
The trade then goes into secondary markets where all kinds of scrap are defined by quality and sold to the highest bidder — there is little concern for the environment .
The free market with economic incentives is much more efficient at recycling than citizens with good intentions .
Metals are highly recyclable , whereas plastic is almost impossible to recycle profitably because its value per ton is so low compared to metals .
For some time , plastic recycling was done in Wen’an , but it was only possible because there was no environmental regulations and the workers did n’t wear protective equipment when handling dangerous chemicals .
The government shut it down after people started getting sick .
It ’s more costly to recycle while complying with regulations , which is why very little of it is done in the US ; the scrap is simply exported to countries with weak oversight .
Recycling usually takes place in places with cheap labor .
Often you have the choice between building a machine to do something , or hire humans to do it .
It all comes down to price : in one case , a task of sorting different metals is done by hundreds of young women in China and an expensive machine in America .
Labor is getting more expensive in China with its rising middle class , so this is rapidly changing .
In the developed world , we have a misguided idea of how recycling works , and often we think of recycling as a “ free pass ” that allows us to consume as much as we want , as long as we recycle .
In reality , recycling is imperfect and it will be turned into a lower - grade product ; in the “ reduce , reuse , recycle ” mantra , reducing consumption has by far the biggest impact , reusing is good , and recycling should be considered a distant third option .

Welcome to my King of the Mountains V2.0 , now with improved elevation calculations thanks to some good folk on the Vikings cycling forums I discovered how extract the data from Garmin TCX files so I could graph the actual data and not rely on the rather clumsy screen grabs .
In addition I have used Tableau to graph the data , which allows you to select and compare only the climbs you are interested in .
This is still a work in progress so any comment on the Tableau graphs is welcome .
All the graphs can be viewed in greater detail by clicking on them which will take them to full screen mode .

The max gradient should be taken with a bit of caution , although it was calculated from the data because of the sometimes erratic nature of the Garmin edge units some of these calculations are a little random .

Firstly here are all the climbs on the one graph , noting that Groggins and Charlottes Pass do continue on for some distance but I ’ve cut them short here to ensure you can still make out the other climbs .
Cat X–
The big ones to really test you .
Corin Dam –
This climb has two distinct parts .
The first starts at the turn off to Corin Dam on Paddy River road up to the gates at Woods Reserve .
The first part of the ride is easy with fairly low gradient .
From the gates to summit the ride gets harder as gradient increases and is what makes Corin a really good climb .
Honeysuckle Creek – Also known as Apollo Rd South of Tharwa .
The start of this climb was measured from the bridge about 2 km from the Nass rd / Apollo rd junction .
This is one of hardest rides in Canberra in my opinion with some short sections hitting a 20 % gradient .
Groggins and Charlotte ’s Pass – are both located South of Canberra in the ski fields around Thredbo .
The data for these climbs was given to me so I ca n’t comment on the climbs but I hope one day to get there .
The Charlottes Pass ride goes on for 32 km and there is a bit more of a climb but by the 25 k mark you ’ll have broken the back of this climb .
Cat A – Represent some of the “ bigger ” challenges around Canberra , these are usually the ones with the killer gradients .
Black Mountain ( Telstra Tower ) –
The climb was measured from the turn off to the very top of the summit , past the car park entry where a lot of riders usually stop their timers .
Black Mountain in my opinion along with Fitz ’s Hill represents one of harder climbs in Canberra .
What makes it difficult is the first 400 metres , which has quite a hard gradient of around 15 % .
Mount Ainslie – Preceding the climb to Mount Ainslie is the climb at the Australian War Memorial which adds another 34 metres to the climb .
Mount Majura – Our famous secret climb .
This was measured from the turn off on Majura Road , not bad considering there is a additional 81 metre up Federal Hwy ( See the Cat C Climbs ) before you get there .
At about 600 m there is an entry gate you ’ll have climb over to continue the climb .
Fitz ’s Challenge – measured from the half moon creek bridge to the KOM line at the summit .
This is without a doubt a brute of a climb .
While average gradient for this climbs is just over 10 % in reality because of a dip in the climb most of the time you will be facing a gradient of 12 to 13 %
Note I ’m currently missing the data for this in version 2 but hope to have it soon
Cat B –
These represent good training climbs ( well for me at least ) that wont leave your legs screaming when you reach to the summit .
Red Hill – Measured from the turn off to Red Hill .
Reported gradient on the chart above probably does n’t do Red Hill justice .
In measuring the distance I measured to the summit which is at the restaurant but you can see from the image above the climb plateaus at around 1.1 km where the main lookout is .
If measure the gradient to this part of the climb it comes out at around 9 % , on par with Black Mountain , just shorter .
Maybe not one of the beginner hills .
The Three Sisters – This is the climb out of Uriarra crossing heading back to Mt Stromlo .
Measured from the bridge crossing to the KOM marking on the road .
So called because of the three distinctive sections to this ride .
Always fun at the end of a race , which happens frequently .
Mt McDonald – Located on the other side of cotter and goes up around cotter dam .
Measured from the turn off on Cotter Road to the KOM marking on the road .
Good training ride , not difficult , just a good consistent gradient .
Old Federal Hwy – This climb is located in the Yass Valley just past Sutton .
Instead of going up the Federal hwy there is a turn off at the nursery which is the old federal hwy .
The climb was measured from the bridge crossing the Yass river to the summit .
As shown it is on par with Mt Stromlo
Mt Stromlo – Measured from the turn off on Cotter Rd to very summit which means going up the small road which is in average condition near the new observatory .
What I like about Mt Stomlo is the even gradient for the climb .
Nothing challenging but a can be a good workout if you choose to push yourself .
Pierce ’s Creek –
This is the first climb after Cotter Dam on Paddy River Road on the way out to the tracking station .
At 9 % it is a toughy but relatively short .
Monaro Hwy , Theodore – This is climb as you leave Canberra on the way to Cooma .
Nothing spectacular about this climb other than it has consistent gradient .
Old Cooma Road – Good climb with some steep sections on it .
This road can get some traffic with the trucks going to the quarry .
Smith ’s Gap – out at Bundgendore might be short but has a high average gradient of almost 9 %
Erindale Road –
You ’ll note the graph for this one appears quite “ grainy ” compared to the others .
This is because it was actually mapped going down the hill and the higher speed meant there were less data points to graph .
Wallaroo – Good solid climb with some steep sections in it .
Kings
Hwy , Queanbeyan – only advice here is get in quick if you want to do this one , they are currently redoing this section of the Kings hwy and it will be shorter and lower soon .
Cat C – I guess these can be classed as the beginner climbs but should not be underestimated .
Australian War Memorial ( AWM ) – Normally I do n’t map climbs this small but as this is the lead into Mt Ainslie I thought it was good to have here .
It ’s s short climb but does peak at 8 % and is a nice way to way to warm up before the big climb to Mt Ainslie .
Mt Pleasant - Measured from the turn off on Fairbairn Ave into Duntroon .
One of my favourite training rides .
Starts of with a kick on the first section but then evens out to consistent climb .
Coppins Crossing - Measured from the crossing to the summit .
Federal Hwy , Watson – Starting from the last roundabout leaving Canberra , starts of easy , nice consistent gradient , smooth road .
Importantly this is the lead up to the Mt Majura climb .
Googong Dam – Short climb but steep also it is a dead road making it a tough climb in its category
Stockdill Drv ( Poo Hill ) – so named because it is the road leading to the Sewage plant , the smell alone should be enough of an incentive to do this climb quickly .
Uriarra Crossing West–
This is the climb opposite to the 3 sisters at Uriarra Crossing .
It is a little below par but given it is part of the Uriarra loop , it a frequent climb and therefore people might like to know about it .
Tidbinbilla –
On the road to the tracking station .
Not to hard unless it is on the finish to a race at the tracking station .
Techie Notes
An interesting point came up while preparing the data for this post .
You ’ll notice that on some of the climbs the data points are a lot closer than others .
For example in the Cat C climbs Urriarra West compared to most of the others .
The difference can be attributed to the use of the new Garmin Edge 500 which appears to record data points more frequently than the 705 .
I guess this one of those less obvious feature improvements you get with the 500 .
It should also be noted that while Garmin say their devices are accurate I have found on given day I can get up to a 10 % variation on the reading for the climbs so if you ’ve recorded these climbs as well but have a different elevation just bear this in mind .
In fact you ’ll notice with my Corin and Mt Majura recordings there are some odd spikes in the data which I just put down to these glitches .
For those interested I ’m planning to write a follow up article on how I extracted and manipulated the data .
If there are any other climbs that should be included please let me know .
After years of serving as Apple 's main source of revenue , the iPod 's influence on the company 's financial health has diminished to the point of being effectively irrelevant as a revenue driver , marking an end to the ' iPod era . '
As the halo effect of the iPod reached its maximum potential , reinvigorated Macintosh sales and deep market penetration by the iPhone have completely taken over as the main source of Apple 's revenue and earnings .
Â
Even the iPad in its inaugural quarter will post more revenue and earnings than the iPod , pushing the device to Apple 's 4th largest source of income .
Â
What 's more , the iPod as a percentage of Apple 's total revenue will drop below 10 % in 2011 .
A few years ago , I wrote an article detailing the iPodâs diminishing importance to Appleâs revenue growth .
As Macintosh sales starting picking up steam , and as the advent of the iPhone assumed the helm of Appleâs future growth prospects , the iPod started a slow descent down from its throne as Appleâs key revenue driver .
In January 2006 , when Apple hit all time highs of $ 86.40 , I remember how investors and financial analysts feared Appleâs best years were behind it .
This fear , while apparently unfounded in retrospect , stemmed from the perception that the iPod was near market saturation , and that Apple wouldnât be able to innovate further .
And though the market was in the midst of a raging bull market , investors saw Appleâs share price drop from $ 86.40 to $ 50.00 by that July .
Turn the page to 2010 , the iPod is a mere afterthought and Apple has since seen its share price grow almost 6 fold .
And while the iPod demonstrated a lot more resilience than anticipated by the financial world , posting record quarter after record quarter through 2008 , its significance as a revenue driver has now diminished to the point of being almost irrelevant to Appleâs overall growth .
In Q1 2006 , the iPod accounted for an astonishing 55.55 % — or more than half — of Appleâs total revenue .
For the 2010 holiday shopping season , though the iPod posted 250 % more revenue than it did in 2006 , it only accounted for 21.62 % or just a fifth of Appleâs total revenue .
That right there is a very tangible example of Appleâs ability to innovate in the face of an inevitable and impending slowdown of its main revenue driver , the iPod .
The chart below details iPod revenue as a percentage of Appleâs total revenue from 2006 through 2010 .
Please note that Q3 and Q4 of 2010 are merely estimates based on a detail analysis Iâve published , and that actual results may vary .
Notice how the iPodâs impact to Appleâs total revenue has been on a consistent and continual downtrend since 2006 .
It is as if the importance of the iPod wanes by the day .
In fact , Iâm projecting that the iPod as a percentage of Appleâs overall revenue will fall under 10 % for the first time in Q4 of this year .
And to get an idea of just how significant that really is , Iâm expecting iTunes to account for 6.9 % of total revenue in the same quarter .
Thatâs an indication that the iPod is becoming just as insignificant of a revenue driver as is iTunes .
Yet , the chart above is even more impressive when one makes a side by side comparison to Appleâs total revenue in the same period .
Even though the iPod has a diminishing impact on Appleâs total sales from 2006 to present , Appleâs revenue has outright exploded .
In Q1 2006 , Apple reported $ 5.75 billion in revenue of which 55 % were iPod sales .
In 2010 , Apple reported $ 15.7 billion or almost triple what it reported in 2006 .
Yet iPod sales only accounted for a meager 21.6 % of that revenue .
Any way you look at it , Apple is no longer dependent on the iPod , and any future signs of weakness should produce nothing more than a yawn .
The chart below is a quarterly overview of Appleâs revenue from 2006 to 2010 .
Please be advised that Q3 and Q4 are merely projections , and that actual results may vary .
A detailed look at how I arrived at those estimates can be found here .
Though the iPod is contributing less in terms of percentages , it still makes very hefty contributions in terms of revenue .
In fact , while iPod revenue as a percentage of Appleâs overall revenue has been on a constant decline since 2006 , the iPod has posted very consistent revenue throughout that period of time .
The only thing that has changed is Appleâs product lineup , and an untouchable capacity to innovate .
Hopefully this article puts the old adage , â As goes the iPod , so goes the Apple , â definitively the rest .
Apple isnât just the iPod maker or the iPhone maker , itâs a money maker .
2010 marks the end of the iPod era .
Next weekend will feature another milestone in the drive to cut Social Security and Medicare .
The organization America Speaks will be hosting a series of 20 meetings in cities across the country .
They will ask the people at these meetings , a cross section of the nation , to come up with proposals for dealing with the country ’s projected long - term budget deficit .
The way the problem is outlined for these meetings virtually guarantees that most of the participants will opt for big cuts to Social Security and Medicare .
The results of this song and dance exercise will then be presented to President Obama ’s fiscal responsibility commission on June 30th , which will use it as further ammunition for plans by its co-chairs to gut these programs .
The rigged deck approach should come as no surprise .
America Speaks is largely funded by Peter G. Peterson , the investment banker billionaire who has been on a decades - long crusade to gut these programs .
In recent years Peterson has redoubled his efforts , committing more than a billion dollars to a wide variety of groups in addition to America Speaks .
To advance his agenda Peterson has even set up a fake news service , The Fiscal Times .
To fill the staff , Peterson ’s son hired a number of reputable reporters who were displaced by the collapse of the newspaper industry .
The “ Federal Budget 101 , ” the guidebook for the discussion , follows a predictably shoddy path .
The book discusses the budget in almost complete isolation from any larger discussion of the economy .
There is virtually no discussion of the ways in which the budget fosters growth , for example by funding education , research and infrastructure ; nor the way in which the pattern of growth affects the budget .
For example , the booklet never discusses the extent to which the economic mismanagement that allowed the unchecked growth of an $ 8 trillion housing bubble contributed to the debt that is its central concern .
The downturn caused by the resulting economic collapse will eventually add more than $ 3 trillion to the country ’s debt according to the Congressional Budget Office ’s projections .
The booklet also neglects to point out the extent to which the long - term budget disaster story is driven by our broken health care system .
If per person health care costs in the United States were the same as in any other wealthy country , we would be looking at enormous budget surpluses in the long - term , not deficits [ http://www.cepr.net/calculators/hc/hc-calculator.html].
Incredibly , the booklet does not even point out the fact that income is projected [ http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/102xx/doc10297/AppendixA.9.2.shtml#1091396] to grow over time .
The average hourly wage is projected to buy 20 percent more in 2025 ( the year for which participants are supposed to design a budget ) than it does today .
This knowledge might affect how people view things such as tax increases .
For example , if we know that people will be on average 20 percent richer , we might be less concerned if their tax rate were to rise by 1 - 2 percentage points .
The booklet also never mentions the plunge in wealth that older workers have suffered as a result of the collapse of the housing bubble and plunge in the stock market .
This has left the bulk of near retirees ( those in their late 40s and 50s ) facing retirement with almost nothing other than their Social Security and Medicare [ http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-wealth-of-the-baby-boom-cohorts-after-the-collapse-of-the-housing-bubble/].
The booklet even gets its basic economics wrong , warning participants at the very beginning that rising deficits can lead to a weaker dollar .
In the real econ 101 , students learn just the opposite - that budget deficits can jack up interest rates leading to a stronger dollar .
This is how a budget deficit can be tied to a trade deficit – by raising the value of the dollar .
A higher dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive to foreigners and imports cheaper for people living in the United States .
People who want to see our trade deficit fall want a lower dollar .
Getting the value of the dollar down ( not up ) is an argument that more serious people would give for a smaller budget deficit .
Peterson should have been able to get a better product for his millions .
Finally , it is striking that not a single person connected with this project was among those who warned of the housing bubble before its collapse wrecked the economy .
Ostensibly , America Speaks tried to include a diverse range of economists and policy analysts .
Yet , in the category of people who recognized the biggest economic disaster of the last 80 years , America Speaks came up completely empty .
To put this in perspective , suppose Peter Peterson had funded this exercise back in 2004 , when the housing bubble was already huge , but still at a point where it could have been deflated without devastating the economy .
This group would have given us a great discussion of the 2020 deficit , but said nothing about the tsunami that was about to wreck the economy ( and send the deficit skyrocketing ) .
Unfortunately , there is no reason to assume that the America Speaks crew ’s understanding of the economy is any better today than it was in 2004 .
We need more serious analysis than this propaganda exercise as a basis for deciding the fate of essential programs like Social Security and Medicare .

The government today opened up its accounting books for the first time as it published the entire contents of the Treasury spending database .
The vast database contains a total of 24 m individual entries documenting where public money comes from , what it is spent on and whose pocket it ends up in .
Publication of the complex 120 GB Combined Online Information System ( Coins ) promises a unique insight into the everyday running of government , and has been widely welcomed by campaigners for open democracy .
But it is proving controversial in Whitehall .
Some ministers have expressed unease about the transparency it will bring , exposing every spending decision they make .
However , Danny Alexander , the chief secretary to the Treasury , hailed the release of the data .
The Liberal Democrat minister said : " For too long , the previous government acted as if the public had no right to know where their hard - earned taxes were spent .
" Today we have lifted that veil of secrecy by releasing detailed spending figures dating back to 2008 .
" This data is complex , but this is a major step forward and shows we are delivering on our promise to make this government more open and transparent while ensuring we deliver value for money for the taxpayer .
" I hope people will take the opportunity to scrutinise carefully how their money is being spent – as I am doing every day in preparation for the spending review . "
He said the government would not stop there , adding : " We plan to release more data in the coming months that will be easier for the general public to understand . "
The data is being released in a raw format .
Members of the public will find it difficult to understand the database without sophisticated analytical tools and expertise , and developers all over the country – including at the Guardian – are working out how to break the data down .
In opposition , the Tories had suggested such a data release could stimulate an industry to analyse and create online services from it , worth up to £ 6bn a year .
Tom Steinberg , the founder of MySociety , a non-profit organisation that runs several democracy websites in the UK , was this week appointed to a new government committee , chaired by the cabinet minister Francis Maude , looking at how to open up government data further .
Steinberg said yesterday : " Tomorrow 's publication is definitely very important as a sign to the rest of government that it is no longer out of bounds from the public any more . "
He added that there had been some resistance to the idea from public bodies .
" What we 're doing is about institutionalising a government that is uniquely more open about publishing data and answering questions , " he said .
" We have a couple of hundred years of a culture of not being open to get over .
It 's not surprising that the big public organisations should prefer to continue a tradition of privacy and secrecy .
" The public should be able to get information out of government , and very soon after it is created , with minimal hassle , without being asked why they want it and what it 's for .
This is a means to an end of a better government and a more engaged public . "
The issue was debated at yesterday 's cabinet meeting .
A Downing Street spokesman said there had been a " discussion on the government 's transparency agenda " .
He added : " The prime minister emphasised the importance of transparency across all departments and made the point that while it may not always be comfortable , it was a necessary and important part of making government more accountable .
" The chief secretary to the Treasury gave an update on the Treasury 's plans to publish the Coins database and set out more detail on public spending . "
There are some concerns that the commercial application of public data – particularly if , in future , it relates to individuals – has the potential to invade people 's privacy .
Jim Knight , the former Labour minister responsible for data in government , welcomed the publication , calling it " a rebranding of the open government programme we were working on " .
He said : " These days , people can mesh government data with commercially available data .
That can give you data right down to the level of a few houses .
" It wo n't be hard to get down virtually to the individual .
Some would argue that gets pretty scary . "
The Conservative technology manifesto said : " Our plans to open up government data and spending information will not only help us to cut wasteful spending , but according to new research ... it will also create an estimated £ 6bn in additional value for the UK . "

Reporting is often about access , but journalists along the Gulf Coast covering the BP oil spill have had some trouble getting it .
As BP faces more pressure from the government and from its own shareholders unhappy with the company 's falling stock price , it seems to be clamping down on who can talk to reporters .
Despite company statements that anyone on cleanup crews can share their views , ABC's Matt Gutman reports that 's not necessarily the case .
Today during a " World News " Conversation , he saw firsthand how a BP manager took pains to keep workers away from the press .
While preparing for a video chat on his laptop from a public beach in Alabama , Gutman was hassled by the manager of a nearby crew , asking Gutman why he was on the beach .
" You mind if I ask why you 've set up a camera right here while my guys are working ? " the man asked .
After Gutman explained that he was a reporter for ABC News , the manager responded , " I find it interesting . "
For Gutman and other journalists along the Gulf , it 's tough to report when so many are barred from talking .
" It 's incredibly frustrating working here because of those conditions , " Gutman told ABC's Dan Harris .
" Everywhere you go , you find police barricades , people telling you , you can't do this , you can't do that , or you can't talk to these people .
We 're not exactly sure why that is . "
" Here we see dozens of workers on this beach " picking up minute pieces of oil , Gutman said .
" They seem to be doing their job and I think they should be commended for it and maybe receive a little bit of press for it . "
Watch the incident in today 's Conversation from the Gulf Coast .
Calm and pragmatic ?

Would you object if your party , after fixing some areas of discrimination against a minority group of which you are a part , refused to move on the last major reform for that group because of '' tradition ' ' without any cogent explanation of why that tradition should remain ?
Not if you 're Penny Wong .
When Julia Gillard became prime minister , it was bemusing to hear an atheist , unmarried woman from Labor 's left saying she did not support allowing gay couples to marry .
But it was not surprising .
Gillard 's strategy to let Tim Mathieson into The Lodge is a small - target .
It is a do nothing , inspire no - one and scare no - one either strategy .
But how can Wong , the only openly gay female cabinet minister in Australia 's history , support her party 's ban on properly recognising gay relationships because of a ' ' cultural , religious , and historical view ' ' against it ?
That 's what she told Channel Ten yesterday : " On the issue of marriage , I think the reality is there is a cultural , religious and historical view around that which we have to respect . "
There was a cultural view against women being politicians .
There is a historical bias against lesbian cabinet ministers .
Sham action on climate change and no action on gay marriage .
Wong 's stance on both raises the question : what precisely is she for ?
On what would she take a stand on ?
Anyone ?
And I 'm fairly sure few religious leaders would support lady - loving ladies in the Senate .
Cultural roots , religion and history were all against Wong being elected in the first place .
Does that mean she should not have been ?
'' The party 's position is very clear and that is an institution between a man a woman . ''
Asked if she was just toeing the party line , she said : '' I do respect the fact that 's how people view the institution . ''
Which is entirely true – if you ignore national opinion polls saying precisely the opposite .
Wong 's position is that her party is not prepared to argue the case to remove the last egregious piece of discrimination against people like her , and nor is she – well , not any more .
In 2006 , she accused John Howard of being more extreme than George Bush on gay rights ; Howard had the governor - general squash civil unions in the ACT .
Then Kevin Rudd achieved much the same end by threatening to do much the same thing .
( Rudd 's objection to registrars presiding over civil union ceremonies , such as it was , seemed to be a fear of having a government formally begin a relationship , rather than recognise an existing one . )
Shortly after Rudd 's move , I asked her if that meant her government , too , was more extreme than the Bush administration .
She preferred to speak of significant changes made to various pieces of federal legislation to help de-facto couples .
She returns to the theme each time she is asked about it .
Her mantra is :
She is part of a party , and the party 's position was clear .
No marriage for gays .
It 's not her only conflicted position .
Acting on climate change , like marriage , is a supposedly progressive policy that is actually conservative , given its point is to keep the environment how it is .
On climate change , there was a time when she said any plan to tackle it without a price on carbon was '' a sham policy ' ' .
Now , her party 's policy has no price on carbon .
It failed to get the emissions trading scheme through the last parliament , but now has no plan to try again in the next .
So sham action on climate change and no action on gay marriage .
Wong 's stance on both raises the question : what precisely is she for ?
On what would she take a stand ?
Anyone ?
In the same speech in which she criticised Howard on gay rights in 2006 , she said : '' I hope there will come a time when this country can look back and wonder why some in this place and some in this government were so frightened of and antagonistic to certain types of relationships .
I look to a day , to paraphrase a great man , when we not only judge people by the content of their character but also where we judge their relationships by markers such as respect , commitment , love and security and not by the gender of their partners . "
" I look to a day when government policy and articulation is not so mired in prejudice .
Loading " I look to a day when we have a government that is not so mired in prejudice that it can address these issues fairly .
One thing I do know is that that will only come under a Labor government . ''
Not this one .
Fox News Channel ’s Bill O’Reilly insists that there is absolutely no way that a gay - themed McDonalds ad — that has gone viral — would ever run in America .
As Huffington Post noted on Monday , “ McDonald ’s has released an ad in France welcoming gay people to their restaurants .
The spot is titled ‘ Come as you are , ’ and shows a young gay man eating in a McDonald ’s with his father , who does n’t know his son is gay . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Nicholas Graham blogged , “ It ’s commendable of McDonald ’s to display their inclusiveness , but it ’s unclear why they felt the need to air such an ad at all .
Were French gay people previously feeling unwelcome in McDonald’s ? ”
A commenter at the Think Progress affiliated Ygleisas blog asked , “ Were gay folks waiting for permission ? ”
Wednesday night , Fox News Channel ’s daytime anchor Jane Skinner explained on The O’Reilly Factor that Nathalie Legarlantezec , the Brand Director for McDonalds in France , had issued the following statement : “ We wanted to show society the way it is today , without judging .
ThereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s obviously no problem with homosexuality in France today .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
A Queerty blogger observed , “ Bill O’Reilly is n’t a stupid man , and he knows that all food advertising is n’t about making your salivate . ”

Sometimes it ’s about making you feel welcome , which is what McDonald ’s gay ad in France was trying to accomplish .
But of course this is a “ political ” ad , so let ’s jump into crazytown with Bill ’s rhetorical question , “ Do they have an Al Qaeda ad ? ” No , but there is an Iranian one .
“ It ’ll never run in the USA , ” O’Reilly declared .
Skinner asked , “ How do you know it ’s not coming to the states ?
Never say never . ”

Andrea Lynn , senior editor of Chile Pepper magazine , shares thoughts and observations from the fiery food world .
Infused vinegars were all the rage at last week 's Fancy Food Show in New York City .
But why buy chile - infused products , when it 's just as easy to make them at home and control how much heat you want from the chiles ?
Take the smokiness from anchos , the fire of Thai chiles or the sweetness from red bell peppers .
Other spices or seasonings can be added as you please , and the overall price will be considerably less .
And why stop with just vinegar ?
Infuse oil , honey or alcohol too .
Here are the basics for chile infusions .
How to Make Chile - Infused Vinegar
1 . Place a variety of halved dried or fresh chiles into a glass jar .
2 . Take your pick of vinegars to use : white , rice wine , cider , white wine or red wine .
Fill jar with vinegar until chiles are submerged .
3. Seal , and allow the flavors to blend for one week .
Uses :
Whisk with oil and use for salad dressings ; use chile - infused vinegar in place of regular vinegar for pickling vegetables ; or add a splash to pulled pork for a Carolina feel .
How to Make Chile - Infused Honey
1 . Place a variety of dried chiles , or one specific types , into a glass jar .
2 . Place honey in a saucepan and warm over medium - heat until the honey is liquefied or until candy thermometer reaches 180 º F .
Keep a careful eye on the honey , so it does not scorch .
3 . Pour honey into the jar over the chiles .
Cool to room temperature .
Keep at room temperature .
Uses : Drizzle the chile - infused honey over yogurt or ice creams ; mix with softened butter to spread onto biscuits and rolls ; or glaze onto grilled fruits .
How to Make Chile - Infused Oils
1 . In a sauté pan , combine a neutral - flavored oil like canola with a handful of chopped dried chiles .
2 . Warm over medium - high heat just until the chiles begin to sizzle , about 1 to 2 minutes .
( Other seasonings or spices like garlic , ginger or peppercorns can also be added at this stage . )
3 . Let the oil cool completely before transferring to glass containers .
4 . Allow the chiles and oil to infuse for a few days .
If desired , strain oil of the chiles and chile seeds before using .
Uses : Marinate meat or tofu ; as a dipping sauce or condiment .
Basically , use in most recipes in place of oil where a spicy kick is preferred .
Have you found success with a certain type of chile infusion ?

Dear Jack ,
While it was recommended to adjust the intake of oils to match an ideal omega - 6 : omega3 ratio , I have heard that this precaution did n’t apply to the consumption of seeds and nuts .
In other words , you could have those in the amounts you deemed right and according to your taste , without worrying about their omega - 6 and omega - 3 composition .
Answer :
The main concern with omega - 3s from plant foods ( aka ALA ) is whether it is being converted into DHA .
There is evidence that a lot of people do not convert it efficiently , especially if their diets are high in omega - 6s ( as most vegan diets are ) .
Hempseeds , flaxseeds , and chia seeds are high in ALA , so these seeds would help correct an omega - 6 to omega - 3 imbalance .
But other seeds and most nuts are primarily omega - 6 and monounsaturated fats and could prevent the converstion of ALA to DHA .
That said , nuts have so many beneficial effects that I would not want to recommend that people eat less than they want .
Seeds have not been studied like nuts , so it ’s hard for me to say if they are as healthy as nuts .
The easiest way to ensure you are getting enough DHA is just to take a DHA supplement , and then you do not need to worry if your omega - 6s are preventing the conversion of ALA into DHA .
You can read more about omega - 3s here .
So , big branding has co-opted the revolution and claimed it for their own .
I just saw another miracle whip ad .
Hipsters doing hipster things with faux hand made titles and a voice over that sounds like an indie film .
Car companies tried this in the nineties , but we still had at least a little bit of personal identity left and rejected them wholesale .
Now , the new generation that grew up in the branded world are old enough to be the consumers , and they buy into it .
They see ads where Mountain Dew talks like they are part of community activism because the general public gets to pick the colours , design the logos and creating fucking blogs about it .
It ’s over , the revolution has been co-opted so completely that it is now in the hands of the people we were revolting against .
Consumerism won the day , it absorbed the anti-brand message , it dragged the culture jamming into its commercials and made them its own .
So , fuck the brand giants , fuck starbucks , and Mcdonalds and Nike , and Comedy Central , and SyFy .
It ’s time to go out and find a piece of reality .
I have a new project I am starting , called the preservers .
There are some details of it I will make public now , some will come in time .
So , heres a public one .
When you get a coupon from Starbucks , carry it with you .
When a homeless person asks you for change , politely explain that you have no change on you , but give them the Starbucks coupon .
Do it as often as you can .
This is mission number 1 .
There will be more .
The funny thing ?
I now own a branding agency .
Really , my company does branding , advertising and web development .
Juggalos be loving science too
" Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . "

The video Miracles has earned Insane Clown Posse many new fans and an unfair reputation as being anti-science .
Insane Clown Polytechnic is trying to clarify this misconception .
Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J have explained in interviews that they were promoting a positive appreciation for the natural wonders of the world .
See the full explanation below .
Some people say we , the Juggalo fans of " The Insane Clown Posse " , lack basic scientific understanding on subjects like fucking magnetism , light , and nature .
Fortunately , us Juggalos will be outside the Warfield Theater on June 5th , 2010 to show that Juggalos understand science too .
To that end , we will be setting up a Science Fair outside the Warfield between 6 pm - 8 pm to demonstrate several of the scientific principles which some people think confuse us .
We are not haters , we are family .
We love science , we love ICP , we love the Fam , and we think that the more Juggalos who stand up as scrub for science , the less the jocks and the haters will make fun of the geeks and clowns and ninjas who really run the muthafucking world .

Violent J Explains ICP 's Stance On Science [ edit ]
Here 's what Shaggy said in an interview about Miracles from Hatchet Harold :
I do n't know what Webster 's definition of the word " miracle " is , but we 've always thought it meant something fuckin ' amazing and incredible .
A fuckin ' special , awesome event of some kind .
A great , wonderful thing .
A fuckin ' miracle .
The song " Miracles " is classic ICP .
Our listeners know we 've always included one or two deep , meaningful songs on our albums , we 've just never made a video for one until now .
It was a good idea , obviously , `cause it 's got people talkin' .
The truth is it do n't make us mad to see all the hate " Miracles " gets from the mainstream .
We 've been " The Most Hated Band in The World " for many years .
Without all the hate on the outside , it would n't be as warm as it is on the inside with the Juggalo Fam .
Instead , all the hate " Miracles " generates makes us sad .
Sad for the haters .
I mean , yeah , we get it .
It 's funny to people on the outside lookin ' in , seeing two clowns rapping about space and shit , while floatin ' around in an orgy of screen savers .
And SNL 's parody was off the hook hilarious .
But when you step back and really look at all the genuine hate it got from everyday people , it 's hard to believe that so few got it .
Yes , most of the miracles we mention can easily be explained away by science , that 's why we say the line " fuck scientists . "
Their factual findings sometimes explain away the Earth 's cool mysteries .
Part of me wishes they were lying .
Part of me does n't want to know how they really make crop circles .
My imagination wants to believe it 's aliens or somethin' .
If people can't relate to that , then that 's their loss .
I mean , seriously , it must truly suck to have no imagination about these things .
Us Juggalos have deep imaginations , and an awesome sense of humor .
As for the infamous line , " fuckin ' magnets ... how do they work ? "
Magnets were like magic to me as a kid .
You could move things across the table without actually touching them !
I found that shit amazing and I still do .
If you do n't like that , have a dick for dinner .
As for the sun and the stars .
Who looks up into the sky and does n't wonder sometimes ?
Come on , man , I fuckin ' straight up feel sorry for anybody that can look at the moon the trees , and the seven seas , and not see fuckin ' miracles .
It 's not about religion either .
Nature itself is a miracle .
Stand toe to toe with the ocean at night and tell me that shit ain't amazing .
We appreciate all this shit .
Especially a yellow ass , long neck giraffe .
What 's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all .
They lost their spirit about everything .
If you can't even see the miracle in animals , then you must have never truly loved a pet .
That has to suck for you .
Maybe you mother fuckers should relax that wound up , extra tense bitch ass of yours for a minute and go smoke a joint or somethin' .
Be an individual , step out and away from the flow of the crowd .
Take a time out , open up ya mind and then peep the giraffe .
Try to appreciate some of these miracles , bitch .
What 's a miracle is the fact that some people have n't recognized by now that Insane Clown Posse will never die .
ICP will go down in history as an independent music miracle .
Get used to these ugly faces .

I can take this one .
However , it might be better if we had a more focused presentation on magnets , but with some ancillary experts on topics that Juggalos may be interested in .
Flipzagging 17:08 , 1 June 2010 ( UTC )
This is the one I 've sat an thought about presentation ideas for .
Really depends on how deep one wants to go - Huygens - Fresnel and wavefronts bending will need to be around if we wanna dig down , but the basic idea I 've been thinking about is " Light bends when it slows down .
Different materials let light go at different speeds .
It all depends on wavelengths , and thus on color .
Look here - a prism and a white LED keychain . "
Michiexile 02:10 , 2 June 2010 ( UTC ) Richard Feynmann attempts to answer this question , with difficulty , after explaining that any answer he gives is likely to be unsatisfying .
It 's hard to discuss the fundamental forces in any terms other than their own .
Mandatory listening for whoever 's doing the magnets poster .
- 76.215.56.38 19:05 , 4 June 2010 ( UTC )
Light never slows down , ever .
Different colors refract at different angles because of their energy level .
But all colors regardless of wavelength travel at the same speed - the speed of light .
quasar
Michiexile is correct .
The velocity of light varies within substances .
Snell 's
Law expresses the index of refraction at the boundary of two substances as the ratio of the the velocities of light within those substances .
For example light goes almost half as fast through arsenic trisulfide as it does in air , so arsenic trisulfide has an IOR of 1.9 .
- Laszlo 18:20 , 2 June 2010 ( UTC )
Cool , I did not know that .
I see what you 're saying .
The way I 'm reading it , it 's not the light slowing down so much as light taking a break and spending some time in an electron .
quasar
A first approximation at something that can be said , and quickly , to this subject : http://img.skitch.com/20100604-p6kip79xgceh24ane4gqsjrwpy.png
Michiexile 22:18 , 4 June 2010 ( UTC )
How far do you want to go into this ?
" Why does light bend ? "
Eventually you will start to overlap with the magnet explanation ! :)
-- Macegr 22:33 , 4 June 2010 ( UTC )
It wo n't take long at all to start overlapping with magnets here .
Not all that surprising either !
The next step , however , is to talk about Huygens - Fresnel , and viewing each point along the refraction boundary as a wavesource , and then showing how the speed change makes the wavefronts change direction .
Going even this deep , however , puts the whole explanation way past the one - sentence explanation , and even way past the 1 - minute elevator talk .
Michiexile 17:43 , 5 June 2010 ( UTC )
Another part that I have n't even started to adress is " Why is the rainbow round ? " - which ties in with the rainbow " really " being a circle , and with how we see each colour only through the exact raindrops that are at the right position for the light to bend just right to hit our eye - which happens , for a point - shaped light source ( the sun ) to be in a circle : the circle of things that are just the right amount of ( angular ) distance from a straight line , thus giving the circular " rainbow " .
Final bit of _this_ explanation , then , is the observation that usually , rainbows are visible with the sun in such an angle that the rainbow is partially hidden by the horizon .
Michiexile 17:43 , 5 June 2010 ( UTC )
I 'm bringing a colour printout of the illustration I linked above today .
If anybody wants to use it in an explanation of rainbows , that 's awesome ; otherwise - big deal .
I 'm a lab assistant , not a scientist ( see above ) , anyway , so I wo n't do that much explanation tonight .
Laszlo would like to present cognitive dissonance theory as an explanation for how misattributed anger toward scientists can lead to their mischaracterization as motherfucking liars .
Scientists can be Family too .

The more I read about Emperor Norton the more I think he totally rules .
North Korea threatened on Saturday to respond with nuclear weapons to a major US - South Korean naval exercise starting this weekend , saying it was ready for a " retaliatory sacred war " .
The threat came from the powerful National Defence Commission ( NDC ) , chaired by leader Kim Jong - Il , as tensions grew over the sinking of a South Korean warship which Seoul and Washington blame on Pyongyang .
The North routinely threatens war in response to joint military exercises by the two long - time allies , calling them a rehearsal for war .
But tensions have been high for the past two months , since the US and South Korea accused the North of torpedoing the warship with the loss of 46 lives .
The North denies involvement and says the " smear campaign " is a pretext for aggression .
The Facebook Movie Will Not Be Using Facebook to Market the Facebook Movie
You might think a huge target audience and golden marketing opportunity for a high - profile Hollywood movie on Facebook , titled “ The Social Network , ” would be the 500 million members of Facebook .
Maybe not so much .
“ Facebook ’s advertising guidelines do n’t allow ads to reference the company unless Facebook has cooperated with the object of the ad , ” said Steve Elzer , SVP of Media Relations for Sony ( SNE ) movie unit Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group , in response to a BoomTown query .
“ So , we wo n’t be advertising there given these parameters . ”
And reference Facebook the film surely does , as you can see from this capture image from its
Web site , above , which mimics the social networking site ’s look and has a big picture of the actor playing co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg looking like he just was indicted for doing something very naughty .
The tag line : “ You do n’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies . ”
Although the film is not coming out until October , the makers of “ The Social Network ” are now in the market making plans to tout the controversial movie about the founding of Facebook .
That would include looking for a series of advertising buys online–including inquiries to market it on this site–related to the company , such as linking the movie with topic words such as “ privacy . ”
No wonder the privacy - challenged Facebook is not having any of it , especially since Zuckerberg publicly expressed distaste for the film in a recent onstage interview at the eighth D : All Things Digital conference .
He also told me in a conversation there that he dreads its release , because of inaccuracies in the book it was based on .
It ’s a good instinct by the Silicon Valley wunderkind , since the trailer for the film was recently released ( you can see it below ) and it portrays Zuckerberg as a conniving punk .
A genius , too , but definitely a punk .
In fact , the trailer uses that word exactly , in a scary manner , as I wrote :
“ Using only portentous voices , big menacing words and doom - filled music , it gives a whole new meaning to poking .
For example , the lines , ‘ The site got 2,200 hits within two hours ?
No , 22,000 … , ’ sounds like someone knew what Facebook did last summer–probably violated the privacy of the wrong hostel host––and is coming to take some body parts . ”
Facebook PR honcho Elliot Schrage confirms that Facebook wo n’t be taking any advertising dollars from the Facebook movie .
“ My understanding is that they asked us for our ad guidelines and decided not to advertise on us after receiving them , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think they ever submitted ad copy for us to review . ”
Here ’s the video of the trailer , so you can see why :

In Non-strict memoization , I sketched out a means of memoizing non-strict functions .
I gave the essential insight but did not show the details of how a nonstrict memoization library comes together .
In this new post , I give details , which are a bit delicate , in terms of the implementation described in Elegant memoization with higher - order types .
Near the end , I run into some trouble with regular data types , which I do n’t know how to resolve cleanly and efficiently .
Edits :
2010 -09 - 10 : Fixed minor typos .
Hyper -strict memo tries
Strict memoization ( really hyper - strict ) is centered on a family of trie functors , defined as a functor Trie k , associated with a type k .
type k :→ : v = Trie k v class HasTrie k where type Trie k :: * → * trie :: ( k → v ) → ( k :→ : v ) untrie :: ( k :→ : v ) → ( k → v )
The simplest instance is for the unit type :
instance HasTrie ( ) where type Trie ( ) =
Id trie f = Id ( f ( ) ) untrie ( Id v ) = λ ( ) → v
For consistency with other types , I just made a small change from the previous version , which used const v instead of the stricter λ ( ) → v .
Sums and products are a little more intricate :
instance ( HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) ⇒ HasTrie ( Either a b ) where type Trie ( Either a b ) = Trie a :*:
Trie b trie f = trie ( f ∘ Left ) :*: trie ( f ∘ Right ) untrie ( ta :* : tb ) = untrie ta `either` untrie tb instance ( HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) ⇒ HasTrie ( a , b ) where type Trie ( a , b ) = Trie a :.
Trie b trie f = O ( trie ( trie ∘ curry f ) ) untrie ( O tt ) = uncurry ( untrie ∘ untrie tt )
These trie types are not just strict , they ’re hyper - strict .
During trie search , arguments get thorougly evaluated .
( See Section 9 in the paper Denotational design with type class morphisms . )
In other words , all of the points of possible undefinedness are lost .
Strict and non-strict memo tries
The formulation of strict tries will look very like the hyper - strict tries we ’ve already seen , with new names for the associated trie type and the conversion methods :
type k :→ v = STrie k v class HasTrie k where type STrie k :: * → * sTrie :: ( k → v ) → ( k :→ v ) sUntrie :: HasLub v ⇒ ( k :→ v ) → ( k → v )
Besides renaming , I ’ve also added a HasLub constraint for sUntrie , which we ’ll need later .
For instance , the ( almost ) simplest strict trie is the one for the unit type , defined exactly as before ( with new names ) :
instance HasTrie ( ) where type STrie ( ) =
Id sTrie f = Id ( f ( ) ) s Untrie ( Id v ) = λ ( ) → v
For non-strict memoization , we ’ll want to recover all of the points of possible undefinedness lost in hyper - strict memoization .
At every level of a structured value , there is the possibility of ⊥ or of a non-⊥ value .
Correspondingly , a non -strict trie consists of the value corresponding to the argument ⊥ , together with a strict ( but not hyper - strict ) trie for the non-⊥ values :
data Trie k v =
Trie v ( k :→ v ) type k :→ : v = Trie k v
The conversions between functions and non-strict tries are no longer methods , as they can be defined uniformly for all domain types .
To form a non-strict trie , capture the function ’s value at ⊥ , and build a strict ( but not hyper - strict ) trie :
trie :: ( HasTrie k ) ⇒ ( k → v ) → ( k :→ : v ) trie f = Trie ( f ⊥) ( sTrie f )
To convert back from a non -strict trie to a ( now memoized ) function , combine the information from two sources : the original function ’s value at ⊥ , and the function resulting from the strict ( but not hyper - strict ) trie :
untrie :: ( HasTrie k , HasLub v ) ⇒ ( k :→ : v ) → ( k → v ) untrie ( Trie b t ) = const b ⊔ sUntrie t
The least - upper - bound ( ⊔ ) here is well - defined because its arguments are information - compatible ( consistent , non-contradictory ) .
More strongly , const b ⊑ sUntrie t , i.e. , the first argument is an information approximation to ( contains no information absent from ) the second argument .
Now we see the need for HasLub v in the type of sUntrie above : functions are ⊔- able exactly when their result types are .
Sums
Just as non -strict tries contain strict tries , so also strict tries contain non-strict tries .
For instance , consider a sum type , Either a b .
An element is either ⊥ or Left x or Right y , for x :: a and y :: b .
The types a and b also contain a bottom element , so we ’ll need non -strict memo tries for them :
instance ( HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) ⇒ HasTrie ( Either a b ) where type STrie ( Either a b ) = Trie a :*: Trie b sTrie f = trie ( f ∘ Left ) :*: trie ( f ∘ Right ) s Untrie ( ta :* : tb ) = untrie ta `either` untrie tb
Just as in the unit instance ( above ) , the only visible change from hyper - strict to strict is that the left - hand sides use the strict trie type and operations .
The right - hand sides are written exactly as before , though now they refer to non-strict tries and their operations .
Products
With product , we run into some trouble .
As a first attempt , change only the names on the left - hand side :
instance ( HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) ⇒ HasTrie ( a , b ) where type STrie ( a , b ) = Trie a :.
Trie b sTrie f = O ( trie ( trie ∘ curry f ) ) s Untrie ( O tt ) = uncurry ( untrie ∘ untrie tt )
This sUntrie definition , however , leads to an error in type - checking :
Could not deduce ( HasLub ( Trie b v ) ) from the context ( HasLub v ) arising from a use of `untrie '
The troublesome untrie use is the one applied directly to tt .
( Thank you for column numbers , GHC . )
So what ’s going on here ?
Since sUntrie in this definition takes a ( a , b ) :→ v , or equivalently , STrie ( a , b ) v ,
O tt :: ( a , b ) :→ v :: STrie ( a , b ) v :: ( Trie a :. Trie b) v
The definition of type composition ( from an earlier post ) is
newtype ( g :. f ) x = O ( g ( f x ) )
So
tt :: Trie a ( Trie b v ) :: a :→ : b :→ : v
and
untrie tt :: HasLub ( b :→ : v ) ⇒ a → ( b :→ : v )
The HasLub constraint comes from the type of untrie ( above ) .
Continuing ,
untrie ∘ untrie tt :: ( HasLub v , HasLub ( b :→ : v ) ) ⇒ a → ( b → v ) uncurry ( untrie ∘ untrie tt ) :: ( HasLub v , HasLub ( b :→ : v ) ) ⇒ ( a , b ) → v
which is almost the required type but contains the extra requirement that HasLub ( b :→ : v ) .
Hm .
Looking at the definition of Trie and the definitions of STrie for various domain types b , I think it ’s the case that HasLub ( b :→ : v ) , whenever HasLub v , exactly as needed .
In principle , I could make this requirement of b explicit as a superclass for HasTrie :
class ( forall v. HasLub v ⇒ HasLub ( b :→ : v ) ) ⇒ HasTrie k where ...
However , Haskell ’s type system is n’t quite expressive enough , even with GHC extensions ( as far as I know ) .
A possible solution
We could instead define a functor - level variant of HasLub :
class HasLubF f where lubF :: HasLub v ⇒ f v → f v → f v
and then use lubF instead of ( ⊔ ) in sUntrie .
The revised HasTrie class definition :
class HasLubF ( Trie k ) ⇒ HasTrie k where type STrie k :: * → * sTrie :: ( k → v ) → ( k :→ v ) sUntrie :: HasLub v ⇒ ( k :→ v ) → ( k → v )
I would rather not replicate and modify the HasLub class and all of its instances , so I ’m going to set this idea aside and look for another .
Another route
Let ’s return to the problematic definition of sUntrie for pairs :
s Untrie ( O tt ) = uncurry ( untrie ∘ untrie tt )
and recall that tt :: a :→ : b :→ : v .
The strategy here was to first convert the outer trie ( with domain a ) and then the inner trie ( with domain b ) .
Alternatively , we might reverse the order .
If we ’re going to convert inside - out instead of outside - in , then we ’ll need a way to transform each of the range elements of a trie .
Which is exactly what fmap is for .
If only we had a functor instance for Trie a , then we could re-define sUntrie on pair tries as follows :
s Untrie ( O tt ) = uncurry ( untrie ( fmap untrie tt ) )
As a sanity check , try compiling this definition .
Sure enough , it ’s okay except for a missing Functor instance :
Could not deduce ( Functor ( Trie a ) ) from the context ( HasTrie ( a , b ) , HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) arising from a use of `fmap '
Fixed easily enough :
instance Functor ( STrie k ) ⇒ Functor ( Trie k ) where fmap f ( Trie b t ) = Trie ( f b ) ( fmap f t )
Or even , using the GHC language extensions DeriveFunctor and StandaloneDeriving , just
deriving instance Functor ( STrie k ) ⇒ Functor ( Trie k )
Now we get a slightly different error message .
We ’re now missing a Functor instance for STrie a instead of Trie a :
Could not deduce ( Functor ( STrie a ) ) from the context ( HasTrie ( a , b ) , HasTrie a , HasTrie b ) arising from a use of `fmap '
By the way , we can also construct tries inside - out , if we want :
s Trie f = O ( fmap trie ( trie ( curry f ) ) )
So we ’ll be in good shape if we can satisfy the Functor requirement on strict tries .
Fortunately , all of the strict trie ( higher - order ) types appearing are indeed functors , since we built them up using functor combinators .
Still , we ’ll have to help the type - checker prove that all of the trie types it involved must indeed be functors .
Again , a superclass constraint can capture this requirement :
class Functor ( STrie k ) ⇒ HasTrie k where ...
Unlike HasLub , this time the required constraint is already at the functor level , so we do n’t have to define a new class .
We do n’t even have to define any new instances , as our functor combinators come with Functor instances , all of which can be derived automatically by GHC .
With this one change , all of the HasTrie instances go through !
Isomorphisms
As pointed out in Memoizing higher - order functions , type isomorphism is the central , repeated theme of functional memoization .
In addition to the isomorphism between functions and tries , the tries for many types are given via isomorphism with other types that have tries .
In this way , we only have to define tries for our tiny set of functor combinators .
Isomorphism support is as in Elegant memoization with higher - order types , just using the new names :
# define HasTrieIsomorph ( Context , Type , IsoType , toIso , fromIso ) instance Context ⇒ HasTrie ( Type ) where { type STrie ( Type ) = STrie ( IsoType ) ; sTrie f = s Trie ( f ∘ ( fromIso ) ) ; sUntrie t = sUntrie t ∘ ( toIso ) ; }
Note the use of strict tries even on the right - hand sides .
Aside : as mentioned in Composing memo tries , trie / untrie forms not just an isomorphism but a pair of type class morphisms ( TCMs ) .
( For motivation and examples of TCMs in software design , see Denotational design with type class morphisms . )
Regular data types
Regular data types are isomorphic to fixed - points of functors .
Elegant memoization with higher - order types gives a brief introduction to these notions and pointers to more information .
That post also shows how to use the Regular type class and its instances ( defined for other purposes as well ) to provide hyper - strict memo tries for all regular data types .
Switching from hyper - strict to non-strict raises an awkward issue .
The functor isomorphisms we used are only correct for fully defined data - types .
When we allow full or partial undefinedness , as in a lazy language like Haskell , our isomorphisms break down .
Following A Lightweight Approach to Datatype - Generic Rewriting , here is the class I used , where “ PF ” stands for “ pattern functor ” :
class Functor ( PF t ) ⇒ Regular t where type PF t :: * → * unwrap :: t → PF t t wrap :: PF t t → t
The unwrap method peels off a single layer from a regular type .
For example , the top level of a list is either a unit ( nil ) or a pair ( cons ) of an element and a hole in which a list can be placed .
instance Regular [ a ] where type PF [ a ] = Unit :+: Const a :*: Id -- note Unit == Const ( ) unwrap [ ] = InL ( Const ( ) ) unwrap ( a:as ) = InR ( Const a :*: Id as ) wrap ( InL ( Const ( ) ) ) = [ ] wrap ( InR ( Const a :*: Id as ) ) = a:as
The catch here is that the unwrap and wrap methods do not really form an isomorphism .
Instead , they satisfy a weaker connection : they form embedding / projection pair .
That is ,
wrap ∘ unwrap ≡ id unwrap ∘ wrap ⊑ id
To see the mismatch between [ a ] and PF [ a ] [ a ] , note that the latter has opportunities for partial undefinedness that have no corresponding opportunities in [ a ] .
Specifically , ⊥ could occur at type Const ( ) [ a ] , ( ) , ( Const a :*: Id ) [ a ] , Const a [ a ] , or Id [ a ] .
Any of these ⊥ values will result in wrap returning ⊥ altogether .
For instance , if
oops :: PF [ Integer ] oops = InR ( ⊥ :*: Id [ 3,5 ] )
then
unwrap ( wrap oops ) ≡ unwrap ⊥ ≡ ⊥ ⊑ oops
By examining various cases , we can prove that unwrap ( wrap p ) ⊑ p for all p , which is to say unwrap ∘ wrap ⊑ id , since information ordering on functions is defined point - wise .
( See Merging partial values . )
Examining the definition of unwrap above shows that it does not give rise to the troublesome ⊥ points , and so a trivial equational proof shows that wrap ∘ unwrap ≡ id .
In the context of memoization , the additional undefined values are problematic .
Consider the case of lists .
The specification macro
HasTrieRegular1([ ] , ListSTrie )
expands into a newtype and its HasTrie instance .
Changing only the associated type and method names in the version for hyper - strict memoization :
newtype ListSTrie a v = ListSTrie ( PF [ a ] [ a ] :→ : v ) instance HasTrie a ⇒ HasTrie [ a ] where type STrie [ a ] = ListSTrie a s Trie f = ListSTrie ( sTrie ( f . wrap ) ) sUntrie ( ListSTrie t) = s Untrie t .
unwrap
Note that the trie in ListSTrie trie contains entries for many ⊥ sub-elements that do not correspond to any list values .
The memoized function is f ∘ wrap , which will have many fewer ⊥ possibilities than the trie structure supports .
At each of the superfluous ⊥ points , the function sampled is strict , so the Trie ( rather than STrie ) will contain a predictable ⊥.
Considering the definition of untrie :
untrie ( Trie b t ) = const b ⊔ sUntrie t
we know b ≡ ⊥ , and so const b ⊔ sUntrie t ≡ sUntrie t .
Thus , at these points , the ⊥ value is never helpful , and we could use a strict ( though not hyper - strict ) trie instead of a non -strict trie .
Perhaps we could safely ignore this whole issue and lose only some efficiency , rather than correctness .
Still , I ’d rather build and traverse just the right trie for our regular types .
As this post is already longer than I intended , and my attention is wandering , I ’ll publish it here and pick up later .
Comments & suggestions please !
In Non-strict memoization , I sketched out a means of memoizing non-strict functions .
I gave the essential insight but did not show the details of how a nonstrict memoization library comes ...

On July 15 , 1979 , President Jimmy Carter spoke to the American people about the " Crisis of Confidence " faced by Americans who were losing faith in the government and who increasingly feared that their children would be worse - off than them .
In this famous speech , Carter laments the loss of American values in the face of rising consumerism .
Our people are losing that faith , not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy .
As a people we know our past and we are proud of it .
Our progress has been part of the living history of America , even the world .
We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy , involved in the search for freedom , and that belief has always strengthened us in our purpose .
But just as we are losing our confidence in the future , we are also beginning to close the door on our past .
In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close - knit communities , and our faith in God , too many of us now tend to worship self - indulgence and consumption .
Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns .
But we 've discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning .
We 've learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose .
The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us .
For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next 5 years will be worse than the past 5 years .
Two - thirds of our people do not even vote .
The productivity of American workers is actually dropping , and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world .
Sound familiar ?
Setting aside the religion issue for the moment , it 's clear that we face many of the same problems Carter discussed in 1979 today – and more .
We are no longer a nation at peace everywhere around the world .
The energy crisis has worsened .
Consumer debt and national debt is out of control .
Millions of Americans have been pushed out of their homes and unemployment is reaching record highs .
Still , in the face of clear evidence that rampant consumption is unsustainable , we measure the health of our economy by our spending .
Still , we measure the quality of American life by our ability to spend .
It 's like consumerism has practically replaced citizenship .
But how did this happen ?
How did we go from a nation of citizens to a country of consumers ?
Liberals will argue that rampant de-regulation was the culprit .
Conservatives will say that free market capitalism is the purest expression of democracy .
Personally , I 'm less interested in esoteric discussions about economic theory than I am in conversations about how we , the citizens of America , can impact the future of our own communities .
How can we re-build the sense of community and common purpose in our local neighborhoods ?
How can we restore values of thrift and saving for the future ?
How can we work together to restore a sense of confidence in the future of America ?
We are at a turning point in our history .
There are two paths to choose .
One is a path I 've warned about tonight , the path that leads to fragmentation and self - interest .
Down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom , the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others .
That path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility .
It is a certain route to failure .
All the traditions of our past , all the lessons of our heritage , all the promises of our future point to another path , the path of common purpose and the restoration of American values .
That path leads to true freedom for our Nation and ourselves .
21 years after Jimmy Carter delivered his speech , a movement is growing to take up his mission to " commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the American spirit . "
Neighborhoods across the country are taking their communities into their hands .
The number of farmers ' markets has more than tripled since the mid-90s .
Activists in cities across the country are supporting community projects like urban farming , bicycle lanes , and community art projects .
Location - based technologies like Foursquare and Loopt are exploding in popularity as citizens are seeking to be more connected to their local communities .
In their upcoming book , What 's Mine is Yours , Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers argue , " [ In ] the 20th century of hyper - consumption we were defined by credit , advertising , and what we owned , and how in the 21st century of Collaborative Consumption we will be defined by reputation , community , and by what we can access . "
Collaborative Consumption is an explosive movement of " sharing , bartering , lending , trading , renting , gifting , and swapping … that is transforming business , consumerism and the way we live . "
The authors examine the growth of services like ZipCar , Swaptree , Couchsurfing , and NeighborGoods .
As the founder of NeighborGoods , a peer - to - peer lending and borrowing service for local neighborhoods , I 'm proud to be a part of this consumer citizen - driven effort to rebuild local communities and restore confidence in America 's future .
But how can borrowing and lending household goods help restore confidence in America 's future ?
At NeighborGoods , we believe that hidden inside all the stuff you own is a whole bunch of latent value .
The items you are not using on a regular basis hold latent monetary value as well as social value .
Obviously , when you share objects with others , you are helping your neighbors save money .
By getting more use out of your power drill , you are extracting more of its monetary value .
By sharing that power drill , you are also creating stronger social bonds with your neighbor , thus extracting the hidden social value in that object .
We 've spent most of the 20th century buying objects and building fences to protect them .
NeighborGoods and other sharing services help us lower those fences as we transition into the more sustainable , less consumer - driven economy of the 21st century .
By lowering your fences and sharing with people around you , you are actively participating in the Collaborative Consumption movement .
You , my generous and forward - thinking friends , are true citizens .
Citizenship is the state of being a citizen of a particular social , political , or national community .
Citizenship status , under social contract theory , carries with it both rights and responsibilities .
" Active citizenship " is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation , public , volunteer work , and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens .
In this vein , schools in some countries provide citizenship education .
Citizenship was equated by Virginia Leary ( 1999 ) as connoting " a bundle of rights — primarily , political participation in the life of the community , the right to vote , and the right to receive certain protection from the community , as well as obligations . "

For only the second time since Big Blue entered the Unix market for real in February 1990 with the launch of the RS / 6000 line of workstations and servers , the company is letting customers who use its
Power - based servers take a future AIX release for a test drive in an open beta program .
The AIX 7 open beta , which launches today , gives customers a download of the binaries in a DVD ISO image that they can burn onto media and install on the last several generations of Power machines .
You can get the AIX 7 code here .
AIX 7 will run on any machine based on the PowerPC 970 ( remember that one , which was used in the initial IBM blade servers ? ) as well as on pSeries , System p , and Power Systems machines that employ Power4 , Power4 + , Power 5 , Power5 + , Power6 , Power6 + , and Power7 chips .
( Presumably any of the iSeries and System i machines , which use IBM 's OS / 400 and i proprietary operating systems , that supported AIX inside logical partitions can also run the AIX 7 beta code , too , but IBM does n't say this . )
The main thing , says Jay Kruemcke , AIX marketing manager within IBM's Power Systems division , is that customers can't run the code in production environments - in fact , the download agreement prohibits this , no doubt to absolve IBM of any responsibility in case someone uses AIX 7 in production .
In addition to letting Power Systems customers get their hands on the AIX 7 code , IBM let loose some of the details on the future AIX above and beyond what El Reg has already told you about the release , which is also called AIX 7.1 just to be confusing .
AIX 7 will support a single system image that spans 256 cores and 1,024 threads and perhaps as much as 8 TB of main memory , which is four times the iron that was supported by the current AIX 6.1 release .
IBM says that AIX 7 will be binary compatible with the prior AIX 5.1 and 5.2 releases ( which are currently off support ) and the AIX 5.3 and 6.1 releases that are still supported by Big Blue .
One interesting thing about the future AIX 7 is that it has a tweaked version of IBM's Workload Partitions ( WPARs for short , in IBMspeak ) that will allow for AIX 5.2 to run inside the partitions .
WPARs are akin to virtual private server partitions like Solaris containers and BSD jails , which have a single operating system kernel and file system that look like multiple operating systems , complete with their own security and tuning , for applications to be isolated in .
WPARs are distinct from logical partitions , or LPARs , implemented by the PowerVM hypervisor , which abstracts the Power iron and allows full AIX , i , or Linux operating systems - with their own kernels and file systems - to run side by side and in a more fully isolated fashion .
With AIX 7 , customers can take a logical partition running AIX 5.2 and restore it onto an AIX WPAR ; this is useful because IBM 's live migration in the AIX environment only works on WPARs , not LPARs .
During the beta , IBM is enabling this AIX 5.2 LPAR to WPAR migration to be tested on earlier Power systems , but when AIX 7 does go into production later this year - perhaps in September or October , according to the latest roadmaps from IBM , but really dependent on how the beta goes - this capability will only be enabled on Power7 - based machines running AIX 7 .
AIX 7 will also take full advantage of all the power management and virtualization features in Power7 systems , but given the relatively few Power7 machines in the field , IBM is not expecting this code to get the same number of eyeballs on it as other AIX 7 features .
Another WPAR enhancement is to allow Fibre Channel adapters to be pegged directly to and be owned by a specific WPAR , which IBM says helps simplify the management of storage on AIX systems that have been virtualized .
There is some complaining in the AIX and i customer bases about the AIX Virtual I/O Server that is used to virtualize storage and networking for LPARs running on the PowerVM hypervisor , and presumably letting WPARs own their own I / O not only simplifies configuration , but boosts performance .
IBM also says that AIX 7 will come with built - in high availability clustering for AIX - based systems , but did not elaborate .
IBM sells PowerHA SystemMirror clustering software for AIX boxes , formerly known as HACMP and which has been available since 1991 .
PowerHA SystemMirror allows up to 32 AIX boxes to be clustered together with shared storage , allowing boxes to back each other up in the event of a crash .
It could be that IBM is going to bundle the basic PowerHA clustering software in AIX Enterprise Edition , its high - end variant of AIX with all the bells and whistles .
Other AIX 7 enhancements include domain support in the role - based access control security modules of the operating system , which will help hosting companies with multiple tenants to restrict access to volume groups , file systems , and devices across multiple domains .
AIX thin servers ( which are diskless and dataless AIX images booted from storage over NFS ) will be enhanced to support NFS v4 and IPv6 .
IBM will also be tweaking the EtherChannel Ethernet link aggregation feature of its TCP / IP stack ( used in conjunction with Catalyst switches from Cisco systems ) to support some new features of the IEEE 802.3 ad standard .
With the AIX 6.1 beta program , which was launched in July 2007 concurrently with the first rollouts of machines based on the dual - core Power6 processors , over 1,000 companies participated in the beta program , says Kruemcke .
IBM had never done a beta program before , and did n't know exactly what to expect , but these numbers were larger than Big Blue anticipated .
Even if they pale compared to the number of companies that participate in Windows or Linux betas , all Unix shops , like mainframe and proprietary midrange shops , are extremely conservative and do n't usually have a lot of fallow RISC , Itanium , or proprietary iron laying around , given its high cost .
But independent software vendors who peddle AIX products do have iron to build and test their code , and they want to get their applications up to snuff on the new release .
About 30 per cent of the companies that tested AIX 6.1 three years ago were ISVs who , for whatever reason , did not go through the normal channels to gain access to the impending Unix release to get started on porting and testing their code .
The net effect of this , says Kruemcke , is that ISVs were primed for the actual AIX 6.1 release , and many more applications were ready in the wake of the delivery of the operating system than IBM would have otherwise been able to count on .
It is reasonable that the AIX 7 beta will get ISVs moving again .
Some users are also keen on moving ahead , says Kruemcke .
" A large number of customers are on AIX 5.3 , and many of them are looking very seriously about jumping straight to AIX 7 . "
AIX 6.1 had two betas , with everyone participating in the first and only a small percentage messing around with the tweaks that IBM did in the second beta .
So this time around , IBM is only planning to do one beta for AIX 7 . ®
Barcelona ’s new president Sandro Rosell revealed earlier this week that the football club is having to take out a € 150 million loan in order to ease financial debts .
Despite the enormity of the football club which generates high income via merchandise sales and tickets it is in a real financial mess as mass spending on new players and wages has contributed to their red status .
Dmytro Chygrynskiy was sold back to Shakhtar Donestk for € 15 million as a financial necessity and clearly illustrates The Blaugrana ’s problems if they have to sell players to ease their finance worries .
Despite their huge debt which is believed to be in the region of €326 million , the football club has seen their revenue rise via marketing and player transfers .
The size of the debt is worrying to see but Rosell has assured that the club will be able to pay for the important necessities such as wages for the players , staff and personnel .
The La Liga champions are as you know not the only major European outfit in the red .
There are a number of clubs across the continent who are putting their existence on the line with the undertaking of heavy loans resulting in high interest payments .
Manchester United is a proven example .
They are arguably the biggest football club in the world along with Real Madrid where both clubs sit at the top of the football rich list as they generate the most revenue and income through their marketing policy and sale of tickets .
Despite that impressive statistic it does somewhat disguise the turbulence with their figures as both clubs are in heavy debt .
Since Manchester United was bought by the Glazers in 2005 the club has been slumped into severe financial woe .
They bought the club by loaning money from banks which now sits on their balance sheets which is bringing interest payments up .
The debt of the Manchester club is actually far greater than all thirty - six clubs in Germany ’s top two divisions .
That is a frightening fact .
Barcelona ’s debt is small change in comparison to United .
They are paying over £ 40 million alone in interest due to the size of their debt which is bringing it up .
The Glazers have revealed that they are refinancing the club but this will only be a short term fix .
In the long run it is impossible to see how this debt will be wiped clean unless it ’s sold on .
The Premier League is without a doubt the most lucrative and watched championship in the world .
The money which is generated by television rights alone is astonishing .
The BSkyB contract is massive and sees all twenty football clubs given an equal share of money .
In Spain ’s La Liga the football clubs have to negotiate their own contracts .
Unfortunately Real Madrid and Barcelona between them recoup more than half of the money that is available leaving the other eighteen clubs to fight over the scraps .
Chelsea Limited sees their debt stand at £ 726 million .
Owner Roman Abramovich took over the club in 2003 with the vision of bringing trophies to Stamford Bridge which he has certainly achieved over the last seven years .
Large amounts of money were spent on bringing players in as the Russian billionaire began his football monopoly .
In order to do this he loaned his money into a holding company , Chelsea Limited , who then loaned it onto Chelsea PLC who run the football club .
Last year the loans from the holding company to Chelsea PLC were converted into shares .
However Abramovich ’s loan to Chelsea Limited , the holding company which owns Chelsea PLC was not .
That means the loan still remains but it does not loom within the club but in Chelsea Limited .
Therefore Chelsea as a football club is more or less debt - free unlike its holding company .
Complicated circumstances indeed .
Abramovich is entitled to call in his debt whenever he feels as long as he gives eighteen months notice .
Unlike United no interest has to be paid so the figure will stand at what is or increase depending on Abramovich ’s willingness to inject more cash into the club .
The huge loans he has undertaken to run The Blues in the last seven years have not been written off .
Once again it seems impossible to see how this loan is going to be wiped clean in the coming years .
With UEFA now implementing rules threatening clubs to sort out their financial predicaments in the next few years it would seem that some are bound to face severe consequences unless they sort out their mess .
Real Madrid is one of the largest debtor ’s in world football .
When Florentino Perez won his second term as President last summer he lived up to his word of bringing in a mass influx of football stars .
They did arrive with heavy price tags .
He shattered the world record transfer twice in the space of a week as he lured Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo to the Spanish capital .
In total the club spent £ 360 million on new talent in the summer of 2009 .
Some of the clubs real - estate assets have had to be sold on in order to ease their financial difficulties .
Perez is doing his utmost to cut back on costs to try and bring debts down but is also spending large sums on new stars with Angel di Maria being the latest big money addition to Los Blancos .
Their financial worries will hardly damage the club in the long term .
Their domestic television contract is by far the richest in the world which stands at just over € 1 billion with MediaPro and are helped greatly by tax legislation .
The fact that Madrid is such an enormous entity in Spain means they are not faced with pressure from banks in order to pay back debts unlike in England and other countries .
Their status is formidable with a high political influence .
The power Madrid and Barcelona have in their domestic league is pretty undisputed .
Due to the enormity of both clubs their financial predicaments do not face harsh consequences like it does for others .
Valencia has had to sell their star players David Villa and David Silva to help eliminate the risk of being liquidised .
They have debts of more than €500 million and were bailed out by the regional Government when they agreed to guarantee a loan of € 74 million in August last year .
Again this is just heaping more and more high figures into their books resulting in higher interest payments .
Los
Che is in a real mess and has been for the last few years .
The importance of qualifying for the Champions League last season was pivotal in bringing in higher income .
Despite all the worries that elude the football clubs it is the fans who are suffering the most .
They are having to sit back and witness the predicaments their beloved clubs face and can’t help but worry about the possible repercussions .
UEFA are now taking a stance over the debts at last but it will be interesting to see if they do live up to their word of expelling teams from European competitions if their debts are not sorted out .
It is a growing and unhealthy trend in European football and it needs to be addressed by the hierarchy .
Below is a table ranking the ten most indebted clubs in Europe .
Manchester United sit at the top of pile accompanied by two other English outfits within the top four emphasising the superior debt levels in England ’s top flight .
Surprisingly Fulham Football Club also make the list with debts just under £ 200 million .
Ranking Club Debt 1 . Manchester United £ 716 m 2 . Chelsea ( Limited ) £ 701 m 3 . Valencia C.F £ 501 m 4 . Liverpool £ 351 m 5 . Real Madrid £ 296 m 6 . FC Barcelona £ 273 m 7 . AS Roma £ 271 m 8 . Schalke 04 £ 234 m 9 . Arsenal £ 203 m 10 .
Fulham £ 198m
Also The Football Association of England itself is in catastrophic debt .
The rebuilding of the new Wembley has contributed greatly to their woe as it has put a £ 350 million millstone over its neck alone .
With just an annual turnover of £ 300 million it does n’t even come close to easing their financial woes as the undertaking of other projects has pushed them further into the red .
The sheer complexity of the 2,319 - page Dodd - Frank financial reform bill is certainly a threat to future economic growth .
But if you sift through the many sections and subsections , you find much more than complexity to worry about .
The main problem with the bill is that it is based on a misdiagnosis of the causes of the financial crisis , which is not surprising since the bill was rolled out before the congressionally mandated Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission finished its diagnosis .

Fischer said there seems to be a lot of ambiguity about who has the right of way when it comes to crosswalks .

I would to thank all of you who offered thoughtful and valuable ideas for the public record regarding the BP Oil Spill !
To share your idea directly with BP call 1-281-366-5511
34 days after the BP Macondo oil well began spewing thousands of barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico , there has been relatively little success in stopping the flow .
BP promises a “ top kill ” ( injection of heavy mud ) of the well sometime this week , but there is no guarantee this will work leaving “ all options on the table ” .
You may have heard some pretty sensational ideas circulating in the media on how best to stop the flow of oil from the well .
Some of these ideas seem logical , while others are far fetched even in these desperate times .
Two weeks before the BP disaster , I wrote an article called An Introduction to Drilling Offshore Oil Wellsand several of you have expressed your thanks for explaining the oil drilling process to put BP ’s recent tragedy in perspective .
Many of you have also shared well plugging solutions of your own .
Do you have an idea for stopping the flow of oil from BP ’s Macondo well ?
Feel free to share you idea in the comments section below .
Who knows , you may be able to save the day !

Be the Match at DEF CON
Be The Match offers the unique opportunity for you to give a life - saving marrow transplant to someone in need .
Thousands of patients with leukemia and other life - threatening diseases depend on the Be The Match Registry , the largest and most diverse registry in the worlds , to find a life - saving donor .
The more potential donors that step forward , more resources are available to patients and more lives can be saved .
Description of the donor recruitment drive :
Be The Match will have a booth at DefCon 18 where individuals can register to be part of the Be The Match Registry .
All they need to be is between the ages of 18 and 60 , meet the health guidelines and be willing to donate to ANY patient in need .
At the recruitment drive , you will fill out a consent form with contact information and a short medical evaluation .
You will receive more information about what it means to be a donor and then you will swab the inside of your cheeks .
Your tissue type will be listed in the Be The Match Registry until your 61st Birthday .
If you are a match for someone in need , then you will be contacted for donation .

DEF CON 18 Contest Madness !
Over the past week or two , we 've had a flood of announcements for new contests !
Check them out below !
Dark Tangent 's Tamper Evident Contest
There are various tamper evident technologies out there , including tape , seals , locks , tags , and bags , to name a few .
This contest will test your ability to perform " defeats " ( Described below ) against a range of inexpensive commercial low to medium security products .
Backdoor Hiding Contest
Two in one Backdoor Hiding / Finding Contest ( participate in either or both ) :
In the first stage , hiding participants provide a source code hiding a backdoor , in the second stage organizers mix the source codes with non-backdoored ( placebos ) , and then ask finding participants to spot the placebos .
Hiding participants get hiding points for being voted as a placebo and finding participants get points for spotting the placebos and negative points for false positives .
KoreLogic 's " Crack Me If You Can " Contest
As a part of an authorized penetration test of a large corporate network , you have captured a large number of passwords hashes .
The hashes are from Active Directory , UNIX systems , LDAP servers , routers , etc .
As part of your analysis , your client has asked for password complexity statistics , what their users are doing right and / or wrong related to generating passwords , and identification of weak passwords .
You only have 48 hours to complete this effort .

Ten people accused of spying for Russia have tonight pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge , setting up what could be one of the biggest , most unusual and least secret spy swaps known to superpower espionage .
The defendants , members of a deep - cover spy ring broken up last week , all told the federal judge in New York they would plead guilty .
They were charged with being long term " deep cover " spies , eight of them posing as married couples with children .
But they were not accused of collecting classified information .
Two Obama administration sources said tonight that the Russian government would release four alleged western agents .
Igor Sutyagin , a Russian scientist convicted of working for the US , was reportedly flown to Vienna today as a first step toward the release of more than 20 alleged agents held in the US and Russia .
Britain was directly involved in the swap , officials made clear .
Sutyagin , an arms control analyst jailed for 14 years for passing military secrets to a British company the Russian authorities said was a CIA front , was reported to be bound for the UK after his release from a Moscow prison .
Today , riot police secured the perimeter of the former KGB Lefortovo jail in Moscow where Sutyagin was being held , as a convoy of armoured vehicles arrived .
A few hours later the Russian media reported he was seen leaving a plane in Vienna , but his family said it was " speculation " .
Sutyagin's father , Vyacheslav , said he had received no official confirmation of his son leaving Moscow or arriving in Vienna .
" There have been some unconfirmed reports that Igor flew in to Austria earlier this afternoon , but so far it seems to be wishful thinking .
We are waiting for Igor to call us himself .
We had expected it to be today , but it looks like it could be tomorrow . "
The Russian Gazeta .ru website reported that Anna Chapman , one of the Russian spy suspects arrested in America , might be delivered to Moscow in exchange for Sutyagin .
It quoted a diplomatic saying the 28 - year old businesswoman would be flown home in the coming days .
Sutyagin has consistently denied being a spy , saying the information he supplied was available from open sources .
But his family said he agreed to effectively be forced in to exile rather than face another four and half years in the " harsh regime " penal colony at Kholmogory near Arkhangelsk .
His mother , Svetlana , said he was unshaven and gaunt when she saw him today at Lefortovo .
Moscow was reportedly preparing to release several Russians convicted of working for the CIA or MI6 .
Lawyers for the alleged deep cover Russian agents held in the US speculated that they could be on their way to Moscow within hours provided a court approves a deal for them to plead guilty to a single charge of failing to declare payments from a foreign government .
They are likely to receive a minimal sentence of the time they have spent in jail since their arrests and then agree to be deported .
The true identities of five of the 10 alleged spies detained in the US are still not known to the US authorities .
Eight were living as married couples with children , some of whom were born in the US .
They explained away their accents by claiming to be from Canada or Italy .
The fate of at least two of the accused agents remains in question .
Chapman is believed to hold a British passport as well as Russian nationality , while another of the 10 is a US citizen .
An eleventh suspect , Christopher Metsos , who is accused of being the spy ring 's paymaster , is on the run after skipping bail in Cyprus .
While their departure may avoid any potential embarrassment to either government that a trial might pose , the alleged spies leave behind them considerable disagreement over how seriously to take their espionage ring .
While the FBI has portrayed the deep - cover " sleeper " agents as a threat to American security , their at times bumbling attempts to infiltrate high policymaking circles has made them figures of fun to many Americans .
Chapman has become such a celebrity that a New York newspaper lamented her departure and asked if the city could keep her .
Yet there is evidence that the Russian intelligence service , the SVR , put considerable effort in to the operation , obtaining false identities using , in one instance , that of a Canadian who died as a child in 1963 .
The SVR also sent hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds .
The putative swap deal emerged when Sutyagin 's lawyer and relatives told the media that prison authorities had abruptly moved him from the penal colony near Arkhangelsk to Lefortovo on Monday .
There is speculation in Russia about which other prisoners jailed for treason and espionage might be part of the swap .
Sutyagin , who is married with two daughters , told his mother he had learned of one other name on the list to be exchanged : Sergei Skripal , a military intelligence officer jailed in Russia in 2006 for giving information to MI6 .
A Russian intelligence source told the Kommersant newspaper of two other proposed individuals : Alexander Zaporozhsky , an SVR operative sentenced to 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and Alexander Sypachev , jailed for eight years in 2002 for working for the CIA .
But Sypachev 's lawyer said he would not agree to such a deal .
The putative exchange is particularly interesting as the Russians rarely give up Russians they have jailed on spying charges , well - placed sources said .
One reason given for the extreme reticence of British agencies to talk about the spy swap was the fear the Russians might make fresh arrests to use more people as potential collateral for exchanges .
It is possible they were already placing potentially vulnerable people under surveillance now , the sources added .
Your Master ’s Voice …
“ Reprehensible , ” says US Representative Kay Granger ( R - TX ) of the public release of thousands of documents relating to the US occupation of Afghanistan .
It “ risk[s ] American lives . ”
It is the government ’s responsibility to “ protect state secrets . ”
This is the same Kay Granger , of course , who supported the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and has continued to support the US occupation of that country for nearly nine years since .
Actually , she does n’t merely “ support ” that occupation , she actively frames the terms under which it continues :
She ’s a member of the House Appropriations Committee and its “ Defense ” subcommittee , and the ranking member of its “ State , Foreign Operations , and Related Programs ” subcommittees .
The Afghanistan occupation is Kay Granger ’s baby .
She “ risks American lives ” every time she justifies it , every times she engages in its planning , every time she votes to continue it and to continue funding it .
It ’s not only in Afghanistan that she “ risks American lives , ” either .
She supported the US invasion and occupation of Iraq .
She ’s actively worked to endanger the lives and well - being of US troops who might be captured on the battlefield by supporting the use of torture and kangaroo “ military commission ” courts with respect to their foreign counterparts .
Kay Granger does n’t give a damn about “ risking American lives . ”
She does so with abandon .
She does so with presumed impunity .
She does so without visible skepticism or self - doubt .
And the blood of thousands of Americans stains the floor wherever she walks .
She ’s already killed more Americans than will ever die due to the Wikileaks document release .
It ’s not the risk to American lives that has Kay Granger upset .
It ’s the fact that Wikileaks has outed the actual results of the policies she — and a majority of the 534 other US Representatives and US Senators she works with — supports and enables .
Like most politicians , Kay Granger ’s bread and butter is the control of information .
She ’ll tell you what she ’s going to do with the money she steals from your paycheck .
Later she ’ll tell you what she ’s done , how swimmingly things are working out , how badly you need more of her and more of her talent for high - level machination .
And , to the best of her ability , she ’ll prevent anyone from superimposing inconvenient facts over that narrative .
Her deepest , dearest desire is to be your master ’s voice , the only voice to which you hearken .
The major threat to the modern state is n’t foreign invasion or even armed native insurrection — it ’s the increasing ease with which its opponents can disseminate the truth about what government is and what government does .
Government withers and dies under the harsh light of disclosure , exposure , transparency .
Congresswoman Granger is alarmed by the public release of thousands of “ classified ” ( read “ kept secret because they ’re embarrassing to the state ” ) documents … and alarmed she should be .
Her ability to keep you in the dark is an indispensable weapon in her overgrown street gang ’s war for control of your life .
In the age of Wikileaks , that weapon is quickly becoming as obsolete and anachronistic as a 12 - pounder Napoleon would be in a modern artillery battery .

To paraphrase Yoda : Begun , the e-book wars have .
Barnes & Noble ( s bks ) started the week off by cutting prices on its
Nook e-book reader to $ 199 from $ 259 , while also introducing a new , $ 149 Wi -Fi model .
Not to be left behind , Amazon , which helped jump - start the e-book reader craze , decided to cut the price on its entry - level Kindle model to $ 189 from $ 259 .
The punch and counterpunch has prompted more than one watcher of the space to declare that an e-book price war is about to break out .
Others are musing about Amazon ’s fate .
All this hand - wringing is old hat for our community , because Kindle hardware or not , Amazon ( s amzn ) is expected to make a billion dollars from its digital book - related business this year .
From where I stand , Amazon has nothing to worry about , as long as it pays attention to a few details .
( And no , that does n’t mean sharing a bigger cut of revenues with publishers . )
Regardless , there are three technological reasons why the online retail giant can and will win the e-book war .
1 . Buy once , read anywhere
The day I first laid hands on Apple ’s ( s aapl ) iPad I banished my Amazon Kindle to the back of the proverbial drawer .
And yet , I have been spending , on average , about $ 10 every 3 - 5 days on Amazon ’s site buying a book to read using the Kindle application on the iPad .
In fact , the reading experience on the iPad is so superior to that of the Kindle I often find myself staying up later than usual reading a book .
In comparison , I ’ve bought three books from the iBooks store and quite frankly , see no reason to go back .
It has fewer options , but more importantly , I can only read those books on the iPad .
The books I buy in a Kindle store will work on an Android device , as well as on an iPad , iPhone or Mac .
Oh , also on my Kindle by the way , which I can take out of my drawer at any time .
This is a big advantage for Amazon , for as more people start living multidevice lifestyles , such cross-platform availability of content will increasingly become a big deal .
Unlike Amazon ’s Kindle store , iBooks is going to be limited to the iPad / iPhone platform — which is not good enough for me .
I like the flexibility of the Kindle app , even if it offers books to me in somewhat of a less attractive format .
In other words , Amazon should be thinking about Kindle as a platform that leverages other people ’s hardware .
2 . We go way back
Most people already associate Amazon with buying books online .
Meanwhile Barnes & Noble , while a great brick - and - mortar brand , has n’t been able to translate its offline presence into a digital one .
As a customer , Amazon has all my billing information and has built a profile of books and digital goods that I like .
Could Amazon ’s recommendation system be better ?
Absolutely .
But in comparison to Barnes & Noble and other booksellers , it ’s good enough .
I do wish Amazon would take some time to improve the customer experience .
For example , I recently bought the printed collected works of John Cheever ’s short stories — after already buying it on my Kindle .
It would have been great if the service had reminded me that I d already bought a digital copy and then asked if I was sure about buying an analog version .
There have been other times when I ’ve reordered a book I originally purchased , say , 10 years ago — it would be nice for Amazon to ask me :
Do you still want it ?
Or , did you lose it and want a new copy ?
You get the drift .
What I ’m suggesting is nothing radical .
Mining data and deriving intelligence from it is a fast - growing field and Amazon has 15 years ’ worth that can be used to its advantage .
3 . It ’s always about the software
When I see companies such as Barnes & Noble try and diversify by building technology products , I laugh ; they just do n’t have the DNA .
Barnes & Noble is a retailer first and everything else later .
It ’s even funnier to watch the company think it can wage wars with hardware .
If that was indeed the case , Samsung , Nokia ( s nok ) and others would n’t be running scared of Google ( s goog ) and Apple .
The reason the mobile industry is all topsy - turvy is because Apple and Google have made the hardware industry about the software .
Sure , the latest features matter , but what matters more is the ability to create and release software at a rapid clip , thus improving the platforms on an ongoing basis .
Traditional handset makers are on a product release cycle that ’s at odds with such agile development .
Barnes & Noble — and any other competing e-reader makers — are going to find themselves in the same place as well .
I think this is Amazon ’s third technological advantage :
It is , at heart , a software company that sells books and other things .
Given the rapid speed with which it has been innovating with its cloud computing offerings , it ’s clearly also a disciple of agile development methodologies .
Amazon should indeed be spending all its energies on furthering its app experience to make it the best book - buying and reading application on any platform .
That , in my opinion , would be money well spent .
The user experience is why Apple is able to command a premium for its products .
Amazon can do the same .
So what about Kindle — the device ?
If Amazon wants to keep the device around , it will have to transform it from a mere e-book reader to a content consumption device that matches the iPad in its capabilities .
Otherwise , like the Nook , it ’s already dated .

State Department warns employees about new website highlighting Top Secret facilities
The State Department is bracing for a potentially explosive new feature on the Washington Post website that would publish the names and locations of agencies and firms conducting Top Secret work on behalf of the U.S. government , according to the copy of an email obtained by The Cable .
The Diplomatic Security Bureau at State sent out a notice Thursday to all department employees warning them to protect classified information and reject inquiries from the press when the new web feature goes live .
" The Washington Post plans to publish a website listing all agencies and contractors believed to conduct Top Secret work on behalf of the U.S. Government , " the notice reads .
" The website provides a graphic representation pinpointing the location of firms conducting Top Secret work , describing the type of work they perform , and identifying many facilities where such work is done . "
According to the notice , the Post used only open - source information to compile its site .
However , if some of that open - source information turns out to have been classified , its publication by the Post does n’t change that classification , the State Department emphasized .
" All Department personnel should remain aware of their responsibility to protect classified and other sensitive information , such as the Department ’s relationships with contract firms , other U.S. Government agencies , and foreign governments , " the notice says .
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail and said it went out to all State Department employees in the Washington , DC area , 14,574 people .
The Washington Post declined requests for comment .
Here ’s the full notice :
Office of Origin : DS /EX
Announcement Number : 2010_07_059
Date of Announcement : July 15 , 2010
________________________________
Notification of Major Media Outlet Story On Monday July 19 , the Washington Post plans to publish a website listing all agencies and contractors believed to conduct Top Secret work on behalf of the U.S. Government .
The website provides a graphic representation pinpointing the location of firms conducting Top Secret work , describing the type of work they perform , and identifying many facilities where such work is done .
Although the Washington Post acquired the information from open sources , all Department personnel should remain aware of their responsibility to protect classified and other sensitive information , such as the Department ’s relationships with contract firms , other U.S. Government agencies , and foreign governments .
Employees are reminded that they must neither confirm nor deny information contained in this , or any , media publication , and that the publication of this website and supporting articles does not constitute a change to the level of classification of any information duly classified in accordance with Executive Order 13526 .
In the unlikely event you are contacted for comment , please forward any request for information to the Bureau of Public Affairs , Press Relations Office at ( 202 ) 647-2492 .
UPDATE : The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder publishes a related memo by Art House , the communications director of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , which appears to be just as worried as the State Department about the Post ‘s reporting .
Excerpt :
It might be helpful as you prepare for publication to draw up a list of accomplishments and examples of success to offer in response to inquiries to balance the coverage and add points that deserve to be mentioned .
In media discussions , we will seek to garner support for the Intelligence Community and its members by offering examples of agile , integrated activity that has enhanced performance .
We will want to minimize damage caused by unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and classified information .
It also describes ODNI ’s expections for the Washington Post series :
Themes
While we can’t predict specific content , we anticipate the following themes :
The intelligence enterprise has undergone exponential growth and has become unmanageable with overlapping authorities and a heavily outsourced contractor workforce .
The IC and the DoD have wasted significant time and resources , especially in the areas of counterterrorism and counterintelligence .
The intelligence enterprise has taken its eyes off its post - 9/11 mission and is spending its energy on competitive and redundant programs .
Format The Washington
Post may run a series of three articles , the first being an overview , the second focused on the large number of contractors supporting the intelligence enterprise , and the third looking at a specific community ( the Fort Meade / BWI Airport area ) that has expanded in part due to Intelligence Community growth .
The Washington Post is expected to work with Public Broadcasting Service ’s Frontline program to add a television component to this work , and will also present an interactive web site demonstrating growth of the intelligence enterprise and inviting comment and dialogue .
The Post advises that " links " between individual contractors and specific agencies have been deleted , although the Post will still cite contractors and their locations .
UPDATE # 2 : An administration official responds to The Cable to comment on the Post series , which the administration is portraying as less than meets the eye .
" A lot of this is explainable .
You want some redundancy in the Intelligence Community and you ’re going to have some waste .
These are things we ’ve been aware of and in some instances we agree are troubling .
However , it ’s something we ’ve been working on for a year and a half .
It ’s something we ’ve been on top of , " the official said .
" There was a need for urgent expansion after 9/11 and there was a need for an expansion of contractors to fill analyst positions .
There will be examples of money being wasted in the series that seem egregious and we are just as offended as the readers by those examples . "
Thanks for your patience everyone !
We 're really sorry we were down for a couple of days , but we 've moved to a new hosting service now .
Things might still be a bit bumpy for a few days , please bear with us .

Sara Sommerfeld , a successful Swedish film , theater and TV actress , says she always had a clear thought of what she wants in life .
" I wanted to be an actress , or a ballet dancer , or a singer .
I wanted to do it all .
" Sommerfeld grew up in a large family consisting of her mother Bea , her father Victor and four strong - minded sisters .
Her parents , Polish imigrants that came to Sweden in 1968 , encouraged her to take dancing and acting lessons of an early age .
" I do feel lucky , I really do .
I 'm not sure that I 've always the most talented person , but I 've worked the most .
I 've been very stubborn that this is what I want to do . " " on paper , I'm Swedish . " , Sara adds .
" But , of course , I 've never feltthat I 'm totally Swedish .
I 've always felt a strong connection to myJewish identity , and I 've always felt that I 've been different from allof my Swedish friends .
" For her , being a Jew in Sweden will always be the odd- man out , muchlike other immigrants in the Nordic country .
" I have things in commonwith this Muslim girl I 'm portraying and her identity crisis andproblems being a Swedish Muslim .
I can relate to that and those kindsof roles . "
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - The Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate on Tuesday , the first G7 industrialized economy to do so after the global recession , but said the European debt crisis made its next move highly unpredictable .
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney speaks during a news conference upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report in Ottawa April 22 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Chris Wattie
The rate hike , to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent , is a response to two quarters of extraordinarily strong growth at home .
But the bank cautioned investors against betting on an uninterrupted tightening campaign , due to the euro zone fiscal problems and an uneven global recovery .
“ Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook , any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments , ” the central bank said in a statement .
The rate hike itself was widely expected .
In a Reuters poll of 40 analysts , 32 had forecast a quarter - point rate hike .
“ No surprise in the decision but the tone was slightly more dovish than we or the markets had anticipated , ” said Millan Mulraine , economics strategist at TD Securities .
“ Of course we continue to mention our bias for them to raise rates at the next few meetings ...
It certainly suggests to us that the bank is not positioning for 50 basis point increases , at least not in the near term , as the market at some point may have priced in , ” he said .
The lack of a clear message on further rate hikes caused the Canadian dollar to ease after the news to as low as C$ 1.0556 to the U.S. dollar , or 94.70 U.S. cents , from C$ 1.0498 , or 95.26 earlier in the day .
It later recovered to C$ 1.0490 to the greenback .
Yields on overnight index swaps , which trade based on expectations for the central bank ’s key policy rate , suggest there is a 67.7 percent chance of a 25 basis point hike at the next announcement on July 20 .
“ I think they did the right thing for a central bank and , given current market and global economic uncertainty , you do n’t want to show your full hand under these circumstances , ” said Derek Holt , an economist at Scotia Capital .
“ But my own personal belief is we still have the need for a made - in - Canada set of monetary policy conditions and that justifies continued hikes , ” he said .
Several major commercial banks raised their prime lending rates on Tuesday to 2.50 percent , including Toronto - Dominion Bank , Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal .
All but one of Canada ’s 12 primary securities dealers , surveyed by Reuters on Tuesday , forecast the central bank would raise rates again on July 20 .
The same number predicted further hikes in September and October .
The Bank of Canada has broken ranks with the U.S. Federal Reserve in the past , but generally the two policy rates move in tandem .
But the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to promise to hold its rate ultra low for an extended period , depending on economic conditions .
The European Central Bank , which has cut rates to 1.0 percent , is far from considering its exit strategy as it takes extraordinary steps to ease the debt crisis and prevent it from snuffing out a recovery on the continent .
Canada ’s profile of a commodities exporter is closer to that of Australia , which held rates steady on Tuesday but had already lifted borrowing costs six times in eight months .
Canada ’s economy fell into mild recession last year , but its banks emerged unscathed from the credit crisis and jobless rates did not soar as high as in the United States .
Consumer spending and a hot housing market have fueled a faster than expected recovery since then .
The economy grew at a surprising 6.1 percent annual clip in the first quarter , and by 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
The bank said economic activity was broadly in line with its expectations , and inflation was also matching expectations .
The new rate is still highly stimulative , it said .
It said the global recovery is “ increasingly uneven , ” with emerging markets taking the lead while there is a “ possibility of renewed weakness in Europe . ”
The debt crisis in Greece and some other European countries has so far had only a limited impact on Canada through lower commodity prices and tighter financing conditions .
But some countries will now have to cut spending quickly and that , combined with debt reduction by banks and households , could slow global growth .
That could hurt Canada ’s export - dependent economy .
“ Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in some countries -- an important downside risk identified in the April Monetary Policy Report , ” it said .
The central bank also said it will gradually reduce the amount left in its overnight settlement system for banks to the pre-crisis norm of C$ 25 million from C$ 3 billion .
It said it would make its standing purchase and resale agreement facility with primary dealers a permanent part of its monetary policy framework .
The facility was introduced in April 2009 to help the bank manage the overnight market at record low rates .

die Worthmühle
When I heard there was a third gose in Goslar I did n't want to believe it .
After all , we travelled to Goslar in 2008 specifically to try the two goses from Brauhaus Goslar , carefully hunted down both the pale and dark versions , and tried them both several times .
I then crossed Goslar off my list of " places to visit before I die , " and was ready to move on .
So to be told that there was another gose in Goslar was not what I wanted to hear .
Especially not that it was only available in a place I 'd already tried to get in , and failed because it was reserved for a private party .
As chance would have it , Goslar was the ideal overnight stop on our way back from southern France this week .
The wife was easily persuaded to stop there , and so after dinner we dropped by die Worthmühle , the restaurant which Boak and Bailey claimed had the third gose , expecting to be told that " yeah , it 's the Goslar Brauhaus Gose " .
But the very busy bar manager took the time to explain to a random person stammering broken German that , no , this gose was brewed especially for them , by Altenauer .
So of course I ordered one .
Blackboard
And immediately it was clear that whatever this was , it was not the Goslar Brauhaus Gose .
That beer is clear .
This beer was cloudy and opaque , looking most of all like a paler version of Hoegaarden .
There seems to be no doubt that this is a separate beer , which means there are six goses in Germany , and not just the five on RateBeer .
( Obviously , once I finish typing up my backlog of beer ratings there are going to be six German goses on RateBeer . )
" But what does it taste like ? " I can hear you cry .
Well , it 's not sour at all , which obviously means that it 's not really a true gose .
Sourness is almost the defining characteristic of gose , so a non -sour gose is like a pale stout or a dark pilsener .
It does , however , have a spicy minty coriander taste with floral wheaty notes , so probably they did spice it properly .
Overall , it tastes more like a heavily spiced wit than anything else .
I found it nice , drinkable , and unusual , but perhaps a touch perfumy from all that coriander .
I gave it 3.2 out of 5.0 , which is a fairly good rating .
There is a little blackboard in the pub stating that the beer is brewed according to an old recipe , but my guess is that the recipe is so old it does n't say anything about the yeast .
The brewery of course knows perfectly well that the beer ought to be spontaneously fermented ( or at least soured with lactic acid bacteria ) , but they also know that this would make it far too sour for most tourists to enjoy .
So they decided to add normal yeast and make it taste more like a " normal " beer , thus destroying what was unique about it to begin with .
And there , I guess , you have the whole problem with tourism in a nutshell .
Any place that is really beautiful and worth visiting must be changed in order to attract and accomodate tourists on a really large scale , which inevitably means destroying part of what made it worth visiting in the first place .
One could get upset and angry about this , but it would n't change anything .
So , on the positive side , at least I 've tried five of the six beers brewed in Germany that have " gose " in the name .
This is the full list :
City Brewed by Name Taste Goslar Brauhaus Goslar Gose Hell A bit boring Goslar Brauhaus Goslar Gose Dunkel Quite boring Goslar Altenauer Gose Interesting , but not sour Leipzig Hartmannsdorf Döllnitzer Ritterguts Gose Easily the best Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof Gose Not bad , but quite mild Köln Braustelle Kölner Gose ?
Looks like a visit to Köln ( Cologne ) might be necessary ...
Users of Nokia 's N900 tablet are outraged at the news that the latest OS update automatically collects details and signs them up to services , without the option to opt out or cancel .
The initiation into the MyNokia service comes at the end of the installation of the latest update – PR1.2 .
Once the user has downloaded and installed the update they get presented with a dialogue asking them to sign up , but notably that dialogue lacks a " no thanks " option .
" To get the most out of your Nokia you will receive free tips & support messages .
By continuing , you accept Nokia 's terms " it says .
This sounds fine until one realises that the only buttons are " Terms and Conditions " and " Done " , as shown in a forum posting on the issue , with the latter button triggering the controversial SMS message .
The N900 does n't have an enormous user base , but they are very vocal in their annoyance and the forums are rife with ( largely ill - informed ) threats of legal action as users accuse Nokia of breaching all sorts of laws and regulations .
SMSs are n't expensive to send - one user reportedly got charged $ 1 as he was abroad at the time - but it's the principle of the thing that has users so wound up .
There 's no problem asking customers to comply with new terms and conditions , and even signing them up to a service is OK , but refusing to let them back out is harsh ( bear in mind that this is at the end of installation , so there 's no reasonable way out at this point ) .
Nokia can't see why anyone would n't want to sign up to MyNokia : " We believe that these support messages are for the benefit of the consumer and help those consumers who are not yet fully aware of the possibilities their devices offer to make the most out of their purchase " the company told Maemo.org , pointing out that the terms and conditions do mention the cost of the SMS .
This is a minor tiff about an upgrade to a niche platform , and users who care simply opt out of MyNokia immediately afterwards .
But we can't help wondering if that was n't just the point – to push a little and see if the users squeal before making the same thing standard in MeeGo .
Nokia has long sought a direct relationship with its customers , and this is one more way to attain just that . ®
It is time that the stone grew accustomed to blooming ,
That unrest formed a heart .

During a dinner with friends the talk turns , as it often does these days , to the problem of anxiety : how it is consuming everyone ; how the very technologies that we have developed to save time and thereby lessen anxiety have only degraded the quality of the former and exacerbated the latter ; how we all need to “ give ourselves a break ” before we implode .
Everyone has some means of relief — tennis , yoga , a massage every Thursday — but the very way in which those activities are framed as separate from regular life suggests the extent to which that relief is temporary ( if even that : a couple of us admit that our “ recreational ” activities partake of the same simmering , near - obsessive panic as the rest of our lives ) .
There is something circular and static to our conversation , which does n’t end so much as frazzle indeterminately out .
And though there is always some comfort in comparing maladies , I am left with the uneasy feeling that my own private anxieties have actually increased by becoming momentarily collective — or no , not that , increased by not becoming collective , increased by the reinforcement of my loneliness within a collective context , like that penetrating but enervating stab of self one feels sometimes in an anonymous crowd .
It is a full day later before it occurs to me that not once , not in any form , not even with the ghost of a suggestion , did any of us mention God .
The greatness of James Joyce ’s Ulysses is partly in the way it reveals the interior chaos of a single mind during a single day , and partly in the way it makes that idiosyncratic clamor universal .
However different the textures of our own lives may be , Bloom ’s mind is our mind ; the welter of impressions he suffers and savors is a storm we all know .
And that is the book ’s horror too : some form of this same fury of trivia is going on in the mind of every sentient person on the planet .
How much cruelty is occasioned simply because of the noise that is within us : the din is too great for us to realize exactly what we are doing to others , or what is being done to others in our name .
Thus an offhand remark , which leaves us as easily as a breath and which we think no more of than a breath , cuts a friend to the quick .
And thus a whole country can be organized toward some collective insanity because there is no space in individuals to think .
Life has accelerated greatly since Joyce ’s time , and now , as our selves scatter into bits and bytes , and our souls , if we are conscious of them at all , diminish to little more than a vague wish for quiet , even the linear associativeness of Ulysses can seem quaint .
How does one remember God , reach for God , realize God in the midst of one ’s life if one is constantly being overwhelmed by that life ?
It is one thing to encourage contemplation , prayer , quiet spaces in which God , or at least a galvanizing awareness of his absence ( “ Be present with your want of a Deity , and you shall be present with the Deity , ” as the 17th - century poet Thomas Traherne puts it ) , can enter the mind and heart .
But the reality of contemporary American life — which often seems like a kind of collective ADHD — is that any consciousness requires a great deal of resistance , and how does one relax and resist at the same time ?
Commute ( 1 )
O the screech and heat and hate
we have for each day ’s commute ,
the long wait at the last stop
before we go screaming
underground , while the pigeons
court and shit and rut
insolently on the tracks
because this train is always late ,
always aimed at only us ,
who when it comes with its
blunt snout , its thousand mouths ,
cram and curse and contort
into one creature , all claws and eyes ,
tunneling , tunneling , tunneling
toward money .
In the Gospels Jesus is always talking to the crowds in parables , which he later “ explains ” to his disciples .
The dynamic is odd in a couple of ways : either the parables are obvious , and the explanations seem almost patronizing , or they are opaque , and the explanations only compound their opacity .
( Or could it be — and I confess to relishing this possibility — that the explanations illustrate Christ ’s wry sense of humor , which is nowhere else evident ? )
In any case , the notable point is just how little the explanations amount to , how completely the ultimate truths of the parables — just like dreams and poems — remain within their own occurrence .
Behind every urge to interpret is unease , anxiety .
This can be a productive and necessary endeavor , whether it ’s literary criticism or theology or even the dogmas and rituals of a religion ( since all religion is , ultimately , an attempt to interpret God and numinous experience ) .
Such effort deepens and complicates our initial response , even as it gives us an aperture through which to see our moments of mystery , crisis , and revelation more clearly — to give them “ meanings , ” to integrate them into our lives .
The trouble comes when the effort to name and know an experience replaces the experience itself .
Just as we seem to have grasped every level of meaning in a poem , the private and silent power that compelled us in the first place seems to drain right out of it .
Just as we plant the flag of faith on a mountain of doctrine and dogma it has taken every ounce of our intellect to climb , our vision becomes a “ view , ” which is already clouding over , and is in any event cluttered with the trash of others who have fought their way to this same spot .
Nowhere to go now but down .
“ If that ’s what he means , ” says the student to the poetry teacher , “ why does n’t he just say it ? ” “ If God is real , ” says the parishioner to the preacher , “ why does n’t he simply storm into our lives and convince us ? ”
The questions are vastly different in scale and relative importance , but their answers are similar .
A poem , if it ’s a real one , in some fundamental sense means no more and no less than the moment of its singular music and lightning insight ; it is its own code to its own absolute and irreducible clarity .
A god , if it ’s a living one , is not outside of reality but in it , of it ( though in ways it takes patience and imagination to perceive ) .
Thus the uses and necessities of metaphor , which can flash us past our plodding resistance and habits into strange new truths .
Thus the very practical effects of music , myth , image , which tease us not out of reality but deeper and more completely into it .
Christ speaks in stories as a way of preparing his followers to stake their lives on a story , because existence is not a puzzle to be solved but a narrative to be inherited , and undergone , and transformed person by person .
He uses metaphors because something essential about the nature of reality — its mercurial solidity , its mathematical mystery and sacred plainness — is disclosed within them .
He speaks the language of reality — speaks in terms of the physical world — because he is reality ’s culmination and code , and because “ this people ’s mind has become dull ; they have stopped their ears and shut their eyes .
Otherwise , their eyes might see , their ears hear , and their mind understand , and then they might turn to me , and I would heal them . ”
I do n’t think the “ answer ” to the anxiety felt by everyone at that dinner party is Christianity .
In fact I ’m pretty sure that is not the case , as we represented several different traditions ( including no tradition ) — and anyway Christ is not an answer to existence but a means of existing , and I am convinced that there is no permutation of man or mind in which he is not , in some form , present .
( This from the Catholic nun , Sara Grant , speaking about , and quoting from , the Kena Upanishad : “ Brahman is not ‘ that which one knows , ’ but that by which one knows , as though a crystal bowl were aware of the sun shining through it .
‘ When he is known through all cognitions , he is rightly known . ’”
But it seems to me you could quote Christ himself in support of this idea : “ To believe in me , is not to believe in me but in him who sent me ; to see me , is to see him who sent me . ” )
I do think , though , that both the problem of , and the solution to , our individual anxiety is a metaphysical one .
Some modern philosophers ( Heidegger , Kierkegaard ) have argued that existential anxiety proceeds from being unconscious of , or inadequately conscious of , death .
True , I think , but I wonder if the emphasis might be placed differently , shifted from unconscious reaction to unrealized action : that is , our anxiety is less the mind shielding itself from death than the spirit ’s need to be .
It is as if each of us were always hearing some strange , complicated music in the background of our lives , music which , so long as it remains in the background , is not simply distracting but manifestly unpleasant , because it demands the attention we are giving to other things .
It is not hard to hear this music , but it is very difficult indeed to learn to hear it as music .
Who is it that clasps and kneads my naked feet , till they unfold ,
till all is well , till all is utterly well ?
the lotus - lilies of the feet !
I tell you it is no woman , it is no man , for I am alone .
And I fall asleep with the gods , the gods
that are not , or that are
according to the soul ’s desire ,
like a pool into which we plunge , or do not plunge .
The operative word in these lines from D. H. Lawrence , who was n’t a conventionally religious person , is soul .
It ’s a word that has become almost embarrassing for many contemporary people , unless it is completely stripped of its religious meaning .
Perhaps that ’s just what it needs sometimes : to be stripped of its religious meaning , in the sense that faith itself sometimes needs to be stripped of its social and historical incrustations and returned to its first , churchless incarnation in the human heart .
That ’s what the 20th century was , a kind of windstorm - scouring of all we thought was knowledge and truth and ours — until it became too strong for us , or we too weak for it , and “ the self replaced the soul with the fist of survival ” ( Fanny Howe ) .
Anxiety comes from the self as ultimate concern , from the fact that the self cannot bear this ultimate concern : it buckles and wavers under the strain , and eventually , inevitably , it breaks .
“ Glimmerings are what the soul ’s composed of , ” writes the Irish poet Seamus Heaney , an interesting — and , I think , accurate — thought , if the word glimmerings is read as both literal and metaphorical : the soul is not simply the agent that does the seeing ( the entity to which metaphorical glimmerings are given ) , it is in some way the things that are seen ( the world that glimmers ) ; or , perhaps more accurately , it is the verb that makes an exchange between the self and reality , or the self and other selves , possible .
It is the soul that turns perception into communication , and communication — even if it ’s just between one man and the storm of atoms around him — into communion .
The meanings that God calls us to in our lives are never abstract .
Though the call may ask us to redefine , or refine , what we know as life , it does not demand a renunciation of life in favor of something beyond it .
Moreover , the call itself is always comprised of life .
That is , it is not some hitherto unknown voice to which we respond ; it is life calling to life .
People think that diagnosing the apostle Paul with epilepsy or some related disorder nullifies any notion that God might truly have revealed something of himself on that road to Damascus .
But God speaks to us by speaking through us , and any meaning we arrive at in this life is comprised of the irreducible details of the life that is around us at any moment .
“ I think there is no light in the world / but the world , ” writes George Oppen .
“ And I think there is light . ”
There is a distinction to be made between the anxiety of daily existence , which we talk about endlessly , and the anxiety of existence , which we rarely mention at all .
The former fritters us into dithering , distracted creatures .
The latter attests to — and , if attended to , discloses — our souls .
And yet it is a distinction without a difference , perhaps , and as crucial to eventually overcome as it is to initially understand , for to be truly alive means to feel one ’s ultimate existence within one ’s daily existence , to feel one ’s trivial , frittering anxieties acquiring a lightness , a rightness , a meaning .
So long as anxiety is merely something to be alleviated , it is not life , or we are not alive enough to experience it as such .
I do n’t mean to be describing an intellectual transformation , or a transformation that is available only to “ intellectuals . ”
I suppose that for many people — people inclined to read essays like this one , for instance — the transformation might seem to begin with a mental decision and a definite application of the will .
In fact , I think taking such a step indicates that some rift of meaning and feeling has already opened inside of us , and we are clutching , consciously or unconsciously , at the rock face and rubble above this sudden abyss .
In the end if we are to integrate our anxieties into our lives — and thereby alleviate them — any merely intellectual understanding of them is inadequate .
Consciousness among contemporary Western intellectuals is an “ apprehensive ” quality : that is to say , we become conscious by taking hold of , or apprehending , our selves and reality , by standing apart from them .
Not at all coincidentally , we grow apprehensive as we do so ( for where , exactly , are we standing ? ) .
There are other , fuller ways of being in the world , which Eastern religions , as well as Christian mysticism , strive to articulate .
( Meister Eckhart : “ It is not that we should abandon , neglect or deny our inner self , but we should learn to work precisely in it , with it and from it in such a way that interiority turns into effective action and effective action leads back to interiority and we become used to acting without any compulsion . ” )
But again , the best evidence comes not from books but from people , some of whom would never think to pick up a book .
Suddenly I am seeing someone out of my own childhood , recalling a habit of mind too attentive to be called passive , too intuitive to be called thought .
I am thinking ( thinking ! ) of a presence so in love with life , so in tune with time , that death seemed only to drive her further in .
She who in her last days loved too well to lose
A single weed to namelessness , in creosote ,
Blue gramma , goatsbeard that is not thriving , is ,
Amid the cattails ’ brittle whisper whispers
O Law ’ , Honey , ai n’t this a praiseful thing .
The itch inside of contentment , or the itch that perhaps is contentment , as if despite our problems with anxiety , inner rest required outer restlessness , as if peace with ourselves and our times were found only within frenzy .
Or , for some , never found at all .
W. B. Yeats :
Through winter - time we call on spring ,
And through the spring on summer call ,
And when abounding hedges ring
Declare that winter ’s best of all ;
And after that there ’s nothing good
Because the spring - time has not come —
Nor know that what disturbs our blood
Is but its longing for the tomb .
This is life as pure death wish .
There is a sense in which Yeats is right : what we seek is meaning for our ceaseless , anxious , and always - anticipatory actions , and death is part of that meaning .
Any life that does not take account of death , that does not , in one way or another , hear the annihilating silence inside every sound , the nullifying stillness within every action , is a life that can neither harness nor redress that dark energy — which is to say , a life of which death already has possession .
Yeats ’s mistake , though , is to make death the entire meaning of life , which , ultimately , makes not only our anxieties , but also our actions , meaningless .
Here ’s another take :
When God at first made Man ,
Having a glass of blessings standing by —
Let us ( said He ) pour on him all we can ;
Let the world ’s riches , which dispersed lie ,
Contract into a span .
So strength first made a way ,
Then beauty flow ’d , then wisdom , honour , pleasure :
When almost all was out , God made a stay ,
Perceiving that , alone of all His treasure ,
Rest in the bottom lay .
For if I should ( said He )
Bestow this jewel also on My creature ,
He would adore My gifts instead of Me ,
And rest in Nature , not the God of Nature :
So both should losers be .
Yet let him keep the rest ,
But keep them with repining restlessness ;
Let him be rich and weary , that at least ,
If goodness lead him not , yet weariness
May toss him to My breast .
In this poem , “ The Pulley ” by George Herbert , our very restlessness is a gift , as it reminds us , even when we are most content , what we most need and why we are on this earth at all .
The poem is perhaps theologically suspect ( why this rat ’s maze of a world for a known result ? ) but intuitively true .
We are driven ceaselessly onward in this life and are certain of our desires only until we realize them , at which point they seem to dissolve and shimmer further off , like a heat mirage on a road down which we ca n’t stop racing .
Unlike Yeats , though , for whom that road ends at a massive wall into which we finally , fatally slam , for Herbert the very permanence of our longing is proof of longing ’s eventual fruition .
Which is not to say , though , that this fruition is forever forestalled .
It is n’t “ heaven , ” exactly , except insofar as we learn to see , as he says in another poem , “ Heaven in Ordinarie . ”
At first , attending to the anxiety of existence can seem like a zero - sum game .
Any attention turned toward the truth of the spirit is attention turned away from all we have come to think of as “ life . ”
Thus we parcel out our moments of devotion — a church service here and there , a walk in the woods , a couple of hours of meditation a week — all the while maintaining the frenzy of our usual existence outside of those moments .
This is inevitable , for the initial demands of the spirit are intense , but it is not sustainable , for the soul is not piecemeal .
We are left with this paradox : only by hearing the furthest call of consciousness can we hear the call of ordinary life , but only by claiming the most mundane and jangling details of our lives can that rare and ulterior music of the soul merge with what Seamus Heaney calls “ the music of what happens . ”
IT IS A STRANGE THING how sometimes merely to talk honestly of God , even if it is only to articulate our feelings of separation and confusion , can bring peace to our spirits .
You thought you were unhappy because this or that was off in your relationship , this or that was wrong in your job , but the reality is that your sadness stemmed from your aversion to , your stalwart avoidance of , God .
The other problems may very well be true , and you will have to address them , but what you feel when releasing yourself to speak of the deepest needs of your spirit is the fact that no other needs could be spoken of outside of that context .
You cannot work on the structure of your life if the ground of your being is unsure .
The first step in the life of the spirit is learning to let yourself experience those moments when life and time seem at once suspended and concentrated , that paradox of attentive oblivion out of which any sustaining faith grows .
These moments may not be — and at first almost certainly will not be —“ meditative . ”
They are more likely to break into your awareness , or into what you thought was awareness ( “ inbreaking ” is the theological term for Christ ’s appearance in the world and in our lives — there is no coaxing it , no way to earn it , no way to prepare except to hone your capacity to respond , which is , finally , your capacity to experience life , and death ) .
This is why we cannot separate one part of our existence , or one aspect of our awareness , from another , for there is a seed of peace in the most savage clamor .
There is a kind of seeing that , fusing attention and submission , becomes a kind of being , wherein you may burrow into the very chaos that buries you , and even the most binding ties can become a means of release .
Commute ( 2 )
There is a dreamer
all good conductors
know to look for
when the last stop is made
and the train is ticking cool ,
some lover , loner , or fool
who has lived so hard
he jerks awake
in the graveyard ,
where he sees
coming down the aisle
a beam of light
whose end he is ,
and what he thinks are chains
becoming keys . . .
Keys to what , though ?
For I ca n’t end with that flourish of poetry and privacy .
Art , like religious devotion , either adds life or steals it ; it is never neutral ; either it impels one back toward life or is merely one more means of keeping life at arm ’s length .
( The subject matter and tone of art have less to do with this than many people think : nothing palls the soul like a forced epiphany , and one can be elated and energized by a freshly articulate despair . )
Keys to what ?
In this poem , the keys are , on one level , to the constraints felt in the earlier section ( the miserable commute , the crush of others , the “ screech and heat and hate ” ) , which prove to be their own means of release ( “ what he thought were chains / becoming keys ” ) .
On another level , the keys are to the mysteries of death ; or , rather , the key is to the blunt , immutable , physical fact of death ( the train “ graveyard ” ) , which opens , if only for a moment , to reveal a mystery .
And now it ’s over .
Now the man on the train — like the man who imagined him ( me ! ) , like Paul God - struck outside of Damascus ( alas , it was n’t quite like that for me ) — must move .
Now the revelation either becomes part of his life or is altogether lost to it .
Either his actions acquire a deeper purpose , and begin to echo and counterpoint each other , or the moment and the man slip back into unfeeling frenzy , and the screech and heat and hate of his days lock metallically around him again .
Death is the only lens for true transcendence , but , paradoxically , transcendence is possible only when we cease being conscious of our own death .
I do n’t mean that we are unconscious of our own death , but that we pass through what we think of as consciousness — that “ apprehensiveness ” I mentioned , that standing - apart - from and taking - hold - of — into something more profound .
What you feel in amateur photographs — it ’s a large part of the poignancy — is the pressure , or the lack of pressure , actually , of all the reality missing from the picture , which is really just a chopped - off piece of life .
An artist , on the other hand , makes you feel just how much missing life is contained within a given image ; it is as if the image is surrounded with , enlivened and even created by , the invisible , the unknowable , the absent .
It ’s not accurate to say that someone who has learned to see like this has forgotten that there is a lens between himself and life .
It ’s more that the lens has become so intuitive and fluent that it ’s just another , clearer eye .
That dinner party with which I began this essay was a failure of mine — not of nerve , exactly , for nothing I have said in this essay had even crossed my mind at that point .
No , it was a failure of consciousness , which is always a spiritual failure .
I believe there is a kind of existence in which meditation and communication , epiphanies and busyness , death and life , God and not — all these apparent antinomies are merged and made into one awareness .
I am a long way from realizing such perception myself , but I have lifted the lens to my eye — there is a sense in which it must be voluntarily lifted , even if , perhaps especially if , it has been roughly thrust there by circumstance — and am learning .
The past few weeks has seen the somewhat unlikely resurrection of Newzbin .
The world 's premier Usenet indexing site was crushed by huge debts but through a tangled web worthy of the most dramatic soap opera , it has somehow been reanimated .
While ex-owner Caesium eyes future opportunities away from file - sharing , lawyers already have plans to bring Newzbin2 to its knees .
During recent years the file - sharing community has grown used to the dramas surrounding The Pirate Bay .
It got raided , it came back .
Its hosts have been threatened , it came back .
Its bandwidth suppliers have faced legal action , but it still it came back .
While these developments have demonstrated the resilience of the site and those behind it , the back stories have always proven pretty straight forward .
The same can not be said about the fall and subsequent resurrection of Newzbin , the site which turned over £ 1 million from its 700,000 members in 2009 .
For those struggling to keep up ( and yes , that includes us too ) here ’s a brief recap with some existing facts , some more recent ones , some you probably did n’t know and others you definitely did n’t .
After a battle with Hollywood earlier this year , Newzbin collapsed early May under a mountain of debt .
Previously run by admin Caesium , who actually left a few months before the court case , the site ceased to exist .
Sort of .
Later in May news broke that Newzbin had previously been infiltrated by Team R Dogs , an entity which appeared to be run by a Mr White .
Apparently without the knowledge of Newzbin , some time ago the ‘ Dogs had the foresight to swipe the site ’s code with the aim of bringing Newzbin back to life should it somehow suffer a fate worse than death at the hands of the MPA .
Team R
Dogs fulfilled this promise a few days ago when Newzbin2 was born .
Ex-users of Newzbin did n’t have any problem finding the site though , since it came back under the old domain name .
The apparent mechanism for this feat is as amazing as the rest of the story .
Some time ago , under the pressure of mounting debts – the £ 360,000 profit the site made in 2009 , gone – Newzbin needed to raise some funds .
They say they did this by selling the domain names Newzbin.com and Newzxxx.com to a Seychelles - based company but then , as they obviously still needed them , leased them back .
After Newzbin1 closed , Team R
Dogs say they bid against several other NZB sites to acquire the Newzbin domain but eventually came out victorious .
From previous reports , rumors , speculation , crystal ball viewing and a statement from an unnamed ex-director of Newzbin , the conclusion was that when Team R Dogs brought back the site it would be with an old version of the site with old databases .
In fact the site returned with the databases bang up to date from the day Newzbin went down , user payments and credits intact .
This feat was partially explained by Mr White in a recent interview .
His implication was that although they gained access to the site ’s databases some time ago , the staff at Newzbin never noticed , which allowed them to take copies of all necessary data right up until the site died .
So what does Chris Elsworth , ex-owner / director of Newzbin think about this drama and how does he feel about Team R Dogs bringing the site back to generate profit for them just as Newzbin1 faces liquidation ?
“ Well I ’m not going to lie .
If they go on to make millions out of it I ’ll be a bit miffed that I ’m not the one earning it – lets not beat about the bush , we ’re all interested in making enough money to be comfortable in our retirement , ” he told Torrent Freak .
“ But at the same time , I think I had done about as much as I could for Newzbin , my interest in it was waning even before the MPA poked their noses in if I ’m honest , it ’s unlikely there would have been many more shattering breakthroughs with me running it .
So maybe if they can keep it up then good things will come out of it , ” he added .
As for the future , Chris told us that he ’s taking a breather first then he ’ll be off to pursue some opportunities being offered to him at the BBC .
But there was one other little mystery we wanted to ask Chris about .
While it ’s well known that Newzbin was found guilty of copyright infringement , what about Team R Dogs – if they stole the Newzbin code and databases are they guilty of theft and / or copyright infringement ?
“ I had some contact with the new owner [ of Newzbin1 ] for a while during the handover [ referring to when Chris left Newzbin months ago ] and from what I gather , the rights to the code / IP were sold to another company before the [ MPA court case ] verdict was out , ” he explained , adding , “ This may or may not be the same company [ WCIS Limited ] the domain was sold to . ”
So while the quiet life beckons for Chris , the same cannot be said for Team R Dogs .
They have taken on a site that Hollywood was determined to crush and spent a huge sum of money in doing so .
The complete return of the site has n’t gone unnoticed .
From a source that was proven reliable in the past , TorrentFreak has learned that work against Newzbin2 is already underway .
The site will not be allowed to reappear “ just like that ” and legal action is already being prepared and measures taken to take down the site .
Newzbin2 currently appears to be hosted in Sweden , although Team R Dogs have suggested that the move there might not be permanent .
However , with the original Newzbin verdict in hand , the studios have a powerful tool .
Already this week a Dutch court relied heavily on the UK Newzbin verdict when it handed a defeat to Usenet community FTD .
TorrentFreak contacted Mr White from Team R
Dogs for his reaction to this news but at time of publication we ’ve received no response .
Remember how bad things were under Communism ?
Save for some effete snobs and True Party Believers , no one ever had anything nice to say about life under Communism .
Corporatism is no different , as these astute scholars observed almost eighty years ago .
Perhaps it ’s time to kick Corporatism to the curb to bum spare change with its old buddy Communism ?
The Modern Corporation and Private Property by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means , 1932 : … The only example of a similar subjection of the economic interests of the individual to those of a group which appears to the writers as being at all comparable , is that contained in the communist system .
Though the communist ideology differs and the communist application is more drastic , the principle seems similar .
As a qualification on what has been known as private property in Anglo - American law , this corporate development represents a far greater approach towards communist modalities than appears anywhere else in our system .
It is an odd paradox that a corporate board of directors and a communist committee of commissars should so nearly meet in a common contention .
The communist thinks of the community in terms of a state ; the corporation director thinks of it in terms of an enterprise ; and though this difference between the two may well lead to a radical divergence in results , it still remains true that the corporation director who would subordinate the interests of the individual stockholder to those of the group more nearly resembles the communist in mode of thought than he does the protagonist of private property .
Meet Maria Verchenova , the 22 - year Russian golfer , who is supposed to be the Anna Kournikova of women ’s golf .
The leggy golfer seems to be adding glamor in golf by wearing short skirts and revealing outfits on tour .
She has the talent and model like looks – 5 feet and 8 inches tall , brunette and toned figure !
Check her pictures –
Clearly , she likes the attention , saying : ‘ I always like to bring something extra special to the golf course , so if I ’m wearing sexier , more stylish stuff – like a shorter skirt or a nice tennis - style dress – and people notice then great . ’
Coming from a poor Moscow family , Verchenova ’s ascension into top - flight women ’s golf has been remarkable .
Russia had three golf courses before 2006 , only one with 18 holes , and all three the reserve of the affluent elite .
She said : ‘ My dad took me to the Czech Republic when I was 12 and we went for a coffee at a golf club
‘ The next day we went back and I tried hitting a few balls with a local coach .
He said I had a talent for the game and I should play .
When I got back we went to Moscow City Golf Club and that ’s how I started .
Role models : Anna Kournikova and Maria Sharapova have blended sport and modelling commitments , and Verchenova hopes to do the same
‘ I did n’t even know what golf was when I was young because my family was poor and everybody in Russia is focused on tennis .
But thanks to my parents I was given a chance . ’
[ Daily Mail ]
She has already done photo - shoots for men ’s magazine Maxim and Sports Illustrated .
Now this sounds like a great reason to watch women ’s golf !
Celebrate the delicious diversity of the great American hamburger .
Each week for 20 weeks the AP will feature a new burger created by the biggest names in the food world .
A classic cheese on a classic burger — Southern style .
No slab of American would suffice for Matt Lee and Ted Lee , brothers who have made careers out of sharing the flavors of the South .
“ A thick slab of melting cheese has always been our favorite addition to a burger , ” Matt said in an e-mail .
“ But our cravings these days also run to snappier , spicy - sour sensations that temper the richness of the cheese - topped burger and speed us toward a second helping . ”
So they reached for that classic Southern food , pimento cheese .
Albeit , with an update .
“ Our favorite new variation on pimento cheese uses Swiss ( instead of the traditional cheddar ) and banana peppers ( instead of roasted red peppers ) , ” said Matt Lee , who with his brother wrote the recent “ The Lee Bros. Simple Fresh Southern . ”
“ We add capers , chives and chili flakes to torque the flavor up to 11 and to reinforce the crumbly , relish - like texture of the spread , ” he said .
The result is a pleasantly piquant Southern take on the classic burger .
CHEESE RELISH BURGER
8 Tablespoons cheese relish ( see recipe below )
1 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon canola oil
4 hamburger buns , lightly toasted
4 leaves iceberg lettuce , optional
1 onion , thinly sliced into rings , optional
Condiments , as desired
Divide the cheese into 4 balls , 2 Tablespoons each .
Flatten each ball into a thick patty .
Set aside .
Form the ground beef into 4 balls and flatten into 3/4 - inch - thick patties .
Heat a grill to high and brush the rack with the oil .
Alternatively , heat a large skillet over high and add the oil to coat the bottom of the pan .
Heat until the oil shimmers and begins to smoke .
Reduce the heat to medium , and cook the burgers for 3 minutes on each side .
With a spatula , flip again and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes on the first side , then for another 1 1/2 minutes on the second side for medium - rare .
Top each burger with a patty of the cheese relish , cover the grill or pan , and cook for 1 minute .
Transfer the burgers to the buns and let rest for 2 minutes .
Top each burger with lettuce , onion and condiments , as desired .
Serves 4 .
CHEESE RELISH
10 ounces Swiss cheese , finely grated
12 - ounce jar banana peppers , drained ( 1 tablespoon of the liquid reserved ) and finely minced
2 Tablespoons minced fresh chives or scallions
2 Tablespoons drained capers , rinsed
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Kosher salt , to taste
In a large bowl , combine the cheese , banana peppers , reserved banana pepper liquid , chives or scallions , capers , pepper flakes and black pepper .
Use your hands to knead the mixture together until evenly blended .
Season with salt , then mix again .
The relish can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks .
Makes 2 cups ( enough for 16 burgers ) .
Enough fat to fill nine double - decker buses is being removed from sewers under London 's Leicester Square .
A team of " flushers " equipped with full breathing apparatus has been drafted in with shovels to dig out an estimated 1,000 tonnes of putrid fat .
And powerful jets are being used to break it down .
The operation , which began in the early hours of this morning , is claimed to be the largest - ever sewer clean - up of its kind .
The build - up is the result of years of " sewer abuse " - when anything other than water , human waste and toilet paper is put down drains - according to Thames Water .
Danny
Brackley , the water company 's sewer flusher , said : " We 're used to getting our hands dirty , but nothing on this scale .
" We could n't even access the sewer as it was blocked by a four - foot wall of solid fat . "
The clean - up is expected to last a couple of weeks .
Johannesburg , South Africa ( CNN ) --
The influx of thousands of soccer fans would increase demand on South African sex workers ; at least that was the belief of a leading expert prior to the start of the 2010 World Cup .
But it seems fans of the beautiful game that traveled to the Rainbow Nation have created a flop in sex - worker business -- leaving prostitutes out - of - pocket and out of work -- in favor of more high - brow pursuits .
" The World Cup has been devastating .
We thought it was going to be a cash cow but it 's chased a lot of the business away .
It 's been the worst month in my company 's history , " the owner and founder of one of Johannesburg 's most exclusive escort companies told CNN .
" No one is interested in sex at the moment .
I think we 've had three customers who traveled here for the World Cup which has seen my group 's business drop by 80 percent .
I enjoyed watching the games , but I can't wait for everyone to just go home now ! " the madam , who works under the alias of " Tori , " added .
The behavior of fans in South Africa has run contrary to what was predicted prior to the start of the tournament after David Bayever told World Cup organizers in March it was feared that up to 40,000 extra prostitutes could converge in the host nation to meet the expected demand .
Bayever , deputy chairperson of South Africa 's Central Drug Authority ( CDA ) that advises on drug abuse but also works with prostitutes , warned : " Forty - thousand new prostitutes .
As if we do not have enough people of our own , we have to import them to ensure our visitors are entertained . "
But the tournament in 2010 , if anything , has seen the modern - day soccer fan attracted to art galleries and museums over brothels .
A trend that has seen a drop in revenue across the board for the prostitution industry , which is illegal in South Africa .
" Zobwa , " the chairperson of Sisonke -- an action group representing around 70 street prostitutes in Johannesburg -- said business had been down over the last month .
" People went to the bars and stadiums to watch the games and afterwards they went home .
They did n't bother themselves with coming to us , " Zobwa , who works as a prostitute told CNN .
" Before the tournament we were getting good money but [ over the month ] it has not been busy at all .
We thought it was going to be much better but it has been boring .
I 've actually left Johannesburg now because there has been so little trade .
" Police have been keen to keep ladies off the streets and I do n't think the foreign visitors were interested , " Zobwa added .
But where one industry declined because of the change in soccer fans ' tastes , another has boomed -- cultural centers such as museums and art galleries have reported record attendance .
Wayde Davy , deputy director of Johannesburg 's Apartheid Museum , said visitors to see the exhibitions on South Africa 's struggle against racial inequality had never been so good .
" Before the tournament we anticipated an increase in numbers , we planned for around 2,000 a day but we 've actually seen around 4,000 a day .
One day we saw over 6,000 people -- it 's gone through the roof .
" We thought people were coming here for the soccer and party but we 've been pleasantly surprised .
Some of the teams visited too , " Davy added .
Antoinette Murdoch , the chief curator of the Johannesburg Art Gallery -- which specializes in contemporary art installations -- said she had seen similar results .
" Fifty percent of our visitors have been international and there 's a strong correlation between their country of origin and the teams playing in the World Cup , " Murdoch said .
" We normally have around 3,000 visitors but this month it 's been closer to 4,000 which is a significant increase for us .
We were worried that we would be inundated with sport hooligans , but there seems a lot of interest in our culture .
We 're situated by a fan park , but we 've had no examples of drunken behavior , just friendly visitors and big donations in our tips box ! "
Diana Wall , manager of collections at Museum Africa , said her center had also seen an influx of culture - craving soccer fans .
" Last June we had 472 foreign visitors , this year we 've had nearly two - and - a - half thousand since the first match .
We 're situated in Newtown , a cultural district of Johannesburg , and our numbers have improved significantly . "
Though reticent to comment before an official post - tournament report had been conducted , Roshene Singh , the chief marketing officer for South Africa Tourism , suggested that South Africa playing host might have made a difference .
" Having a World Cup in Africa is different from going somewhere more local .
It 's a long - haul trip so many have traveled with a holiday in mind too , so they probably want to have more of a total experience of the destination .
" We estimate that in the region of 300,000 people visited for the World Cup on packages costing anything between $ 2000 to $ 20,000 .
We noticed that most fans were between the age range of 25 - 55 - years - old , with many coming in as families or with corporate sponsors .
" People who come to South Africa come for our people and our culture , those visiting have certainly had a great time .
The township of Soweto has been full ; shopping in the cities has also been very popular .
The fans have been very well behaved and South Africans have been great hosts , " she added .

Have a look at this Bloomberg story :
Billionaire Edward Lampert may have found a way to shield himself from millions of dollars in taxes under legislation that would raise levies on profits at private - equity firms .
ESL Partners LP , the Greenwich , Connecticut , hedge fund Lampert started more than 20 years ago , and affiliates distributed about $ 829 million of stock ... to him on June 2 ...
By taking direct ownership of the shares , Lampert would be taxed at the capital - gains rate of 15 percent when the stock is sold , rather than the ordinary income rate of 39.6 percent that his fund would have to pay under the bill , according to Robert Willens , whose New York - based firm analyzes tax and accounting rules for Wall Street clients .
Lampert is ranked 316th on the Forbes list of world 's richest people , with an estimated net worth of $ 3 billion .
“ It 's totally an astute thing to do , ” Willens said in a telephone interview .
“ It does n't take a fortune teller to predict that we are going to see a lot of this activity between now and the end of the year . ”
The economist thing to say is that it 's obviously rational to avoid taxation when possible , and this is why governments need to take heed when designing tax regimes .
Individuals will do what they can to avoid paying , either by reducing the taxed behaviour or acting to take advantage of loopholes .
And the rich will be best able to do this .
But let 's be honest for a moment .
According to this Bloomberg story , Mr Lampert is worth $ 3 billion .
If he earns just 1 % per year on that fortune — and he certainly earns much more — then he takes home $ 30 million in income .
Per year .
That 's 600 times the median household income in America .
It 's more money than a person can reasonably spend .
With that much money you can binge every day , and yet the money will just keep accumulating .
And yet Mr Lampert feels he needs to take special steps to avoid paying the regular income tax rate for individuals in the highest tax bracket , which begins at around $ 373,000 ( the 15 % bracket , by the way , begins at $ 8,375 for an individual ) .
Obviously , most of the people bringing home that level of income are generating it in wages and salary , and they have no choice but to pay the income tax rate .
I 'm sure if you approached Mr Lampert and told him he did n't work for his money , he 'd bristle at the suggestion .
And yet he wants to continue to take advantage of the silly rule by which the money hedge fund managers make from doing their job is taxed as capital gains rather than income .
As far as I can tell , this is entirely within the law .
But I do n't think it 's improper to declare it obscene .
Shameful , even .
With a fortune of that size , additional wealth is about little more than score - keeping .
You can afford to be a grown - up and pay the same taxes as everyone else .
It sounds horribly populist to say so , but the fact that this kind of behaviour is lauded in the financial press when it ought to be scorned is a real problem .
It 's a problem in that it reveals big money men to be as brazen in their behaviour as they were before the crash .
But it 's also an indicator that something remains broken in America 's attitude toward wealth .
You wo n't find WikiLeaks ' biggest impact in any specific story the site has exposed .
You 'll find it in the bracing fear of what the place might publish next .
That anxiety , more than anything else , explains the arrest of Bradley Manning , the soldier who allegedly leaked that infamous video of the airstrikes that killed two Reuters employees in Baghdad .
The government does n't want to deal with a world where a disillusioned functionary can spill secrets so easily , and it 's doing everything it can to bring back the days when leaking a story was far harder .
For those who tuned in late : WikiLeaks is an online operation that lets whistleblowers publish damaging documents without anyone — not even the people who run the website — learning who the leaker is .
Besides the Baghdad footage , its revelations have ranged from the emails that set off the climategate scandal to the Standard Operating Procedures manual from the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay .
The authorities arrested Manning after he told an informant that he had sent the site the video and a trove of other damaging information , including thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables .
The cables have not yet materialized , and WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange says he does n't have them .
It 's not yet clear that Manning actually is the leaker , as opposed to merely being a braggart .
But I hope he avoids a jail term either way .
The Obama administration has brought an ugly double standard to the misdeeds committed during the Bush years .
It has passed up opportunities to prosecute those crimes on the grounds that it wants " to look forward and not backwards , " but it has shown no such restraint when it comes to prosecuting the people who exposed those crimes in the first place .
Having brought charges against two other leakers , including NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake , the feds now seem set to do the same thing to Manning .
Meanwhile , WikiLeaks itself has been the subject of an Army counterintelligence report , which suggested that " identification , exposure , termination of employment , criminal prosecution , [ or ] legal action against " whistleblowers could " damage or destroy " the belief that WikiLeaks protects its sources ' identities , and will thus " deter others considering similar actions from using the Wikileaks.org Web site . "
( We know about the report because it appeared — where else ? — on WikiLeaks . )
WikiLeaks has attracted a wide range of criticisms , and not just from the knee - jerk defenders of the institutions it exposes .
A similar public disclosure site , Cryptome , has published texts allegedly written by " A WIKILEAKS Insider , " who accuses the organization of failing to protect its leakers and of misleading the public about its finances .
But most critiques of WikiLeaks boil down to one of two complaints .
The first is that it distributes information that should n't be spread ; the second is that it distributes claims that are n't accurate .
Put another way , people complain that it's too truthful and that it is n't truthful enough .
The second criticism has n't come up as often as you might expect .
When WikiLeaks publishes an article analyzing the documents on the site , the writer 's claims are dissected and denounced as widely as any other arguments on the Internet .
But with rare exceptions , the documents themselves tend to be accepted as legitimate .
Pundits may debate the meaning of the Baghdad video , the climategate emails , or the Guantanamo prison manual , but their provenance has been well - established .
Given the enemies that WikiLeaks has made , you might expect that by this time someone would have attempted to discredit the outfit by feeding it phony data .
But if this has been tried , there 's no sign yet that the site has taken the bait .
As a means of distributing raw information , WikiLeaks works .
For some critics , it works too well .
Many people argued that WikiLeaks went too far in 2008 , when it posted the technical details of some of the jammers the military had used to stop insurgents from detonating IEDs in Iraq .
The decision did n't necessarily put lives in danger — by the time the material appeared , the jammers in question had largely been superceded — but it 's hard to see what it was supposed to achieve either .
Exposing information can carry risks , and in that case the risk was n't worth it .
But concealing information can be risky as well .
Thanks to WikiLeaks , Chinese citizens have access to information about unrest in Tibet ; thanks to WikiLeaks , Kenyans can read about the extrajudicial killings committed by their own police .
Thanks to WikiLeaks , we have evidence of corruption in the Kaupthing Bank in Iceland , and of deadly toxic dumping off the coast of Africa .
WikiLeaks has expanded our knowledge of how prisoners are treated at Guantanamo , how the CIA tries to manage public opinion in Europe , and how some prominent climate scientists talk about their critics .
And if Thomas Drake had revealed the NSA 's illicit surveillance program to WikiLeaks instead of the Baltimore Sun , he might not be facing a prison sentence today .
You can complain about some of the editorial decisions that WikiLeaks ' managers have made , but as with the free press in general , we 're better off with the site than without it .
Above all , we 're better off now that the large , hierarchical institutions where potential leakers dwell have one more reason to look over their shoulders .
At some point , even the most thick - headed , slow - moving bureaucratic dinosaurs just might recognize that they 're living in a new environment , one where corrupt corporations and government agencies are no more able to control the flow of embarrassing information than record companies can control the flow of digital music files .
Just as the online MP3 swap meet continued to thrive after downloaders started landing in court and Napster was effectively destroyed , the revolution that WikiLeaks represents wo n't die even if Manning is imprisoned and Julian Assange 's site shuts down .
Thanks to the Internet , a new wave of grassroots journalists , and a global network of human rights activists , it 's less risky than ever before to release incriminating information anonymously .
The result will be a world where it 's easier not just to expose misbehavior but to deter it .

A loyal reader of Brew Blog whined to us last week about the recent foray into winter beers when it's , well , not winter outside .
But we tend not to agonize over our pickings when buying beer .
The heart ( gut? palate ? ) wants what it wants .
This week 's pick , Real Ale 's Sisyphus Barleywine Ale , had been swimming around in our mind for a few weeks since Anvil tapped a cask of it June 24 during the Firkin Fest ( and we missed getting a sample ) .
So we grabbed a bottle at Central Market recently and thought we'd share for those who may have only quaffed the Texas brewery 's blue , green and brown - labeled bottles .
The satiny - lime - green - labeled Sisyphus is , like last week 's stout , more of a winter beer , and the Blanco - based brewery releases it during cold weather ( the brewery 's first seasonal product , in fact , according to its Web site ) .
Our sample was only from last year , but presumably there are older versions out and about if you ask .
We did n't regret the choice in the least .
Barleywines are an old style , hailing from an era when the drinking public toiled at manual labor tasks all day and needed a hearty brew or two to serve as not only beverage but also muscle relaxant and sleeping pill after sundown .
The Sisyphus weighs in at about 11 percent alcohol , and you know it with each sip , but the booze never stings .
That 's nice .
This beer is thick and rich , but not syrupy , and while it 's bitter first , there are plenty of other flavors to enjoy .
There 's a bright , fruity tinge to it and plenty of sweet aroma , but it transitions fairly quickly to bitter after the malty first notes , and finishes with a very long , very pronounced ( but welcome ) bitterness .
Frankly , it 's nice to be reminded that a beer can be a sledgehammer without relying fully on the ashy flavor of over - roasted malt or the acidic slap of a bushel of hops .
Toward the end of the glass the brew loses most of its bite and mellows out .
The bitterness does n't linger as long , and the bright fruit flavors fade .
It 's still rich , though .
We daresay this need not be a winter beer , though certainly do n't try to sit outside and drink it -- unless you happen to own one of those fake - snow - making machines .
In that case , go ahead .
His home team has been knocked out .
But Paul the " psychic " octopus is still a winner after correctly predicting Germany would be beaten during this morning 's do - or - die World Cup semi-final clash with Spain .
German fans had been praying the two - year - old cephalopod had made an uncharacteristic cock - up when , from his aquarium in the German city of Oberhausen , he chose the Spaniards to triumph .
But now even hardened cynics must be thinking twice about dismissing advice from the football soothsayer , who has shot to fame during this World Cup with his ability to pick the outcome of matches with astonishing accuracy .
The method his owners use at Aquarium Sea Life is simple .
They lower two containers of mussels into his tank , one emblazoned with the flag of Germany , the other with the flag of their football opponent .

We ’ve enjoyed MGMT ’s album Oracular Spectacular since it came out last fall , but with the band playing at McCarren Pool later this month — and the subject of a profile in our own magazine this week — we realized we still do n’t know for sure how to pronounce the band ’s name .
Is it “ Management , ” which we ’ve heard used to be their name before some other band laid claim to it ?
Is it just the letters pronounced in order — “ Em Gee Em Tee ” ?
Or is it some mumbled version of “ Management ” with the vowels removed ( “ Mij- mit ” ) ?
Some blog commenters claim it ’s one thing ; others claim it ’s another .
Rolling Stone says it ’s “ Management . ”
David Letterman says it ’s “ Em Gee Em Tee . ”
Time for some totally necessary Vulture detective work !
We called the band ’s label , Columbia , and a publicist told us it ’s definitely pronounced “ Em Gee Em Tee . ”
This seems to be confirmed by this video , in which MGMT ’s Andrew VanWyngarden pronounces it that way .
But we would n’t put it past these guys to change it again , to “ Magma ” or something .

New Orleans film producer Bess Carrick wanted to see what the Gulf of Mexico looked like in the 48 miles between the tip of the Mississippi Delta and the blown Macondo wellhead for a series she is producing called The Barataria Chronicles .
She had met NASA pilot , Caltech graduate and theoretical physicist Dr. Bonny Schumaker , and convinced Bonny to take her on a fly - by on Monday .
This was 24 hours before the mainstream talking heads of all political stripes were declaring that only one barrel of oil had been skimmed from the Gulf on Tuesday , so it looked pretty much as if the crisis were over .
But is it ?
The oil flowed mercilessly for 86 days until July 15 , dumping 200 million gallons of Louisiana crude into the Gulf of Mexico .
SkyTruth , the website that has accurately depicted the size and scope of the river of oil since the days when BP was maintaining a paltry 1000 barrels per day , has a nifty analysis and a couple of good caveats .
Oil floating at the ocean ’s surface has a limited lifespan – it ’s been collected and destroyed by skimming , booms , chemical dispersants , evaporation , photolysis , biodegradation – and took a beating from wind and waves when tropical depression Bonnie blew through over the weekend .
If the well stays plugged until the static - kill and bottom - kill efforts permanently plug it with cement , then the remaining fragments of slick should disappear within days .
The big question remains and SkyTruth asked it .
All of those 200 million gallons did not vanish .
How much oil ca n’t be seen with satellite images ?
How much oil is buried in beach sands , embedded in marshes , is still dispersed in the water column or is lying on the sea floor ?
The Washington Post suggested that while the feds have been fixated on the Natural Resources Damages Assessment ( NRDA ) process prescribed by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , “ BP has been engaging academic scientists for its NRDA defense .
Billions of dollars are at stake , so litigation is likely to go on for years . ”
Politicians , BP and the Coast Guard “ sock puppets ” would sure be happy if those 200 million gallons just went away .
Carrick wanted to see for herself , and so she did , presenting a snapshot of one afternoon that speaks volumes about the necessity to keep up with the research and keep all eyes on the Gulf before research succumbs to litigation .
Carrick is admittedly a producer and not an editor , but she managed to learn Final Cut Pro software in three weeks ( no small task ) and set off to chronicle Barataria Bay .
She is no newbie to production , and her most recent full - length , award - winning documentary , “ Lindy Boggs : Steel and Velvet ” explores the life of journalist Cokie Robert ’s mother , Ambassador Lindy Boggs .
The documentary won a Telly award and currently is in national distribution on PBS .
Carrick also happens to have built a nature retreat on the edge of the wilderness in Mississippi , among other things .
But that is another story .
NASA pilot Schumaker is Sea Shepherd ’s liaison for Operation Gulf Rescue , and has been in the Gulf since the early days of the oil disaster .
She has been flying with NASA colleagues doing remote sensing and spectral imaging and uses her commercial pilot ’s license as credentialing collateral to fly government officials , journalists and people like Carrick .
Schumaker is also the founder of the non-profit
On the Wings of Care , dedicated to promoting the welfare of domestic animals and wildlife and their habitats by helping with searches , rescues , transports , rehabilitation , and scientific research .
There is spectacular photography of what remains of the Deepwater Horizon Macondo wellhead site , known in pilot lingo as “ The Source ” on the website .
Schumaker was able to take the cameras below the 3,000 feet general aviation exclusion zone and get up close to the Gulf .
You can track her flights here .
Although she saw less “ observable oil ” on the surface , something else was also lacking .
Other than a school of golden rays , the normal sea life , such as dolphins were largely absent .
Where did they go , and why ?
Did they leave the contaminated zone on their own , or are their bodies lying unnoticed , undocumented , and ultimately abandoned on the sea floor .
No one knows .
Beleaguered Raccoon Island remains in peril , confirming reports of biologist Drew Wheelan and photographer Jerry Moran .
According to Wheelan :
Raccoon Island , one of the most densely populated islands with birds in the entire state was left with one layer of deflective inner harbor type boom , which was completely useless against the waves and the wind from a storm in early July .
As of last Friday , day 94 , this boom was still piled high up on the beach , having been washed ashore with the same oil that drenched a large number of birds , an event that was brought to light by Cornell University biologists studying the colony .
Carrick videoed hundreds of feet of oiled orange deflective boom that was piled on breakwaters , unattended , and birds were perching in the mess .
After her flight Carrick and I communicated on Facebook , and I think one of the huge social networking stories will be how ordinary people , concerned about the Gulf , connected through this medium .
I think David Mathison might do well to add a chapter to his book , “ Be the Media , ” about this phenomenon .
Carrick said she found more questions and concerns than answers .
It was so cool to go out there .
There is no flare burning at the top of the Horizon well any longer .
Lots of boats , making a .mov now of my rough edits around the well site .
What I can say is that you can see deep sunken oil patches out there .
As you fly away you can see some streams of oil , but the dispersants have either deteriorated it totally into some unseen form , or you can see it deep beneath the surface .
We saw only a school of golden rays and they , sadly , were swimming right in the dispersant streams and toward oil under the sea .
Sure hated to see that .
There were no dolphins anywhere in the Mississippi Sound over by the Gulf coast and that is usually loaded with them .
I do hope they have gone off somewhere safe .
I will say something kind of shocking I saw on the way back .
Just about 4 miles off the coast of Bay St Louis over to Biloxi we saw lots of oil offshore , deep dark patches , big ones .
And of course , the little people swimming on shore .
I think this is crazy that they lifted the fishing ban and are not telling people to stay out of the water
The islands , the Chandeliers were cleaned and some birds were there .
Raccoon
Point is totally screwed , oil on the beach , birds there nesting .
That one has just not gotten the attention it sorely needed .
Meanwhile , back at the cable and news networks , you can almost hear the shuffling of equipment and personnel as they close up shop on the Gulf disaster and wait breathlessly for the next crisis .
Maybe they will come back in six months , like they did for Haiti , and find things worse than when they left .
Or maybe this will be ignored for twenty years , like the Exxon Valdez was , and only revisited after the next catastrophe .
And the news cycles go ’round and ’round .

It is unclear how Mr. Amiri ’s information fed into the 2007 intelligence estimate .
That document contended that Iran halted its design work on a nuclear weapon in 2003 .
A new national intelligence estimate , which has been repeatedly delayed this year , is likely to back away from some of the conclusions in the earlier document .
For example , American intelligence officials now believe the design work on a weapon was resumed and continues to this day , though likely at a slower pace than earlier in the decade .
Mr. Amiri , a specialist in measuring radioactive materials , is not believed to have been central to any of Iran ’s efforts at weapons design .
But he worked at the Malek Ashtar University , which some American officials think is used as an academic cover for the organization responsible for designing weapons and warheads that could fit atop an Iranian missile .
Those operations are run by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , an Iranian academic with long and close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps .
Mr. Fakhrizadeh , United States officials maintain , is now effectively the head of the university , and in an effort to evade international inspectors has reorganized the structure of the Iranian program .
The National Council of Resistance of Iran , an opposition group based in France , in 2004 disclosed the existence of what it called a secret administrative headquarters for the military aspects of the Iranian program .
The group made public more information in 2008 , saying the site was in a suburb of Tehran adjacent to the university , giving it academic cover , and was called Mojdeh , after an adjacent street .
Mohammad Mohaddessin , head of the group ’s foreign affairs committee , said the school “ does not operate like a university . ”
Instead , he said , it is “ a center for research and development of weapons ” and works in cooperation with the Mojdeh site .
The American officials said that at some point while working as a secret informant , Mr. Amiri visited Saudi Arabia , and the C.I.A. arranged to spirit him out of that country and eventually to the United States , where he settled in Arizona .
It is unclear whether Mr. Amiri tried to bring his wife and child with him .
Administration officials conceded that Mr. Amiri ’s decision to come out of hiding and return to Iran was both a large embarrassment and a possible disincentive to future defections .
But the incident is also an embarrassment for Iran .
Analysts said that even if he is publicly greeted as a hero , Mr. Amiri will probably be viewed with suspicion by the Iranian government .
Detroit was once the engine of America 's automotive industry .
Today it is a symbol of urban decay .
But a daring bid to return the land to farming is sowing seeds of recovery – and could be a template for cities across the world
Strolling around his inner-city Detroit neighbourhood , Mark Covington pauses to take in the view .
The houses and shops that existed when he was a child are gone , replaced by empty lots , the buildings either burned down or demolished .
In their place is wilderness .
Tall grass , wild flowers and trees .
" Just look at that , " he says .
" It could be a country road . "
Such views are increasingly common all over Detroit , the forlorn former capital of America 's car industry and now a by - word for calamitous urban decline .
Once the fourth largest city in America , its population has shrunk from about 1.8 million at its peak in the 1950s to fewer than 900,000 now .
Its streets are lined with an incredible 33,000 empty lots and vacant houses .
City government is broke .
The shells of dilapidated factories look out over an urban landscape that has been likened to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina – except Detroit 's disaster was man-made and took decades to unfold .
Now the seeds of a remarkable rebirth are being planted – literally .
Across Detroit , land is being turned over to agriculture .
Furrows are being tilled , soil fertilised and crops planted and harvested .
Like in no other city in the world , urban farming has taken root in Detroit , not just as a hobby or a sideline but as part of a model for a wholesale revitalisation of a major city .
Some farms are the product of hardy individualists or non-profit community groups .
Others , like Hantz Farms , are backed by millions of dollars and aim to build the world 's biggest urban farm right in the middle of the city .
Mark Covington , 38 , is one of those 21st - century pioneers , though he stumbled on his role almost by accident .
Finding himself unemployed after losing his job as an environmental engineer and living back with his mother two years ago , he started tidying up an empty lot near his Georgia Street home , planting vegetables and allowing local people to harvest them for free .
An orchard of fruit trees followed , as did a community centre – made by converting a pair of empty buildings – which keeps local youths off the streets .
The result is a transformation of the area around his childhood home .
Local kids come to movie nights held amid the crops .
Residents love the free , fresh food in an area where no major supermarkets exist .
The Georgia Street Community Garden is never vandalised .
Standing next to a freshly planted bed of onions , potatoes , garlic and collard greens , Covington is a genial soul with gentleness built into a giant physical frame that could play American football .
As he walks his neighbourhood , it seems everyone knows his name and calls out hello .
He seems unsure of whether or not he is at the forefront of a social revolution , but he does know that he has made a big difference to a part of the city where real improvements have been in short supply .
" I just did what seemed like needed to be done , " he shrugs .
A familiar refrain from many of the thousands of people involved in urban farming in Detroit is that they are returning the city to its pre-industrial roots .
Back in the late 18th century , Detroit was a small trading post surrounded by fields and farms .
" You know , this area began as farmland and we are just going back to that , " says Rich Wieske , who runs more than 60 beehives in inner-city Detroit and sells the resulting honey commercially .
The middle - aged Wieske sports a white beard and a passion for his bees .
What began as a hobby to provide honey for making mead has now turned into a profession .
As he tends five of his hives , situated on a plot of land that used to house a grand brick mansion , but is now a pleasant patch of woodland , Wieske marvels at how suitable the environment of the inner city is for his tiny charges .
Each year Wieske 's apiary , Green Toe Gardens , produces about 3,000lb of honey and sells it in local Detroit markets .
" Our harvests are as high as anywhere else in the US .
There is so much forage , so much land for the bees , " he says .
Yet the fact remains that for the past 100 years Detroit was all about industry .
It was where Henry Ford invented the production line , giving birth to the car industry .
Detroit became the archetypal American 20th - century metropolis on the back of hundreds of huge factories , surrounded by solid middle - class houses and a thriving downtown filled with skyscrapers .
It was a magnet for immigrant workers and produced vast industrial fortunes for grand American families , becoming a centre of culture and manufacturing where politicians could dream of one day rivalling New York .
No more .
The car industry faded , taking jobs with it .
" White flight " saw neighbourhoods decay as the middle classes departed , ruining any chance of raising enough taxes for the city 's upkeep .
A once - wealthy , ethnically mixed city is now more than 80 % black , with an unemployment rate believed to be as high as 50 % .
Since the 1970s there have been numerous efforts to stem the decline , either by trying to stop the car factories from leaving or by bringing in new industries , such as the massive casinos that have sprung up downtown .
All have failed .
Detroit is not being transformed by some massive top - down initiative , but by projects like the urban farm that has emerged on Linwood Street .
It 's a typical Detroit scene , with burnt - out shops , empty lots and houses , plus a few other buildings where residents are barely clinging on .
It is busy with the roar of traffic , as well as the sound of a small John Deere tractor which is mowing the grass around a large plot of bare earth that has been prepared for planting .
There are more bare fields on nearby lots .
The smell of damp earth and fertiliser mingles with exhaust fumes .
The Linwood Street urban farm is now in its fourth planting season , producing a bounty of corn , squash and potatoes for local residents to harvest , again for free .
Developed by Urban Farming , which was founded by Detroit singer and former Prince protégé Taja Sevelle , the movement is dedicated to turning vacant land over to food production , providing a healthier diet to city people who either go hungry or have poor nutrition .
Some of Urban Farming 's projects , such as Linwood , are huge , spanning several city blocks and generating substantial amounts of food .
Others , like planting single gardens on rooftops or creating " living walls " , are small .
Last year alone the group oversaw the creation of 900 food gardens in Detroit .
Some were in people 's gardens , others on land donated to charities by local people or bought from the city .
Sevelle sees what is happening as a harbinger of urban development for the western world 's declining inner cities , with Detroit at the cutting edge of the phenomenon .
" I see the entire world looking different .
Detroit will be number one in showing people how to pull a city out of a situation like this , " she says .
Not that such grand thoughts are a concern to Linwood Street residents such as William Myers , a 70 - year - old retired General Motors worker .
He just knows that the crops sprouting from the fields that have unexpectedly sprung up on his street are feeding many of his poor neighbours .
As with many community or charity - run farms , the food is simply available free to residents .
When it is ready they can come and harvest it straight from the ground themselves .
Such a scheme might seem a recipe for chaos , but vandalism on the city 's urban farms is almost unknown .
They are unfenced , open to all , and run by volunteers or charity workers .
It is hoped that residents who eat the food will also help to grow it .
But there are no set rules .
" It 's beautiful , " Myers says .
" There 's a lot of people around here who really need it , and they say it tastes very good . "
Agriculture has long existed in the nooks and crannies of urban life .
Market gardens , allotments and backyard plots have always helped provide extra nourishment for city dwellers .
That 's certainly the tradition that Patrick Crouch sees himself following .
A red -haired man dressed in T - shirt and jeans , he is working hard in the late - spring sunshine .
" Mind the asparagus ! " he calls out as he pushes a hand plough through the soil of the Earthworks Urban Farm .
Situated in one of Detroit 's most deprived areas , it provides food for a soup kitchen , which is run by Capuchin monks and is vital for the neighbourhood 's poorest residents .
" I think there is a historic context to this , " he says .
" There is a long history of urban farming .
I look for inspiration to the Parisian market gardens of the 19th century . "
Crouch , who has a background in agricultural social activism , was born in Maryland , a state known for its rural farming areas .
Yet he ended up in Detroit practising his agrarian skills , and Earthworks now has the potential to transform his adopted city by creating one thing the city needs more than anything else : a way to make a living .
Crouch is developing a " model plot " that consists of rows of vegetables , some beehives and a compost heap .
He believes that with hard work the model plot could be replicated on individual lots across the city and provide owners with the means to produce an income of perhaps $ 20,000 a year .
In Detroit that wage could be nothing short of miraculous .
" This garden could be replicated and turned over for profit .
That 's the goal .
It could provide a living wage , " he says .
The strange thing about Detroit is that the soil of its urban landscape is capable of supporting farming even after more than a century of urbanisation .
Though many factory sites are contaminated , the land under the city 's houses is often not .
Crouch has tested the soil that Earthworks farms , and though frequently poor in nutrients , it 's usually not polluted .
Now , with each round of farming , harvesting and composting , it 's improving every year .
Earthworks ' crops of vegetables and fruits are even certified organic .
There are even more grand plans afoot elsewhere .
Mike Score , president of Hantz Farms , has a vision of something that no other modern city has ever attempted : running full - scale commercial farms .
Operating out of a former factory , Hantz Farms – the brainchild of John Hantz , one of the last remaining wealthy white financiers living in the city – is planning a wholesale transformation of the landscape and the creation of a proper agricultural industry .
Score sees a future for farming on a large scale , on city land cleared of houses and their residents , with abandoned factories turned into hydroponic operations full of tomatoes and other crops planted all year around in artificial climates .
The business could create the jobs , taxes and income that no other industrial sector in the city has provided for years .
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to reshape Detroit , " says Score .
" Small - scale farming cannot create jobs .
We believe we can do that .
We can make all the difference . "
There is certainly enough land .
Abandoned houses , vacant lots and empty factories now make up about a third of Detroit , totalling around 40 square miles – the size of San Francisco .
Walking around the rows of houses surrounding the Hantz offices , Score envisions a landscape dominated by agriculture .
With his black cowboy boots and a lilting accent that seems to hint at the South , he looks an unlikely visionary for urban Detroit as he describes vegetable plots , fields and greenhouses , all the while wielding a hefty stick to keep away stray dogs and looking at burnt - out houses sometimes used as crack dens .
In among the ruins there are a few rows of neatly kept homes where brave residents continue to cling on , but Score does not see their presence as a problem .
" We are not like a developer like Walmart , where we need the whole block of land to develop a new store .
If someone is still living in their house and does n't want to leave or sell , that 's OK , " he says .
" We can just farm around them . "
Score 's project is not idle fantasy : Hantz Farms is expected to begin farming on a 40 - acre plot in the city soon .
It will be the largest urban farm in the world , and if it is successful other Hantz programmes will be implemented , and commercial farming will have begun within a few miles of downtown .
This has certainly caught the attention of cash - strapped local government .
Detroit mayor Dave Bing is currently working on a blueprint for the city 's future , to be announced in the next 18 months , which is expected to involve concentrating Detroit 's remaining residents within still - viable areas and abandoning neighbourhoods that are considered past the point of no return .
The effect would be to create " nodes " of urban population surrounded by large stretches of land , likely to be largely empty .
Detroit would become a more modern city , with many of its derelict and isolated buildings torn down .
Its citizens could work a mix of rural and urban jobs , their health and diets nourished and improved by their own city 's crops .
Hantz Farms believes its large - scale farming would fit in perfectly with such a scheme .
Yet a big commercial operation like Hantz is not without critics .
Community groups and some urban farming activists distrust the corporation 's profit motive , accusing it of attempting a " land grab " .
Such criticisms are shrugged off by Score , who sees his commercial farms operating side by side with community organisations .
" I do n't see why it has to be an either or option , " he says .
" We can both coexist in changing the city and turning it into something else . "
To some extent this is already happening .
A city - wide alliance of non-profit organisations is sponsoring the Shar Foundation , which aims to farm up to 2,000 acres in 15 - to 30 - acre pods : like Hantz Farms ' plans , these will be run as agricultural businesses .
Urban farms are already springing up in similar faded urban giants of the " American Rust Belt " such as Cleveland and Buffalo .
Nor is the idea limited to troubled post - industrial cities : it 's taking hold in vibrant metropolises like New York and Los Angeles too .
Sevelle 's organisation , born in Detroit , is now helping to set up urban farms and gardens nationwide .
" We are doing this in more than 25 cities across the US and abroad , " she says .
It is possible that the future of cities is being born in Detroit .
If so , that is a vision that Wieske , the genial beekeeper , is happy with .
As he drives to his hives , he disturbs a wild pheasant with his car and it bursts into the sky in an explosion of feathers – a scene common to rural America but rarely associated with an inner city .
" We get pheasants around here all the time , " he says .
He smiles and recites the unofficial slogan of Detroit 's urban farming revolutionaries : " We are turning Motown into Growtown . "

The deepening notes of disenchantment with Barack Obama now issuing from commentators across the political spectrum were predictable .
So , too , were the charges from some of the president 's earliest enthusiasts about his failure to reflect a powerful sense of urgency about the oil spill .
There should have been nothing puzzling about his response to anyone who has paid even modest critical attention to Mr. Obama 's pronouncements .
For it was clear from the first that this president — single - minded , ever - visible , ...
When they start deliberating , probably this afternoon , jurors in the trial of former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle will have to weigh the arguments of a prosecutor and defense attorney who disagree on nearly every facet of the case save one - that Mehserle shot Oscar Grant in the back Jan. 1 , 2009 .
During closing arguments
Thursday , jurors were told that the video - recorded killing during an arrest at BART 's Fruitvale Station in Oakland was either an intentional act by a cop who " lost all control " or a tragic accident by an officer who intended to subdue a suspect with a Taser .
Either the 22 - year - old Grant never resisted Mehserle before being shot or he fought him to the end .
Either Mehserle has profited since from the lies of his colleagues in blue or he 's been hounded by prosecutors under political pressure to deliver his scalp .
After 13 days of testimony , prosecutor David Stein and defense attorney Michael Rains put their clashing spins on the case , with Stein asking for what would be a historic verdict against an officer in a use - of - force case : second - degree murder , punishable by 15 years to life in prison .
" It can never be lawful to shoot an unarmed man , " Stein said , " when that man is face - down in the process of putting his hands behind his back . "
' Let 's pack our bags '
Rains asked jurors to acquit Mehserle , 28 , of murder as well as manslaughter , saying , " Let 's pack our bags and go home . "
When the court session ended Thursday , Rains was near the conclusion of his argument .
Stein will deliver a rebuttal argument today before jurors are instructed on laws that apply to the case and then retreat into a meeting room .
There , they will be allowed to discuss the case with one another for the first time .
Unless they can reach a verdict in a case involving dozens of witnesses , six videos and scores of documents in a few hours , they will continue deliberations Tuesday morning , after the holiday weekend .
Contrasting styles
About 50 people filled Judge Robert Perry 's courtroom to hear the closing arguments by attorneys who differed in style as much as in substance .
Stein spoke slowly and evenly , mostly standing at a lectern following notes in a binder as he called up footage of the shooting played on two big - screen televisions .
Rains was more animated , shouting some of his points as he paced around or hunched over the lectern , scanning back and forth across the jury box .
The attorneys argued over whether Mehserle 's actions fit not only the theories of second - degree murder , but also those of voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter .
Mehserle testified last week that he had decided to use his Taser on Grant while trying to handcuff him , and after thinking Grant was reaching in his pocket for a gun .
Prosecutor sees lies
On Thursday , Stein argued first , telling jurors that Mehserle was lying - both about his belief that Grant reached for a gun and about pulling his firearm by accident .
Stein showed how the ex-officer 's pistol holster was designed to prevent an assailant from snatching the weapon .
A hood must be rolled forward and a lever depressed before the gun comes free .
After the shooting , Stein said , Mehserle never told fellow officers that he had meant to fire his Taser .
He referred to testimony from another former BART officer , Anthony Pirone , who said Mehserle had walked up to him minutes after the shooting and said , " Hey Tony , I thought he was going for a gun . "
" He was trying to justify it , " Stein said .
" He 's saying , ' I meant to do what I did , but I have a justification . ' "
Rains started his argument with a direct reference to the implications of the verdict .
Some community leaders , activists and others believe the shooting underscored a larger problem of police officers abusing people of color with little accountability .
Grant was black , and Mehserle is white .
East Bay tensions
The trial was moved to Los Angeles in part because of the tensions the killing caused in the East Bay .
Rains told jurors their job was not to exact revenge , to redress social or racial injustices , or to make " some sort of commentary on the state of relations between the police and the community in this country . "
Rains said Mehserle had a reputation as an unaggressive officer , while Grant had once fled from San Leandro cops after a traffic stop , forcing them to use a Taser on him .
If Mehserle had intended to shoot Grant , he would have fired his pistol more than once and then kept the gun out as he assessed the threat , Rains said .
Instead , the defense attorney said , Mehserle looked shocked after firing his gun , said , " Oh s- , I shot him , " and quickly put the weapon away .
After witnessing much misuse of the Long Tail phrase , this silly post has finally pushed me over the edge .
It 's time to draw the line .
Long
Tails are found everywhere , but not , you know , actually everywhere .
There are many distortions of the term , but the most common one is to use it as a newly - positive synonym for " fringe " .
Invoking the Long Tail is not a magic wand to explain away the apparent lack of demand for what you 've got .
The Long Tail is not a get - out - of - jail - free card for poor - selling product .
Or weak sectors .
Or bad ideas .
The fact that something is n't popular does n't mean that it 's just a matter of time before it will benefit from all sorts of powerful demand - creation Long Tail effects .
More likely , it 's just not good enough to be commercially interesting , and probably never will be .
Most of the " niche " products in the tail are simply crap .
That 's okay , because some significant fraction of them are n't and with a functioning way to separate the good from the bad , they can be found by those who will appreciate them .
But note the essential element : a functioning way to drive demand .
As I 've mentioned in the original article , for Long Tail effects to work , you need both a head of relatively few hits and a tail of many niches , so that recommendations and other filters can lead consumers from one to the other .
A tail without a head is too noisy and apparently random to get consumer traction ; people need to start with the familiar and then move , via trusted recommendations , to the unfamiliar .
Likewise a head without a tail is too limited in choice ; the odds of finding a niche you want are too low to bother exploring much beyond what you already know .
Thus the two big Long Tail opportunities are :
Aggregating hits and niches into a one big curve , from head to tail .
Creating content and products that can plug into someone else 's aggregated curve .
If what you 're selling is fringe , it may well enjoy Long Tail benefits , but only if it can fit nicely into an existing market that has the capacity to drive demand .
If that market does n't exist , it 's unlikely that throwing some niche products out there is going to create it .
Even if it does exist , those products will only reach their audience if the filters and recommendations are good enough to find them .
While I 'm at it , here are some other things the Long Tail is not ( to protect the guilty I will refrain from linking to the offending examples ) :
Commodification
The LT is about nicheification , which is different .
Simple variety
Offering a few different choices or a bit of customization ( like the sandwich filling options in the risible example above ) is not enough .
Long
Tail effects kick in when you 're expanding variety and choice by orders of magnitude -- from 10 x to infinity .
The case for an all amateur , self - published future
The LT will probably have as much commercial content as ever .
It will just be joined by far more amateur fare , forming a relatively seamless continuum from pros to ams .
The actual end of hits
The LT ends the tyranny of hits , shifting the market equally to niches .
But it certainly acknowledges that some things will continue to be a lot more popular than others .
Powerlaw distributions are as natural as diversity itself .
A focus on small markets at the exclusion of large ones Again , you need both hits and niches to allow the filters and recommendation engines to work , driving demand down the curve from the known to the unknown .
Just any powerlaw Powerlaws are ubiquitous .
Long
Tails are not .
The first shows up anywhere you have variety , inequality , and network effects ( word of mouth ) .
The second requires massive variety and a wide range between the hits and niches .
After all , many short tails are simply truncated powerlaw distributions .
They just are n't , er , long .
Venture capitalists who are tired of bogus Long Tail pitches are invited to point the hapless entrepreneurs to this post .
