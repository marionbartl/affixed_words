As noted yesterday , Time has built a protective cocoon around Joe Klein , refusing to print anything that might suggest that their Golden Boy Joe Klein is fallible .
So they 're stonewalling letters like this one from the CHAIRMEN of the House judiciary and intelligence committees :
To the editors of TIME Magazine
Joe Klein recently criticized the RESTORE Act ( " The Tone Deaf Democrats , " Nov. 21 , 2007 ) , claiming that it " would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court . "
This is incorrect .
The RESTORE Act creates " basket " authorizations to allow widespread surveillance of foreign powers ( such as Al Qaeda ) and their agents .
To prevent a repeat of the Bush Administration 's extra-legal warrantless wiretapping program , the court must approve the parameters of the group surveillance to ensure that warrants are still obtained for Americans ' communications .
But no court orders are required for surveillance of foreigners reasonably believed to be outside of the country .
The bill simply will not make our intelligence agencies get thousands of warrants for foreign terrorists .
The RESTORE Act 's blend of executive branch flexibility , court approval , and congressional oversight is calibrated to ensure that the fight against terrorism is conducted in an efficient and constitutional manner .
We would hope that Mr. Klein , having studied the RESTORE
Act further , is no longer so confused as to continue to characterize our system of constitutional checks and balances as " well beyond stupid . "

The Year of Living Biblically : One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible
The Year of Living Biblically is about my quest to live the ultimate biblical life .
To follow every single rule in the Bible as literally as possible .
I obey the famous ones :
The Ten Commandments
Love thy neighbor
Be fruitful and multiply
But also , the hundreds of oft - ignored ones .
Do not wear clothes of mixed fibers .
Do not shave your beard
Stone adulterers
Why ?
Well , I grew up in a very secular home ( I ’m officially Jewish but I ’m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is an Italian restaurant ) .
I ’d always assumed religion would just wither away and we ’d live in a neo-Enlightenment world .
I was , of course , spectacularly wrong .
So was I missing something essential to being a human ?
Or was half the world deluded ?
I decided to dive in headfirst .
To try to experience the Bible myself and find out what ’s good in it , and what ’s maybe not so relevant to the 21st century .
The resulting year was fascinating , entertaining and informative .
It was equal parts irreverent and reverent .
It was filled with surprising insights almost every day .
( I know it ’s not biblical to boast , so apologies for that ) .
The book that came out of the year has several layers .
An exploration of some of the Bible ’s startlingly relevant rules .
I tried not to covet , gossip , or lie for a year .
I ’m a journalist in New York .
This was not easy .
An investigation of the rules that baffle the 21st century brain .
How to justify the laws about stoning homosexuals ?
Or smashing idols ?
Or sacrificing oxen ?
And how do you follow those in modern - day Manhattan ?
A look at various fascinating religious groups .
I embedded myself among several groups that take the Bible literally in their own way , from creationists to snake handlers , Hasidim to the Amish .
A critique of fundamentalism .
I became the ultra - fundamentalist .
I found that fundamentalists may claim to take the Bible literally , but they actually just pick and choose certain rules to follow .
By taking fundamentalism extreme , I found that literalism is not the best way to interpret the Bible .
A spiritual journey .
As an agnostic , I ’d never seriously explored such things as sacredness and revelation .
A memoir of my family ’s eccentric religious history , including my ex-uncle Gil , who has been , among other things , a Hindu cult leader , an evangelical Christian and an Orthodox Jew .
The Year of Living Biblically has received praise from Publishers Weekly , Kirkus Reviews , The New York Times Book Review , the Los Angeles Times , USA Today and others .
Reviews
As you have probably know , most online readers do n’t read line by line , instead they scan ( from one point to another ) .
For this reason , designers create typographic contrast and flow by emphasizing certain text .
Contrast is important because not all the content within a page have the same value , some have greater significance than the others .
By creating contrast , you can direct the reader ’s attention to the important messages and at the same time enhance the visual appearance .
Here are seven basic methods on how you can create typographic contrast .
1. Size
Larger font size indicate higher priority because it draws reader ’s attention , therefore this method is commonly applied on headings .
On the other hand , you can de-emphasize by using smaller font size .
2. Typeface / Classification
Contrast can be achieved by mixing different typeface classifications .
However , due to limited web safe fonts , there are only two main classifications commonly used : serif and sans - serif .
Generally , to create a contrast between the headings and the body text , we use serif font for the headings and sans - serif font for the body , or vice versa .
If you want to go beyond the web safe fonts , there are two more options :
CSS image replacement , that is to use CSS to hide the text and replace with a background image .
[ css + bg image = static graphic img ] sIFR ( Flash replacement ) , that is to use Javascript and Flash technology to replace the text with the embedded font .
[ Javascript + Flash = any font dynamically ]
Note : CSS image replacement or sIFR is not practical for long paragraph , so they are normally used for headings .
3. Color
Color contrast is a common way to distinguish between navigation , headings , link , and body text .
You can use faded color to indicate something that is disabled or not available .
Sometime you do n’t need to make something bigger to get more attention , you can create emphasis by using brighter color , such as red .
You can also use color to distinguish individual word within a group of text .
When small font size combined with lighter tone color , the importance of the text is further de-emphasized .
4. Cases
When the same typeface is used for the headings and body text , contrast can be established by changing the case .
Uppercase tends to get more attention than lowercase , therefore it is more suitable for headings .
The CSS property to transform text to uppercase is text - transform : uppercase .
Tips : avoid using uppercase in the body text or in long sentence because it will reduce readability .
5. Style and Decoration
One of the common mistakes made by most editors ( particularly the Microsoft Word users ) , is the tendency to use the underline decoration to emphasize certain text .
This is a big mistake in web typography .
Readers will misinterpret the underlined text as a link because the browser underlines the link by default .
So , do not underline any text that is not a link when posting on the web .
Instead , you can use italic font style .
6. Weight
Making certain text heavier weight ( bold ) can also create emphasis .
Another common mistake is that people tend to bold the entire line of text .
By doing so , the emphasis / contrast of the text is lost .
7. Space
Space plays the most important part in maintaining flow of your design .
Good use of space will tell the reader where to start , when to pause , where it ends , and what to do next .
There are various ways to create space :
Block break ( padding or margin ) is the space in between the block elements .
( or ) is the space in between the block elements .
Paragraph break ( padding or margin ) is the space created after the < p > element .
( or ) is the space created after the element .
Tracking ( letter - spacing ) is the space in between the characters .
( ) is the space in between the characters .
Leading ( line - height ) is the space in between the lines .
( ) is the space in between the lines .
Indentation ( padding or margin ) is commonly used for blockquote and list elements .
Conclusion
Let ’s put all these methods together in practice .

I ‘m off in Norway today , the guest of some folks interested in U.S. foreign policy .
They want me to explain what Americans think of international events and how policymakers formulate foreign policy .
It ’s a daunting , or perhaps more accurately , an embarrassing , task .
Americans know very little about the world .
Their ignorance is almost charming .
In one sense , it ’s good that most people are more interested in spending time with family and friends and in earning a living than in plotting a coup in some faraway land , waging a war against some emerging power , or issuing foreign ultimatums over random economic and political demands .
Unfortunately , however , as a result Americans have essentially delegated the power to do all of those things to a Washington - centered elite .
When things go wrong , Americans get angry .
Then the politicos start blaming each other .
Specific policies sometimes change , but Washington ’s interventionist enthusiasm always quickly returns .
It ’s not a pretty spectacle .
Most Americans are not ideologically committed to turning the U.S. into an imperial power .
Few of them would like to spend months or years patrolling failed foreign states , such as Iraq .
Most of them turn against needless conflicts when it becomes evident that they are n’t going to be short and sweet .
Indeed , when wars go bad  conflicts like Iraq and Somalia  the public eventually says " enough ! "
President Bill Clinton perceived that the debacle in Mogadishu destroyed domestic political support for the mission , so he brought the troops home .
Anger over the Bush administration ’s Iraq war , dishonestly initiated and incompetently waged , led voters to transfer control of Congress to the Democrats .
The failure of Congress to override continuing presidential support for the conflict may lead voters to give the White House to the Democrats as well .
Indeed , though the crazy Republican candidates ( Rudy Giuliani and John McCain ) might be prepared to occupy Iraq forever , the other GOP wannabees likely would bring home the troops for political reasons , if nothing else .
Yet in a perverse sense the biggest foreign policy problem is when the costs seem low .
Then the public simply ignores the issue , giving policymakers wide discretion to continue advancing interventionist policies running contrary to America ’s national interests .
How else to explain continuing American membership in NATO , especially a NATO that keeps expanding ?
In the 1950s and 1960s Europe needed defending from the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies .
From whom is America defending Europe today , a continent with a population and GDP larger than America’s ?
Moreover , what sense does it make to continue expanding NATO up to the borders of Russia , absorbing countries with multiple disputes with Russia , a nuclear - armed power ?
The Baltic states and Poland , in particular , offer Washington security costs , not benefits .
It would be even more foolish to include in an alliance that technically remains the “ North Atlantic ” Treaty Organization the countries of Georgia and Ukraine .
However , the American people remain blissfully unaware of and disinterested in their nation ’s foreign policy .
If America ends up at war with Russia over a recent addition to NATO , voters might then take notice .
Otherwise they just do n’t care .
Similarly misguided is America ’s continuing defense of South Korea .
The South has upwards of 40 times the GDP and twice the population of North Korea .
Seoul is friends with all of its neighbors , even the North ’s former allies , Beijing and Moscow .
Most South Koreans no longer fear Pyongyang ; in fact , they have been lavishing subsidies and aid on North Korea for years .
America ’s policy - making elite naturally offers a multitude of arguments to maintain the same military commitment more than a half century after the end of the Korean War .
But what normal person would support spending billions of dollars to raise and maintain overseas thousands of troops to guard South Korea ?
Then there ’s Japan .
The second ranking economic power on earth , Japan could do far more to protect itself and its region .
Its neighbors prefer that Washington do the job , but so what ?
That does n’t make the policy in America ’s interest .
Again , American elites rather like the idea of the U.S. attempting to run the world .
But the vast majority of Americans , who have to pay the bill , probably would be much less enthused if they thought about it .
Beyond such major commitments , Washington has dribbled bases and forces around the world .
It ’s a policy of which Americans are largely ignorant .
To the extent that they believed that such facilities advanced American security , they might support them .
But alliances and bases can act as transmission belts of war at a time when we should be building firebreaks to war .
Although serious armed conflict is unlikely in either Asia or Europe , Washington ’s explicit promise to defend the Baltic States and Eastern Europe necessarily makes all of those nations ’ squabbles with Russia America ’s squabbles as well .
Washington ’s implicit guarantee to Taiwan does the same thing with China next door .
Bringing nations like Georgia and Ukraine into NATO would add more problems to America ’s portfolio .
Advocates of scattering security guarantees around the globe argue that they deter aggression , which undoubtedly is true to some degree .
But U.S. security guarantees also ensure American involvement in conflicts that would be little relevant to U.S. security .
With the Cold War over , South Korea does n’t much matter to America .
It ’s an important trading partner , but nevertheless remains a minor factor in American prosperity .
Poland was n’t important to America ’s defense even during the Cold War .
Promising to go to war in such circumstances is no bargain , even if the chances of conflict seem small .
Especially since guaranteeing the security of other nations changes their incentive for irresponsible behavior .
That is , so long as small countries act in the belief that Washington will rush to their defense in a conflict with a bigger power  China and Russia most obviously today  they are likely to act more aggressively .
We can see that phenomenon at work in Taiwan , which has adopted a confrontational stance with Beijing over Washington ’s objections .
With America behind them , why not assert their interest ?
The challenge for non-interventionists is to break through the public ’s ignorance to build popular support for overturning elite opinion .
It wo n’t be easy , obviously .
But it never has been .
However , without the emergence of a real opposition to today ’s aggressive foreign policy , we are doomed to continue following current policy around most of the world .
Ron Paul has made progress .
But we have far to go to turn make foreign policy into an issue that moves voters and , in doing so , stirs so - called major candidates to challenge the interventionist status quo .
Only then will we be able transform the American empire back into the American republic .

Astronomers at the Carnegie Institution have found the first indications of highly complex organic molecules in the disk of red dust surrounding a distant star .
The eight - million - year - old star , known as HR 4796A , is inferred to be in the late stages of planet formation , suggesting that the basic building blocks of life may be common in planetary systems .
In a study published in the current Astrophysical Journal Letters , John Debes and Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism with Glenn Schneider of the University of Arizona report observations of infrared light from HR 4796A using the Near - Infrared Multi-Object Spectrometer aboard the Hubble Space Telescope .
The researchers found that the spectrum of visible and infrared light scattered by the star 's dust disk looks very red , the color produced by large organic carbon molecules called tholins .
The spectrum does not match those of other red substances , such as iron oxide .
Tholins do not form naturally on present - day Earth because oxygen in the atmosphere would quickly destroy them , but they are hypothesized to have existed on the primitive Earth billions of years ago and may have been precursors to the biomolecules that make up living organisms .
Tholins have been detected elsewhere in the solar system , such as in comets and on Saturn 's moon Titan , where they give the atmosphere a red tinge .
This study is the first report of tholins outside the solar system .
" Until recently it 's been hard to know what makes up the dust in a disk from scattered light , so to find tholins this way represents a great leap in our understanding , " says Debes .
HR 4796A is located in the constellation Centaurus , visible primarily form the southern hemisphere .
It is about 220 light years from Earth .
The discovery of its dust disk in 1991 generated excitement among astronomers , who consider it a prime example of a planetary system caught in the act of formation .
The dust is generated by collisions of small bodies , perhaps similar to the comets or asteroids in our solar system , and which may be coated by the organics .
These planetesimals can deliver these building blocks for life to any planets that may also be circling the star .
" Astronomers are just beginning to look for planets around stars much different from the Sun. HR 4796A is twice as massive , nearly twice as hot as the sun , and twenty times more luminous than the Sun , " says Debes .
" Studying this system provides new clues to understanding the different conditions under which planets form and , perhaps , life can evolve . "
Image Caption : Red and near infrared wavelengths from the dust disk surrounding the star HR 4796A ( masked in false - color image to make fainter disk visible ) suggest the presence of complex organic molecules .
The inner " hole " of the ring - shaped disk is big enough to fit our entire solar system and may have been swept clean of dust by orbiting planets .

They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young - Bob Dylan
except in cases of alleged Satanic Ritual Abuse
The first week of May , 1981 , Daniel O'Connell , the Investigative Counselor of the Boston Public School Board , alerted the district 's principals that " it has been brought to the attention of the police department and the district office that adults dressed as clowns have been bothering children to and from school .
Please advise all students that they must stay away from strangers , especially ones dressed as clowns .
" Several days later , in Brookline , Massachusetts on May 5 , two clowns using candy as lures tried to entice children into their black van parked near Lawrence Elementary School .
According to Loren Coleman in Mysterious America , police had a good description of the vehicle : it was an old model with ladders on the side , a broken front headlight and was missing its hubcaps .
The following day the Boston police , " responding to persistent complaints , warned that men in clown suits were harassing elementary children . "
One , driving a black van , was seen to be dressed as a clown only from the waist up ; from the waist down he was naked .
" By May 8th , " writes Coleman , " reports of clown men in vans harassing children had come in from East Boston , Charlestown , Cambridge , Canton , Randolph , and other cities near Boston .... 50 miles south , in Providence , RI , reports of clown men disturbring children were coming to the attention of psychiatric social workers counseling the city 's youth .
" Encounters with " evil clowns " proliferated quickly westward .
Pittsburg children began reporting being pestered by two men dressed as clowns driving a van .
Mid-May , frightened Kansas school kids told of a clown who had chased them home and threatened them to get in his van .
On the afternoon of May 22 , in Kansas City , Missouri , chased a " knife - wielding clown in a yellow van that had been reported at six different elementary schools " : Earlier in the day , at 8:30 , a mother had watched a yellow van approach her children as they walked to a school bus stop .
The van stopped and someone inside spoke to her two girls who then screamed and fled ; the vehicle sped away .
The children told their mother that a man dressed as a clown and carrying a knife had ordered them inside .
By noon the police had received dozens of similar reports - of a clown in a yellow van .
The calls did not taper off until five o'clock that afternoon .
Coleman quotes LaTanya Johnson , a then - sixth grade student at Fairfax Elementary School , who told the Kansas City Star of her sighting of the clown :
He was by the fence and ran down through the big yard when some of the kids ran over there .
He ran toward a yellow van .
He was dressed in a black shirt with a devil on the front .
He had two candy canes down each side of his pants .
The pants were black too , I think ; I do n't remember much about his face .
That Spring , scared children in Nebraska , and in Colorado , and elsewhere , spoke of being menaced by knife - wielding clowns who ordered them to get in their vans .
No suspect was apprehended , and perhaps most significantly , no child was abducted .
Frustrated police departments began backtracking , and discounting the allegations .
Besides , most of the witnesses were young children - how much could their word be trusted ?
As the sightings petered out , and as children were merely terrified and not missing , " group hysteria " was floated as an explaination , and eagerly seized upon by most .
But Coleman makes a significant observation that suggests something else was going on :
The story of the phantom clowns went unnoticed on a national scale until I began getting a hint we were in the midst of a major flap of a new phenomenon .
Slowly , after contacting fellow researchers by phone and mail , I discovered the phantom clown enigma went beyond Boston , Kansas City , and Omaha .
Indeed , the reports filtering into me demonstrated that a far reaching mystery was developing .
In the individual cities , the local media were not aware they were living through a series of puzzling events that were occurring nationwide .
In the early months of 1990 a similar pattern played out in England , though instead of clown costumes , they came disguised as social workers .
Patrick Harpur writes in Daimonic Reality : Reports poured in to the police , describing " health workers " or " social workers " who called to examine or take away children , but who hurriedly left when the householder became suspicious .
The visitors were mostly one or two women , but sometimes a woman and a man .
The women were typically in their late twenties or early thirties , heavily made up , smartly dressed and of medium height .
They carried clipboards and , often , identification cards .
" They looked professional , " said one witness .
" Like doctors . "
Few of them had local accents .
Some even telephoned in advance to make appointments .
Twenty - three separate police forces combined to launch Operation Childcare , dedicated to tracking down the bogus social workers .
By May , the incidents were so widespread that police feared that up to four organized gangs were involved .
( On 6 May there were three separate incidents in Nantwich , Cheshire , alone . )
They were thought to be gangs of pedophiles .
But clearly there were signs that the matter was far from straightforward : the pedophile theory was weakened by the involvement of so many women , who are rarely implicated in pedophilia ( except in cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse . )
By early August , 251 incidents had been reported .
As with the " Phantom Clowns , " no child was abducted , no suspect was apprehended , and dispirited police began to talk of " social panic .
"
In their respective studies of the clown and social worker flaps , both Coleman and Harpur use them to draw similar conclusions regarding Satanic Ritual Abuse .
To Coleman , the allegations belong to the realms of the Fortean and folkloric ; Harpur , that they are the product of the daimonic imagination .
Harpur goes so far as to suggest that the " social workers " were themselves daimons : tricksters perpetrating practical jokes on the merely human and , like the so - called Men in Black , not doing any real harm .
I agree with much of what Harpur says about hidden and non-human agencies , but I think he 's well off the mark here .
And I think it 's because he , like Coleman , and so many , deny a priori the mundane realities of ritual abuse , and naturally therefore make no allowance for the complicity of elements of both US and UK state apparatus in the perpetuation and cover - up of occult crime .
Harpur even notes that the involvement of women was unusual in matters of suggested pedophilia , .
But because such things do n't really happen in Harpur 's world , then he needs to invoke an otherworldly explanation for the bogus social workers .
Sometimes , as I 've suggested many times , we need to go there , but we need n't go there this time .
So what was going on ?
Coleman writes that " something quite unusual was happening in America in the Spring of 1981 . "
One unusual thing was the dawning general awareness of Satanic Ritual Abuse and its possible links to institutions and individuals of authority .
Perhaps a " clown op " was run to discredit the testimony of children ( " a black shirt with a devil on the front , " said LaTanya Johnson ) , and to lead the public towards discounting even more nightmarish mysteries .
In Britain in November 1989 , just two months before the first incident of a phantom social worker , genuine social workers had removed 17 children from their homes on the grounds that they were being sexually abused in satanic ritual .
Perhaps another " op " was run to vilify those who meant to protect children and to sow distrust , demonizing them in the public imagination as abductors themselves .
Maybe , it 's about putting on a wolf costume to scare little children .
Maybe , it 's about making them cry wolf .
For the next time .
The Finders provided one of those next times , as documented by a US Customs Service report On Thursday , 2/5/ 87 , the duty agent , SS / A [ deleted ] , received a call from SS / A [ deleted ] , USCS , Tallahassee , Florida .
SS / A [ deleted ] was seeking assistance in contacting an appropriate local police agency to coordinate a child abuse investigation in with the Tallahassee Police Department ....
U.S. Customs was contacted because the police officers involved suspected the adults of being involved in child pornography and knew the Customs Service to have a network of child pornography investigators , and of the existence of the Child Pornography and Protection Unit. SS / A [ deleted ] stated the two adults were well dressed white males .
They had custody of six white children ( boys and girls ) , ages three to six years .
The children were observed to be poorly dressed , bruised , dirty , and behaving like wild animals in a public park in Tallahassee .
The police were notified by a concerned citizen and all eight persons were taken into custody .
The subjects were living out of a white 1979 Dodge van , Virginia license no .
XHW 557 .
Upon being taken into custody , the adult white males refused to cooperate , one of whom produced a " business " card with a name on one side and a statement on the other .
The statement indicated that the bearer knew his constitutional rights to remain silent and that he intended to do so .
Upon interviewing the children , the police officers found that they could not adequately identify themselves or their custodians .
Further , they stated that they were enroute to Mexico to attend a school for " smart kids . "
SS / A [ deleted ] was further advised the children were unaware of the function and purpose of telephones , televisions and toilets , and that the children had stated they were not allowed to live indoors and were only given food as a reward ....
The photographs were nudes , believed to be of members of the Finders .
There were numerous photos of children , some nude , at least one of which was a photo of a child " on display " and appearing to accent the child 's genitals .
I was only able to examine a very small amount of the photos at this time .
However , one of the officers presented me with a photo album for my review ..
The photos portrayed the execution , disembowelment , skinning and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children ..
Further inspection of the premises disclosed numerous files relating to activities of the organization in different parts of the world .
Locations I observed are as follows : London , Germany , the Bahamas , Japan , Hong Kong , Malaysia , Africa , Costa Rica , and " Europe . "
There was also a file identified as " Palestinian . "
Other files were identified by member name or " project " name . under front names for the Finders .
and others referring to members operating in foreign countries .
Not observed by me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the Finders .
During the course of the search warrants , .
PAGE 2 OF 2 DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION : On March 31 , 1987 , I contacted Detective [ deleted ] of the Washington , DC Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) .
I was to meet with Detective [ deleted ] to review the documents seized pursuant to two search warrants executed in January , 1987 .
The meeting was to take place on April 2 or 3 , 1987 .
On April 2 , 1987 , I arrived at MPD at approximately 9:00 a.m. Detective [ deleted ] was not available .
I spoke to a third party who was willing to discuss the case with me on a strictly " off the record " basis .
I was advised that all the passport data had been turned over to the State Department for their investigation .
The State Department in turn , advised the MPD that all travel and use of the passports by the holders of the passports was within the law and no action would be taken .
This included travel to Moscow , North Korea , and North Vietnam from the late 1950s to mid 1970s .
The individual further advised me of circumstances which indicated the investigation into .
I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks prior and that the FBI Foreign Counter Intelligence Division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI Washington Field Office of anything that had transpired .
Perhaps they might as well have been phantoms .
Spooks , even .
Truly , nothing says Christmas like a footballer - party rape allegation .
It 's getting so Pavlovian that the first story suggesting one guest might have enjoyed herself rather less than the others at some club 's festive bash has become as evocative as the smell of mulled wine or wilfully spun reports suggesting the Muslims are stealing our Christmas .
Facetious ?
Most of the responses to the fact that a 19 - year - old Manchester United player has been accused of raping a 26 - year - old woman at the club 's Christmas party early on Tuesday have been about as nuanced .
They have run the gamut from " footballers are lawless scum " to " the girls are no better : they all deserve each other " .
There were some " she probably made it ups " in there , too , and maybe the odd " women are just meat to these beasts " .
Yesterday further revelations about the party surfaced .
One " very drunk " woman was " roasted " by five or six men , according to another guest , who told a newspaper that " I asked her if she was OK and she said , ' Yeah , why would n't I be ?
They said I was a great shag . ' "
There will be people - some would even count themselves as third - wave feminists - who can read that statement and accuse anyone who feels the vaguest sense of unease about it of being straitlaced , or repressive of this woman 's natural sexuality .
These people like to think of themselves as sexual cognoscenti - a bedroom version of those television chefs who tell you they always get their truffles from a family supplier in Puglia and assume you 'll do the same .
For their bondage tips , they go to the Marquis de Sade in the original French .
If they 're that smart , though , they should appreciate that not everyone indulges in these things with quite the same degree of consequence - free delight and rationalised abandon as they do - and it's inverse snobbery to pretend that it is so .
And so to a vexing riddle of our times .
Namely , if six footballers can have six girls each , why do they only want one between them ?
The answer is actually incredibly simple ( and has nothing to do with repressed homosexuality ) .
It might be partly that they enjoy team activities and it's a kind of extended goal celebration , but it is primarily because that is what they see in porn .
And porn is screwing up sex .
Not sex in relationships , but the kind of casual sex in which it would be nice to think people could indulge in a mutually enjoyable , non-exploitative fashion .
In this context , footballers are not qualitatively different from plenty of other young men , it 's just that being regarded as demigods makes it easier to act in this way .
Several years ago Naomi Wolf pointed out that the proliferation of porn , particularly on the internet , was the way most young men and women were now , in effect , taught about sex - " what sex is , how it looks , what its etiquette and expectations are " .
It had a significant impact on the way they interacted .
She wondered whether all the sexual imagery around represented the true liberation of sex , or whether " the relationship between the multibillion - dollar porn industry , compulsiveness , and sexual appetite has become like the relationship between agribusiness , processed foods , supersize portions , and obesity " .
No matter where you stand on it , porn has undoubtedly skewed many young men's expectations of sex , and many young women 's sense of sexual obligation .
The marvellous website jezebel.com touched on this theme recently , having identified an experiential trend among the staff 's acquaintances .
Several of these women had been on a first date , ended up sleeping with the guys , and the men had ejaculated on their face without asking .
The reader responses were revealing .
It transpired that lots of people had had this surprise experience , and while there was debate about whether the act referred to was rank misogyny or something you could truly love , there was unanimous concurrence that it should be on the " have to ask first list " - and that the presumption even in a few people that it was n't signified a shift in popular male imagination .
Several younger readers wrote in saying that they found men their age were so conditioned by porn that " they do n't think sex is ' good ' unless it 's somehow fetishy " .
Now , either these guys were just borderline rapists , or - way more likely and way more scarily - they simply did n't know any better .
It would be nice to think we could reclaim the right to say people do n't know any better without being accused of snobbery , because the longer we allow the argument to be short - circuited in that fatuous way , the longer the debate remains buried .
And there are plenty of questions , wherever you stand .
Is this the only sexual liberation we 're going to have , or are we due another rethink ?
Are both genders having better sex than they did 10 or 20 years ago ?
Could it be that women who queue up outside a hotel just itching to be told they are " a great shag " by an assortment of footballers have bad sex most of the time ?
If we placed more emphasis on addressing these issues , would there be fewer of what we might , with immense charity , call " misunderstandings " ?

Ultimately it 's the technology that suffers , as the public slowly gets more and more pissed off that it is n't as awesome as USA Today or the salesman at Best Buy told them it would be .
Contrary to what you learned in your economics classes , the market is n't always about supply and demand .
Sometimes it 's the opposite : supplying some technology nobody wanted , then trying to create the demand for it with hype .
6 High - Definition TVs

Last year Best Buy reported huge numbers of unexpected returns of high - definition TVs because many who bought the sets thought the picture looked " like someone rubbed cat shit on the screen . "
How is this possible ?
That 's the entire point of HD TV - - its ability to render today 's most visually intense shows in crystal - clear detail .
Root Problems :
Consumer confusion , slow adoption .
It turns out the problem does n't lie with the televisions ; it lies with the people who buy them .
Or , you could say it lies in the industry 's inability to explain to those people what they 're buying .
It seems obvious to us computer - literate and sexually confident Internet users that if you buy an HDTV you still need an HD source -- a special box from your cable company or satellite provider -- to get an HD picture .
But to your average Joe , who 's used to plugging one wire into the back of his TV , this can be a frustrating realization .

" What do you mean I need special cables ? "
" What do you mean I need to rent a little box with it ? "
" What do you mean I 'll have to pay more monthly for the HD plan ? "
" What do you mean my DVD player is n't high definition ?
What 's ' Blu-ray ? ' "
" RAAARRRRGH ! "
Then he goes into the other room and kicks his dog .
This is the true face of animal abuse in America today : frustrated A/V installations .
from FlatPanelTV.org
According to a recent Nielsen study half of the people who own HD television sets do n't use them with a high - definition source .
Many of them do n't even know .
That 's a problem , because if you happen to watch any standard definition channels on your HD TV , you 'll find the picture is now distorted on your widescreen set .
If we wanted to see what Katie Couric looks like 40 pounds heavier , we 'd Photoshop her head onto a fat guy 's body , like any normal person .

Sure you can fiddle with the picture settings to sort of resolve this ; it 'll likely require a couple of hours on the phone with a support center in India , and the resulting picture will still be a grainy mess .
This is why Best Buy is getting irate customers dragging in returned sets with shattered holes in the screen the exact size and shape of an angry fist .
Eventually these problems will fade away , once the only type of television on store shelves is HD , and the only type of cable is HD , and the only type of DVD players for sale is HD .
Mr. Johnny Average Consumer Idiot * wo n't have to take a six - week course to figure out what terms like HDMI and 1080 p mean , because everything will be figured out for him .

If this is your real name , we are sorry .

Network Working Group Steve Crocker Request for Comments : 1 UCLA 7 April 1969 Title : Host Software Author : Steve Crocker Installation : UCLA Date : 7 April 1969 Network Working Group Request for Comment : 1 CONTENTS INTRODUCTION
I. A Summary of the IMP Software Messages Links IMP Transmission and Error Checking Open Questions on the IMP Software II .
Some Requirements Upon the Host - to - Host Software Simple Use Deep Use Error Checking III .
The Host Software Establishment of a Connection High Volume Transmission A Summary of Primitives Error Checking Closer Interaction Open Questions IV .
Initial Experiments Experiment One Experiment Two Introduction
The software for the ARPA Network exists partly in the IMPs and partly in the respective HOSTs .
BB&N has specified the software of the IMPs and it is the responsibility of the HOST groups to agree on HOST software .
During the summer of 1968 , representatives from the initial four sites met several times to discuss the HOST software and initial experiments on the network .
There emerged from these meetings a working group of three , Steve Carr from Utah , Jeff Rulifson from SRI , and Steve Crocker of UCLA , who met during the fall and winter .
The most recent meeting was in the last week of March in Utah .
Also present was Bill Duvall of SRI who has recently started working with Jeff Rulifson .
Somewhat independently , Gerard DeLoche of UCLA has been working on the HOST - IMP interface .
I present here some of the tentative agreements reached and some of the open questions encountered .
Very little of what is here is firm and reactions are expected .
I. A Summary of the IMP Software Messages Information is transmitted from HOST to HOST in bundles called messages .
A message is any stream of not more than 8080 bits , together with its header .
The header is 16 bits and contains the following information : Destination 5 bits Link 8 bits Trace 1 bit Spare 2 bits
The destination is the numerical code for the HOST to which the message should be sent .
The trace bit signals the IMPs to record status information about the message and send the information back to the NMC ( Network Measurement Center , i.e. , UCLA ) .
The spare bits are unused .
Links
The link field is a special device used by the IMPs to limit certain kinds of congestion .
They function as follows .
Between every pair of HOSTs there are 32 logical full - duplex connections over which messages may be passed in either direction .
The IMPs place the restriction on these links that no HOST can send two successive messages over the same link before the IMP at the destination has sent back a special message called an RFNM ( Request for Next Message ) .
This arrangement limits the congestion one HOST can cause another if the sending HOST is attempting to send too much over one link .
We note , however , that since the IMP at the destination does not have enough capacity to handle all 32 links simultaneously , the links serve their purpose only if the overload is coming from one or two links .
It is necessary for the HOSTs to cooperate in this respect .
The links have the following primitive characteristics .
They are always functioning and there are always 32 of them .
By " always functioning , " we mean that the IMPs are always prepared to transmit another message over them .
No notion of beginning or ending a conversation is contained in the IMP software .
It is thus not possible to query an IMP about the state of a link ( although it might be possible to query an IMP about the recent history of a link -- quite a different matter ! ) .
The other primitive characteristic of the links is that there are always 32 of them , whether they are in use or not .
This means that each IMP must maintain 18 tables , each with 32 entries , regardless of the actual traffic .
The objections to the link structure notwithstanding , the links are easily programmed within the IMPs and are probably a better alternative to more complex arrangements just because of their simplicity .
IMP Transmission and Error Checking
After receiving a message from a HOST , an IMP partitions the message into one or more packets .
Packets are not more than 1010 bits long and are the unit of data transmission from IMP to IMP .
A 24 bit cyclic checksum is computed by the transmission hardware and is appended to an outgoing packet .
The checksum is recomputed by the receiving hardware and is checked against the transmitted checksum .
Packets are reassembled into messages at the destination IMP .
Open Questions on the IMP Software 1 .
An 8 bit field is provided for link specification , but only 32 links are provided , why ?
2 . The HOST is supposed to be able to send messages to its IMP .
How does it do this ?
3 . Can a HOST , as opposed to its IMP , control RFNMs ?
4 . Will the IMPs perform code conversion ?
How is it to be controlled ?
II .
Some Requirements Upon the Host - to - Host Software Simple Use
As with any new facility , there will be a period of very light usage until the community of users experiments with the network and begins to depend upon it .
One of our goals must be to stimulate the immediate and easy use by a wide class of users .
With this goal , it seems natural to provide the ability to use any remote HOST as if it had been dialed up from a TTY ( teletype ) terminal .
Additionally , we would like some ability to transmit a file in a somewhat different manner perhaps than simulating a teletype .
Deep Use
One of the inherent problems in the network is the fact that all responses from a remote HOST will require on the order of a half - second or so , no matter how simple .
For teletype use , we could shift to a half - duplex local - echo arrangement , but this would destroy some of the usefulness of the network .
The 940 Systems , for example , have a very specialized echo .
When we consider using graphics stations or other sophisticated terminals under the control of a remote HOST , the problem becomes more severe .
We must look for some method which allows us to use our most sophisticated equipment as much as possible as if we were connected directly to the remote computer .
Error Checking
The point is made by Jeff Rulifson at SRI that error checking at major software interfaces is always a good thing .
He points to some experience at SRI where it has saved much dispute and wasted effort .
On these grounds , we would like to see some HOST to HOST checking .
Besides checking the software interface , it would also check the HOST - IMP transmission hardware .
( BB&N claims the HOST - IMP hardware will be as reliable as the internal registers of the HOST .
We believe them , but we still want the error checking . )
III .
The Host Software Establishment of a Connection
The simplest connection we can imagine is where the local HOST acts as if it is a TTY and has dialed up the remote HOST .
After some consideration of the problems of initiating and terminating such a connection , it has been decided to reserve link 0 for communication between HOST operating systems .
The remaining 31 links are thus to be used as dial - up lines .
Each HOST operating system must provide to its user level programs a primitive to establish a connection with a remote HOST and a primitive to break the connection .
When these primitives are invoked , the operating system must select a free link and send a message over link 0 to the remote HOST requesting a connection on the selected link .
The operating system in the remote HOST must agree and send back an accepting message over link 0 .
In the event both HOSTs select the same link to initiate a connection and both send request messages at essentially the same time , a simple priority scheme will be invoked in which the HOST of lower priority gives way and selects another free link .
One usable priority scheme is simply the ranking of HOSTS by their identification numbers .
Note that both HOSTs are aware that simultaneous requests have been made , but they take complementary actions :
The higher priority HOST disregards the request while the lower priority HOST sends both an acceptance and another request .
The connection so established is a TTY - like connection in the pre-log - in state .
This means the remote HOST operating system will initially treat the link as if a TTY had just called up .
The remote HOST will generate the same echos , expect the same log - in sequence and look for the same interrupt characters .
High Volume Transmission
Teletypes acting as terminals have two special drawbacks when we consider the transmission of a large file .
The first is that some characters are special interrupt characters .
The second is that special buffering techniques are often employed , and these are appropriate only for low - speed character at time transmission .
We therefore define another class of connection to be used for the transmission of files or other large volumes of data .
To initiate this class of link , user level programs at both ends of an established TTY - like link must request the establishment of a file - like connection parallel to the TTY - like link .
Again the priority scheme comes into play , for the higher priority HOST sends a message over link 0 while the lower priority HOST waits for it .
The user level programs are , of course , not concerned with this .
Selection of the free link is done by the higher priority HOST .
File - like links are distinguished by the fact that no searching for interrupt characters takes place and buffering techniques appropriate for the higher data rates takes place .
A Summary of Primitives Each HOST operating systems must provide at least the following primitives to its users .
This list knows not to be necessary but not sufficient .
a ) Initiate TTY - like connection with HOST x. b)
Terminate connection .
c ) Send / Receive character (s ) over TTY - like connection .
d)
Initiate file - like connection parallel to TTY - like connection .
e) Terminate file - like connection .
f)
Send / Receive over file - like connection .
Error Checking
We propose that each message carry a message number , bit count , and a checksum in its body , that is transparent to the IMP .
For a checksum we suggest a 16 - bit end - around - carry sum computed on 1152 bits and then circularly shifted right one bit .
The right circular shift every 1152 bits is designed to catch errors in message reassembly by the IMPs .
Closer Interaction
The above described primitives suggest how a user can make simple use of a remote facility .
They shed no light on how much more intricate use of the network is to be carried out .
Specifically , we are concerned with the fact that as some sites a great deal of work has gone into making the computer highly responsive to a sophisticated console .
Culler 's consoles at UCSB and Englebart 's at SRI are at least two examples .
It is clear that delays of a half - second or so for trivial echo - like responses degrade the interaction to the point of making the sophistication of the console irrelevant .
We believe that most console interaction can be divided into two parts , an essentially local , immediate and trivial part and a remote , more lengthy and significant part .
As a simple example , consider a user at a console consisting of a keyboard and refreshing display screen .
The program the user is talking typing into accumulates a string of characters until a carriage return is encountered and then it processes the string .
While characters are being typed , it displays the characters on the screen .
When a rubout character is typed , it deletes the previous non -rubout character .
If the user types H E L L O <- <- P < CR > where <- is rubout and < CR > is carriage - return , he has made nine keystrokes .
If each of these keystrokes causes a message to be sent which in return invokes instructions to our display station we will quickly become bored .
A better solution would be to have the front - end of the remote program -- that is the part scanning for <- and < CR > -- be resident in our computer .
In that case , only one five character message would be sent , i.e. , H E L P < CR > , and the screen would be managed locally .
We propose to implement this solution by creating a language for console control .
This language , current named DEL , would be used by subsystem designers to specify what components are needed in a terminal and how the terminal is to respond to inputs from its keyboard , Lincoln Wand , etc .
Then , as a part of the initial protocol , the remote HOST would send to the local HOST , the source language text of the program which controls the console .
This program would have been by the subsystem designer in DEL , but will be compiled locally .
The specifications of DEL are under discussion .
The following diagrams show the sequence of actions .

Police are investigating as a possible hate crime an incident in which a ham steak was placed in a bag on a lunch table where a group of Somali students were sitting .

Scientists have known that on the whole , females of all ages tend to worry more and have more intense worries than males .
Women also tend to perceive more risk in situations and grow more anxious than men .
Now we know why .
Women are more likely than men to believe that past experiences accurately forecast the future , according to two new studies .
The research , involving both 3 - to 6 - year - olds and adults of both genders , tested the extent to which participants ' thought that worry can be caused by thinking that a bad event that happened in the past could happen again in the future .
( This skill , in its simplest form , is critical to social understanding as it is important to making decisions and assessing risk . )
For the first study , subjects listened to six stories that featured characters harmed by another person or animal in the story .
Many days later , the character felt worried or changed their behavior when confronted with the same wrongdoer who had hurt them before .
( For example , if one little boy stole a toy from another , the child might be worried when he saw that boy again and hide the new toy he was playing with . )
The second study was the same , except that the person or animal the character ran across later only looked similar to the one that had harmed them before .
At the end of each story , the participants were asked to explain why the character was worried or changed their behavior .
Females , both children and adults , were more likely to use uncertainty to explain the character 's reaction , that is , they tended to explain the reaction in terms of events that might happen versus those that will happen , the researcher reported .
They also tended , more than males , to predict that the characters who encountered the new character who looked similar to the wrongdoer would feel worried because they thought the new character would also do them harm .
The studies , detailed in the Sept. / Oct. issue of the journal Child Development , also found that children increasingly made these kinds of past - to - future connections as they got older , which yields insight into their cognitive development .
" These results are significant because they reveal that knowledge about the impact of past - to - future thinking on emotions and behaviors develops during the preschool years , " said study author Kristin Lagattuta of the University of California , Davis .
This is because there is a consensus within the intelligence community that Iran is at least five years away from obtaining a bomb , Hersh said in an interview on CNN on Sunday .
Hersh pointed to a speech US President George Bush made in August to the American legion in which he said : " The attacks on our bases and our troops by Iranian supplied munitions have increased ... the Iranian regime must halt these actions and , until it does , I will take actions necessary to protect our troops . "
He ended : " I have authorised our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran 's murderous activities . "
Since then Mr Bush has made a number of other comments that suggest the Administration might still be hopeful of a diplomatic solution and , in recent weeks , has prevailed upon France to assist in dealing with Tehran .
A Pentagon spokesman in response to Hersh 's inquiries said : " The President has made it clear that the US Government remains committed to a diplomatic solution with respect to Iran . "
The White House declined to comment , and Hersh says he was warned during his research that the President had yet to issue an execute order on the plans , and that such an order may never be issued .
But Hersh 's article detailed conversations with numerous sources in the Department of Defence , the CIA and former Administration officials who have heard talk of the strike plans .
Hersh said the bombing plan has had its most positive reception from Britain 's Prime Minister , Gordon Brown .
While Hersh did not mention Australia in the article , he told CNN that there had been " expressions of interest " from Australia and Israel for the strike plan .
" There 's been expressions of interest from Australia , other countries , " he said .
" The Israelis , of course , have gone bananas .
They 're very upset about the idea of not going .
If you 're going into Iran , the Israeli position is very firm .
They want us to go .
And they want us to hit hard .
As an Israeli told me , if you run into a lion , you either shoot it or ignore it .
You do n't pluck out its eyebrows . "
Australia 's Minister for Defence , Brendan Nelson , was in the US a month ago for briefings with defence officials and a meeting with Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
He told reporters at the time that he had discussed Iran , but declined to elaborate .
Hersh said the revised bombing plan with its tightened focus on counter - terrorism was gathering support among the generals and admirals in the Pentagon , who had been apprehensive about the earlier broader bombing plan .
" The strategy calls for the use of sea - launched cruise missiles and more precisely targeted ground attacks and bombing strikes , including plans to destroy the most important Revolutionary Guard training camps , supply depots and command - and - control facilities , " Hersh wrote .
He said there were also plans to hit Iran 's anti-aircraft surface - to - air missile sites .
He said a Pentagon consultant on counter - terrorism had told him that if the bombing campaign took place , it would be accompanied by a series of what he called " short sharp incursions " by American Special Forces into suspected Iranian training sites .
( Fortune ) --
It 's been hard for Pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , to catch a break lately .
For one thing , the FDA 's drug safety arm is questioning the company 's newest potential blockbuster , the anti-smoking pill Chantix .
Next , in what amounts to a massive marketing failure , Pfizer said last month it would stop selling its Exubera insulin inhaler .
What 's more , in Nigeria , where Pfizer faces allegations that a test of its experimental meningitis medicine , Trovan , injured and killed children more than a decade ago , settlement talks over the Nigerian government 's demand for $ 9 billion in damages have broken down .
That trifecta of bad news would whack any company 's shares , but it 's been especially hard on Pfizer ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
The company is about to lose patent protection on its best - selling drug , the cholesterol - lowering Lipitor , in two short years - and has very little in its pipeline to replace it .
Lipitor generated 27 percent , or nearly $ 13 billion , of Pfizer 's 2006 revenues .
On the heels of the FDA 's Nov. 19 Chantix warnings , Pfizer shares hit a year - and - a - half low of $ 22.24 .
Bargain hunters swooped in last week and pushed company shares up 6 percent , but they 're still down 28 percent in five years .
Even so , there are plenty of reasons to think Pfizer is a steal right now .
For starters , Pfizer boasts a price - to - earnings ratio of more than 11 , which is well below the industry average of roughly 19 .
The company also offers a generous dividend yield of more than 5 percent .
But there are more fundamental signs that Pfizer is headed for an upswing .
The company is doing a far better job of leveraging its $ 7.6 billion research and development budget while cutting costs - a move that should silence critics who complain that Pfizer is good at selling medications , but bad at developing new ones .
Last week , for instance , Pfizer 's newly appointed R&D chief Martin Mackay told investors at a meeting in Hong Kong that the drugmaker is targeting China , India , Japan , and South Korea for its R&D .
The region is known for its R&D expertise , but is cheaper to operate in than either Europe or the United States .
At the same time , Pfizer 's campaign to reduce research costs dovetails with an innovative strategy to boost its clinical successes .
To that end , Gene Logic , a small biotech , last week said it had filed a patent on Pfizer 's behalf for an experimental drug to treat solid tumors .
The Pfizer - Gene Logic partnership is part of a new phenomenon called " drug repositioning , " in which a larger drug company hires a small firm with genetic expertise to locate new uses for a formerly discarded drug compound .
In this case , Gene Logic took on a drug compound that Pfizer had tested and rejected ( Pfizer wo n't say what the initial intended use was ) .
Pfizer will now put the compound through animal and human clinical tests in the hopes that it can someday seek FDA approval for it as a treatment for solid tumors .
Gene Logic will receive an undisclosed payment for its work on Pfizer 's potential tumor drug , as well as a percentage of sales if the new drug makes it to market .
Pfizer , in turn , may have found a way to turn its vast vault of failed medicines into a source of future revenues , with little upfront investment .
While Gene Logic is n't the first biotech looking to profit from other companies ' failed compounds , its newfound use for Pfizer 's treatment is the first public example of a repositioning partnership that has resulted in a potential new drug .
Gene Logic CEO Charles Dimmler III says the company has similar deals with Abbott ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Eli Lilly ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Roche , among others , but wo n't disclose details .
" We consider the Pfizer patent application to be proof - of - concept for our approach to repositioning , " Dimmler said .
For every three compounds the company tests , Dimmler says , Gene Logic finds one drug that it considers worth pursuing .
A radical plan to lower drug costs
In another example of deft partnering , Pfizer has been working with researchers at MIT for the last three years to solve another costly R&D problem : Toxicity , which is the primary reason many medicines fail laboratory tests .
Right now , toxicity is n't usually discovered until human and animal testing takes place , a hugely expensive undertaking that occurs late in the development process .
MIT researchers now say they 've found a way to model human cell tissues and closely replicate the liver , which is tested for toxicity .
As a result , Pfizer may be able to detect drug toxicity earlier in the development process .
" These models capture the complexity of what happens in the liver , " says Linda Griffith , who , along with collaborator Steven Tannenbaum , plans to start a small biotech company around the idea in 2008 ( Pfizer will be an investor ) .
" They could easily be used to help predict how humans might react to a new drug . "
For all of Pfizer 's innovation on the R&D front , few investors are impressed .
Most Wall Street analysts have a " hold " rating on the stock , and the few mavericks who are recommending " buy " are lukewarm .
James Kelly , a Goldman Sachs analyst , has a twelve - month price target of $ 29 ( last week it closed at $ 23.76 . ) .
But now might just be the perfect time to bet on Pfizer .
Aside from its low price - to - earnings ratio and generous dividend , Pfizer has more than $ 20 billion in cash with which , through some smart acquisitions , to buy its way out of its doldrums .
Meanwhile , though , the company is tackling what 's been its main weakness in recent years : R&D .
Currently there 's quite a debate raging over the relative merits of Groovy and JRuby as scripting languages running on the Java virtual machine .
Curious minds want to know - which of these languages will win this upcoming language war ?
People want to know which language to pick for a project , or which language to commit to learn .
Perhaps the first thing to point out is that it 's perhaps rather unfair to see this as a race between these particular two horses .
Scripting has been available on the JVM for a long time .
Jython , a Java implementation of Python , has been around for several years .
There 's plenty of other , more obscure languages , which I dare n't mention for fear of offending all the ones I miss out .
JRuby has got a lot of attention due to the attention of the Ruby language generally - attention particularly ignited by the interest around Rails .
We 've seen a sharp spike of interest around Ruby and Rails work at ThoughtWorks , and JRuby adds an extra dimension since it allows people to deploy Rails applications using their existing Java infrastructure .
Groovy gets its attention because it , more than any other language , is designed to work seamlessly with the JVM , and got a lot of attention from an early JSR .
Personally I 'd dropped Groovy from my radar a couple of years ago when its development seemed to bog down .
With its 1.0 release and further interesting positive vibes from some of my colleagues I 've started to pay attention again .
Lets begin by talking about similarities .
Both JRuby and Groovy ( and indeed Jython ) are modern OO scripting languages .
They combine the well - chosen terseness of scripting languages with good solid structures for building larger programs .
As such they are suitable both for classical scripting and for writing larger programs .
Both are comfortable with dynamic type checking , although Groovy does offer some static facilities too .
Both support Lambdas which are an important feature for the greater expressiveness that people want from this kind of language .
The biggest difference between them is their broader platform philosophy .
Groovy is designed to be a scripting language for Java .
As much as possible its syntax tries to match the equivalent in Java .
( Including such ugly things as the default fall - through in switch statements . )
It also works with Java 's class library directly , although it dynamically adds many methods to Java 's classes , vital in order to make use of things like closures .
JRuby , however , is a Java implementation of the Ruby platform .
Ruby can run directly on mainstream operating systems with a C runtime , and is starting to run on .
NET 's CLR .
When you program in JRuby you primarily use Ruby 's libraries which are implemented in Java , and may also use Java 's libraries at your discretion .
If you stick to Ruby 's libraries , or at least wrap any foreign elements , you can run Ruby programs on the C , Java , or ( in time ) .NET runtimes .
So you can use JRuby to both run Ruby programs on the JVM and as a language for scripting the JVM .
One of the big differences between JRuby and Jython is around the libraries .
One of the tricky aspects of porting this kind of scripting language to the JVM is that these languages are usually closely intertwined with libraries implemented in C.
Porting these libraries to Java involves rewriting the libraries in Java .
Jython did n't do much of this , as a result many Python apps can't run in Jython .
However the JRuby implementers decided from early on that their goal was to run Rails apps , as a result many libraries including all the Ruby standard libraries needed to be ported .
The fact that JRuby is a Ruby platform on the JVM means that in JRuby you have two kinds of objects - JRuby objects and Java objects .
Although there are ways for the two to talk to each other and to convert there is a difference .
There are times when you need to know whether you 're dealing with a Java string or a JRuby string .
With Groovy you do n't have that boundary , there are just Java objects .
It 's too early , or rather too difficult , to say if one language will win out .
Both are pretty young , only just finding their feet on the JVM .
On a more personal level , your choice has a lot to do with what you expect to do with it .
If you are only interested in running on the JVM , then Groovy could well be the easier choice .
You are working directly with Java 's library and object model , and the syntax requires less getting used to .
A strong reason to prefer Ruby is the fact that it lives in multiple implementations .
Ruby is a tool you can use in a lot of other places .
As a long time Rubyist , there 's not much incentive for me personally to get heavily into Groovy , even though I actually like the language a lot from what I 've seen of it .
Rails is an important factor .
The Java world is hardly lacking in web frameworks , but Rails is widely liked by those who 've used it .
I 've not got many reports yet about Grails ( the Groovy knock - off ) so can't give a firm opinion on that .
But I can imagine that the ability to deploy web apps with Rails could be a major factor in making JRuby popular .
Something else to look at is the growth of RSpec as a new spin on testing environments .
With any platform it's as important to consider the people involved in the community as much as any technical factors .
Good people can overcome technical weaknesses quickly and a vibrant community is a potent source for big innovations .
RubyPeople have formed a particularly strong community , which has already spawned things like Rails , Rake , and Rspec .
Will either matter to Java ?
After all Jython 's been around for a long time without making a huge impact on the JVM .
Tool support is frankly pathetic for any of these languages when you compare it to what you have for Java at the moment .
I think we 're actually at an inflection point with Java .
Until recently the Java cry was One VM and OneLanguage .
( As opposed to the CLR which started with the cry of one VM and many languages - providing they 're C# or VB . )
This seems to be changing as people realize the limitations of Java and begin to seek out different capabilities .
It 's likely the future will see multiple languages closely integrated within the JVM .
There are plenty of people who dislike the hype around Rails and Ruby .
But even if you dislike Ruby , the hype has led to a resurgence of interest in new languages .
I doubt if the interest in Groovy would be anywhere near as great as it is if it was n't for this hype , nor would Jython be awaking from its slumbers .
The ruby / rails hype has also generated interest in other exotic JVM languages .
The really nice thing here is that the JRuby people have been encouraging their dynamic rivals - recognizing that the point here is to encourage multi-lingual inter-operability and innovation .
Sprint has decided to settle a class action lawsuit that alleged the company was engaging in anticompetitive practices by locking mobile handsets sold through the carrier .
The company has agreed to provide unlock codes to current and former customers so that they can use their Sprint CDMA phones on other CDMA - enabled carriers , upon deactivation or after deactivation of the account .
It has also agreed to add information about unlocking to its Terms and Conditions , and to train customer service personnel to address questions related to unlocking handsets .
The suit was originally filed by California residents Katherine Zill , William Mackenzie , Linda Mackenzie , and Gerasimo Molfetas , saying that Sprint violated California law by locking its handsets .
They also alleged that Sprint failed to disclose the practice to customers , which then made it more expensive for them to switch carriers ( since it required them to purchase a new phone ) .
Specifically , the plaintiffs cited California 's Unfair Competition Law , Business & Professions Code , and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act .
In its proposed settlement , Sprint maintains that it is free from any wrongdoing or liability to the class members .
The company says , however , that it has agreed to settle the case " for the purpose of avoiding the uncertainties and expense of , and diversion of business resources resulting from , further litigation . "
As long as customers have no outstanding obligations with Sprint ( translation : " Pay your bill , yo " ) , they will be able to obtain unlock codes upon request from the carrier .
This will apply to any current or past customers who have purchased phones from Sprint between August 28 , 1999 and July 16 , 2007 .
Sprint is , of course , not the only company being targeted by consumers over handset unlocking .
The California Supreme Court greenlighted a class action suit against T - Mobile earlier this month — one that mirrors the Sprint lawsuit in almost every way .
Additionally , two class - action lawsuits have been filed against Apple and AT&T so far , both of which address the iPhone - AT&T lock - in in addition to a number of other issues .
Sprint 's settlement , assuming that a judge approves the proposal , does n't necessarily carry legal implications for other companies , but it may put pressure on them to settle similar lawsuits that pop up in order to avoid costly lawyer fees .
T - Mobile is the most likely candidate for a settlement first , but we 're willing to guess that Apple will kick and scream until it 's forced to unlock the iPhone by a court or legislation — especially if it 's receiving $ 18 per month per subscriber from AT&T .
I have always maintained that the American public was the least culpable of the players during the run-up to Iraq .
The war was sold by a brilliant and fear - fueled White House propaganda campaign designed to stampede a nation still shellshocked by 9/11 .
Both Congress and the press — the powerful institutions that should have provided the checks , balances and due diligence of the administration ’s case — failed to do their job .
Had they done so , more Americans might have raised more objections .
This perfect storm of democratic failure began at the top .
As the war has dragged on , it is hard to give Americans en masse a pass .
We are too slow to notice , let alone protest , the calamities that have followed the original sin .
In April 2004 , Stars and Stripes first reported that our troops were using makeshift vehicle armor fashioned out of sandbags , yet when a soldier complained to Donald Rumsfeld at a town meeting in Kuwait eight months later , he was successfully pilloried by the right .
Proper armor procurement lagged for months more to come .
Not until early this year , four years after the war ’s first casualties , did a Washington Post investigation finally focus the country ’s attention on the shoddy treatment of veterans , many of them victims of inadequate armor , at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other military hospitals .
We first learned of the use of contractors as mercenaries when four Blackwater employees were strung up in Falluja in March 2004 , just weeks before the first torture photos emerged from Abu Ghraib .
We asked few questions .
When reports surfaced early this summer that our contractors in Iraq ( 180,000 , of whom some 48,000 are believed to be security personnel ) now outnumber our postsurge troop strength , we yawned .
Contractor casualties and contractor - inflicted casualties are kept off the books .
It was always the White House ’s plan to coax us into a blissful ignorance about the war .
Part of this was achieved with the usual Bush - Cheney secretiveness , from the torture memos to the prohibition of photos of military coffins .
But the administration also invited our passive complicity by requiring no shared sacrifice .
A country that knows there ’s no such thing as a free lunch was all too easily persuaded there could be a free war .

Instead of taxing us for Iraq , the White House bought us off with tax cuts .
Instead of mobilizing the needed troops , it kept a draft off the table by quietly purchasing its auxiliary army of contractors to finesse the overstretched military ’s holes .
With the war ’s entire weight falling on a small voluntary force , amounting to less than 1 percent of the population , the rest of us were free to look the other way at whatever went down in Iraq .

Mexican tequila sells well in the US
The lower house of Congress voted to urge the government to stop Chinese firms patenting maguey - a type of agave cactus used in tequila .
MPs are also worried that Chinese and Japanese firms could target the market in another cactus species , nopal .
Nopal leaves are increasingly popular in the US , where there is already strong demand for tequila .
" Nopal and Maguey are Mexican plants and if we do n't take the necessary measures in time , we run the risk of losing the denomination of origin " , Cesar Duarte , the deputy who sponsored the move , told the Efe news agency .
Mr Duarte said the main Mexican farmers ' union had been told that Chinese firms had begun legal moves to register the nopal plant with the European Commission as a Chinese product .
But the Mexican Agriculture Ministry said that so far Brussels had received no requests regarding either mopal or maguey .
Tequila power
The Mexican tequila industry has expanded rapidly since the early 1990s .
Marketing experts have tried to change its reputation from a cheap peasant drink to a sophisticated international spirit like whisky .
In 2005 , Mexico produced a record 210 m litres of tequila - almost half of which was exported .
Sales to the US alone were worth more than $ 400m .
Mexican tequila producers have pushed for tequila products to have a denomination of origin system similar to the one used in the wine industry .
Mexico argues that the maguey is a uniquely Mexican product because 150 of the 200 varieties of the plant are found in its territory .
Shared hosting is not a ghetto
In the wake of the Dreamhost blog ’s post on Rails and shared hosting , there ’s been a bit of a meme going around with respect to deploying frameworks like Rails ( or Django , or TurboGears … ) , and which more or less consists of people asking why , if you ’re using one of these frameworks , you ’re not just ponying up for a VPS or dedicated server .
After all , it ’s not like the offerings these days are that much more expensive than commodity shared hosting .
There are some problems with this attitude , some of which are elegantly characterized by a comment on Twitter developer Alex Payne ’s post “ Shared Hosting is a Ghetto ” :
people who are living in ghettos are , you ’ll find , rarely there because they ’re just too cheap to move to the nicer parts of the city .
Let ’s run with that and explore why shared hosting , despite the average developer ’s distaste for it , is still a necessity and — I believe — a good thing for the modern frameworks to play nicely with .
The hidden cost of dedicated hosting
The first thing to realize is that a VPS plan that costs $ 20 / mo .
is n’t actually that cheap ; it comes with ongoing costs in terms of systems administration and maintenance that , frankly , a lot of people do n’t have the time or budget for .
Yes , you get the operating system preinstalled and maybe a nice control panel to configure services , but that ’s just the starting point : you also need to monitor security and bugfix updates for all of the software running on your server , and be ready and able to upgrade or reconfigure in response ( and even with nice package managers like apt , this is still a non-trivial job ) .
For that you either need to have some sysadmin skills or have the budget to hire someone who does , and that means your cost , either in time spent doing this work or money spent paying someone to do it for you , goes up .
You can get “ managed ” dedicated servers , but again your cost and complexity go up .
When you take things like this into account , typical shared hosting suddenly starts looking a lot more attractive to the average individual or small business that ’s trying to set up a Web presence : they only need to worry about the things that directly pertain to their own site , and the host takes care of the rest of the server environment .
And back when I did freelance work , I steered a lot of clients toward shared hosting solutions ( including Dreamhost , though , in the interest of disclosure , I never made any significant referral money from them ) for precisely this reason : it let the client focus their budget on the things they actually cared about .
Is dedicated hosting overkill ?
Also , for the vast majority of individuals and small businesses out there , dedicated hosting is really much more than they ’re ever likely to need ; standard commodity shared hosting can handle their application loads and traffic levels just fine .
For example , this blog runs on a Joyent Accelerator , which is a virtualized slice of a beefy Solaris server and gives me root access to go in and configure whatever I want .
But it ’s overkill for what I ’m doing here ; even when I ’m being linked up by a bunch of popular blogs , shared hosting would be able to handle the load with ease .
I bought the Accelerator plan for other reasons ( including the fact that , as a geek , I just love having cool things to play with ) .
If I were helping a typical small business to work out what they need for their Web presence , and doing a realistic assessment of their expected traffic levels and resource utilization , I ’d probably recommend shared hosting ; most people simply have no need for what a VPS / dedicated plan offers , and the additional costs outlined above would make such a plan a bad choice for them .
Flexibility
Ultimately there ’s only one argument I can think of in which VPS / dedicated hosting comes out ahead for the needs of the typical web site : the freedom and flexibility to run practically anything .
When you ’ve got the keys to your own box ( or a virtualized slice of one ) , you have absolute control over what runs on it and how , and that can be a big attraction .
It means , for example , that you can set up Apache or any other web server , and build exactly the set of extensions and modules you want .
It means you can tune the database until it sings .
It means you can throw up a memcached instance and give it the memory it needs without worrying about per-process limits .
It means you can add or shut off services at will .
It ’s the ultimate power trip for the average web - dev geek .
But is this level of flexibility necessary for running a framework - based application ?
Absolutely not .
The only reason people recommend dedicated hosting for frameworks like Rails is the fact that , right now , we ’re all still figuring out how to make the shared - hosting equation work .
Back in the days when consumer - level hosting did n’t typically offer CGI access or limited it to canned pre-installed scripts , people would recommend moving up to the next tier of hosting if you needed to run custom stuff Today you ’d be laughed at if you recommended dedicated hosting for that .
I fully believe that within a year or two , the same will be true of the new wave of frameworks : there are promising solutions already nearing maturity ( and several hosts which are already doing a great job of helping them along ) , and worries about whether you can deploy a framework on shared hosting will be as antiquated as a previous age ’s worries about whether you can use mailform.pl .
Why I care about shared hosting
Thinking back again to my freelance days , when I mostly worked in PHP and Perl , one fact stands out : I almost never wrote a full application for a client .
Most of the time I took something off the shelf , reconfigured it , wrote some stuff on top of it or maybe wrote a plugin , and that was that .
Part of the reason for this was the availability of software I could hack on , but a bigger part was simply that writing an entire application back to front , in those languages and at that time , simply was n’t an option : grabbing a canned app and hammering it into the right shape for the client ’s needs , or ( more often ) something close enough to work , was the only thing that could deliver on time and within budget .
I ended up making some pieces of software do things they were never intended to do , sometimes badly , but it was always faster and cheaper than bespoke development .
Today , though , I ’d never dream of working that way .
If I were freelancing today , I ’d simply pick up a framework and build out an application tailored precisely to my client ’s needs , and I ’d be able to meet both deadlines and budget requirements .
By dealing with the common , baseline problems like database interaction , templating and URL dispatch , frameworks free up developers to , well , develop .
But if it ’s too hard to deploy a framework - based application on the kind of commodity hosting that most smaller clients will have , then they ’ll never see the benefit of it .
They ’ll keep hearing , and believing , that custom application development is too expensive and takes too much time .
They ’ll keep getting square pegs hammered into round holes .
They wo n’t ever get applications that really fit their needs .
And that ’s a case where everybody loses : clients get crappy sites and developers get crappy jobs , and nobody ’s happy .
Shared hosting is not a ghetto
Shared hosting is and likely will always be an appropriate choice for many types of sites : individuals , small businesses , non-profit groups with tight budgets , all sorts of use cases that are n’t necessarily glamorous but exist and make up a huge percentage of real - world web development .
There are still plenty of cases where I ’d recommend VPS or dedicated hosting to a client who has the budget for it , but shared hosting works and is a good solution for an awful lot of people .
And while it ’s currently hard to deploy a lot of framework - based applications on a lot of shared hosts , that does n’t mean framework developers should just ignore the problem or hope that someone else will solve it , or that people who want to take advantage of the power and flexibility of modern web frameworks should be forced into hosting solutions that do n’t otherwise suit them .
Like I said the other day , what ’s needed is an ongoing dialogue between hosts and framework developers , to sit down and solve the various issues in ways that work for both sides .
Comments about how shared hosting is a “ ghetto ” , or how the customers at shared hosts are just too cheap to get real hosting , bespeak ignorance at best and arrogance at worst , neither of which contribute anything useful to discussions of a real problem being faced by real people .

Snow has fallen in Baghdad for the first time in living memory
Local reports say that 10 people died in Saudi Arabia after snowfalls .
In Syria , temperatures have dropped to minus 16 degrees Celsius .
There has been widespread damage to crops in Syria , Jordan and Israel .
There has also been snow in the Iraqi capital Baghdad for the first time in living memory .
The Middle East is a region used to extremes of temperature - but not ones like these .
Kuwaiti meteorologists are eagerly watching thermometers to see if the previous low recorded in the open desert , minus four degrees Celsius in 1964 , could be broken in the coming days .
Some in the Jordanian government are worried that food prices may increase , giving inflation another unwelcome bump .
But reports from Israel suggest the weather may not be bad news for everyone .
Some farmers are suffering , but there has been a jump in the sale of heaters and warm clothes , with retailers saying the demand for some goods has tripled .
This cold snap has been caused by a weather system that began in Siberia .
But meteorologists in the region cannot agree whether it is the result of climate change ; the director of Baghdad 's Meteorology Department reportedly said it could be , his counterpart in Amman disagrees .
Have you been affected by the cold weather in the Middle East ?
Your comments :
This week the ice has not thawed on our goose pond as we have had nights of - 3 to - 6 and the winds have been 35 - 48 kmh clear and cold at 740 meters
Nathanael Kinstein , Eli Shomron , West Bank
It 's very cold in Jordan despite the sun being out .
My car is often registering an outside temperature of less than 5C .
We are very concerned about price rises here .
Fuel costs were due to go up by 30 % or so , but that has been delayed .
Staple foods in Amman usually go up in price during the winter but if there 's a weather effect on crops , then we might see higher prices .
Mohammed Shahnawaz , Amman , Jordan
It is a beautiful bright blue sky now but must have been about 4C last night .
You have to remember the houses are built to keep the heat out !
So wearing bobble hats , using a hotwater bottle and warming your pyjamas on a radiator is n't really the image of life in the Middle East .
It rained very heavily in the week and it was like Blackpool in November .. winds and rains .
June Arber , Doha Qatar
I have lived in Kuwait for the past 26 years and I can say this is the coldest yet .
Also , no rain has fallen which would make the weather milder .
This is the first time people are actually staying indoors at night !!!
Of course sales of heaters , blankets and quits has quadrupled so there is benefit for retailers ( the past years have been very mild and no winter colthes were worn ! )
Mayada Homad , Kuwait
This cold weather has wiped out all of our banana crop and has severely damaged our citrus .
Along with the fact that until now we have had about 1 / 4 of our normal rainfall , this is not a good year for the average person in the Middle East .
Bill Scheinman , Kibbutz Ginnosar , Israel
I have n't seen snow like this since I was a child growing up in the heart of Damascus .
It is spectacularly cold outside , a welcome sight amid all the heated conflicts in the Middle East !
Hazem Bard , Damascus , Syria
I live in Riyadh and the weather has been the coldest I remember !
I love it !
Majed , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia
It seems that God decided to turn the Holy Land into a big refrigerator about 10 days ago .
I use to go outside , late at nights , for years , to do some excercise and the cold strikes you now in the face , even if you are well - covered .
To add salt to injury , the wind sarted blowing .
Only one thing I do n't understand : how Shackleton and his friends survived much much longer and in much much colder conditions .

This weekend , I finally decided to step into the 21st century and began the process of migrating RSS Bandit to v2.0 of the .NET Framework .
In addition , we 've also moved our source code repository from CVS to Subversion and so far it 's already been a marked improvement .
Since the .NET Framework is currently on v3.0 and v3.5 is in beta 1 , I 'm fairly out of date when it comes to the pet peeves in my favorite programming tools .
At least one of my pet peeves was fixed , in Visual Studio 2005 I finally have an IDE where " Find References to this Method " actually works .
On the flip side , the introduction of generics has added a lot more frustrating moments than I expected .
By now most .NET developers have seen the dreaded
Cannot convert from ' System.Collections.Generic.List<subtype of T > to ' System.Collections .Generic.List<T >'
For those of you who are n't familiar with C# 2.0 , here are examples of code that works and code that does n't work .
The difference is often subtle enough to be quite irritating when you first encounter it .
WORKS ! - Array [ subtype of T ] implicitly casted to Array [ T ]
using System ;
using Cybertron .
Transformers ;
public class TransformersTest {
public static void GetReadyForBattle ( Transformer [ ] robots ) {
foreach ( Transformer bot in robots ) {
if (!bot. InRobotMode )
bot.Transform ( ) ;
}
}
public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) {
Autobot OptimusPrime = new Autobot ( ) ;
Autobot [ ] autobots = new Autobot [ 1 ] ;
autobots [ 0 ] = Optimus Prime ;
Decepticon Megatron = new Decepticon ( ) ;
Decepticon [ ] decepticons = new Decepticon [ 1 ] ;
decepticons [ 0 ] = Megatron ;
GetReadyForBattle( decepticons ) ;
GetReadyForBattle( autobots ) ;
}
}
DOESN'T WORK - List < subtype of T > implicitly casted to List<T >
using System ;
using Cybertron .
Transformers ;
public class TransformersTest {
public static void GetReadyForBattle ( List < Transformer > robots ) {
foreach ( Transformer bot in robots ) {
if (!bot. InRobotMode )
bot.Transform ( ) ;
}
}
public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) {
Autobot OptimusPrime = new Autobot ( ) ;
List < Autobot > autobots = new List < Autobot > ( 1 ) ;
autobots .
Add( OptimusPrime ) ;
Decepticon Megatron = new Decepticon ( ) ;
List < Decepticon > decepticons = new List < Decepticon >( 1 ) ;
decepticons .
Add( Megatron ) ;
GetReadyForBattle( decepticons ) ;
GetReadyForBattle( autobots ) ;
}
}
The reason this does n't work has been explained ad nauseum by various members of the CLR and C# teams such as Rick Byer 's post Generic type parameter variance in the CLR where he argues
More formally , in C# v2.0 if T is a subtype of U , then T[ ] is a subtype of U[ ] , but G < T > is not a subtype of G < U > ( where G is any generic type ) .
In type - theory terminology , we describe this behavior by saying that C# array types are “ covariant ” and generic types are “ invariant ” .
There is actually a reason why you might consider generic type invariance to be a good thing .
Consider the following code : List < string > ls = new List < string >( ) ; ls. Add( " test " ) ; List < object > lo = ls ; //
Ca n't do this in C# object o1 = lo[ 0 ] ; // ok – converting string to object lo [ 0 ] = new object ( ) ; // ERROR – ca n’t convert object to string
If this were allowed , the last line would have to result in a run-time type - check ( to preserve type safety ) , which could throw an exception ( eg. InvalidCastException ) .
This would n’t be the end of the world , but it would be unfortunate .
Even if I buy that the there is no good way to prevent the error scenario in the above code snippet without making generic types invariant , it seems that there were a couple of ways out of the problem that were shut out by the C# language team .
One approach that I was so sure would work was to create a subtype of System .
Collections .
Generics .
List and define implict and explict cast operators for it .
It did n't
WORKS ! - MyList <T> implicitly casted to ArrayList via user - defined cast operator

public static implicit operator MyList < T>( ArrayList target ) {

}
return newList ;

}
}
I really wanted that last bit of code to work because it would have been quite a non-intrusive fix for the problem ( ignoring the fact that I have to use my own subclasses of the .
NET Framework 's collection classes ) .
At the end of the day I ended up creating a TypeConverter utility class which contains some of the dumbest code I 've had to write to trick a compiler into doing the right thing , here 's what it ended up looking like
WORKS - Create a TypeConverter class that encapsulates calls to List.
ConvertAll
using System ;
using Cybertron .
Transformers ;
public class TypeConverter {
public static List < Transformer > ToTransformerList <T>( List < T> target ) where T : Transformer {
return target .
ConvertAll( new Converter <T , Transformer >( MakeTransformer ) ) ;
}
public static Transformer MakeTransformer <T>( T target ) where T : Transformer {
return target ; /* greatest conversion code ever !!!! */
}
}
public class Test {
public static void GetReadyForBattle ( List < Transformer > robots ) {
foreach ( Transformer bot in robots ) {
if (!bot. InRobotMode )
bot.Transform ( ) ;
}
}
}
public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) {
Autobot OptimusPrime = new Autobot ( ) ;
List < Autobot > autobots = new List < Autobot > ( 1 ) ;
autobots .
Add( OptimusPrime ) ;
Decepticon Megatron = new Decepticon ( ) ;
List < Decepticon > decepticons = new List < Decepticon >( 1 ) ;
decepticons .
Add( Megatron ) ;
GetReadyForBattle( TypeConverter.ToTransformerList(decepticons ) ) ;
GetReadyForBattle( TypeConverter.ToTransformerList( autobots ) ) ;
}
}
This works but it 's ugly as sin .
Anybody got any better ideas ?

Lot 's of great suggestions in the comments .
Since I do n't want to go ahead and modify a huge chunk of methods across our code base , I suspect I 'll continue with themodel .
However John Spurlock pointed out that it is much smarter to implement theusing generics for both input and output parameters instead of way I hacked it together last night .
So our code will look more like
using System ;
using Cybertron .
Transformers ;
public class TypeConverter {
/// < summary >
/// Returns a delegate that can be used to cast a subtype back to its base type .
/// </summary >
/// < typeparam name= " T " > The derived type </ typeparam >
/// < typeparam name= " U " > The base type </ typeparam >
/// < returns > Delegate that can be used to cast a subtype back to its base type .
</ returns >
public static Converter <T , U> UpCast < T , U > ( ) where T : U {
return delegate ( T item ) { return ( U)item ; } ;
}
}
public class Test {
public static void GetReadyForBattle ( List < Transformer > robots ) {
foreach ( Transformer bot in robots ) {
if (!bot. InRobotMode )
bot.Transform ( ) ;
}
}
}
public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) {
Autobot OptimusPrime = new Autobot ( ) ;
List < Autobot > autobots = new List < Autobot > ( 1 ) ;
autobots .
Add( OptimusPrime ) ;
Decepticon Megatron = new Decepticon ( ) ;
List < Decepticon > decepticons = new List < Decepticon >( 1 ) ;

I like to learn a thing or two every day , and today I learned a very interesting thing indeed .
Many people know that alcohol can be used as fuel for cars and farm equipment .
It ’s popular today in the guise of ethanol , but ethanol is largely a red herring .
Ethanol is a ghost of what could have been had the Prohibition movement not killed alcohol fuel in its infancy .
Most people are not aware that Henry Ford ’s Model T came in a variation that allowed the driver to switch the carburetor to run the engine on farm - made ethyl acohol [ sic ] .
This allowed the operator to stop at local farms ( equipped with stills ) to refuel his / her car during long trips through the backcountry .
After all - the gas station was n’t exactly as ubiquitous in those days , as it is now .
The Standard Oil Company and its industrialist - founder John D. Rockefeller was n’t too happy with this arrangement .
After all , Rockefeller ’s company had a virtual monoploly on gasoline at this time in our nation ’s development .
It kind of makes me wonder why we ’re fighting an illegal war over oil in the desert , thousands of miles away , when we could probably retrofit our cars to run on domestically produced alcohol fuels ( which does not have to be corn - based like ethanol ) .
Like William Randolph Hearst ’s campaign against cannabis ( marijuana ) , Rockefeller ’s campaign against alcohol was ultimately successful … for him .
Hearst and Rockefeller ’s respective campaigns were horrible crimes perpetrated against America , the environment and truth , but both men were personally enriched through their scheming .
Since the late 1800′s there had been a growing Alcohol Temperance Movement developing among reformers .
Rockefeller saw an opportunity in this .
It is well - documented that local efforts to curb alcohol consumption were expanded to the national level when high - profile figures like Rockefeller joined in the anti-alcohol efforts .
Was he so concerned with the social problems that abuse of alcohol was said to cause ?
No… John D. Rockefeller was not concerned with family dynamics in the working classes .
But he was influential in changing the goals of the movement from temperance to prohibition .
As we know , his contribution to the outlawing of the production and sale of alcohol was successful .
Of course , Rockefeller and the oil companies reaped tremendous profits as a result .
Remember that the period covered by the 18th Amendment ( 1919 - 1933 ) coincided with the huge rise in the sale and operation of automobiles .
America was on the move , and all of these cars were now operated solely on gasoline .
By the time that the 21st Amendment was passed , ending the prohibition of alcohol , the standard was already set and worked completely in the favor of the Rockefeller family .
While this is an excellent example of a conspiracy against the American people that is both provable and successful , there is one problem with calling it a conspiracy : Conspiracies require illegal acts , and lying to the American people is not necessarily illegal .
Unethical , yes , but unless you were personally slandered there ’s no chance of legal recourse against such conspiratorial campaigns .
In the end , this is an example of how rich men can ride roughshod over the Constitution and the democratic process and there ’s not a damn thing anybody can do about it .

[ I recently got my hands on one of the One Laptop Per Child machines .
I found the perfect person to review the machine .
Today ’s guest blogger , SG , is twelve years old and is the child of a close friend .
I lent the laptop to SG and asked SG to write a review , which appears here just as SG wrote it , without any editing .

[ Update ( June 2012 ) : I can reveal now that SG is my daughter , Claire Felten . ]
I ’ve spent all of my life around computers and laptops .
I ’m only 12 years old though , so I ’m not about to go off and start programming a computer to do my homework for me or anything .
My parents use computers a lot , so I know about HTML and mother boards and stuff , but still I ’m not exactly what you would call an expert .
I just use the computer for essays , surfing the web , etc .
Over the last few days , I spent a lot of time on this laptop .
I went on the program for typing documents , took silly pictures with the camera , went on the web , played the matching game , recorded my voice on the music - making application , and longed for someone to join me on the laptop - to - laptop messaging system .
Here is what I discovered about the OLPC laptops :
My expectations for this computer were , I must admit , not very high .
But it completely took me by surprise .
It was cleverly designed , imaginative , straightforward , easy to understand ( I was given no instructions on how to use it .
It was just , “ Here . Figure it out yourself . ” ) , useful and simple , entertaining , dependable , really a “ stick to the basics ” kind of computer .
It ’s the perfect laptop for the job .
Great for first time users , it sets the mood by offering a bunch of entertaining and easy games and a camera .
It also has an application that allows you to type things .
The space is a little limited , but the actual thing was great .
It does n’t have one of those impossible - to - read fonts but it was still nice .
When the so - so connection allows you to get on , the internet is one of the best features of the whole computer .
With a clever and space - saving toolbar , it is compact , well designed , accessible , and fast .
But , unfortunately , the internet is the only fast element of the computer .
My main problem with this laptop is how very slow it is .
It ’s true that I am used to faster computers , but that ’s not the problem .
It ’s just really slow .
I had to wait two minutes to get onto one application .
That ’s just a little longer than I can accept .
Also , it got slower and slower and slower the longer I went without rebooting it .
I had to reboot it all the time .
We ’re talking once every two or three hours of use !
And one of the most frustrating things about the system was that it gave no warning when it was out of power ( as it was often because it lost charge very quickly ) but just shut down .
It does n’t matter if you ’re working on your autobiography and you had gotten all the way to the day before yesterday and forgotten to save it , it just shuts off and devours the whole thing .
This laptop is definitely designed for harsh conditions .
Covered in a green and white hard plastic casing , it is designed not to break if dropped .
It has a very nice handle for easy transportation and two antennas in plastic that can be easily put up .
Once you open it , you see the screen ( pretty high resolution ) and my favorite part of the computer : the keyboard .
It ’s green rubber so that dust and water wo n’t get in under the keys , and this makes the keyboard an awesome thing to type on .
Every time you hit a key , it provides a certain amount of satisfaction of how squishy and effortless it is .
I just ca n’t get over that keyboard .
There is also a button that changes the brightness of the screen .
The other cool thing is that the screen is on a swiveling base , so you can turn it backwards then close it .
This makes the laptop into just a screen with a handle .
All in all , this laptop is great for its price , its job , and its value .
It is almost perfect .
Just speed it up , give it a little more battery charge hold , and you have yourself the perfect laptop .
I ’m sure kids around the world will really love , enjoy , and cherish these laptops .
They will be so useful .
This program is truly amazing .

In his remarkable twenty - year career as a New York Times business journalist , Kurt Eichenwald has seen himself as a kind of crusader — shedding light on the world ’s dark places , uncovering wrongdoing , bringing criminals to account .
Lately , however , the pursuer feels like the pursued .
“ I had no idea of what I was taking on .
I had no idea of the magnitude of the evil of these people , ” he tells me .
“ This is an organized - crime business , these are people — we ’re not talking about people with an affinity for Scotch — they spend their days talking and living and breathing the sexual issues of children . ”
Two years ago , Eichenwald wrote a sensational front - page story in the New York Times about Justin Berry , a teenage pornography star who ran an enormously lucrative business from his room while his mother thought he was doing homework .
The article resulted in congressional hearings , arrests , book - and - movie interest , and an Oprah episode .
Eichenwald followed that first story with disturbing reports about illegal child - modeling Websites and self - help chat rooms where child molesters perfect their strategies .
The Berry piece was impressive in its vividness .
Law - enforcement agencies seized upon it as the definitive word about a sordid , teeming underworld , and parents inclined to worry about the dangers of the Internet were given reason to worry much more .
As much as the stories provided a window into a seldom - seen world , they also raised troubling questions about how they were reported — and ultimately about the man who reported them .
To start with , Eichenwald made himself a character in the story about Berry — highly unusual for the New York Times .
The reporter appeared as a savior , working to win Berry ’s trust and finally rescuing him from the business he ’d fallen into and delivering him back to his religious faith .
But once Eichenwald became part of the story , others began to ask questions :
Why would a Times reporter believe he should go into the rescuing business ?
And how had he accomplished what he ’d accomplished ?
( Reporting on child pornography is inherently difficult , because looking at the images themselves is illegal , even for a journalist . )
And behind those questions is a more fundamental one :
What drives the people who fill these roles , criminal and pursuer , obsessive fan and obsessive foe ?
With the country ’s vexed relationship to youthful sexuality as the backdrop , Eichenwald ’s stories , hectoring as they were about the evils they were uncovering , had a kind of prurient power that is undeniably related to the power of pornography .
The cure and the disease are impossible to separate .
Now Eichenwald has been ensnared by his own campaign .
His reporting methods are under intense scrutiny , and he ’s been pilloried by other journalists , by pro-sex activists , and by people whom his investigations helped to put in jail .
As the controversy has grown , Eichenwald has bunkered himself in his Dallas home .
He has family members answer his doorbell .
As our talk began , he closed the doors of his home office , which is tightly shuttered against a beautiful morning , though there is no one in the house but the two of us and the family ’s three - legged dog , Maggie .
The fight he ’s found himself in has wreaked havoc on his life .
He ’s teary , volatile , largely unable to work .
He left the Times , then walked away from a large contract at Portfolio .
His career is in tatters .
For this , he blames a campaign by the convicts he ’s exposed , other child molesters he does n’t even know , random anonymous bloggers , and journalists , specifically the advocacy journalist Debbie Nathan , who has written several long pieces questioning his reporting methods and whom he calls “ the high priestess of pedophilia . ”
He believes they are acting in concert to destroy him , professionally and emotionally .
“ I am emotionally damaged — significantly damaged , ” he tells me in one of dozens of interviews over the past three months , many marked by tears and screams of rage .
“ The Justin thing was two years ago , and it wo n’t stop !
What can I do to make it stop ?
It will never stop , you just do n’t understand . ”

Back in early June 2005 , child exploitation was the furthest thing from his mind .
He was an award - winning business reporter , known for his ability to master arcane corporate puzzles and finesse uncooperative sources .
He came to prominence on the ruins of Enron as well as scandals at Archer Daniels Midland and Arthur Andersen — proving himself amid America ’s business crises as an unparalleled investigative reporter who could find a heart - stopping thriller in any corporate drama .
His best - selling books have been snapped up by Hollywood , one set to star Leonardo DiCaprio , the other Matt Damon , with Steven Soderbergh directing .
He had two George Polk awards on his shelf , and was a finalist ( with Gina Kolata ) for a 2000 Pulitzer .
It was entirely by accident that he turned his talents to exposing the Internet - porn business , he says .
Between investigations , he was Googling for a new project .
“ I was looking for something international , ” he has said , and something involving dirty money .
So he typed in Interpol , fraud alert , and investigations .
That led him to a Website called MexicoFriends.com , which sounded to Eichenwald like it might involve cross - border money laundering but turned out to be an amateurish porn operation starring Justin Berry , who was 18 at the time , and a parade of beautiful Mexican women .
His eye fell on the Website ’s help icon .
It was illustrated with the face of a young kid — Berry at about age 14 .
There were disclaimers , but Eichenwald looked past them .
“ Nobody could look at this image knowing that it was a porn site and not conclude this is about child porn , ” Eichenwald testified in a related criminal case in Michigan .
“ It was an image of a 14 - year - old boy , somebody who was clearly underage .
Somebody who , in truth , and this was a very important thing , he looked a lot like my oldest son , who was 13 at the time . ”
Eichenwald , who has two other sons ( then ages 7 and 10 ) , was haunted by the comparison .
He showed the picture to his wife , Theresa , a physician .
“ I remember him saying , ‘ This could be ours , this could be our boy , ’ ” she says .
In that moment , they both say , the boy in the picture stopped being a potential story and became a rescue operation , a mission of mercy .
They decided to make contact .
“ A little voice was asking , ‘ What if our sons were in trouble , ’ ” Theresa Eichenwald says .
“ I would hope somebody would help them . ”
Something kept them from thinking that they could simply alert authorities to their concerns and leave it at that .
Eichenwald now says he should have e-mailed the CyberTipline , a project of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children .
Instead , he recruited his own spiritual adviser , an Episcopalian minister named Kevin Huddleston , and spoke to their oldest son , using Justin Berry as an “ object lesson ” in the perils of the Internet .
With everybody onboard , over the next several days Eichenwald posed as a pervy fan and made awkward contact with the youth and his business partner and sometime sexual partner , a 37 - year - old operator of a Sonic drive - in named Greg Mitchel .
He won their trust in part by leading them to think he was a celebrated musician .
They guessed Eichenwald might be Don Henley of the Eagles .
Despite Berry ’s claims to being over 18 , Eichenwald says the contacts only increased his concern for the youth and his fears for the kid ’s safety .
Justin Berry first went through the looking glass as a 13 - year - old , when he hooked up a Webcam and began broadcasting live from his bedroom in Bakersfield , California .
His distracted mother and stepfather apparently paid little notice ; his biological father was long gone , having beaten charges of child abuse for knocking Berry ’s head against a wall , then left for Mexico .
He thought the Webcam would give him the opportunity to meet “ some girls my age , ” he once said .
But that ’s not exactly what happened .
Soon , a man invited him to remove his shirt , which he did for the promise of cash , he says .
By 14 , he was fielding requests to masturbate online in exchange for “ gifts ” his admirers would send , chosen off a “ wish list ” he kept on Amazon : computer equipment , toys , CDs , movies .
In this , he was clearly not alone .
An indeterminable number of teenagers had stumbled into similar businesses — a number that today has no doubt ballooned thanks to perfectly legal sites like MySpace , Facebook , and especially XTube , where 43,000 people have uploaded their home sex pictures and videos .
But Berry ’s corner of the marketplace was a bit scrappier .
For one thing , he was underage — federal child - pornography laws make it illegal to film , view , or sell sexualized images of anybody under 18 , though age - of - consent laws are lower ( in most states , 16 ) .
Berry — a lanky bottle - blond — launched JustinsCam.com when he was still 15 ( one preserved Webpage announced he was on hiatus “ due to homework ” ) .
He says he was soon making a six - figure income .
In retrospect , he says , he was being lured into these activities by practiced predators .
But a review of chat logs from that period suggests he was especially precocious .
He sends school - exam questions to his fans for them to answer and sometimes brazenly stiffs subscribers after they paid for shows .
When his girlfriend confronted him , he refused to quit .
“ It ’s a job , and I enjoy it , ” he wrote .
Berry says that at 13 and again a year or so later , he was drawn into a pair of sexual encounters with adult men he met over the Internet .
At 16 , he fell into his sordid , on - and - off relationship with Greg Mitchel ( they met in Mexico , where the age of consent can be as low as 12 ) , which would last until he was nearly 19 .
“ im str8 , ” Berry once IM - ed a friend , “ but bi for money . ”
Berry also generated money in other illegal ways , including using his subscribers ’ credit cards to buy unauthorized things for himself , plotting insurance scams , and even smuggling aliens over the border .
In one of the most peculiar twists of his story , Berry quit high school and moved to Mexico .
There , he reconciled with his father .
But the father soon found out about the son ’s entrepreneurial niche — and reportedly turned it into a family business , procuring young women to co-star with the teenager on a brand - new site called MexicoFriends.com .
The two Berrys were piling in the money by the time the son turned 18 , in July 2004 , but by the winter , Berry had begun drifting away from the business , redirecting MexicoFriends to an Evangelical Christian link , yeajesus.com , and rededicating himself to Christ .
One of the few artifacts of his past still online was a fan site Mitchel maintained on Yahoo in his honor .
Eichenwald first managed to contact Berry through an IM address he found in the MexicoFriends site archive .
Berry was staying with Mitchel at his home in Virginia at the time .
Eichenwald posed as an obsessed admirer , IM -ing and calling repeatedly .
After initially gaining their trust , Eichenwald says he worried that Berry and Mitchel were going cold on him .
That ’s when the Eichenwalds , according to Theresa , decided to make several payments via PayPal .
“ A lure , ” she called the cash , gaining his trust and keeping his attention until they could intervene .
“ I thought , Could we be throwing money away ?
And then , once again , What if it were our child ?
It ’s a small price to pay . ”
That spring , Justin and Mitchel were considering refurbishing JustinsFriends , as a “ twink ” ( young male ) porn business , once again starring Justin , a prospect Eichenwald has testified he found alarming .
These are n’t the usual tactics of a reporter , but Eichenwald insisted to me that he was working on a rescue , not a newspaper story — he decided to write about it all only later .
By late June 2005 , Eichenwald ’s rapport with Berry was strong enough that he began angling for a meeting , but Berry was reluctant — he still thought his Internet benefactor was a gay Gary Glitter .
Eichenwald pressed him repeatedly .
He reminded Berry of his generosity , and talked about the promise of a movie .
Eichenwald says he grew more desperate when he learned that Berry might be considering two marketing stunts in conjunction with his return : an Internet “ auction , ” where he would prostitute himself out to the highest bidder , and a whistle - stop tour in an RV — Eichenwald calls it “ a molest - a - thon , ” even though Berry was over 18 — in which fans could have a private show .
Desperate to stave off both events , the Eichenwalds sent along a much larger sum of money than before , this time $ 2,000 .
“ You have to come meet me , ” he would cajole the teenager .
“ I ’m the $ 2,000 guy ! ”
Finally , on June 30 , Berry flew to LAX and met his benefactor .
Eichenwald , who had flown in from Dallas , he demanded to see Berry ’s license , which proved he was weeks away from his 19th birthday , and handed over a copy of his newest book , proof he was a reporter , not a fan at all .
But these revelations did n’t stop the rescue mission .
Eichenwald explains that Berry was high on drugs when he arrived , sick to his stomach , and desperately thin — 109 pounds , though he was six - foot - one .
That afternoon , and the next morning , Eichenwald talked to Berry about self - respect and the fragility of the soul .
He extracted a promise to go cold turkey .
This was an interesting moment in their developing connection to one another , both Eichenwald and Berry explain to me .
Berry , in a telephone interview monitored by his attorney , said he looked at Eichenwald and thought , You know what ?
Enough ’s enough , and agreed to quit on the spot .
Emboldened , Eichenwald told Berry to break off all connections with his fans , and implored him to find a way to make money “ that was n’t based in self - denigration . ”
He says he also demanded Berry return the $ 2,000 .
“ We paid that money to save your soul , ” he remembers saying .
“ That money was good money and you took it for all of the worst reasons possible .
You took it and debased yourself by accepting that money .
You have to give it back . ”
Berry agreed to it all ; he was that ready for a change .
“ I was a mess .
I was horrible .
I was speaking to thousands of pedophiles on a daily basis , ” he says .
“ Luckily enough , Kurt , with that talk we had in L.A. , knocked enough sense into me . ”
Eichenwald says he then returned home hoping to see the money repaid but frankly never expecting to hear from Berry again .
On July 3 , he wrote the young man an encouraging e-mail , attaching a song by pop singer Chad Kroeger and an exegesis of the lyrics .
“ It ’s the story of a man who awakes one day , distressed at what he has done to his own life , angry at himself for the things he has allowed himself to do , ” he wrote .
Two days later , Berry called Eichenwald around 9 p.m .
“ So many kids are in danger , ” Eichenwald remembers him saying .
“ So many kids are being hurt , so many kids are ending up like me .
Somebody ’s got to stop this .
Somebody ’s got to do something . ”
At that moment , Eichenwald remembers thinking , “ Now this is a news story . ”
He called his editor in New York and got permission to fly Berry to Dallas , saying he was in danger where he was .
Berry spent the next months not far from Eichenwald ’s office , staying with cousins who , providentially , had experience ministering to troubled teens .
It was , both Berry and Eichenwald say , a period of deprivation for the teenager .
He was kept from a computer , a car , and a phone , marching through detox with little help but Eichenwald’s .
This was apparently as grueling an experience for Eichenwald as for Berry .
For Eichenwald ’s story , day and night , they reviewed Berry ’s many hard drives and downloaded data from the host computer and Neova , the company that handled credit - card processing for Justins Friends .
Eichenwald says Berry showed him the preview video for his Website .
It featured him and a kid named “ Taylor , ” side by side on a bed masturbating .
Taylor , Berry said , was just 14 years old .
The idea that another youngster was now sinking into a similar fate occupied Eichenwald ’s mind .
He worried he was legally culpable to do something but felt his options were few .
He could go to the authorities himself , but journalists are loath to be seen as tools of prosecutors .
At that very moment , his colleague Judith Miller sat in a federal prison for refusing to reveal a source to a special prosecutor .
Eichenwald had a better idea , he says , and convinced Larry Ingrassia , the top editor of the Times business section .
They would encourage Berry to go to the authorities , then chronicle the investigation from start to finish .
But they had a problem .
Berry could possibly be brought up on charges himself for recruiting , filming , and distributing the Taylor video , a serious federal crime .
Going to the authorities was especially troubling to Father Huddleston , who was now praying regularly with Berry .
“ The problem was that Justin ’s age put him in a place where he was too old to be considered a victim , and the adult programs would treat him like he was the perpetrator , ” Father Huddleston says .
Eichenwald called Steve Ryan , a former federal prosecutor who had been a source of his over the years , and Ryan agreed to help negotiate immunity for Berry in exchange for telling what he knew about the industry that Eichenwald was uncovering .
He arranged for Berry to be interviewed by the FBI in Washington , D.C. , on July 25 and 26 , 2005 .
Eichenwald accompanied his source to D.C.
( He says he was passing through on a family vacation , but Ryan says Eichenwald was on hand to greet Berry during breaks in his testimony and even offered information himself . )
But the FBI took some 50 days to confer immunity .
One day in July , Eichenwald learned that Taylor was planning to travel to Boston with Greg Mitchel .
Berry convinced him that Mitchel intended to molest the minor on the trip ( Taylor later told the FBI he was never touched by Mitchel , whom he said he loved “ like a father ” ) .
In a panic , Eichenwald called Ingrassia again , this time proposing an even more unorthodox intervention , to which he says the editor — and company lawyers — finally agreed .
Eichenwald initiated an IM conversation with Taylor , impersonating Berry , the youngster ’s mentor .
He told Taylor to stay clear of Mitchel and to end his porn career , and Taylor apparently agreed .
“ In part , I was Justin , ” Eichenwald tells me , “ because Justin was speaking in part through me . ”
When I press Eichenwald on how , as a journalist , he could justify this charade , he explodes in angry self - defense : “ Do you think I wanted to be the first journalist to go to jail for allowing a child to continue being raped because I did n’t want to violate some Star Trek–ian nonintervention rule that is n’t written down anywhere ? ”
Eichenwald says he made additional contacts with over a dozen other minors who he believed were producing sexualized images of themselves and persuaded them to stop as well .
“ It ’s the most noble thing I ’ve ever done , ” he says .
Right or wrong , these actions give an indication of the terrible weight Eichenwald felt was on his shoulders .
The world that came into focus for him was a dire one and drove him to peculiar extremes , he admits .
“ Somebody told me yesterday , ‘ You wanted to be the Catcher in the Rye . ’
And I realized that ’s absolutely true .
I wanted — I wanted to save them . ”
This hero complex drove him deeper into the rabbit hole .
He began to see pedophiles and their victims everywhere — in the shadows at the local water park or massing at a neighborhood hamburger stand .
His wife remembers him calling her from the garage in tears , unable to come in from his car .
He often woke up screaming in the middle of the night .
“ He ’s a casualty of war , ” says Ryan , who now represents Eichenwald as well .
“ Kurt saw things , or imagined things based on the life that these kids lived — he imagined their lives , through the facts that they gave him .
As a human being , he said , ‘ What would it be like to be this 13 - year - old boy who ’s raped ? ’ ”
“ His nerves were shattering , the pressure he was under was intense , ” agrees the reporter Diana B. Henriques , his closest confidante on the business desk .
“ I had certainly been urging him to get some help for quite some time . ”
Ingrassia , the editor , referred him to the Times health organization , which referred him to a therapist , Eichenwald says .
But he was in too deep to recognize the personal urgency .
He told friends his own health would have to wait .
As it happens , Eichenwald has had significant health problems since college , when he was diagnosed with grand - mal epilepsy .
Convulsive seizures came on in a mounting wave until he was waking from multiple seizures a week , unable to recall what he ’d been through .
It meant that his classmates knew a part of him that even he did n’t know — another persona , if you will .
They named that person “ Michael . ”
Anthropomorphizing his illness served a useful purpose all around .
“ They ’d say , ‘ Michael came for a visit last night , ’ ” Eichenwald tells me .
“ ‘ I think Michael ’s coming again . ’
For them it was a way of talking about it , but for me it was a way of thinking about it .
I did n’t want this thing to spill over into every aspect of my life . ”
“ In part , I was Justin , ” Kurt Eichenwald tells me , “ because Justin was speaking in part through me . ”
After a series of adjustments to his medication , Eichenwald reports , he had his last epileptic convulsion in 1991 .
He still suffers the less - obvious symptoms of partial - onset seizures , including frequent mini-seizures that most laypeople would n’t recognize as epilepsy .
“ If I have a regret , it ’s that I did n’t intervene more actively , ” Henriques says .
“ I think he knew he was under extraordinary duress , and he knew he needed to get some help dealing with it …
But the nature of our work is , you ’ll get the help when the story ’s done — you get the story done . ”
Eichenwald has always been extremely difficult to edit , but the weeks before publication were excruciating for everyone involved .
Eichenwald says the story was ultimately pushed through 44 drafts by eleven editors .
But he hammered back , screaming at his editors about children in danger and writing nuclear memos about his perceived mistreatment .
He flew to New York to demand that the piece finally run .
He cried often .
On the eve of publication , his story was assigned to yet another editor , and he put his foot down one last time .
That Friday , he submitted his resignation — not the first time or the last .
The piece appeared the following Monday .
In retrospect , Times colleagues say Eichenwald steamrolled the piece through a leery editorial process .
“ This was n’t people saying the story is three - quarters right and they do n’t give a shit about the rest , ” says Alex Berenson , a business reporter .
“ The difference is Kurt ’s record , which gave them the assurance he was telling the truth , and his personality , which made it so difficult to edit him . ”
The story , when published in December 2005 , took readers into a knotty and unknown world on a narrative roller coaster of lurid seductions , abandoned allegiances , and spiritual conversion .
Eichenwald not only delivered Berry into the hands of ministers , lawyers , and the FBI , but also was by his side as Berry ’s former associates were arrested one by one .
In the dramatic final scene , Berry sat in an undisclosed location , simultaneously conducting an IM conversation with Greg Mitchel and a phone call with the battalion of federal agents as they pulled into Mitchel ’s driveway in Virginia .
Berry asked Mitchel whether his housemate and her children were at home , then shouted , “ The kids are in the house ” to warn the agents .
He knew time was short .
According to Eichenwald , Berry had “ decided to confront the man who had hurt him for so long . ”
“ Do you even remember how many times you stuck your hand down my pants ? ”
Berry typed .
“ You molested me .
Do n’t apologize for what you ca n’t admit . ’’
Mitchel went silent at that moment — taken from the keyboard into federal custody , charged with operating a marketplace for underage porn as the mastermind of Justins Friends .
The article was an instant sensation .
Eichenwald , often with Berry at his side , made the rounds — Oprah , Larry King , Today .
Meanwhile , media critics assailed the piece , which could be read as vigilante journalism , Grisham meets To Catch a Predator with a made - for - Hollywood gloss .
He was referred to as “ Justin , ” never “ Mr. Berry , ” as Times style demands for adults , in a transparent bid to garner sympathy .
Gay men in particular were offended by some of the language used in the article — the word “ molest ” was used when describing Justin ’s interactions with men .
With women , it was simply “ sex . ”
To many , it seemed alarmist and overblown , an invitation to a kind of sexual witch hunt .
( Although Berry and Ryan , his lawyer , forwarded records on hundreds of subscribers to prosecutors in 44 states , so far only one indictment has reportedly followed . )
Deeper issues surfaced almost immediately .
The journalist Debbie Nathan ( who has written for New York Magazine ) became interested in Eichenwald ’s Internet - sex pieces while doing research about child - pornography laws , which she believes should be amended to allow journalists and other researchers to verify the government ’s impression of them .
She thought that Eichenwald , whose stories seemed to imply he ’d viewed lots of illegal sites , was given some sort of free pass by the Feds in part because he seemed so personally invested in promoting prosecution .
Yet in an e-mail exchange , he denied viewing the sites , except by accident , which he said made it legal under certain circumstances .
Her Salon article was strident and prosecutorial , steeped in incredulity about Eichenwald ’s methods .
“ Really ?
He did n’t know ?
Was n’t hunting ?
Please ! ”
Eichenwald and the Times deny that Eichenwald did anything illegal in reporting the story .
After the Nathan article , Eichenwald says he feared he might be arrested , or his children removed from his home based on her declaration that he illegally viewed underage porn .
He instructed his personal lawyer to sue her for $ 10 million and publicly declared , “ My wife and I have instructed our financial adviser to set aside $ 100,000 to finance the initial portions of this lawsuit . ”
So far he has n’t sued , but in a private , seething e-mail to her , he wrote , “ People like you are the maggots of journalism . ”
He later wrote a rambling , 2,600 - word letter to Romenesko , the media blog , putting all other journalists on notice .
“ If you choose to rely on this conflicted woman for your reports , you do so at your own legal peril . ”
Nathan has continued to battle Eichenwald with a fervor that mirrors his , writing about him for Counterpunch , and also in a short piece for this magazine ’s Website .
Nathan ’s pro bono lawyer , the former New York corporation counsel Victor Kovner , says the whole affair left him stunned .
“ He flipped , ” says Kovner .
“ It was ridiculous .
But it turns out there are problems of which she was totally unaware , some of which have come to light . ”
These issues have arisen from the prosecutions touched off by Eichenwald ’s pieces .
Records subpoenaed from PayPal and Internet service providers allege payments to Berry of several thousand dollars from Eichenwald ’s accounts , under the names “ Roy ” or “ Andrew McDonald . ”
Greg Mitchel ’s mother , Mary Robertson , an executive training consultant , wrote a letter about Eichenwald ’s payments to the Times .
Initially , Eichenwald elided the issue of whether he made payments to Berry .
In an e-mail to Ingrassia dated January 6 , 2006 , Eichenwald wrote , “ i do n’t want to start heading down the path of denying every crappy lie that greg mitchel says , ” he wrote .
Ultimately , Robertson encouraged her son to plead guilty to four counts of underage porn and hope for a lenient sentence ; he got 150 years in a federal prison , a sentence that seems more appropriate for a mass murderer .
Another of the cases the Berry story spurred involves Tim “ Casey ” Richards , a 23 - year - old Internet - porn star who faces 220 years in prison when he goes for sentencing in December .
Berry hired him to help run Justins Friends in return for a share of the profits .
“ The first thing he asked me to do was upload a preview video , ” says Richards over the phone from a Tennessee jail — the video featuring Berry and Taylor side by side .
Richards says he was specifically told Taylor was an adult .
A bio for Taylor also stated he was “ 18 , almost 19 . ”
Richards was convicted on eleven counts of child pornography , both involving his role in distributing the Taylor video and videos he had made of an ex-boyfriend when the boyfriend was underage .
“ There was more hysteria surrounding Tim ’s case than any other federal case I ’ve ever handled , ” says Peter Strianse , an attorney for Richards .
“ I do n’t know if the government was being driven by that article in the New York Times , but it ’s as if they felt they had to do something and make representations to the court that Tim was one of the largest purveyors of child pornography that they have ever encountered . ”
In preparation for his sentencing hearing , Richards , who maintains a blog partly dedicated to discrediting Eichenwald , was given access to read - only copies of Berry ’s and Mitchel ’s hard drives and computers used by the credit - card - processing company , whose owner was also arrested .
In court papers , he alleges that they found cash transfers , as well as e-mails from “ Andrew McDonald , ” using an AOL address of Eichenwald’s .
On June 6 , 2005 , “ Andrew McDonald ” wrote “ the lighting sucks , washed out .
still … worth 100 . ”
On June 7 , he wrote , “ I have other proposals for you that would get you even more money . ”
A day later , Berry received a $ 2,000 check , drawn off Eichenwald ’s Dallas bank .

Even more mystifying than the payouts were the allegations by a computer expert hired by the defense , who analyzed hard drives and records and presented evidence that , as Berry was preparing to return to the business , Eichenwald had high - level administrative access to JustinsFriends , which would have allowed him to closely monitor the site ’s business .
If true , the allegation suggests many things : reportorial zeal , or a kind of journalistic sting , perhaps ; not to mention personal motives that would be hard for anyone but Eichenwald to understand .
Eichenwald has yet to address this allegation specifically , but he ’s denied doing anything illegal in reporting the story .
His legal team moved to seal the records , but they were finally released last month .
“ All I can say is that there are troubling events and circumstances in advance of the launching of this site , ” Strianse tells me , “ involving whoever was involved in assisting Justin Berry , and then deciding to get Tim Richards involved for whatever technical support and assistance he can bring . ”
Ingrassia is reportedly furious over Eichenwald ’s failure to disclose the payments .
“ We trusted him to disclose all pertinent information , ” he says in a statement .
“ The subsequent disclosures about pseudonyms and payments have been disturbing , and we have said so .
Kurt ’s behavior , and particularly his failure to be candid with his editors , violated the paper ’s standards . ”
Though Eichenwald ’s lawyer denies he purchased photographs , Eichenwald has admitted to the $ 2,000 check .
While not denying that he made other payments , he says he has “ no independent memory ” of any of the PayPal expenses .
However , Theresa does remember the payments .
Eichenwald says that his epilepsy causes severe short - term - memory disruptions — it seems Michael , his anthropomorphized disease , had n’t been dispatched after all .
He produces a statement his neurologist has issued confirming the condition .
Financial transactions are particularly vexing for him , he says .
Eichenwald says he has covered for his lapses over the years with memory - enhancing techniques , like reading documents out loud or taking more detailed notes than others in his line of work .
But in personal matters — which he insists the Berry rescue had been during the time he was sending money — he is less meticulous and therefore more forgetful .
“ People think I ’m a scatterbrain , ” he says .
“ The number of coats that he ’s lost , ” adds his wife , sitting beside him on the family sofa one evening .
“ Or he comes home with one shoe . ”
“ One shoe in my suitcase , ” he corrects her quickly .
“ Let ’s not create images that are n’t necessary !
But the flip side is , look , people in our profession , there are people who are stupid .
There are people who are drunks .
There are people who are lazy .
I learned Enron ’s accounting .
People think I came into that knowing it .
I did n’t know what structured finance was — that ’s the basis of the entire Enron case . ”
In fact , during our many interviews , he showed an astonishing command of detail ( hundreds of dates , names , and events that animate the Berry story fill his head , as do chapter - and - verse citations from many other stories he ’s worked on ) .
Now Eichenwald is in a trap at least partly of his own making , and he sees danger everywhere .
“ I was told these people are relentless , that they never stop , ” he tells me in his Dallas office .
“ That they will torture you till you are destroyed or dead , ” he says .
“ I put my son at risk !
Because I chose to save somebody else ’s kid !
Do you have any idea how guilty I feel ? ”
He thought about installing a panic button in the house or buying a gun .
Instead , he got a second dog .
“ A three - legged dog was not enough protection , ” he confided a few days ago .
“ My children are scared all the time , because they see me falling apart .
My wife holds together .
But that does n’t keep her from sobbing in the middle of the night , ‘ I wish to God we ’d let him die . ’ ”
For legal reasons , Justin Berry ’s lawyer has instructed him to break off all communication with Eichenwald until after Richards is sentenced .
The young man today attends college , runs a small Web - development business , and misses the man he credits with turning his life around .
“ He ’s a wonderful guy , and seeing him get criticized makes me sick to my stomach , ” Berry says .
But Eichenwald , for whatever complex reasons , is stuck in the world Berry escaped — caught in the gravity of youthful sexuality , which distorts everything it touches .
“ I did n’t do this for a news story .
I did n’t do this to get people arrested .
I did this because I thought this person was desperate …
And now I sit here , desperate .
And I do n’t know how to get out of it . ”
PARIS , Aug. 27 — In his first major foreign policy speech as president , Nicolas Sarkozy of France said Monday that Iran could be attacked militarily if it did not live up to its international obligations to curb its nuclear program .
Addressing France ’s ambassadorial corps , Mr. Sarkozy stressed that such an outcome would be a disaster .
He did not say France would ever participate in military action against Iran or even tacitly support such an approach .
But the mere fact that he raised the specter of the use of force is likely to be perceived both by Iran as a warning of the consequences if it continues its course of action , and by the Bush administration as acceptance of its line that no option , including the use of force , can be excluded .
Mr. Sarkozy praised the current diplomatic initiative by the world ’s powers , a two - pronged approach that threatens tougher United Nations - mandated sanctions if Iran does not stop enriching uranium for possible use in a nuclear weapon , but holds out the possibility of incentives if Iran complies .
A team of scientists melted five samples of ice from Antarctica in hopes of reviving the oldest known frozen bacteria — millions of years older than any previously brought to life .
And , in fact , the bacteria , ranging in age from 100,000 to a stunning 8 million years old , came groaning back in the culture flask .
The younger the bacteria , the more quickly the resurrection occurred .
It took the younger bacteria just seven days to reproduce ; the oldest samples took up to 10 times as long .
The finding could have a profound effect on microbial life .
As Antarctic ice melts , the bacteria frozen inside may revive and be taken up by microbes in the ocean , says Paul Falkowski , a Rutgers University biologist who directed the bacteria project .
“ We are watching gene transfer from land into the ocean , introducing something completely different from the last millions of years , ” Falkowski says .
He points out that humans , through global warming , are subtly bringing about a new phase of evolution .
While the evolution probably wo n’t have a direct effect on humans , Falkowski believes that it could lead to a change in this minuscule variety of marine life .
It is important that genomes in the ocean be recorded as they are now , Falkowski says , because the coming change could happen quickly .
“ We are potentially on the cusp of a global revolutionary experiment in the microbial world , ” he says .
“ These evolutionary changes could be visible 50 to 100 years from now , showing us new genomes of marine organisms . ”

Molecular machines – tiny machines made of molecules that do mechanical work – are usually thought to operate in a state of non-equilibrium .
This makes sense , considering that macro-sized machines operate at non-equilibrium , requiring an additional force to move .
On the other hand , equilibrium implies that forces cancel each other out , resulting in an unchanging system , often at rest .
But R. Dean Astumian , a Physics Professor at the University of Maine , has recently proposed a concept in which molecular machines can operate arbitrarily close to chemical equilibrium at every instant of the cycle , and still perform work at the rate of several micrometers per second against piconewton loads .
The study , “ Adiabatic operation of a molecular machine , ” is published in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ The main significance is conceptual – it changes the way we think about molecular motors , ” Astumian told PhysOrg.com .
“ Much emphasis has been put on the ‘ non-equilibrium ’ aspects of the system , but in fact this is not really important .
The motion of the rings here arises due to a combination of topology that break spatial symmetry , and the slow external modulation that breaks time symmetry .
It is also important to recognize that , in the molecular world , we can truly have motors that operate with nearly 100 % efficiency . ”
Astumian ’s example of such a molecular machine is a three - ring “ catenane ” structure that serves as a rotating motor .
The catenane , about 3 nanometers in diameter , consists of one large ring with two smaller rings linked to the large ring , like rings on a keychain .
Three binding stations on the large ring provide locations where the two small rings can bind , depending on the interaction energy between ring and station .
Astumian gets the small rings to move clockwise from station to station around the large ring , a movement that results in mechanical cycling .
Further , he achieves this movement without any heat gain or heat loss and without a change of entropy , but simply by thermal noise due to Brownian motion .
This type of “ adiabatic ” system is arbitrarily close to equilibrium at every point of the cycle .
The key to making the small rings move from station to station is by periodically modulating the interaction energy .
The rings will bind to the station that requires the lowest interaction energy .
This modulation must be done slowly enough not to generate heat , but at a sufficient rate to produce significant work .
Slowly modulating the energy of a single molecule is challenging , and Astumian explains that it is nearly impossible to do with chemical systems .
However , the net interaction energy for many molecules can be slowly modulated by very slow titrations of pH and redox potential .
For example , a condition that is strongly acidic and strongly reducing corresponds with high interaction energy at station 2 .
Therefore , the two rings will bind at stations 1 and 3 .
Then , by titrating with oxidant to reach a strongly oxidizing and strongly basic condition , the energy at station 1 is highest .
So the rings now occupy stations 2 and 3 .
Astumian explains that the rings could switch to this state by either the ring at station 1 moving clockwise to bind at station 2 , or the ring at station 3 moving counter - clockwise to bind at station 2 .
However , after more modulations , the majority ( about 75 % ) of the movements will be clockwise due to the changing energy levels at different stations .
By figuring this probability , Astumian concludes that , every time the small rings move around the large ring , the system will complete one - half of a mechanical rotation .
He also mentions that there might be more creative architectures where counter - clockwise motions do n’t undo the clockwise motions .
He likens this mechanism to a ratcheting screwdriver used to drive a screw .
When the ratchet turns counter - clockwise to reset itself , it releases so that it does n’t undo the forward turn of the screw .
Although a molecular machine would use thermal noise instead of external torque , the concept is similar .
In the molecular machine , one of the small rings could be fixed to prevent counterclockwise motion .
“ I would say that the biggest challenge is to arrange the molecules on a surface so that the movement can be used to do work on the outside world , ” Astumian said .
He added that the chemical structures have already been synthesized by David Leigh at the University of Edinburgh , as the next step in the development of the machines .
Astumian also explains that operating this system requires a fine balance between modulating slowly enough so that the system is in chemical and mechanical equilibrium at every instant , but rapidly enough to perform substantial work .
While biomolecular motors are often described in “ violent ” terms , he hopes that this “ kindler , gentler ” description may be more appropriate for designing more efficient molecular machines .
“ I plan to extend the theory to explain the mechanism of biological motors , ” Astumian said .
“ While they doubtless do not operate exactly by the mechanism described for the three - ring catenane , I think the flavor of how they operate is much better characterized by this near - equilibrium description than by various biological models involving cars , judo throws , and steam engines . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
During the 1960 presidential election , Theodore Sorensen helped then - Sen .
John F. Kennedy draft a speech addressing Kennedy 's Catholicism and the separation between church and state .
At the time , many questioned whether Kennedy , who would go on to become the nation 's first Roman Catholic president , would be influenced by the Catholic church .
Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedy 's 1960 speech on Catholicism .
Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider , Sorensen discussed Kennedy 's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , who would be the first Mormon in the White House if he is elected .
Question : Did Kennedy 's 1960 speech win him the presidency ?
Sorensen :
Well , he obviously did n't lose it , nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-Catholicism .
The hate mail still poured into his office .
The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail , and , indeed , on Election Day .
According to a University of Michigan survey , more people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason .
Nevertheless , that speech , which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast , certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-Catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people .
Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech »
Q. Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday ?
Sorensen : No. Mr. Romney 's position on many of the issues are very different than JFK's .
JFK wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state .
He believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president , and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all .
So , Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have .
Q. Romney seemed to differ quite strongly with Kennedy on the privacy of religion , did n't he ?
Sorensen : Yes , he did .
In fact , Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Jesus Christ .
Kennedy said , as you noted , his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the American people .
Q. Romney made the statement " freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom . "
Do you think Kennedy would have agreed with that ?
Sorensen : I do n't think anyone would disagree strongly with that .
There were some lines in the Romney speech that echoed the Kennedy speech .
As an old speechwriter , I would congratulate Mr. Romney .
It was a pretty good speech .
I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch .
Q. Romney discussed his views of Jesus Christ , something that Kennedy avoided .
Why did Kennedy avoid discussing his religious views ?
Sorensen : Because [ Kennedy ] began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with God or Jesus Christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion .
He did not think the election should be based on -- as he said , it 's not what kind of church I believe in , the question is what kind of country do I believe in .
Q. Kennedy 's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful .
Do you think Romney 's speech is likely to be viewed as a success ?
Sorensen : I assume so .
I do n't think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion .
Just as I do n't think Senator [ Barack ]
Obama should be denied because of his race .
Or that Mrs. [ Hillary ]
Clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender .
This country is in deep , serious trouble , and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion , race , or gender .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil rose on Monday on expectations OPEC will maintain output levels and the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again to help stimulate the economy of the world ’s top energy consumer .
A resident looks at the price of gasoline as she fuels up her car at a gas station in South Beach , Miami , January 2 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Carlos Barria
U.S. crude settled up 28 cents at $ 90.99 a barrel , rebounding strongly off the session low of $ 88.78 .
London Brent crude rose 48 cents to $ 91.38 a barrel .
Crude edged higher alongside U.S. stocks as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would slash interest rates for the second time in a little more than a week to prevent the housing slump from tipping the economy into a recession .
Oil prices fell early after the U.S. government reported that new single - family home sales tumbled in December to the lowest rate in nearly 13 years .
Worries that a U.S. recession could hit oil - demand growth have helped deflate crude from record peaks over $ 100 in early January .
“ With that weak ( housing ) number the Fed might be more inclined toward a half - point rate cut in addition to the three quarter point last week , which will further weaken the dollar and probably prop up the economy a bit , both of which will be bullish factors for the oil market , ” said Rob Kurzatkowski , futures analyst with options Xpress .
“ I think the oil traders are a little bit skeptical about the eoncomic conditions , and OPEC is always a wild card later on this week when they meet . ”
Many experts expect OPEC will maintain output levels when it meets on Friday in Vienna despite consumer nation calls for more oil to bring down prices .
Nigeria ’s oil minister on Monday said prices were not being influenced by supply and demand , echoing recent comments from other OPEC ministers but adding he was concerned about the effect of high prices on consumption .
ECONOMIC WOES
The housing report added to concerns about the health of the world economy which have weighed on oil prices by dimming the outlook for fuel demand .
Oil fell sharply early last week as growing concern over the U.S. economy rattled global equity markets , but rebounded on Thursday as U.S. legislators and the White House hammered out a $ 150 billion stimulus plan .
Still , wider economic worries have sent some crude oil speculators to seek out safer investments .
“ I think perhaps ( funds ) are trying to find safer bets with maybe the grains or some of the soft commodities which have underperformed the metals and petroleum markets , ” said Kurzatkowski .
Regulator data on Friday showed NYMEX crude oil speculators slashed their bets on rising prices in the week to January 22 to their lowest since mid-December .
“ It shows the large speculative funds reducing aggressively their net length exposure on futures through a combination of long liquidation and fresh short positions , ” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix .
A Reuters poll of analysts ahead of weekly U.S. government inventory data forecast a 2.1 - million - barrel rise in crude stocks , a 1.9 - million - barrel draw in distillate inventories and a 2 - million - barrel build in gasoline stockpiles .
LAKE LANIER , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue declared a water supply emergency in north Georgia on Saturday as its water resources dwindled to a dangerously low level after months of drought .
But an Army Corps of Engineers official denied there is a water crisis .
Perdue , who signed an executive order Saturday , asked for President Bush 's help in easing regulations that require the state to send water downstream to Alabama and Florida .
He also asked the president to declare 85 counties as federal disaster areas .
Perdue blasted what he called the " silly rules " governing the water supplies , noting that even if the state got replenishing rains , it could not by law conserve those , but must release 3.2 billion gallons a day downstream .
" The actions of the Corps of Engineers and Fish and Wildlife Service are not only irresponsible , I believe they 're downright dangerous and Georgia cannot stand for this negligence , " Perdue said .
The Army Corps of Engineers , however , presented a different assessment .
If there were nine months without rain , water supplies still would be adequate , said Maj.
Daren Payne , the Army Corps ' deputy commander for the Mobile , Alabama , District .
The corps sent a letter to Perdue assessing the situation and pointing out that they are " not going to run out [ of water ] any time soon , " Payne said .
The corps -- under an agreement reached in the 1980s with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the state and downstream users -- releases 5,000 feet of water per second from the dam between Lake Lanier and the Chattahoochee River .
The figure was based on a Florida hydroelectric power plant 's needs , as well as concern for endangered species in the river , including mussels and sturgeon .
On Friday , Georgia filed a motion seeking to require the Army Corps of Engineers to restrict water flows from the lake and other north Georgia reservoirs .
Watch Gov. Perdue blast a " disaster of federal bureaucracy " »
The corps said it needs 120 days to review its water policies , according to Perdue .
The Bush administration has been in contact with the Georgia congressional delegation on the matter , the White House said Saturday afternoon
" We have already begun drafting interim rules to ... address the endangered species requirements , and the Army Corps has started the process of revising the operations manual for the river basin , " said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
Months of drought
Rainfall in north Georgia , which includes the Atlanta metropolitan area , is far below normal for this time of year .
That was evident as Perdue addressed reporters on packed red clay on the shore of Lake Lanier -- the main water source for the Atlanta area's 5 million residents .
Normally , he'd be standing in water , but levels have dropped to historically low levels .
The drought is hurting businesses and scaring away tourists .
Efforts are under way to try to reduce the flow from Lake Lanier by looking into requirements for endangered species and demands downstream for power plants and industries , Payne said .
A new biological review of endangered species needs will end in November and will be examined by officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to see if water requirements can be reduced , he added .
" The corps is not opposed to reducing the flow , if it can do it legally , " Payne said .
Georgia , Alabama and Florida have been wrangling over how to allocate water from the Chattahoochee watershed for years as metro Atlanta 's population has doubled since 1980 .
" No one is sacrificing , no one is sharing the pain like the people in north Georgia are , " Perdue said , noting there are no water restrictions in Florida or southern Alabama .
Georgia has imposed a mandatory ban on outdoor water use by homeowners in the region , but Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle warned this is a situation " we can not conserve our way out of . "
Meanwhile , individual counties are monitoring illegal water use .
In Douglas County , violators will have their water supply turned off and may have to pay up to $ 1,000 to get it turned back on .
Cobb County , just north of Atlanta , is doling out fines of up to $ 500 for repeat offenders .

日本のIT業界は救いようがない。絶望的としか言いようがない。
IT業界不人気なんて、この業界に重くのしかかる決して晴れることのない暗雲の氷山の一角に過ぎない。はてなの匿名ダイアリーにもどうせ理系出身者なんていらねえんだよ。なんて書かれていたけど、これが現実なのだよ、学生諸君。
ちょっと補足しておくけど、ここでIT業界っていうのは、SIerのことだ。お客さんの要件をヒアリングして、その要求に沿ったシステムを受託開発するっていうビジネスのことを指している。
ぼくもその昔、その世界のループに組み込まれていた。そして華麗なるコミュニケーション能力とやらをいかんなく発揮し、場の空気を読み、生意気なぐらいのチャレンジ精神で、それなりに仕事のできるよい子だったようだ。
いや、正直に言うよ。正直に言うとだね、結構楽しかった。
だって、考えてみてごらん。お客さんのところに出向いて行って、その業界のことをじっくり観察・勉強して、業務課題を理解し、それをえぐり出してあげると、「あぁこの人はわかってるんだな」と思ってもらえる。「若いのに、社会やビジネスの構造がよく見えているんだな」なんて風に思ってもらえる。相手がそういう風に認めてくれているのを肌で感じるんだよ。
そしてさらに、それを実際に技術的な次元に落とし込んで、ソフトウェアという形にして作り上げて「ほら」と見せてあげたら、今度は「この人は、業務を知ってるだけじゃなくて、それを実際に形にすることができる技術まで持ってるんだ」っていうリスペクトまで得ることができる。
そしたら、そのお客さんはぼくのファンになってくれるわけだ。次回からは、直々にご指名が入るようになってきて、でもゴメンなさい、もう今は他の仕事で忙しくて手一杯なんです、ってお断りしなきゃいけないサイクルに入ってくる。予定表はいつも一杯で、昼間は分刻みでアポをやりくりしながら都内をぐるぐる回って、夜に帰社してToDoリストを片っ端からやっつけていく、そんな日々が延々と続いていく。
そして、徹夜に徹夜を重ねたあとにカットオーバーした瞬間の、朦朧としていく意識とともに自分の体から重力の作用がふっと立ち消えていくような、えもいわれぬ高揚感。たとえそれが半年程度のプロジェクトでも、それが終わる頃にはお客さんとはもうまるでオマハ・ビーチの死闘をくぐり抜けた戦友のような知己となっている。
この、やるべきと信じることをカチッ、カチッと片付けていく感覚、そしてその結果として他人から認定してもらえることの喜びが、幸せでないわけがない。
忙しくて忙しくて週に80時間以上働くような生活を何年もしていたけど、全然苦じゃなかったね。
それでもなお、いや、だからこそ、日本のIT業界は救いようがない。
この局所的にみれば顧客満足を見事に達成するごくまっとうなストレス→ドーパミン→ストレス→・・・のサイクルが、心の奥底にしまわれた疑念の声をより一層固く閉ざすことになっていた。まるで、後ろめたい気持ちを感じながらも依存性を断ち切れない麻薬のように。
そんな生活をしていたある日、ひと仕事終えてスターバックスでコーヒーを読みながらしっぽりウェブを泳いでいたら、なんだか得体の知れない不安感のようなものにおそわれたことを思い出す。このとき、とうとう心の底で長らく封じられていた声が聞こえてきてしまったのだった。
コンピュータの性能はこの40年で1億倍になった。当時10億円したメインフレームと同じ計算力を現在なら10円で入手できる。かつては巨大なスーパーコンピュータが設置されている電算室の前にエリートたちが列を作って順番待ちしていたのに、今ではその何万倍もの性能の端末を女子高生たちがポケットに入れて持ち歩いている。
こんな圧倒的なイノベーションが現在進行形で起きている時代にせっかく生きていながら、自分のやっていることのなんとちっぽけなことか。そういう焦燥感を覚えた。
もともと、そういう圧倒的な技術の提供者になりたくてこの世界に来たはずじゃなかったのか。前世紀末、日本が第１次ネットバブルの熱に浮かされていた頃、どうしてもテクノロジーへのこだわりが捨てられず、当時から未来はネットの側にあると感じつつも、どうしてもネットベンチャーで働くという選択肢をとれなかった自分は、こんなことを続けるためにソフトウェアの世界にとどまる決意をしたんだったっけ？
受託開発の世界のどこにイノベーションがあるのだろう？
そういう疑問が堰を切ったようにあふれてきて、そして答えはどこにもなかった。文字通り、どこにもなかった。
情報という財の新しさは、ほぼ限界費用ゼロで劣化なく無限に複製できるということだ。それは理論的にはシャノンが信号を量子化する前から正しいことが知られていたが、コンピュータとインターネットの急激な普及はとうとうそれを現実のものとした。現代は新聞、テレビ、音楽、映画、本などの情報財に囲まれて暮らす豊かな時代であり、そしていまやそれらのコンテンツ産業は情報技術がもたらす価格低下圧力との仁義なき戦いを続けている。主流対主流のガチンコの戦いだ。
一時ロングテールという言葉がもてはやされたが、その頃にはとっくにアテンションのほうが稀少資源だった。情報は加速度的かつ累積的に供給が増えているが、人々が情報を消費する時間は定数で、死蔵される情報ばかりが増えていく。この定理は逆も真なりで、参入に巨額の資本を必要としない情報産業では超優秀な技術者のアテンション（集中力）だけが稀少資源で、それ以外の何物もない。その資源を使ってどれだけレバレッジの効く情報財を生み出せるかが唯一無二の戦略であるはずだ。
であるのに、受託開発の世界には、そういったエキサイティングな革命の歴史とはどこにも接点がない。
生産された財は、最も低水準なサービス財と同様、たった一人の顧客に届けられる。以上おわり。
情報財に固有の、限界費用ゼロで複製できる性質が活かされる余地はまるでない。情報財の競争は人々のアテンションを奪うためにどんどん激化していて、最先端ではもはや「対価は無料に限りなく近いもの」という次元で極限まで「広く薄く」のモデルでバトルが繰り広げられている。今の時代、無料で利用できるサービスが一番クオリティが高いというのは偶然じゃない。これは情報財というものの本質が見えていれば、競争原理が正常に機能した結果だということがよくわかる。それなのに、受託開発の世界の人たちには、そんな土俵が存在することすら見えていない。たった一人の顧客に届ける財なんて、サイエンス的にも、ケーザイ学的にも、古き良き製造業未満の存在じゃないか。
とはいえ、ぼくは、そんなところで働いている人たちに、あまり強いことも言えない。
アメリカなら、ソフトウェアの世界で本来の意味でモノ作りに携われる仕事がたくさんある。グーグルとかマイクロソフトとか、メジャーどころを足し上げていくだけでも10万人以上の雇用吸収力があるから、ごく平凡なスキルのプログラマでも大企業でそういった仕事に就く機会がある。それなりにいい給料で、ステータスもあって、定時に帰るという満足な生活を営むことができる。そういう意味では、外国人労働者との競争とかレイオフみたいな要素もあるけど、アメリカ人にとってのソフトウェアエンジニアという職業は日本に比べたらずいぶん楽できているのは間違いない。
でも、日本にはそういうソフトウェア・プロダクトを製造する会社、ないんだよ、ほんとに。ちょっと前までは日本のネット業界で技術系のベンチャーなんてほとんど皆無に等しかったし、今でもそれほど状況が大きく変わったわけじゃない。
だから、じゃぁどこに転職すればいいの？と聞かれたら、答えに窮してしまう。最も技術的にエッジっぽいベンチャーを全部かき集めても、日本でトップクラスの技術者すら吸収しきれるキャパはない。選択肢がないんだよ。
だから、あんな生産性の低い、たぶん全産業の中でももっとも生産性が低い部類の、ああいう仕事にとどまることを余儀なくされているのだろう。
しかし、本来ならそんな生産性の低い企業は市場メカニズムによって退場させられるはずなのだけど、なぜか日本ではそういうことが起きない。情報大航海プロジェクトみたいなのに代表されるトンデモなバラマキ政策などで植物状態にもかかわらず酸素だけは供給されているから、もうそろそろ死なせてあげるべき企業が死ねてないのだ。みじめとしか言いようがない。
日本のSI業界の過酷な労働条件を改善したければ、やるべきことは労基法の改正とかじゃなくて、市場メカニズムを正しく機能させることだ。日本のIT業界を発展させたければ、援助交際をやめて何もしないことだ。
その結果、そもそも本質的には供給過剰だった多くのSI企業は倒産するか併合され、おそらく数社の大手ブランドと超小規模なブティックに収束することになるだろう。そして一時的には今以上に「見かけ上のサービス供給不足」が起きるが、ユーザ企業はむしろ「無きゃ無いで、割と平気だったのね」という真実に気付かされるだろう。
今までのユーザ企業は実質どうでもいいところまで細かくオーダーメイドで作り込むことを要求しすぎていた。そのくせ、結局ユーザには不評で使われないシステムが量産されていたのだから笑い事ではない。人間の価値観は努力や根性では変わらないから、それが無駄だと気付かせるには外的要因しかない。受託開発サービスの絶対供給量が減れば、そんな無理も言ってられなくなって無駄のない落としどころで需給均衡するだろう。さらにはパッケージを使うべしという駆動力にもなり、より生産性の高いソフトウェア・パッケージやSaaSのような国際競争力の高いビジネスモデルの需要を創出する効果もある。そこへきて先のSI企業の整理統合ではじき出された優秀な人材が本来の実力を発揮して活躍できる新たな機会が登場するというわけだ。おいしい人材を一時的に外資に持って行かれるかも知れないが、低い生産性の企業に優秀な人材を張りつけていることの大罪を思えば、人材に流動性をもたらす触媒になってくれるならむしろ大歓迎だ。
ま、そんなわけで、世の中が目まぐるしく動いているのに自分は・・・という焦りを覚えている心ある技術者は、全力で受託開発の会社から逃げ出す準備を整えたほうがいい。とても残念なことだけど、そこには未来は絶対にないよ、とハッキリと言っておくのが、ぼくにとっての精一杯の誠意だ。
♪ Yen Town Band / Swallowtail Butterfly 〜あいのうた〜
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - No. 2 U.S. beermaker SABMiller 's SAB.L move to combine American operations with No. 3 Molson Coors TAP.N will likely be approved even though it will increase market concentration , antitrust experts said .
The approval may be a reflection of how much easier it has become for companies to merge under the Bush administration , antitrust lawyers said .
“ I would frankly expect that they will ( get approval ) , in part because it ’s the Department of Justice , ” said Ben Sharp of Perkins Coie LLP , reflecting a view among some experts that the department challenges few mergers .
“ I doubt very much that it would have got approval under the Clinton administration , ” Sharp said .
Michael Keeley of Axinn , Veltrop & Harkrider , LLP agreed : “ I ’d be stunned if they did anything to stop this deal . ”
Anheuser - Busch BUD.N , which brews Budweiser , Busch and Michelob , is the longtime U.S. market leader with just under half of all U.S. beer sales .
Miller holds 18.7 percent of the market and Coors 11 percent , according to Michael Scherer , who teaches management at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government .
The rest of the market is shared by imports and microbrewed beers .
The proposed merger would give Anheuser - Busch and the new MillerCoors joint venture control over nearly 80 percent of the U.S. beer market .
According to the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index used by antitrust experts , the U.S. beer market is already concentrated and the joint venture would push the index up by more than 300 points .
Deals that raise the index by more than 100 points in concentrated markets “ presumptively raise antitrust concerns , ” according to the Justice Department ’s merger guidelines .
“ This is one that clearly violates the anti-merger guidelines , ” said Scherer , who follows the beer industry .
“ So it seems to me that the government should take a hard look at it . ”
IMPACT ON JOE SIX - PACK ?
The joint venture , announced in October , would have annual sales of $ 6.6 billion .
Ownership would be split with each company holding a 50 percent voting interest , but the larger SABMiller would take a 58 percent economic interest compared to Molson Coors ’ 42 percent .
The deal could hurt Pabst Brewing Co , which has 3.38 percent of the U.S. beer market , since Miller brews most of Pabst ’s beer and could opt to shut down that plant , said Scherer .
“ This could put them in a very squeezed position , ” he said .
Despite a second request for information from the U.S. Justice Department , both companies say they expect to win approval and close the deal by mid-2008 .
Miller and Coors have argued that the deal will be good for the average American beer drinker since it will lead to some $ 500 million in savings , mostly in administrative costs .
But some antitrust experts were skeptical .
“ The claimed efficiencies at transaction are seldom achieved , ” said Sharp .
And Miller and Coors may use their combined clout with wholesalers to squeeze competitors , meaning that some smaller brewers could lose their distributors .
Anheuser - Busch ’s wholesalers handle only their beers in most markets , except for a the occasional import .
Miller and Coors sometimes share wholesalers .
“ It is virtually certain that Miller and Coors will take some of the wholesalers that they had separately and drop one of them , ” Scherer said in a telephone interview .
“ If the wholesaler just shuts down , then you have a lessening of competition at the wholesale stage . ”
It also means that smaller brewers , which depend on a wholesaler dropped by MillerCoors , could lose access to their market .
Scherer argued that the money saved by the MillerCoors joint venture would not lead to lower bar bills .
“ If there ’s no increase ( in price ) , it means that Joe Shareholder gets higher dividends because Miller and Coors have reduced their costs , ” he said .
“ For Joe Sixpack , my first impression is that it may not have much impact on price , ” Scherer said .
@redman042 :
he 'll have the last laugh when he makes about 300 G's off this sale .
This collection is not going to fetch 300 grand , or even a third that .
It reminds me of collecting baseball cards as a kid .
Sure , there is the occasional card that might be worth something , but as a collection , they ultimately are not worth much at all .
The thought of a collection being ' valuable ' is just a way we justify to ourselves holding on to something that has very little value compared to what we originally paid .
That said , I applaud this person waking up one day and realizing that he has a ton of junk filling his house and it is time to move on .
Life is too short for stuff like this .
Being tracked by anti-piracy organizations and receiving infringement notices on file - sharing networks is becoming more common .
A security project manager has just released a short video showing how it 's done .
A common question from BitTorrent users is how anti-p2p outfits trace and trace file - sharers in order to send infringement notices .
We ’ve reported on one technique in the past and now , thanks to Dan Morrill , a Security Project Manager with VMC Consulting in Redmond Washington , we have a short video illustrating another basic technique which is easy to understand .
Dan ’s example involves him downloading a large file with the popular Azureus client , while giving a commentary on the various types of information offered by the client , a brief overview of how BitTorrent works , how it ’s possible to be tracked and how the gathered information could be processed .
He also touches on anonymity and the use of blocklists .
A popular piece of IP blocking software is Peerguardian , which can be downloaded at Phoenix Labs , with the blocklists available from Bluetack .
Users seeking anonymity can achieve this by using a free proxy server but in reality , most do n’t offer performance anywhere near good enough for BitTorrent .
VPN services such as VPNTunnel are n’t free but they ’re reliable and generally protect users from the techniques shown in the video .
Just one criticism ;
Dan states towards the end of the video that if you do n’t use blocklists you are almost guaranteed to be ‘ nabbed ’ .
The majority of people do n’t use blocklists and the majority of those are not getting ‘ nabbed ’ .
Indeed , most of the cases we hear of from the United States are people who do n’t use BitTorrent at all .
On the other hand , blocklists mostly offer pseudo - security , since there ’s no guarantee that you are not tracked while using them .

Every afternoon in CNN's " Situation Room , " anchored by milquetoast non-talent Wolf Blitzer , Blitzer shares a few short exchanges with self - styled curmudgeon , Jack Cafferty .
Â Â
Cafferty 's 90 - second segments , whored to viewers as " The Cafferty File , " broadcast the purposely craggy Cafferty from CNN in New York to Blitzer 's Situation Room in Washington , DC .
Â Â Cafferty , disguised as a wisecracking ' 50s - '60s style newsman , plays the vexed moralistic foil to Blitzer 's dispassionate bore . Â
It 's Cafferty 's loose cannon " Lucy " meets Blitzer 's timid " Ethel Mertz . "
Â
Those silly girls are at it yet again !
Astoundingly , there are plenty of impressionable viewers who actually buy Blitzer as a journalist and Cafferty 's comments as profound .
Â
Neither case is true .
But what can one expect ?
Â
WithÂ the current crop of on - air newspeople at a quality low , and the bar for meritorious journalism buried far below ground , Situation Room viewersÂ perceive Cafferty 's commentaries as worthwhile .
Â
They are often too youngÂ to remember the substantive journalists of old - like Murrow and Huntley - who Cafferty attempts to evoke .
Â
But Cafferty 's commentaries fall short of insightful .
Â
They 're shallow .
Â Â They pander to popular sentiment .
Â Â
They 're notÂ instructional , Â innovative or enlightening .
Â Â
Unlike Keith Olberman 's " Special Comments , " packed - full of magical metaphors , dazzling syntax , brilliant analogies , historical references and more , Cafferty 's commentaries are unremarkable odes to the obvious .
Â
They 're not guided by history , facts , or infused by revelation .
Â
They 're the pedestrian rants of a minor player who can parrot pre-conceived lore .
Â Â
To be fair , Cafferty 's diatribes often correctly criticize the ills of the Bush administration .
Â
But honestly , what THINKING inhabitant of this planet can't correctly criticize the ills of the Bush administration ?
Â Â The only reason Cafferty enjoys even a modicum of popularity is that he echoes the anger of his viewers .
Â He'sÂ not a cynic . Â
He 's a mimic .
Â Â
One would think , given Cafferty 's simple task of bemoaning the obvious , that he'd use his 90 - second spots to make logical statements and draw logical conclusions .
Â
But he fails at even that .
Â Â
Yesterday was a prime example of Cafferty mischaracterizing a critically important issue when he criticized Presidential candidate John Edwards ' pursuit of electoral equality . Â
In a moronic , poorly constructed argument , Cafferty Â attacked John Edwards for his decision toÂ PUBLICLY FUND his Presidential campaign .
Â
Then to cement his flawed logic , Cafferty attacked the dangers of big money in PRIVATELY FUNDED campaigns .
Â Â
HUH ??!!Â
If you 're as confused as I am by this Cafferty double - speak , here 's the direct transcript of Cafferty 's diatribe , accompanied by the youtube video of the same : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoqb0GpS90.Â
Â Â
See if you can figure out why Cafferty attacks Edwards forÂ NOTÂ misusing the system that Cafferty slams for misuse .
" The Cafferty Fool - ( errr " File " ) Â - September 28 , 2007 :
" So , here we go . Â
This is called a flip flop .
Â
Democratic hopeful John Edwards has now changed his tune on campaign financing and decided that he 'll accept public money for his campaign .
Â Â You 'll recall earlier this year Edwards said he would not do this because his fellow contenders would likely raise large amounts of private money and he would have to do the same in order to stay competitive .
Â
Now he has flip - flopped on that .
Â Â
Edwards says he changed his mind because of the influence special interests have in political races .
Â Baloney .
Â
He 's challenging both Clinton and Obama to do the same and they wo n't , and here 's why .
Â
They have raised more than double the amount of money that Edwards has raised in the first six months of this year and would n't you know Edwards is trailing both Obama and Clinton in the polls .
Â
It is probably not a coincidence that the two candidates that have raised by far the most money are by far the frontrunners in almost all of the polls - that 's Obama and Clinton .
Â Â
[ To viewers ]
So the question we 're asking this hour is what 's wrong with our campaign finance laws ?
Â Â
The answer is quite a lot , but I 'm interested in some of the specific ideas you have to fix it ... Â Â
[ To Blitzer ]
You know these campaigns are becoming more expensive every time we have one , Wolf , and until something is done , nothing is going to change this and it just means that the influence of the big money crowd continues to grow in Washington , DC and the influence of folks like you and me - well that 's bupkis . "
Someone please tell me - if Cafferty decries the influence of " the big money crowd " in private campaign financing , why does heÂ call John Edwards ' decision to publicly finance aÂ flip - flop ?
Â Â Instead , why does n't Cafferty take on Clinton and Obama for not using public financing , but instead using their private donations to try to buy the election ?
Â Â Â
Yes , it 's true that Clinton and Obama have raised double the money of Edwards .
Â
It 's also true that Edwards has every right to use the legal methods available to him to remain a viable candidate .
Â
Why does Cafferty assail Edwards for trying to level the playing field and removing the " For Sale " sign from the White House ?
Â Â
And why must Cafferty resort toÂ Rovian pejoratives likeÂ flip - flop ?
Â
In his miniscule 4 to 5 minutes on camera , is n't Cafferty capable of at least one original axiom per day ?
Over the past several months there has been a movement afoot by some duped Cafferty viewers to get Mr. Cafferty his own show .
Â Â
This would be difficult if logic , reason and originality were prerequisites for an anchor .
Â
But with journalistic standards at an all time low , thanks to Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to name just a few , I suppose it's not that outlandish for Mr. Cafferty to have his own show .
Â
Fact is , he'd have lots of abusive material to use .
Â
There are countless Republican attack smears on hand at CNN to berate honorable people for doing honorable things .

A political and social activist since the Vietnam War , Linda attributes her revitalized - fully - engaged - intense - head - on - non - stop - political activism to the UNFORTUNATE EXISTENCE OF GEORGE W. BUSH and her disgust with greed - ridden American imperialism , environmental atrocities , egregious war , nuclear proliferation , lying leaders , and global tyranny !
Would Americans be outraged if the government decided to read every piece of our personal mail ?
Think about it , letters and notes which are sent to a lover , things we all say in anger , regret later , and never follow - through on ?
What about confidential financial information , plans to trump your competitor with a new product or service , and a host of personal issues that are too numerous to mention ?
People in the United States have become accustomed to their privacy and believe it is one of those “ unalienable constitutional rights ” which are guaranteed to all American citizens that most of us take for granted .
Our constitution and Bill of Rights demand it , yet here we are , one year before Bush leaves office , and the government is planning on doing almost exactly what I described .
The only difference is that instead of snail - mail ( which can also be opened ) , the government ’s proposed directive covers any and all computer communications and correspondence that everyday citizens send and receive on their computer systems .
This includes any all financial information as well as personal matters of anyone in your home ; the communications of your teenagers will be monitored as well , and issues that are normally kept within the family unit(s ) will suddenly become part of your governmental profile .
Now that our society if firmly entrenched in the digital world , a multitude of personal activity is carried out on the Internet .
Millions of people use dating services , communicate with prospective “ dates ” and often bare their souls .
We know this occurs on a regular basis by the huge amount of people that are finding successful relationships and oftentimes marriage through the internet .
People often find it easier to discuss extremely personal matters on the Internet because the embarrassment and shy nature of many of the people who use these services tend to become more honest and speak of matters they never would have in person - all because of the unique privacy the internet has offered those who are seeking friends , lovers , and permanent relationships .
How will these services perform when the subscribers know that every word they write is monitored and read , possibly ending - up in a file on that individual with the FBI or other law enforcement office , most likely Homeland Security ?
Do n’t forget the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 , also known as “ The Thought Crime Prevention Bill . ”
S-1959 is the vehicle Homeland Security will use to judge and imprison those who they deem are guilty , but it is this directive that will help to compile what they will classify as “ thought crimes ” , and suddenly , like those who lived in fear while attempting to keep themselves alive in other societies that traded personal privacy for “ security ” , Americans will be fearful when they use any means of communication , worried that words said in anger or while being particularly emotional could be used against them and given credibility when none actually exists .
In similar situations and throughout history , families were broken - up , the people as a whole lived in misery and fear , always afraid they would be picked - up by the Gestapo or other governmental storm troopers merely because they had communicated with someone the government blieved to be a “ dissident ” .
Many of those that were caught - up in the government ’s witch - hunt were enlisted to spy on their neighbors to keep from being arrested themselves , and in the era of Stalin , Hitler , Mao ’s China , and the old Soviet Union , these tactics were used to turn entire populations into informants and spies ; as more and more people were arrested , those who were attempting to save themselves would often make - up stories about innocents they believed the “ authorities ” wanted to hear , others were turned - in and eventually the stench of mistrust was felt throughout the respective countries ; even family members had to be careful , ever watchful that someone from within had been compromised and was attempting to escape their own death or incarceration by implicating another family member .
Anyone that was identified as a dissident or radical was arrested , executed or sent off to a concentration camp .
What was left behind was a terrified , subservient populace , easy to manage through fear and intimidation , and cowed into submission because they watched members of their own family and friends being arrested , even executed in front of them for crimes that never existed .
( The implementation of similar programs in the United States could very well result in similar situations as were experienced with other societies that were morphed into “ police states . ”
This is surely a matter where we can look upon our past in order to know what to expect from our future .
One constant is that history always repeats itself . )
For reasons none of us fully understand , our Congress is powerless to stop Bush and Cheney from doing as they damn well please , and even though they have broken laws and committed war crimes , lied and stand in utter defiance of Congress and the people , neither is touchable and act with impunity , safe in the knowledge that Congress is too cowed to impeach .
To allow these tyrants to gain the power to read any email or computer communication they desire is unconstitutional on its face , and now that the Supreme Court is stacked , a directive such as this is likely to succeed in court if legislation is n’t passed to prohibit any such intrusion (s ) into the privacy of innocent Americans .
This is what the government is proposing :
January 13 , 2008 , 12:00 am Dancing Spychief Wants to Tap Into Cyberspace Siobhan Gorman reports on the U.S. spychief .
Spychief Mike McConnell is drafting a plan to protect America ’s cyberspace that will raise privacy issues and make the current debate over surveillance law look like “ a walk in the park , ” McConnell tells The New Yorker in the issue set to hit newsstands Monday .
“ This is going to be a goat rope on the Hill .
My prediction is that we ’re going to screw around with this until something horrendous happens . ”
At issue , McConnell acknowledges , is that in order to accomplish his plan , the government must have the ability to read all the information crossing the Internet in the United States in order to protect it from abuse .
Congressional aides tell
The Journal that they , too , are also anticipating a fight over civil liberties that will rival the battles over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Part of the lawmakers ’ ire , they have said , is the paltry information the administration has provided .
The cyberspace security initiative was first reported in September by The Baltimore Sun , and some congressional aides say that lawmakers have still learned more from the media than they did from the few Top Secret briefings they have received hours before the administration requested money in November to jump start the program .
Please note that the funds to “ jump start ” this program were requested in November .
If I were to hazard a guess , this program is already running somewhere in tests , or for all we know , may already been implemented .
This administration has n’t exactly been truthful with the people or Congress .
MORE
Scholars and Rogues posted an insight into this situation that makes perfect sense , and I agree with them , there are no coincidences !
All your Internets are belong to ATT & the NSA Two seemingly coincidental bits of news crossed my desk yesterday morning .
First , the Wall Street Journal contains excerpts of an interview with Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell in which he outlines a vast new initiative to police Internet traffic “ for abuse . ”
Meanwhile , AT&T announced that it plans to extend its initiative to examine packets of information on its network for illegally traded content , becoming , in effect , the Internet ’s traffic cop .
Let ’s see … the world ’s largest telecom company states it ’s in negotiations with major entertainment conglomerate to police the Internet on their behalf , on the same day the DNI announces the government wants more eyes on Internet traffic ?

Gerry Mitchell was hit , then ticketed .
PHOTO BY JEN FARIELLO
Heading home from a trip to Reid 's supermarket on Preston Avenue about a month ago , Charlottesville artist Gerry Mitchell stopped his motorized wheelchair on the sidewalk along West Main Street and waited to cross .
Even though the powerful drugs he takes to control AIDS have weakened his bones so badly that he can no longer walk , his failing health was not on his mind that morning .
" I was just happy , " he says .
As the light in front of him turned green , Mitchell rolled forward into the crosswalk .
Moments later , a powerful jolt from behind threw him from his chair and tossed him face down in the street .
Stunned from the blow , Mitchell looked up to see an Albemarle County police officer leaning over him , asking if he was okay .
But as Mitchell would soon learn , the officer was n't part of the rescue team ; he was the driver of the vehicle that had just struck Mitchell 's wheelchair from behind .
And then , several hours later , in the University of Virginia Medical Center emergency room , Mitchell got another jolt .
" You 're not going to like this , " Mitchell quotes the officer who paid the call .
It was n't flowers or well wishes the officer came bearing .
It was a traffic ticket .
Not what he needed
Gerry Mitchell 's life has not been easy .
Although he studied art at Yale University and has operated galleries in San Francisco and Barcelona , he found himself on the cutting edge not only of art but also medical history .
In 1981 , Mitchell discovered that he was infected with a then little - known but lethal virius , HIV .
After watching scores of his friends die from the disease , in the mid-'90s he , too , developed full - blown AIDS .
He 's one of the world 's longest survivors of the deadly disease .
" It 's a miracle I 'm alive , " says Mitchell , a Charlottesville native who says his brother moved back to their hometown five years ago to help him after doctors had given Mitchell months to live .
Mitchell , now 53 , says he never let the illness or doctors ' warnings slow him down .
Even now , wheelchair - bound and with his dexterity diminished from several strokes , he paints daily and donates all the proceeds from his frequent shows to charity – $ 100,000 in the last several years , by his account .
" He 's an amazing guy , " says John Lawrence , owner of the Mudhouse coffee shop on the Downtown Mall , where Mitchell has shown his work twice in the past and will again in January .
" I 've never met anyone with such a positive mental attitude and such a joy for life . "
The accident , Mitchell says , dampened some of that joy .
Mitchell was treated and released the day of the accident , but by the following day he was back in the hospital suffering from renal failure , something he says his doctors attribute to the blunt blow to his back .
" I did n't need this , " he says , " on top of everything else . "
Excessive force ?
What happens between officers and ordinary citizens in crosswalks has lately been a subject of local controversy .
In the early morning hours of September 29 , just four blocks east of Mitchell 's accident , two young adults allege that they were almost run over by a Charlottesville police officer .
According to recent trial testimony , an Iraq war veteran and his fiancée , Richard Silva and Blair Austin , were walking across Water Street toward the parking deck after a birthday dinner on the Downtown Mall when Officer Mike Flaherty came speeding down Second Street on his way to a call .
After Silva threw up his hands and uttered some variation of " Slow your a* * " or " Slow the f*** down , " Flaherty hopped out of his Jeep to arrest him .
When Austin asked why , Flaherty pushed her , and her tumble onto the pavement prompted at least one bystander to call 911 to report the officer 's behavior .
Flaherty charged the couple with being drunk in public and Austin with obstruction , and the two filed a formal complaint against Flaherty .
After a five - hour trial on November 29 , Silva and Austin were found not guilty of all charges .
Flaherty testified he ended his response to the original call for back - up in order to deal with Silva , whom Flaherty believed posed a safety hazard .
Silva , he said , was " bobbing and weaving " and had " puffed out his chest . "
In court , Charlottesville District Court Judge Bob Downer stopped far short of reprimanding Flaherty .
Instead , he seemed to suggest he believed Flaherty 's account– that Silva refused to leave the middle of the road and that Austin interfered with the arrest .
The judge said that prosecutors simply had n't proven their case " beyond a reasonable doubt . "
The internal police investigation into that matter remains open .
Slow motion
Gerry Mitchell 's accident occurred Monday , November 5 , the kind of fall day that could make even a dying man smile– cool and crisp with temperatures in the mid 50s , glowing foliage under a clear blue sky .
As he waited around 10 am at the intersection of Main and Fourth across from Main Street Market , the groceries he'd just purchased from Reid 's hanging from the back of his wheelchair , he imagined the bowl of beef stew he planned to make for lunch and an afternoon he hoped to spend finishing a painting for an upcoming exhibition .
His plans were about to be interrupted .
For one west - bound driver , the incident unfolded like a nightmare .
Ben Gathright , 25 , saw Mitchell waiting to cross , and when the light in front of his car turned yellow , rather than rushing through , he stopped and motioned to Mitchell to cross .
As Mitchell set off in his wheelchair , the police cruiser that had been idling on Fourth Street began turning left onto West Main– Gathright watching in horror .
" I was thinking , ' Oh my God , he 's going to hit him ! ' " says Gathright , adding that he could do nothing to stop the collision .
On impact , Mitchell " was pitched a good five feet from his wheelchair , " says Gathright , who left his car running and rushed to offer aid– as did the officer who struck Mitchell .
A man aboard a Route 7 Charlottesville Transit bus , stopped at the light on its way to Fashion Square Mall , was also stunned to see the police cruiser hit a man in a wheelchair .
" I do n't understand how he did n't see the guy , " says passenger Haywood Johnson .
' Blind spot '
Gathright and Mitchell say the officer 's initial reaction was apologetic .
" He said he had been ' looking down ' as he turned , " says Gathright .
But they claim that once Mitchell was on the side of the road and police back - up had arrived , the sense of contrition had evaporated .
" Suddenly , they said I was in his blind spot , " says Mitchell .
" I said , ' You 've got to be kidding .
He almost killed me . ' "
Gathright says he could n't understand why police never took a formal statement from him , although he remained at the scene and told them he had witnessed the entire event .
Gathright says Mitchell was shaking , crying , and worried about the fate of his $ 13,000 motorized wheelchair , which would not fit into an ambulance .
Gathright wanted to call an ambulance anyway , but he contends the officer did not .
" I said anything could happen , " says Gathright .
" He could be bleeding internally , you call the ambulance . "
Gathright says he pointed out that Mitchell had mentioned having a stroke just a week earlier .
The officer 's response , according to Gathright : " The law says if he does n't want medical care , he does n't have to have it . "
The officer , Gregory Charles Davis , did not return the Hook 's call for comment , and Albemarle County police spokesperson Lieutenant John Teixeira says the department will not comment on the matter .
Eventually , Mitchell , realizing he was bleeding from wounds to his legs and arms , relented and agreed to be taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center .
Several hours later , as he was being examined in the ER , Mitchell says , Charlottesville officer Steve Grissom showed up with a ticket .
But it was n't a photocopy of a ticket issued to the officer who struck him : it was a ticket for Mitchell .
There was no ticket issued to the officer .
" He said , ' You did n't push the button , ' " Mitchell recalls .
" We have video of you . "
That video , allegedly shot from a camera mounted at the front of Officer Davis ' cruiser , purportedly shows a " do n't walk " signal that Mitchell may have violated .
" That 's when I got angry , " says Mitchell .
Whatever else the video may show– such as the force of the impact or Davis ' actions in the collision 's aftermath– may take a while to discover .
Teixeira , citing an ongoing investigation , has denied the Hook 's request for a copy .
Internal investigations
In recent years , the City of Charlottesville has taken several steps to create a more pedestrian - friendly city .
In 2006 , the city erected a series of signs in the middle of non-signaled downtown crosswalks reminding drivers of their obligation to yield to pedestrians .
Pedestrian activist Kevin
Cox says those signs– particularly noticeable at the crosswalks near the Downtown Mall– have helped increase driver awareness of pedestrians , and he has noticed drivers have been " more courteous " at those intersections since the signs went up .
John Wetmore , the Maryland - based founder of the website pedestrian.org , and creator of the nationally distributed public access TV series Perils for Pedestrians , says in cases like Mitchell 's , the driver should be ticketed .
" If you 're a turning vehicle , you have an obligation not to run someone over , " he says .
" It 's not like you 're going down the road and someone jumps out in front of you . "
( Wetmore 's show airs locally on Comcast channel 13 at 7 pm on Mondays . )
Wetmore says that common - sense physics explain why .
" When you 're turning , you 're starting from close to zero miles an hour , " he says .
" You would n't have any trouble stopping if you looked . "
So why was Mitchell charged , while the driver who struck him was not ?
With police officials in both Charlottesville and Albemarle refusing to answer any questions , that 's hard to determine .
But one veteran attorney believes she understands .
" I can only think of one reason , " says attorney Debbie Wyatt .
" It 's really for liability purposes . "
City spokesperson Ric Barrick says no one in the city or on the police force will comment .
We " do n't want to get in the habit of playing these events out in the press , " he says .
" We feel the debate should remain in the courts and not in the public . "
Could this really be an example of " the best defense is a good offense " – or perhaps of the " thin blue line , " the supposed protection brothers of the badge provide each other ?
" It 's certainly been a tried and true method , and it 's certainly been a practice I 've seen in the county , " says Wyatt , who recently won a $ 4.5 million civil judgment against the county after an officer shot and killed an allegedly berzerking man in a Rio Road apartment 10 years ago .
Wyatt notes that five officers in that incident reported themselves as injured .
" Jaywalking is n't generally prosecuted in this town , " says Wyatt .
" I think this is an abuse of power . "
The law , however , can be complicated .
One part of Virginia code says that pedestrians in a crosswalk have the right of way– particularly when they 're facing a green light .
But Mitchell was also facing a " do n't walk " sign .
" It 's chaotic , " says pedestrian advocate Cox , citing Charlottesville 's smorgasbord of intersections .
Some have buttons a pedestrian must press to prompt the walk signal ; other intersections offer no buttons , with pedestrian signals simply coordinated with the traffic signals .
Sometimes there are no pedestrian signals at all .
" It should be standardized , " says Wetmore .
" If you have to push the button to get a walk signal , there should be a sign that says , ' You must push button for signal , ' Otherwise , you do n't even know you need to look for it . "
In Virginia , this confusion has been recognized by the agency with the power to do something .
" We 're looking at changing the Code because of these types of problems , " says Jacob Helmboldt , state bicycle and pedestrian program coordinator for the Virginia Department of Transportation .
" It makes no sense that the police would ticket him for that , " says Helmboldt .
" Pedestrians have the reasonable expectation to think that when the light is green they can cross with traffic . "
But in light of Barrick 's comments , if Mitchell wants answers about why he was ticketed and the officer was not , his only recourse is to file a complaint with the Charlottesville police department and request an internal investigation .
That , some say , is a problem .
" I do n't believe a department should investigate itself , " says Lloyd Wood , who sits on the Citizen 's Advisory Committee of the Albemarle County Police Department .
Established in 2002 at the urging of a County man who'd been ejected from a Western Albemarle High School football game for smoking a cigar , it 's one of many such groups that municipalities have established to create an unbiased and nonthreatening forum where citizens can take complaints about police behavior .
Although the Albemarle County committee has no direct power over police personnel , it can make recommendations to the Albemarle Board of Supervisors .
In addition , Wood says , Albemarle police often ask State Police to conduct investigations into controversial matters .
" That way , " he says , " there 's no question about anyone doing anything wrong . "
Dana Slater , an attorney and herself a former Albemarle County police officer– who is also a member of the Committee– says such committees are no cure - all , in part because many citizens do n't know they exist .
Even when people do know about it , Slater says , they often they shy away from complaining , and Wood notes that only one member of the public has ever lodged a complaint in the six years of the committee 's existence .
Will Charlottesville ever establish such a board ?
Is it needed ?
In 2005 , Chief Longo showed his willingness to request an independent investigation into officers ' conduct when he asked both the state police and the FBI to investigate two officers .
Longo had suspended Charlottesville Police Officers Roy Fitzgerald and Charles Saunders in 2001 following a complaint that they attended a stripper party while on duty and in uniform , but it was a series of other allegations about corruption and bribery that eventually led him to ask for outside help– and win praise from U.S. Attorney John Brownlee .
" His proactive approach demonstrates the bravery and integrity of the Charlottesville Police Department , " said Brownlee of Longo in a 2006 press release .
Saunders and Fitzgerald , who were fired from the department in 2005 , eventually pled guilty to lying to a federal agent , and both served three months in prison .
" Apalled "
After he was treated at UVA Hospital , says Mitchell , and a Charlottesville police officer 's offer of a ride fell through , he caught a cab back to the Main Street Market .
His wheelchair , although bent , was still operable , and a samaritan had bundled up his groceries and hung them from the back of his chair .
He wheeled back to his downtown home at a senior citizens high - rise .
It was witness Gathright who brought Mitchell 's accident to the Hook 's attention .
He says he was outraged when he saw the accident , and his outrage grew when he found out later that Mitchell was the person ticketed .
" I can't express how appalled I am , " says Gathright .
" To me this is just insane .
What if it were a civilian driver ? "
Attorney Slater , declining comment on this specific case , says the law typically allows both parties to be charged in one incident .
She says she often did just that when she was an officer in cases where there was probable cause to suggest both sides had some blame .
" Let the court sort it out , " she says .
The sorting out begins for Mitchell at 9 am December 6 .
That 's when he must appear in Charlottesville District Court to defend himself against the charge of " failure to obey a pedestrian signal . "
Like Wyatt and many of his friends , Mitchell believes the ticket was simply an attempt by the police to limit their liability if he decides to sue , something he says he 's considering .
If he does , he may have difficulty winning a judgment , particularly if he 's found guilty .
That 's because Virginia is a " contributory negligence state , " says Slater , meaning if a victim can be shown to be even one percent liable , he can not collect anything .
( Most states follow the doctrine of " comparitive negligence , " which allows judgments and awards even when blame is shared . )
Whether he sues , Mitchell says he wants an apology– and a guarantee .
" I was treated like a dog , " he says .
" I do n't want this to ever happen to anyone else again . "
The day after he was hit by a police cruiser , Gerry Mitchell was hospitalized for renal failure .

Employer of suspect in officer 's death arrested Employer of murder suspect arrested
Prosecutors say illegal immigrant charged in killing of officer got help to re-enter U.S .
Robert Camp leaves the Bob Casey Federal Courthouse Wednesday in Houston .
The federal complaint alleges that Camp , through his company Camp Landscaping , hired Juan Quintero knowing that he had been deported previously for a crime and was back in the country illegally .

The owner of a landscaping firm was arrested Wednesday and faces up to 10 years in federal prison , accused of harboring one of his workers , an illegal immigrant from Mexico charged with the capital murder of a Houston police officer .
Court documents show that Robert Lane Camp , 47 , went to considerable lengths to help Juan Leonardo Quintero and keep him on the job at his Deer Park landscaping company before the September 2006 killing of officer Rodney Johnson .
In August 1998 , Camp posted a $ 10,000 bond for Quintero after he was jailed on an indecency with a child charge and hired an attorney to defend him .
After the worker was deported in May 1999 , Camp sent him money in Mexico and later bought him a plane ticket from Phoenix to Houston after Quintero re-entered through Arizona illegally , according to an affidavit by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent .
Camp then purchased a house in Houston and rented it to Quintero .
Camp walked out of the federal courthouse on Wednesday afternoon after U.S. Magistrate Stephen Smith approved a $ 50,000 bond following his first court appearance .
His attorney , Jimmy Ardoin , would not comment after the hearing , and calls to Camp 's home were not returned .
No one answered the door at his Deer Park house Wednesday .
U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle in Houston said the prosecution of Camp serves to " demonstrate the consequences a U.S. citizen faces " by harboring , employing or helping an illegal immigrant enter the country .
'' The shooting of HPD officer Johnson was a tragic incident that could have been avoided , " said DeGabrielle , in a statement released after Camp 's arrest .
Camp also is charged with encouraging or inducing Quintero to enter the country illegally , and later harboring the immigrant in the Houston area .
Quintero worked for Camp for at least 11 years , according to the affidavit .
Shot four times in head
On Sept. 21 , 2006 , officer Johnson stopped a truck owned by Camp 's company for a traffic violation and arrested Quintero after the landscape worker could not provide a driver 's license .
As the officer wrote up his report in the front seat of his police car , authorities say , Quintero pulled a pistol overlooked in a body search and shot Johnson four times in the head .
The charges against Camp are the result of a lengthy investigation by the Houston Police Department and ICE agents .
Robert Rutt , special agent in charge of the ICE Office of Investigations in Houston , echoed DeGabrielle 's comments .
'' Officer Johnson 's terrible murder illustrates that hiring and harboring illegal aliens is not a victimless crime , " Rutt said .
" Many illegal aliens , especially aliens with criminal convictions , are desperate to avoid being detected and apprehended .
These people also tend to take desperate actions , and the results are often tragic . "
On the sixth floor of a Harris County Jail facility , Quintero seemed pensive Wednesday when told for the first time his friend and alleged employer was charged in federal court .
" Excuse me if I can't discuss details of the case .
I just can't , " Quintero said .
At the advice of his lawyer , Quintero said he could n't talk .
" My situation is difficult , the options are life ( in prison ) or death , " he said of what a guilty verdict would bring .
Quintero has largely been cut off from the outside world and the general jail population , spending his days locked in his own cell , a standard procedure for prisoners facing capital murder charges .
Jury selection in Quintero 's trial is scheduled for March 31 .
Police union hails arrest
Meanwhile , Camp 's arrest was supported by members of the Houston Police Officer 's Union , where Johnson served as a board member .
'' We had concerns about the suspect being here , how he had got back into the country , " said Mark Clark , the union 's executive director .
'' These concerns were taken up by HPD and other agencies following Rodney 's murder , and we 're fully supportive of this person who employed the subject being charged . "
Clark said Camp should be held accountable in the officer 's death .
" It appears now that bill has come due in the criminal justice system , " he said .
Camp 's prosecution also was lauded by Texans for Immigration Reform , a Houston group which favors tightened immigration enforcement .

After well over a year of insanely early coverage , the 2008 presidential campaign finally has an actual contest today when Iowa holds its caucus .
At first , Page 2 planned to honor this moment and the coinciding first week of the NFL playoffs by speculating how the presidential campaign would go if it was covered like the NFL .
But given all the early speculation , anointed and subsequently dethroned front - runners , constantly changing predictions , evolving conventional wisdom and excessive hype ( Super Tuesday has been renamed " Super Duper Tuesday " -- seriously , we 're not making that up ) , it 's apparent the many " news " outlets already cover the presidential campaign as if it were the NFL .
The question , therefore , is how the news outlets would cover the NFL this season .

The last major label to hold out on selling DRM - free MP3s , Sony BMG , is " finalizing plans " to sell music not locked down with DRM .
It 'll be available sometime in the first quarter , apparently in time to get in on Amazon and Pepsi's 1 billion song giveaway , which now looks like it 'll have tracks from every major label .
So , how'd we get here ?

We 've been saying for a while DRM has cancer ( is a cancer ? ) , dying a long , drawn out death — cue Frucci's " DRM Deathwatch " meme .
EMI 's move was characterized as a desperate ploy by the weakest label — hence , it ran with iTunes , something we 've been told the other labels would n't have even sniffed at because of the dreaded iTunes hegemony ( more on that in a sec ) .

But then Universal , the biggest label in the world , jumped .
In large part to cut at iTunes , true .
Regardless , the tide had turned .
Warner and Sony BMG were wary holdouts .
After Warner joined the party , Sony BMG really had little choice — it pretty much had to go open or go home , so we 've been expecting this .
Universal announced it will start selling DRM - free music through a variety of outlets , but iTunes Read more
It 's no surprise Sony is throwing in with Amazon , either .
Again , the fear of an iTunes paradigm is very real among the labels — if the last 10 years have taught us anything , they crave control more than money — and Amazon is in the best position to compete with iTunes .
Especially now that it has something very powerful that iTMS does n't — DRM - free tracks from every major label .

Scientists have created silicon nanowires that are perfect — at least atomically .
Down at the single - atom level , the identical wires have no bumps , bends , or other imperfections .
They are perfectly crystalline , even more so than bulk silicon .
The full array of nanowires is also highly parallel , and each wire is an excellent metallic conductor .
This research may be an important step forward for nanotechnology .
Nanowires play a key role in developing nanoelectronics applications , and silicon nanowires are particularly important because of the central function that silicon plays in the semiconductor industry and current technologies .
Some scientists believe that silicon nanowires will overtake carbon nanotubes in popularity , and they are being eyed for a variety of electronics applications and even quantum computing .
Therefore , the ability to create straight , identical , parallel , and atomically smooth nanowires could lead to new developments in nanoelectronics .
The nanowires were created by scientists from the Institute for the Structure of Matter ( CNR - ISM ) in Rome , Italy ; the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate , also in Italy ( both institutes are part of Italy 's National Research Council ) ; and the Center for Research on Condensed Matter and Nanoscience in Marseilles , France , a branch of France 's National Center for Scientific Research .
Using two separate tools , a scanning tunneling microscope and a beam of low - energy x-rays , the researchers observed that the the nanowires are essentially made of individual 1.5 - nanometer - diamter silicon nanodots .
The nanodots “ self - assembled ” into nanowires : the more nanodots , the longer the nanowire , up to a maximum achieved length of 31 nanometers .
The most common length was about 10 nanometers .
The research group noticed a “ surprising ” characteristic of the nanowires .
Despite the wires ' otherwise atomic perfection , they display an usual lack of symmetry across their widths :
One side of each nanowire is effectively shorter than the other side .
This dip , as the researchers refer to it , sometimes occurs on the left side and sometimes the right .
Why the asymmetry arises seems to be due to the particular surface , or “ substrate , ” on which the nanowires were grown : silver .
More specifically , the substrate consists of two very , very thin layers of silver , each only a single atom thick .
The two layers give the substrate a grooved appearance , with the top layer of silver atoms forming regularly spaced lines over the bottom layer .
To “ grow ” the nanowires , two atom - thick layers of silicon were deposited on top of the silver substrate at room temperature .
The top layer of silicon consisted of silicon “ dimers , ” or bonded atom pairs .
The bottom layer was composed of single silicon atoms , which made contact with both silver layers .
Due to the complex electronic interactions that can occur between silicon and silver atoms , the silicon atoms on silver can self - assemble into ordered structures — in this case , nanowires .
But those interactions , coupled with the grooves on the silver substrate , also produced the nanowire asymmetry .
The scientists say that more work needs to be done before the scientists know more about the wires ' exact atomic structure and the number of silicon atoms that comprise them , as well as better understanding the asymmetry .
They are currently involved in follow - up research .
This research is reported in the January 9 , 2008 , edition of Nano Letters .

Mailings of a suspicious white powder to 10 Church of Scientology addresses prompted the evacuation of dozens of people and the closure of a major thoroughfare Wednesday as hazmat teams were called to examine the packages .
The letters were sent via the Postal Service to Scientology properties in Hollywood , the San Fernando Valley , Santa Monica , Glendale and Tustin .
Police shut part of Glendale ’s busy Brand Boulevard for two hours before sounding the all - clear , while 60 people were cleared from buildings in Tustin , authorities said .
The incidents appeared to be part of a hoax .
Preliminary tests showed the powder to be cornstarch and wheat germ .
“ Initial field testing by LAPD indicates the powder is harmless , ” said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller .
“ However , further testing will be conducted .
We will also work to assess what threat , if any , was associated with the mailings and determine whether any federal statutes were violated . ”
The Church of Scientology had no comment about the incidents .
The mailings come after a cyber attack last week on the Church ’s website .
Authorities said there was no evidence that Wednesday ’s mailings were connected to the hacking .

ACTION PLAN REGARDING S. 1959 : HOW TO STOP IT IN ITS TRACKS ( AND THIS WILL WORK !!)
A ) Challenge the validity of the 404-6 “ votes ” in the House of Representatives for HR 1955 ( if appropriate ) :
Because a number of politicians have registered a lack of familiarity with the bill .
23 House members were absent while the bill was voted for .
Rep. Lynn Woolsey , Rep. Barbara Lee , and Rep .
Payne were all at a house party where a friend of mine attended , who responded to the concern about S. 1959 / HR 1955 by saying things like “ oh , do you mean Bill # 205 ” and stuff like that .
They seemed “ very sketchy ” about the bill , said my friend who attended the house party .
I also have read about other politicians knowing nothing about this bill .
This needs to be researched and , if appropriate , challenged formally :
Did the bill REALLY pass the House with 404 - 6 votes ?
Maybe yes .
Maybe not ?
B ) Expose in writing and sue the corporation which is funding the passage of S.1959 / HR 1955 :
I read about a subsidiary of Haliburton sponsoring this bill but regret that I lost the link and the article .
Does anybody know about this ?
Please post below if so .
I will research this and see what I can do to get the exact information posted : Stay tuned for an edit to this article .
If so it will be posted right here , in this exact paragraph .
TO HIT CORPORATIONS IN THE POCKETBOOK IS KEY TO WINNING OUR CAUSE .
C ) Gather 100,000 donations on the Internet of $ 20 each to amount to $ 2,000,000 , and file a lawsuit against the US Government for passing free speech - chilling legislation .
I suggest the Center for Constitutional Rights should be handed the lawsuit , because their head attorney Michael Rattner has been very vocal about S. 1959 / HR 1955 and been advocating civilian pro-activity .
And while the ACLU has made statements about the bill and registered utmost concern , they also have not circulated an email petition to gather signatures to topple it .
I suggest CCR ’s Michael Ratner is more “ on the ball ” on this one than the ACLU .
But either entity would be excellent to do the suit .
D ) Create a petition
( Opednews , will you please , please do this , immediately ! ) and gather signatures all over the web to stop S .1959 .
In that petition , there Must be a request to Senators to promise a filibuster if the bill passes : Very important !
The petition should have additional bullet points :
1 ) Quoting text of the bill to prove that this bill DOES clamp down on civil liberties *
2 ) Reminding Congress that we PAY them to uphold , protect and defend the Constitution , as is their sworn oath of office to do .
3 ) Demand that Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Jane Harmon , who drafted and introduced this bill targeting thought and not action as the ACLU says , step down from public office .
( Even if Sen. Collins and Rep. Harmon do n’t resign , the message will be clear :
The Senate will be less likely to pass the bill and legislators will realize that they ca n’t just literally get away with murder , given a People which refuses to lie down as passively as we have in the past .
We ’ve got to prove the stuff we are made of , NOW , before free speech is lost and it is simply too late ! )
E ) Create a Civilian Commission
Whose function would be to spy on the government infiltrators to be sent to the College campuses under this bill , to report back to the ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights , who in turn would sue the government based on these civilian reports .
In other words , if the government is going to shadow us , we will shadow them right back !
We are n’t going to lie down and just take it all : We WILL fight back !

New York Times : Sen. Clinton avoids ' flip - flopper ' label despite ever - changing stance on Iraq war RAW STORY
Published : Saturday August 4 , 2007
Print This Email This As the New York Times reports , Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton has so far succeeded in avoiding the label of " flip - flopper , " despite numerous shifts in opinion and handling of the Iraq war , but has not escaped criticism entirely .
Sen .
Clinton originally voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2002 , but has since moved towards other Democratic politicians , as well as the voting base , to call for a gradual withdrawal of troops .
Advisers insist that this is not a political move , but an honest change in thinking brought on by public opinion and the current course the Iraq offensive is on .
# Excerpts :
 Thanks to her votes on defunding the war and supporting a timetable for withdrawal , she has defused the war issue as a problem for her , and her 2002 vote for the war , to quite an extent ,  said Medea Benjamin , a leader of the antiwar group Code Pink , whose members once regularly booed and heckled Mrs. Clinton whenever she spoke about the war .

Moulitsas , whose Web site inspired this weekends gathering of bloggers in Chicago , cited Mrs. Clintons statements that she would leave a sizable military force in Iraq even after reducing the American military role there , saying that distinction was lost in the way she had presented her antiwar credentials .
 I dont know if policy and rhetoric are aligned ,  Mr. Moulitsas said .
 But people dont see the policy paper on our side ; they hear what she says , and she talks a great game .  #

Electronic Mail Etiquette Back in 1993 , I published a set of etiquette guidelines for electronic mail , which became a standard part of the Pegasus Mail help file : in the sixteen years since I originally wrote them , I have continually kept them up to date , and have received innumerable questions and requests on the subject .
The guidelines themselves are shown below , provided as a public service : for information on republishing or using these guidelines , please click here .
Etiquette Guidelines for Electronic Mail
This document presents some simple guidelines for electronic mail etiquette and usage .
It does not try to mandate any particular style or rules , but is rather an attempt to highlight important issues affecting the clarity of the electronic mail we send - and after all , electronic mail is about communication , so clarity should be our goal .
Addresses and personal names A personal name is an arbitrary string of text that many mailers will allow you to define , and will attach to your e-mail address as a textual comment : in Pegasus Mail , you define your personal name in the General Preferences dialog ...
So , in the example address " David Harris < david@example.com > " , the personal name part is " David Harris " .
Always provide a personal name if your mail system allows it - a personal name attached to your address identifies you better than your address can on its own .
Use a sensible personal name : " Guess who " or other such phrases are annoying as personal names and hinder the recipient 's quick identification of you and your message .
Most mail programs will show only your personal name ( not your e-mail address ) in recipients ' folder lists , so using a sensible name is essential in allowing them to identify you as the sender .
If your mail system lets you use personal names in the addresses to which you send mail , try to use them .
This will often help a postmaster recognize the real recipient of the message if the address is invalid .
Example : The address 344188@foo.chaos.com conveys less information on its own than if it were written as 344188@foo.chaos.com ( Ford Prefect ) Subject lines
Always include a subject line in your message .
Almost all mailers present you with the subject line when you browse your mailbox , and it's often the only clue the recipient has about the contents when filing and searching for messages .
Make the subject line meaningful .
For example , sending a message to Microsoft Technical Support with the subject " Windows " is practically as unhelpful as having no subject at all .
If you are replying to a message but are changing the subject of the conversation , change the subject too - or better still , start a new message altogether .
The subject is usually the easiest way to follow the thread of a conversation , so changing the conversation without changing the subject can be confusing and can make filing difficult .
Message Length , Content and Format
Try to match your message length to the tenor of the conversation : if you are only making a quick query , then keep it short and to the point .
It has become increasingly common for people to try to cram their entire message into the " subject " line , but you should n't do this - it is visually confusing to open a message and see nothing in the body : many people will mistake such messages for botched delivery attempts and will delete them without necessarily noticing the subject .
Make your subject descriptive , by all means , but ensure that the message body also contains meaningful text .
In general , keep to the subject as much as possible .
If you need to branch off onto a totally new and different topic then it's often better to send a new message , which allows the recipient the option of filing it separately .
Do n't type your message in ALL - UPPERCASE - it 's the Internet equivalent of yelling , and can be extremely difficult to read ( although a short stretch of uppercase may serve to emphasize a point heavily ) .
Try to break your message into logical paragraphs and restrict your sentences to sensible lengths .
Use correct grammar and spelling .
Electronic mail is all about communication - poorly - worded and misspelled messages are hard to read and potentially confusing .
Just because electronic mail is fast does not mean that it should be slipshod , yet the worst language - mashing I have ever seen has been done in e-mail messages .
If your words are important enough to write , then surely they are also important enough to write properly ?
" TXT - speak " ... f u wnt 2 talk lk ths 2 yr frnds , well OK , but make sure they understand you .
Also , be aware that not everyone thinks that txt - speak ( or its cousin , " l33t - speak " ) is " cool " - if you send a message like this to such a person , you may end up looking ridiculous , which could be disastrous .
Avoid using this type of language when mailing people you do n't know , or in business correspondence .
Finally , make sure you agree on what your abbreviations mean - " LOL " , for instance , means " Laughing out Loud " to some people , but " Lots of Love " to others .
Avoid public " flames " - messages sent in anger .
Messages sent in the heat of the moment generally only exacerbate the situation , achieve little , and are usually regretted later .
Settle down and think about it for a while before starting a flame war .
( Try going and making yourself a cup of coffee - it 's amazing how much you can cool down even in that short a time , besides which a good cup of coffee is a great soother ) .
If your mail program supports fancy formatting ( bold , italic and so on ) in the mail messages it generates , make sure that the recipient has a mail program that can display such messages .
At the time of writing , there are still some Internet mail programs that do not support anything other than plain text in messages , although this will change over time .
Be very careful about including credit card numbers in electronic mail messages .
Electronic mail can be intercepted in transit and a valid credit card number is like money in the bank for someone unscrupulous enough to use it .
Replies Avoid using " group reply " ( reply - to - all ) functions whenever possible : the vast majority of messages that receive group replies each day do not warrant them .
Abuse of this function generates an enormous amount of unwanted and unnecessary mail : always consider carefully whether a group reply is really required before using it .
Include enough of the original message to provide a context .
Remember that Electronic Mail is not as immediate as a telephone conversation and the recipient may not recall the contents of the original message , especially if he or she receives many messages each day .
Including the relevant section from the original message helps the recipient to place your reply in context .
Include only the minimum you need from the original message .
One of the most annoying things you can encounter in e-mail is to have your original 5 - page message quoted back at you in its entirety , with the words " Me too " added at the bottom .
Quote back only the smallest amount you need to make your context clear .
Use some kind of visual indication to distinguish between text quoted from the original message and your new text - this makes the reply much easier to follow . " > " is a traditional marker for quoted text , but you can use anything provided its purpose is clear and you use it consistently .
Pay careful attention to where your reply is going to end up : it can be embarrassing for you if a personal message ends up on a mailing list , and it 's generally annoying for the other list members .
Ask yourself if your reply is really warranted - a message sent to a list server that only says " I agree " is probably better sent privately to the person who originally sent the message .
E- Mail Scams
There are so many e-mail scams out there now that some days you 'll receive more of them than you will real mail .
The key to protecting yourself is simple - just use a little common sense .
If an e-mailed offer looks too good to be true , then it IS too good to be true .
When you actually stop and read these things , they are almost always poorly written , inconsistent , repetitive and outrageously implausible .
By all means have a laugh , but never , ever be tempted , even for a second .
No responsible bank or business will * ever * send you an e-mail message asking you to enter your username , password or personal details .
If you get a message like this , even if it looks convincing , DO NOT reply or click on any links - instead , ring the bank or business and ask them to confirm the message 's legitimacy : 999 times out of 1000 , it will be bogus and you should delete it at once .
SPAM ( unsolicited commercial e-mail )
If you are tempted to advertise your business or service by sending out e-mail to large lists of people , then we have one word for you : DON'T .
This is called spamming , and it is the single most reviled practice on the Internet .
Sending unsolicited commercial e-mail will have the opposite effect from anything you might intend , and because it is explicitly mentioned in most Internet Service Providers ' terms and conditions as a prohibited practice , it may end up costing you your e-mail address .
At the very least , you will get hundreds or thousands of deeply irate people screaming at you .
We can't stress this one enough - DON'T SEND SPAM ; it is nothing but trouble .
If you receive a spam message ( and who does n't , these days ? ) do n't assume that the person in the " From " field of the message is actually the person who sent it .
It is a very common practice for spammers to forge the headers of their messages to deflect the blame for their evildoing onto someone else .
This one is not etiquette , exactly , but it 's so important we have to mention it here .
Most spam mail will claim to have a " remove " option - an address to which you can send a message so that you will supposedly never get spam from the sender again .
Never , never EVER use such remove options - they simply confirm to the spammer that your address is valid and that you read your mail .
Rather than reducing the amount of spam you get , using a " remove " option will almost certainly result in you getting even more spam .
Spam is one of the most emotive , complex social issues facing the Internet .
If you are interested in helping to kerb this abusive practice , you might like to consider joining one of the anti-spam action groups , such as CAUCE ( the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E- mail ) - visit their web page at http://www.cauce.org.
Forwarding mail
When forwarding a message , think carefully about whether the recipient will actually appreciate it .
It 's become common for people to forward jokes , funny pictures and other incidental items on an almost open - slather basis , without first checking whether or not the people to whom the items are being forwarded really want to receive them .
Before forwarding incidental mail to someone , always ask first whether or not they want it .
If a message contains a request that you forward it to other people , then that 's almost always a good reason not to do so .
There are many well - known hoaxes and chain letters that have been going around the Internet for years - for instance , the letter with the heart - rending tale of the sick child who before he dies wants to set a record for the most e-mail greeting cards received ...
The message goes on to urge you to send a postcard to the child , then forward the e-mail to all your friends .
Do n't just blindly fall for hoaxes like this one - either ignore them , or if they happen to seem especially worthy , ask around and find out whether or not they are kosher before proceeding .
Signatures A Signature is a small block of text appended to the end of your messages , which usually contains your contact information .
Many mailers can add a signature to your messages automatically .
Signatures are a great idea but are subject to abuse ; balance is the key to a good signature .
Always use a signature if you can : make sure it identifies who you are and includes alternative means of contacting you ( phone and fax are usual ) .
In many systems , particularly where mail passes through gateways , your signature may be the only means by which the recipient can even tell who you are .
Keep your signature short - four to seven lines is a handy guideline for maximum signature length .
Unnecessarily long signatures waste bandwidth ( especially when distributed to lists ) and can be annoying .
Some mailers allow you to add random strings to your signature : this is well and good and can add character if done carefully .
You should consider the following basic rules though :
Keep it short .
The length of your quote adds to the length of your signature .
A 5,000 word excerpt from Kant's ' Critique of Pure Reason ' used as a signature will not win you many friends .
Definitions of " offensive " vary widely : avoid quotes that might offend people on the grounds of religion , race , politics or sexuality .
Avoid topical or local quotes , since they may be meaningless to recipients in other towns , countries or cultures .
Variable signatures are usually best if they 're amusing ; polemical outbursts on politics or other such topics will turn most people off , but a one - liner that brings a smile can make someone 's day .
Courtesy Electronic mail is all about communication with other people , and as such some basic courtesy never goes amiss .
If you 're asking for something , do n't forget to say " please " .
Similarly , if someone does something for you , it never hurts to say " thank you " .
While this might sound trivial , or even insulting , it 's astonishing how many people who are perfectly polite in everyday life seem to forget their manners in their e-mail .
Do n't expect an immediate answer .
The fact that you do n't get an answer from someone in ten minutes does not mean that he or she is ignoring you , and is no cause for offense .
Electronic mail is all about dealing with your communications when you are able to do so .
Do n't assume that the simple fact that you have sent someone a message somehow obliges them to send a reply .
People who are very busy , or who occupy very public positions may simply not have the time to be able to reply to every message they receive , and the fact that yours is one that misses out does n't necessarily reflect badly on either you or the recipient .
Always remember that there is no such thing as a secure mail system .
It is unwise to send very personal or sensitive information by e-mail unless you encrypt it using a reliable encryptor .
Remember the recipient - you are not the only person who could be embarrassed if a delicate message falls into the wrong hands .
Include enough information : if you are sending in a question to which you expect a response , make sure you include enough information to make the response possible .
For example , sending the message
My spreadsheet program does n't work to Microsoft Technical Support really does n't give them very much to work with ; similarly , sending the message
What has happened to my order ?
to a vendor is also unhelpful .
When requesting technical support , include a description of the problem and the version of the program you 're using ; when following up on an order , include the order number , your name and organization , and any other details that might assist in tracing your order - and so on .
" Smiley faces " ( Emoticons ) Electronic mail has very nearly the immediacy of a conversation , but is totally devoid of " body language " .
As many new e-mail users quickly discover , it is depressingly easy to send what you feel is a completely innocent mail message , only to find that the recipient has read things into it that you never intended , and has taken offense .
The Internet " counter - culture " has had an answer to this problem for years - " smiley faces " ( also known as " emoticons " ) , or sequences of characters that are meant to look like a face turned on its side : the idea is that using a smiley face simulates some of the cues you would use in a face - to - face conversation , and reduces the likelihood of being misinterpreted .
The most common smiley faces are probably these : :-) or :)
A smiling face seen side - on ; generally used to indicate amusement , or that a comment is intended to be funny or ironic ( " < g > " or " < grin > " is also sometimes used for the same purpose ) . :-( or :(
An unhappy face seen side on ; generally used to express disappointment or sorrow . ;-)
A winking smiley face ; usually indicates that something should be taken " with a grain of salt " . >;->
A mischievous smiley face ( note the devil 's horns ) ; usually indicates that a comment is intended to be provocative or racy .
There are hundreds of others , some more recognizable than others .
Using the common smiley faces appropriately can markedly improve the clarity of your message and can allow you to express a wider range of sentiments and emotions in what you write .
Like any embellishment , however , overusing them will destroy their value - use them sparingly .
The Bottom Line Above all else , remember that electronic mail is about communication with other people .
When you compose an e-mail message , read it over before sending it and ask yourself what your reaction would be if you received it .
In the end , any time we spend on making our e-mail clearer is time well - spent , so let 's start taking the time .

Expansion of the tropics could mean an increase in droughts Climate change is causing the tropics to widen , with possible impacts on the global food supply , research suggests .
Scientists examined five different measures of the width of the tropical belt , and found it expanded by between 2 and 4.8 degrees latitude since 1979 .
Other researchers meanwhile said climatic change could increase the number of thunderstorms in the US .
The findings emerged as delegates met in Bali for UN climate talks focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
The capacity of poorer countries - many of them in the tropics - to respond and adapt to impacts of climate change will be another major theme of the talks .
Widening belts
The new analysis of tropical expansion comes from a team of US scientists who reviewed five separate strands of evidence , all gathered from satellite data .
While geographers define " The Tropics " rigidly as the region between 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South , to atmospheric scientists it is a more variable zone marked by features such as the jet stream and the circulation known as Hadley cells .
Mapping climate change
New crops for warmer world
On these measures , the tropics have expanded since the era of reliable satellite observation began in 1979 .
" The edges of the tropical belt are the outer boundaries of the subtropical dry zones , and their poleward shift could lead to fundamental shifts in ecosystems and in human settlements , " the researchers write in the journal Nature Geoscience .
" Shifts in precipitation patterns would have obvious implications for agriculture and water resources , and could present serious hardships in marginal areas . "
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) warned in its series of reports this year that serious impacts on food and water supplies lie ahead , including : 75-250 million people across Africa could face water shortages by 2020
Crop yields could increase by 20 % in East and South East Asia , but decrease by up to 30 % in Central and South Asia
Agriculture fed by rainfall could drop by 50 % in some African countries by 2020
The scientists behind the new study note that the tropical zone appears to be expanding much faster than predicted by computer models .
Thunder rolls
While impacts on agriculture could prove important for developing countries , a bigger concern for richer nations such as the US may be the damage wrought by extreme weather .
The IPCC forecasts stronger hurricanes in the future , but possibly fewer of them .
Now another US team is suggesting an increase in thunderstorms over the country as well .
In the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , researchers report a computer modelling study that projects a doubling of the frequency of weather conditions right for the formation of severe thunderstorms .
Already , they write , extreme weather events are costing the US economy more than $ 2bn ( £ 970 m ) each year .

What are these ?
At first , an epidemic of absent - mindedness seemed to have broken out .
One purse was found just sitting on a display shelf in the shoe department at Macy’s .
Another one turned up downstairs , in Macy ’s Cellar .
Yet another rested on a chair in a Midtown McDonald ’s , left by a woman who had stepped into the restroom .
In fact , all three items had been planted by police officers in plainclothes during the previous six weeks .
And the three people who picked them up were arrested , and now face indictment on charges that could land them in state prison .
Nine months ago , a similar police decoy program called Operation Lucky Bag was effectively shut down by prosecutors and judges who were concerned that it was sweeping up the civic - minded alongside those bent on larceny .
Shopping bags , backpacks and purses were left around the subway system , then stealthily watched by undercover officers .
They arrested anyone who took the items and walked past a police officer in uniform without reporting the discovery .
Now , a new version of the operation has started to catch people in public places outside the subways , and at much higher stakes , Criminal Court records show .
Mr Chua admitted he was featured in the DVD on Tuesday
The widely circulated recording showed the married father of three having sex with a female friend in a hotel room .
On Tuesday , amid mounting speculation , he shocked the nation by admitting to being the man featured in the DVD .
This is the latest in a series of problems for PM Abdullah Badawi , who is expected to call an election in the coming weeks .
Apology
According to Malaysia 's Star newspaper , the DVDs are believed to be CCTV recordings made in a hotel suite .
The hotel and the date are unknown .
Copies were reportedly left at various locations in Mr Chua 's home state of Johor , on Saturday , " for people to pick up " .
Mr Chua made his admission on Tuesday , hours after the Star reported that the DVDs were being widely distributed .
" I am the man in the tape , " Mr Chua , 60 , told reporters .
" The girl is a personal friend . "
" I would like to emphasise I did not make the tape myself , " he added .
" Who [ did ] this is not important .
What is most important is that my family , wife and children have accepted my apology . "
As health minister , Mr Chua has advocated giving out free condoms to reduce the spread of HIV , in the face of religious opposition .
The left wing of the antiwar movement has some very serious problems , mainly our inability to recognize that the antiwar sentiment in the United States is resonating far beyond the confines of the so - called “ left . ”
We cannot step back and effectively analyze the failures of the antiwar movement without peering under the hood of John Kerry ’s campaign in 2004 .
In essence , I think the majority of the left made a huge mistake on this issue by not opposing the Democrats ; the movement supported a pro-war position by not opposing Sen.
Kerry , who promised to continue the occupation of Iraq .
There was no pressure on Kerry to alter his position on the war .
No bird - dogging protests along the campaign trail .
No outrage over his flip - flopping - let ’s - send - more - troops - into - battle rhetoric .
Silence during election season is complicity .
So let ’s be loud .
Despite his good intentions , Dennis Kucinich also failed us four years ago as well by abandoning his antiwar platform in favor of Kerry ’s pro-war candidacy .
There is little reason to believe ol ’
Dennis wo n’t do the same thing again this year if Hillary is the nominee .
It was party politics before issues .
Kucinich , unfortunately , was n’t an activist but a pawn in the Democrat ’s game .
And the antiwar movement , or at least those who supported his bid , felt the damaging tremors for months afterward .
Kucinich has been running in Iowa for almost nine years and is barely pulling in 1 % of the vote .
So what ’s the point ?
The backlash to the Iraq war in this country is much larger than Kucinich ’s fan club , yet there is no real visible “ moving ” movement on the ground to end it .
In many ways this is our fault as we are not willing to reach out to antiwar folks across the lines .
A movement will never move forward with archaic sectarian factions or unyielding adherence to entrenched political philosophies .
We must overcome our unwillingness to collaborate and collectively organize .
Case in point being the most visible and enthusiastic antiwar candidate in the country , which we consistently ignore : Rep. Ron Paul .
Whether we agree or disagree with Paul ’s libertarian solution to every problem , we cannot disregard that his campaign is exploding owing to a broad coalition of people who oppose the war on terror .
Paul has built a viable campaign , one that must move beyond the Republican primaries and into the general election .
We ca n’t let Paul become Kucinich of ’ 04 .
The more independent antiwar voices we have running against the war machine the better we ’ll all be .
And Paul has millions in his coffers to push an antiwar agenda .
This is not about Rep .
Paul as an individual per se , but about his grassroots following .
He ’s exciting many newcomers to the movement and that must be welcomed .
We certainly do n’t share the same views with all who have latched on to his campaign , but on the issue of the Iraq war we are in total agreement .
One does n’t not have to be a member of the left to oppose empire .
As a movement that allegedly grew out of WTO protests in Seattle , which was an unimaginable coalition of interests ( labor , environmental , protectionist ) , one would think the left would be at the forefront in calling for such an alliance again today .
Whether we ’re beer - drinking rednecks from Tennessee or pot smokin’ hippies from Oregon , we need to come together .
And working to keep the movement away from supporting a pro-war candidate like Hillary Clinton is an important endeavor .
One we should n’t shy away from over the course of the next 11 months .
Rep .
Paul ’s call to end the war needs to be supported .
We need to monkeywrench the war issue so the media and the big party candidates cannot ignore it .
There is a lot of work that must be done and we cannot be locked in the logic of old if we are to succeed .
Ending the war in Iraq will take substantial pressure from all sides of the political spectrum .
From conservative veterans to radical peaceniks .
Let ’s embrace this new reality .
The antiwar movement is larger than the left , in fact so much so that we may be at the whim of a real grassroots resistance instead of at its forefront .
And if that means bringing this ugly war to a screeching halt , I ’m all for it .
Lab mice were bred to show symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome
US scientists created mice that showed symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome - a leading cause of mental retardation and autism in humans .
They then reversed symptoms of the condition by inhibiting the action of an enzyme in the brain .
The study , by Massachusetts Institute of Technology , appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
This implies that future treatment may still be effective even after symptoms are already pronounced
Dr Susumu Tonegawa
Fragile X Syndrome is linked to mutation in a gene carried on the X chromosome called FMR1 .
It can cause symptoms ranging from mild learning disabilities to severe autism .
The researchers , based at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , targeted an enzyme called PAK which affects the number , size and shape of connection between brain cells .
They found that inhibiting the enzyme stopped mice with Fragile X Syndrome behaving in erratic ways .
Prior to treatment they showed signs of hyperactivity , purposeless and repetitive movements .
Abnormalities corrected
Further analysis showed that not only were structural abnormalities in connections between brain cells righted , proper electrical communication was restored between the cells .
In the brain small protrusions called dendritic spines are responsible for communication between cells .
People with Fragile X Syndrome have more dendritic spines than usual , but each is longer and thinner , and transmits weaker electric signals .
Blocking PAK activity in the lab mice corrected these abnormalities .
Researcher Dr Susumu Tonegawa stressed that the mice were not treated until a few weeks after symptoms of disease first appeared .
" This implies that future treatment may still be effective even after symptoms are already pronounced , " he said .
Professor Eric Klann , of New York University 's Center for Neural Science , agreed that the research was potentially significant .
He said : " This is very exciting because it suggests that PAK inhibitors could be used for therapeutic purposes to reverse already established mental impairments in fragile X children . "

Porting from Windows to a UNIX environment
Most Microsoft® Windows ® - based projects are built using Microsoft Visual Studio® , which has a sophisticated integrated development environment ( IDE ) that automates almost the entire build process for the developer .
In addition , Windows developers use Windows platform - specific application program interfaces ( APIs ) , headers , and language extensions .
Most UNIX ® - like systems , such as SunOS , OpenBSD , and IRIX , do n’t support an IDE or any Windows - specific headers or extensions , thereby making porting a time - consuming activity .
To make matters more complicated , legacy Windows - based code was meant to be run on 16 - bit or 32 - bit x86 architecture .
UNIX - based environments are often 64 - bit , and most UNIX vendors do n’t support the x86 instruction set .
This article , the first in a two - part series , demystifies the process of porting a typical Visual C++ project in a Windows operating system to a g++ environment in SunOS while addressing the aforementioned issues in some detail .
C/C++ project types in Visual Studio
You can use a Visual C++ project to create one of three variants ( single or multi- threaded ) of a project :
Dynamic - link library ( DLL or .dll )
Static library ( LIB or .lib )
Executable ( .exe )
For more complex variants , use a Visual Studio .NET solution — this solution makes it possible to create and manage multiple projects .
The next couple of sections in this document focus on porting dynamic and static library project variants from Windows to UNIX .
Porting a DLL to a UNIX environment
The UNIX equivalent of a .dll file in Windows is a shared object ( . so ) file .
However , the process of creating a . so file is rather different from that of creating a .dll file .
Consider the example in Listing 1 , where you try to create a small .dll file that has a single function , printHello , which is called from the main routine in the main.cpp file .
Listing 1 .
File hello.h containing the declaration for the printHello routine
#ifdef BUILDING_DLL # define PRINT_API __declspec(dllexport ) #else # define PRINT_API __declspec( dllimport ) #endif extern " C " PRINT_API void printHello ( ) ;
Show more
Show more icon
Listing 2 provides the source code for hello.cpp .
Listing 2 . File hello.cpp
# include < iostream > # include " hello.h " void printHello { std::cout << " hello Windows / UNIX users
" ; } extern " C " PRINT_API void printHello ( ) ;
Show more
Show more icon
If you use the Microsoft 32 - bit C/C++ standard compiler for 80 ×86 platforms ( cl ) , the following command creates the hello.dll file :
cl /LD hello.cpp /DBUILDING_DLL
Show more
Show more icon
/ LD instructs cl to create a .dll file .
( It can be instructed to create other formats such as .exe or .obj . )
/ DBUILDING_DLL defines the PRINT_API macro for this particular building process so that the printHello symbol is exported from this DLL .
Listing 3 contains the main.cpp main source file , which uses the printHello routine .
The assumption here is that hello.h , hello.cpp , and main.cpp are all in the same folder .
Listing 3 . Main sources using the printHello routine
#include " hello.h " int main ( ) { printHello( ) ; return 0 ; } Show more Show more icon
To compile and link the main code , use the following command line :
cl main.cpp hello.lib
Show more
Show more icon
A quick inspection of the sources and generated output reveals two important facts .
First , the Windows - specific syntax , __declspec( dllexport ) , is needed to export any functions , variables , or classes from a DLL .
Likewise , the Windows - specific syntax , __declspec( dllimport ) , is needed to import any functions , variables , or classes from a DLL .
And second , the compilation generates two files : printHello.dll and printHello.lib .
PrintHello.lib is used to link the main sources , and the UNIX headers for shared objects do n’t need the declspec syntax .
The output of a successful compilation is a single . so file that gets linked with the main sources .
To create a shared library in UNIX platforms using g++ , compile all source files as relocatable shared objects by passing the - fPIC flag to g++ .
PIC stands for position independent code .
A shared library is potentially mapped to a new memory address every time it gets loaded .
Therefore , it makes sense to generate the addresses of all variables and functions inside the library in a way that can be easily computed relative to the start address that the library is loaded to .
This code is generated by the - fPIC option and makes the code relocatable .
The -o option is used to specify the name of an output file , and the - shared option builds a shared library in which unresolved references are allowed .
To create the hello . so file , you must modify the header , as shown in Listing 4 below .
Listing 4 . Modified header for hello.h with UNIX - specific changes
# if defined ( __GNUC__ ) && defined ( __unix__ ) # define PRINT_API __attribute__ ( ( __visibility__ ( " default " ) ) ) #elif defined ( WIN32 ) #ifdef BUILDING_DLL # define PRINT_API __declspec(dllexport ) #else # define PRINT_API __declspec( dllimport ) #endif extern " C " PRINT_API void printHello ( ) ;

Symbol hiding in g++
There are two typical ways to export symbols from a Windows - based DLL .
The first method is to use __declspec( dllexport ) only on select elements ( for example , classes , global variables , or global functions ) that are exported from the DLL .
The second method is to use a module - definition ( . def ) file .
. def files have their own syntax and contain the symbols that need to be exported from the DLL .
The default behavior of the g++ linker is to export all the symbols from a . so file .
This might not be desirable , and it makes linking multiple DLLs a time - consuming task .
To selectively export symbols from a shared library , use the g++ attribute mechanism .
For example , consider that the user sources have two methods , ' void print1 ( ) ; ' and ' int print2 ( char* ) ; ' , and the user needs to export print2 only .
Listing 5 encloses a means of achieving this in both Windows and UNIX .
Listing 5 . Hiding symbols in g++
#ifdef _MSC_VER // Visual Studio specific macro #ifdef BUILDING_DLL # define DLLEXPORT __declspec(dllexport ) #else # define DLLEXPORT __declspec( dllimport ) #endif # define DLLLOCAL #else # define DLLEXPORT __attribute__ ( ( visibility ( " default " ) ) ) # define DLLLOCAL __attribute__ ( ( visibility ( " hidden " ) ) ) #endif extern " C " DLLLOCAL void print1 ( ) ; // print1 hidden extern " C " DLLEXPORT int print2 ( char* ) ; // print2 exported Show more

Using __attribute__ ( ( visibility ( " hidden " ) ) ) prevents symbol exporting from a DLL .
The latest versions of g++ ( 4.0.0 and higher ) also provide the - fvisibility switch , which you can use to selectively export symbols from a shared library .
Using g++ with - fvisibility =hidden in a command line suspends exporting of all symbols from a shared library , except for those that have been declared with __attribute__ ( ( visibility ( " default " ) ) ) .
This is a neat way of telling g++ that every declaration that is not explicitly marked with a visibility attribute has a hidden visibility .
Using dlsym to extract a hidden symbol returns NULL .
Overview of the attribute mechanism in g++
Much like the Visual Studio environment , which provides a lot of additional syntax on top of C/ C++ , g++ supports many non-standard extensions to the language .
One of these , the attribute mechanism in g++ , is handy for porting purposes .
The previous example discussed symbol hiding .
Yet another use of attributes is to set function types , such as cdecl , stdcall , and fastcall , to Visual C++.
Part 2 of this series discusses the attribute mechanism in greater detail .
Explicit DLL or shared object loading in a UNIX environment
In Windows systems , it is quite common to for a .dll file to be explicitly loaded by a Windows program .
For example , consider a sophisticated Windows - based editor that has printing capabilities .
Such an editor would dynamically load the DLL for the printer driver the first time a user makes the corresponding request .
Windows - based developers use the Visual Studio - provided APIs , such as LoadLibrary , to explicitly load a DLL , GetProcAddress to query for a symbol from the DLL , and FreeLibrary to unload an explicitly loaded DLL .
The UNIX equivalents for the same functions are the dlopen , dlsym , and dlclose routines .
Further , in Windows , there ’s a special DllMain method that is invoked the first time the DLL is loaded onto memory .
UNIX - like systems have a corresponding method called _init .
Consider a variant of the previous example .
Listing 6 is the loadlib.h header file , which is used in the sources that call the main method .
Listing 6 . Header file loadlib.h
#ifndef __LOADLIB_H #define __LOADLIB_H #ifdef UNIX # include < dlfcn.h > #endif # include < iostream > using namespace std ; typedef void * ( * funcPtr ) ( ) ; #ifdef UNIX # define IMPORT_DIRECTIVE __attribute__(( __visibility__(" default " ) ) ) # define CALL #else # define IMPORT_DIRECTIVE __declspec(dllimport ) # define CALL __stdcall #endif extern " C " { IMPORT_DIRECTIVE void * CALL LoadLibrary A ( const char* s LibName ) ; IMPORT_DIRECTIVE funcPtr CALL GetProcAddress ( void* h Module , const char * lpProcName ) ; IMPORT_DIRECTIVE bool CALL FreeLibrary ( void* h Lib ) ; } #endif Show more Show more icon
The main method now explicitly loads the printHello.dll file and invokes the print method for the same , as shown in Listing 7 .
Listing 7 . Main file Loadlib.cpp
#include " loadlib.h " int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { #ifndef UNIX char * fileName = " hello.dll " ; void * library Handle = LoadLibrary A( fileName ) ; if ( libraryHandle == NULL ) cout << " dll not found " << endl ; else // make a call to " printHello " from the hello.dll ( GetProcAddress( libraryHandle , " printHello " ) ) ( ) ; FreeLibrary ( libraryHandle ) ; #else // unix void ( * voidfnc ) ( ) ; char * fileName = " hello.so " ; void * library Handle = dlopen ( fileName , RTLD_LAZY ) ; if ( libraryHandle == NULL ) cout << " shared object not found " << endl ; else // make a call to " printHello " from the hello . so { voidfnc = ( void ( *)() )dlsym(libraryHandle , " printHello " ) ; ( * voidfnc ) ( ) ; } dlclose ( libraryHandle ) ; #endif return 0 ; } Show more Show more icon
DLL search path in Windows and UNIX environments
In Windows operating systems , a DLL is searched in the following order :
Directory where the executable is located ( for example , notepad.exe in Windows )
Current working directory ( That is , the directory from which notepad.exe is launched . )
Windows system directory ( typically C: \Windows \System32 ) Windows directory ( typically C: \Windows )
Directories listed as part of the PATH environment variable
In UNIX - like systems , such as Solaris , the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable specifies the shared library search order .
The path to a new shared library needs to be appended to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable .
The search order for HP - UX involves directories listed as part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH followed by those in SHLIB_PATH .
For IBM AIX ® operating systems , it ’s the LIBPATH variable that determines the shared library search order .
Porting a static library from Windows to UNIX
The object code of static libraries , as opposed to dynamic link libraries , is linked when the application compiles and , as such , becomes a part of the application .
Static libraries in UNIX systems follow a naming convention , where lib is prefixed and .a is suffixed to the library name .
For example , the Windows user.lib file would typically be named libuser . a in a UNIX system .
The operating system - provided commands ar and ranlib are used to create static libraries .
Listing 8 illustrates how to create a static library , libuser .a , from the user_sqrt1.cpp and user_log1.cpp source files .
Listing 8 .
Creating a static library in a UNIX environment
g++ -o user_sqrt1.o - c user_sqrt1.cpp g++ -o user_log1.o -c user_log1.cpp ar rc libuser .a user_sqrt1.o user_log1.o ranlib libuser .a
Show more
Show more icon
The ar tool creates a static library , libuser.a , and puts copies of the user_sqrt1.o and user_log1. o object files in it .
If there is an existing library file , the object files are added to it .
If the object files being used are newer than those inside the library , the older ones are replaced .
The r flag replaces older object files in the library with newer versions of the same object files .
If it does n’t exist yet , the c option creates the library .
After a new archive is created or an existing one is modified , an index of archive contents needs to be created and stored as part of the archive .
The index lists each symbol , defined by a member of an archive , that is a relocatable object file .
The index speeds up linking with the static library and allows routines in the library to be called , irrespective of their actual placement inside the library .
Note that the GNU ranlib is an extension of the ar tool , and invoking ar with an s argument , [ ar - s ] , has the same effect as invoking ranlib .
Precompiled headers
C/C++ - based applications in Visual C++ often use precompiled headers .
Precompiled headers are a performance feature that certain compilers , such as cl in Visual Studio , provide to help speed up compilation .
Complex applications often make use of header ( .h or .hpp ) files , which are sections of code that are meant to be included as part of one or more source files .
The header files are modified only rarely during the scope of a project .
Thus , to speed up compilation , these files can be converted into an intermediate form that is easier for the compiler to understand so that subsequent compilations are faster .
This intermediate form is called precompiled header files or PCH in the Visual Studio environment .
Consider the example involving hello.cpp in Listings Listing 1 and Listing 2 earlier in this article .
The inclusion of iostream and the definition of the EXPORT_API macro can be considered code - invariant parts of the file throughout the scope of the project .
Thus , they are good candidates for inclusion in a header file .
Listing 9 shows what the code looks like with the relevant changes .
Listing 9 . Contents of precomp.h
#ifndef __PRECOMP_H #define __PRECOMP_H #include < iostream > # if defined ( __GNUC__ ) && defined ( __unix__ ) # define EXPORT_API __attribute__(( __visibility__(" default " ) ) ) # elif defined WIN32 # define EXPORT_API __declspec(dllexport ) # endif Show more

Listing 10 shows the source code of the DLL with the relevant changes .
Listing 10 .
Contents of new hello.cpp file
#include " precomp.h " # pragma hdrstop extern " C " EXPORT_API void printHello ( ) { std::cout << " hello Windows / UNIX users " << std::endl ; } Show more
Show more icon
As the name suggests , a precompiled header file contains object code in a compiled form that is included before the header stop point .
This point in the source file is usually marked by a lexeme that is not consumed as a token by the preprocessor , meaning one that is not a preprocessor directive .
Alternatively , this header stop point can also be specified as # pragma hdrstop , if it is encountered in the sources before a valid non-preprocessor language keyword in the source text .
In a Solaris build , a precompiled header file is searched for when #include is in the compilation .
As it searches for the included file , the compiler looks for a precompiled header in each directory just before it looks for the include file in that directory .
The name searched for is the name specified in the #include with .gch appended .
If the precompiled header file ca n’t be used , it is ignored .
Here is the command line for achieving precompiled header facility in Windows :
cl / Yc precomp.h hello.cpp /DWIN32 /LD
Show more
Show more icon
/ Yc tells the cl compiler to generate the precompiled header from precomp.h .
The same functionality is achieved in Solaris using the following lines :
g++ precomp.h g++ - fPIC -G hello.cpp -o hello.so
Show more
Show more icon
The first command creates the precompiled header precomp.h.gch .
The rest of the procedure for generating the shared object is the same as described earlier in the article .
Note : Support for precompiled headers in g++ is available for versions 3.4 and above .
Conclusion
Vandals egg house of local atheist
The home of a local outspoken atheist was vandalized overnight Friday , police said -- with eggs tossed at the house and cars , and crosses and religious words scrawled in chalk on the driveway .
A church bulletin also was stuck on the front door .
The incident comes days after Rob Sherman 's daughter , Dawn , led a successful effort to have the song " God Bless America " yanked from Buffalo Grove High School 's homecoming celebration .
Dawn Sherman is a freshman on the student council .
The vandalism likely was the retaliatory work of youngsters , police Sgt. Mike Millett said -- since it came on the heels of the school incident and because one of the chalked words , " Jesus , " was misspelled .
Mr Bernier said he regretted the embarrassment the manual caused
Maxime Bernier said the list , which formed part of a manual on torture awareness given to diplomats , " wrongly includes some of our closest allies " .
Mr Bernier insisted the manual was not a policy document and did not convey the official views of his government .
The listing was criticised by the US and Israel , who demanded it be changed .
" We find it to be offensive for us to be on the same list with countries like Iran and China .
Quite frankly it 's absurd , " said the US ambassador to Canada , David Wilkins .
A spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Ottawa , Michael Mendel , said the Israeli Supreme Court was " on record as expressly prohibiting any type of torture " .
" If Israel is included in the list in question , the ambassador of Israel would expect its removal , " he added .
' Reviewed and rewritten '
In a statement on Saturday , Mr Bernier said he regretted the embarrassment caused by the public disclosure of the list and promised it would be changed to reflect the Canadian government 's official position .
The manual is neither a policy document nor a statement of policy - it does not convey the government 's views or positions

" It contains a list that wrongly includes some of our closest allies .
I have directed that the manual be reviewed and rewritten , " he said .
" The manual is neither a policy document nor a statement of policy .
As such , it does not convey the government 's views or positions . "
The manual lists US interrogation techniques such as forced nudity , isolation , sleep deprivation and the blindfolding of prisoners under its " definition of torture " .
It also refers to the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , where a Canadian man , Omar Khadr , is being held .
Critics say it ridicules Ottawa 's claims that he is not being mistreated .
The manual refers to Guantanamo Bay where a Canadian is being held
Other countries on the watch list include Afghanistan , China , Iran , Israel , Mexico , Saudi Arabia and Syria .
The document was mistakenly provided to the human rights group , Amnesty International , as part of a court case it is bringing against the Canadian government over the treatment of detainees in Afghanistan .
The torture awareness course was introduced after Ottawa was strongly criticised for its handling of the case of a Canadian who was deported from the US to Syria in 2002 .
Syrian - born Maher Arar , who was accused of being an al - Qaeda member , has said he was tortured during the 10 months he was detained in a prison in Damascus .
An inquiry exonerated him of any links to terrorist groups in 2006 .
A TV writer - producer named Kevin G. Boyd has had an inspiration : ultra - premium drinking water selling for a very , ahem , splashy price -- around $ 38 per 750 - milliliter bottle .
The water comes from the highly regarded English Mountain Spring source in Tennessee and goes through a nine - step purification process .
And then it 's packaged in glazed bottles hand - decorated with sparkly Swarovsky crystals .
Wow .
How Hollywood is that ?
The brand name ?
Bling H2O , of course .
( Warning : mildly racy home page on that website . )
You can buy online , so if none of your local stores is selling Bling H2O , you can still order yourself a bling -y New Year's .
P.S. If you can do without the bling part , the company also sells the same water in 500 - milliliter screw - top plastic bottles .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People who are depressed about their cancer are no more likely to die than people who keep a positive outlook , U.S. researchers reported on Monday .
Cancer patients are often encouraged to stay as happy as possible and many people believe that a positive outlook helps recovery and survival .
Dr. James Coyne and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania set out to see if this was really true .
They analyzed data from two studies of the emotional states of 1,093 patients with head and neck cancer .
Over the time of the two studies , 646 patients died .
The analysis showed that emotional status was not associated with survival rate .
A person ’s emotions were not associated with survival even after taking into account other factors , such as gender , tumor site or disease stage , Coyne and colleagues report in the journal Cancer .
“ The hope that we can fight cancer by influencing emotional states appears to have been misplaced , ” Coyne said in a statement .
“ If cancer patients want psychotherapy or to be in a support group , they should be given the opportunity to do so .
There can be lots of emotional and social benefits .
But they should not seek such experiences solely on the expectation that they are extending their lives . ”
The Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) cooperatively analyzed oceanic and atmospheric observation data and sea ice data acquired by satellites , and found that the sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean has been decreasing at a much faster pace than expected compared to the previous worst record in the summer of 2005 .
After satellite observations started in 1978 , the observed area shrunk to its lowest level on August 15 , 2007 .
Ice melting normally continues until mid September , thus further shrinkage of the sea ice area is expected .
The observed phenomenon significantly exceeded the forecasted model submitted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) fourth Assessment Report , and the big difference tells us that the model may not precisely reflect the actual situation in the Arctic Ocean .
The following are findings as a result of analysis of observation data acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer ( AMSR - E ) .
The AMSR - E acquires observation data and visible images of sea ice density .
1. Since July , the smallest record of sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean has been broken every day .
2 . Since the beginning of August , the shrinkage of sea ice has been accelerated by a low pressure system generated and lingering off Siberia .
3 . On August 15 , the total sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean reached a new low .
4 . If this pace of melting continues , the sea ice area reduction pace may significantly exceed the IPCC forecast , and it may actually reach the forecasted values for 2040 to 2050 .
This picture shows Sept. 22 2005 the previous worst ice cover ever recorded .
This picture shows Sept. 16 2006
On August 15 , 2007 , the area got smaller than the worst record marked in September 2005 .
The receding of sea ice is especially noticeable toward the North Pole in North American Coastal areas and the Northern ocean area of East Siberia .
The following are estimated causes of accelerated sea ice reduction this year as a result of the comprehensive analysis of the observation data acquired by JAMSTEC including observation data by ships , continued observation by drifting buoys ( JCAD , POPS * 2 ) and atmospherics data .
1. Sea ice reduction has been observed not only along the coast of Alaska but also along the Arctic Ocean shore of Canada this year .
Accordingly , the impact of friction from coastal areas is smaller than usual thus sea ice tends to move in a large scale .
This fragile and easy - to - melt ice , that has just formed in coastal areas , spreads into the Arctic Ocean .
2 . As this fragile ice moves into the Arctic Ocean it melts quickly and the ocean water is able to absorb more sunshine , warming the water and further accelerating the melting .
3 . More sea ice has been drifting toward the Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic Ocean , decreasing the volume of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean .
A graph showing the change in the sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean between 2002 and 2007 .
Until this June , the area change trend was about the same as previous years , but since July , each day sets a new low record .
On August 15 , the previous worst record marked in Sept. 2005 was broken more than one month earlier .
The shrinking area is expected to continue , and new records are expected .
If you are into this sort of thing you can find the most up to date image of the shrinking arctic ice here .
So what does this all mean ?
A : The IPCC report has erred on the side of caution , by a lot .
B : It seems we simply do n’t understand just how fast these feedback loops are going to warm the temperature of the Arctic .
C : We almost surly have less time than we had assumed to make strong changes to the way we live our lives .
It is not just polar bears that will be effected by an ice free arctic , although they most certainly will .
All that fresh water could disrupt global sea currents that rely on cold salty water to flow , which could in turn effect weather all over the planet ( and not in a good way ) .
Call , email , phone your senator and representative and badger them about this , send them links to these sites , and let them know we want action now to reduce green house gases , that we want renewable energy , and that we want it now .
The particulars of Alexandra Gammelgard ’s egg donations are a bit of a blur to her .
Between the ages 18 and 21 , she donated to at least four infertile couples , using two , maybe three , agencies that paid her from $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 for each donation .
She was trying to pay for her education at UC San Diego and did n’t keep track of the details .
“ The college years of your life go by so fast , and you do so many crazy , random things that it ’s hard to remember it all , ” Gammelgard , now 23 , says .
She believes at least four children were conceived from her eggs , results she was proud of .
In recent months , however , she got grim news : One has Tay - Sachs , a neurological disease that usually kills its victims before age 5 .
A child can develop the disease only if both parents carry a relatively rare genetic mutation .
Gammelgard said she had no clue she was a carrier ; she had n’t been tested because she was n’t in the groups at highest risk .
She knows now .
The couple raising the sick child contacted the agency that arranged Gammelgard ’s egg donation .
The agency told her .
But neither she nor the agency has made any effort to inform the other families who used Gammelgard as a donor .
In the United States , nothing ensures that recipients of donated eggs or sperm are warned about defects later discovered in the donor ’s family tree .
In contrast to blood donations , no one tracks donors and their products .
The system is founded largely on a pledge of confidentiality -- the promise that the donor and recipients will remain strangers , linked only through third parties .
Donors typically sign contracts severing parental rights and most obligations .
But genetic ties endure .
When flaws in DNA slip through the screening process , they may fan out over generations , undetected until it is too late .
Even if Gammelgard ’s other children do not have Tay - Sachs , they have a 50 % chance of carrying the mutation .
And these children , if they grow up to conceive babies with other Tay - Sachs carriers , have a 25 % chance of passing along the disease .
For all Gammelgard knows , couples may have embryos made from her eggs in storage , awaiting implantation .
Others may have conceived children she has n’t heard about .
“ It ’s awful that in the United States right now , the buck stops with this young lady who donated , ” said Elizabeth Stephen , an associate professor of demography at Georgetown University who has studied the fertility industry .
“ There is no tracking system and no enforcement . ”
‘ A big family ’
Bruce Steiger recalls telling Rick Karl on one of their first dates : “ I want to have a family -- a big family . ”
Karl , raised as a conservative Catholic , had never considered the possibility .
Over the years , Steiger convinced him that their well - paying jobs in the high - tech industry were going to get them only so far down the path to happiness .
“ I ’ve always considered having children to be pretty much out of the question , and that saddens me , ” Karl remembers telling Steiger one day in 2002 during a walk along the ocean in Long Beach .
“ So , if we can do this , let ’s go do it . ”
Through a gay parents group , they found an agency , Surrogate Alternatives in Chula Vista , that specialized in finding women to provide eggs and surrogates to carry the child , for a fee .
Such agencies typically are small , for - profit operations , drawing donors and surrogates through ads and clients via the Internet or word of mouth .
Operated by a surrogate mother from her home , Surrogate Alternatives is essentially a matchmaker .
Although the 9 - year - old agency has a website highlighting its links with fertility doctors , it has no medical staff .
Outside doctors , recommended by the agency or chosen by the client , handle genetic testing as well as egg harvesting , fertilization and implantation .
Steiger and Karl had a rough start .
After they selected a donor , a surrogate and a clinic , embryos were created in the lab using the donor ’s eggs and both men ’s sperm .
But two efforts to impregnate the surrogate failed .
They intended to try a third time , but the donor failed a drug test .
A second egg donor did n’t work out either .
At that point , “ we wanted an egg donor and a surrogate who had a track record , ” said Steiger , now 42 .
“ We did n’t want to take any more chances . ”
Gammelgard seemed a good bet .
She ’d already helped at least one other couple conceive , through a different agency .
As a freshman , she ’d noticed an ad in her college paper .
“ It was like ‘ Be an angel , ’ she recalled .
“ ‘ Make money for college .
A family is looking for a donor . ’ ”
She got in touch with several agencies , fielding offers from one , then another .
“ I feel like I look good on paper , ” she said , noting that she was a high school valedictorian with interests in art and sports .
After examining Surrogate Alternatives ’
Web catalog of donors , Karl and Steiger thought so too .
She was tall , athletic and blond .
She cited no serious family health problems .
The couple picked her based mostly on a picture and questionnaire .
She had written : “ I feel like egg - donating is my gift to give to the world . ”
Growing numbers
The number of American children born from donated eggs grows each year , reaching about 6,500 in 2005 .
Donated sperm accounts for an estimated tens of thousands of births annually .
Many recipients and donors contact broker agencies with the assumption that screening and testing will be as thorough as the field of genetic science allows .
After all , clients are spending a lot of money .
Karl and Steiger estimate they spent about $ 250,000 on conception alone , with about 10 % of that going to Surrogate Alternatives .
In reality , scrutiny of donors varies widely .
Tay - Sachs testing can be done for between $ 100 and $ 250 , but fertility doctors say testing everyone for every known genetic disorder would be prohibitively expensive and is unnecessary .
Testing generally is limited to certain diseases linked to known high - risk groups .
In the case of Tay - Sachs , that would be Jews and French Canadians .
There are no governmental regulations , only guidelines set by medical societies .
In recent years , some parents have alleged that inadequate screening has led to tragic results .
In 2003 , a Santa Barbara family received a confidential settlement from a Los Angeles sperm bank that allegedly overlooked a prolific donor ’s family history of kidney disease .
Their daughter inherited the illness , which could cut short her life .
Even if industry guidelines are followed to the letter , rare genetic conditions sometimes slip through .
Because there is neither a tracking system to catch problems nor a limit on how many families can use the same donor , the effects can multiply before anyone notices .
A Michigan sperm donor unwittingly carried a rare mutation that put his progeny at risk for leukemia and serious infection .
He fathered at least 11 children , five with the disease .
The pattern was noticed and reported in a medical journal last year -- only because of a coincidence :
The same medical specialist treated the children .
Britain does things differently .
Sixteen years ago , the government created a registry for egg and sperm donors , mostly to prevent offspring from inadvertently marrying relatives .
Included are names , contact information and detailed personal histories .
Donors and recipients have access to the registry , as do children once they turn 18 .
Britain also limits the number of families that can use a single donor .
An approach like Britain ’s would be a departure from the American tradition , which relies heavily on anonymous donation with no strings attached .
But some U.S. fertility experts favor a voluntary registry that would include disease histories and pregnancy outcomes .
“ The beauty of it is that the information helps everybody , ” said Andrea Braverman , a Pennsylvania psychologist who is on a task force preparing a proposal .
“ If you are having a child , you ’d like to know that there were no problems with children born from that egg donor .
And if you ’re the donor , when it comes time to have children of your own , it might be nice to know there were no genetic disorders related to your donated eggs . ”
Screening promised
Steiger said Surrogate Alternatives promised him and Karl that their egg donor would undergo a thorough screening .
What they did n’t know is that few rules guide this process .
Genetic screening is a loose term that encompasses everything from a few questions on paper to an in - person interview with a certified counselor trained to find inherited diseases lurking in the family tree .
Even if all the right questions are asked , donors may not know all the answers , and some downplay the risks in pursuit of money .
Testing , performed by doctors , is generally based on what the screening yields .
Gammelgard recalled meeting “ at some point ” with a genetic counselor , although she said she did not know if it was for Karl and Steiger ’s case .
“ You go through all the family members you can remember , where they came from , any health problems , ” she recalled .
She said she reported what she had been told since she was 5 years old : that she was mostly Scandinavian .
Although she did n’t say so on her Surrogate Alternatives questionnaire , she told The Times she had some “ Irish French Catholic ” lineage on her mother ’s side .
The risk of carrying a Tay - Sachs mutation for most Caucasians is about 1 in 300 .
It is about 10 times greater for Jews of European heritage and French Canadians , for whom medical experts recommend testing .
But Gammelgard said she was a member of neither group .
Irish Americans have a risk as high as 1 in 50 , but testing is not recommended .
Karl and Steiger said they were not screened or tested for genetic abnormalities .
They said they were n’t asked .
After the initial setbacks , the couple wanted a fresh start .
They selected a new doctor , a well - known Westwood reproductive endocrinologist named Vicken Sahakian , to handle the fertility treatments and implantation .
“ She was pure Scandinavian background , so there was no reason to test for Tay - Sachs , ” Sahakian said of Gammelgard .
“ I still to this day wish there was something I could have done to prevent this , but there was n’t . ”
Legally , Karl and Steiger were on notice about the risks .
They signed a contract with Surrogate Alternatives stating that the baby ’s health was not guaranteed .
But they now believe someone -- the agency or the doctor or both -- dropped the ball .
Gammelgard agrees .
“ Why were n’t we offered this test ? ” Steiger asked .
“ It would have totally prevented this from happening . ”
Pregnancy at last
After several attempts , the surrogate hired by Karl and Steiger got pregnant in May 2005 .
The initial ultrasound exam showed twins .
“ We were excited .
After so many tries , we thought that maybe it just made sense that we would end up with two children instead of one , ” said Karl , now 47 .
After 15 weeks , though , the surrogate miscarried one fetus .
Karl and Steiger recalled that their obstetrician assured them that the other was healthy .
So it seemed when Krystie was born in January 2006 , on Karl ’s birthday .
For the first few months , she hit all the milestones .
At 10 months , though , her development stalled .
She was n’t interacting as much .
She could n’t crawl .
She had trouble focusing her gaze .
Karl and Steiger took her to neurologists and occupational therapists , but it was an ophthalmologist who noticed the telltale cherry - red spots on her retina .
Krystie was diagnosed the day before her first birthday .
The couple had intended to keep paternity a mystery .
Both men ’s sperm was mixed with Gammelgard ’s eggs .
When they found out Krystie was sick , though , doctors said identifying the mutation that caused the disease might help treat it .
Karl was found to be the Tay - Sachs carrier and , by inference , Krystie ’s father .
He is of Irish American heritage but had no Tay - Sachs in his family that he knew of .
The test results suggested a mutation typical of French Canadians .
“ I will always have this incredible amount of guilt because I ’m the one who did this to our daughter , ” Karl said .
The couple resolved to make sure it did n’t happen again , at least with this donor .
The problem was in getting everyone down the line to communicate and cooperate .
Steiger and Karl knew little more than Gammelgard ’s birth date and first name .
So they asked Surrogate Alternatives to tell Gammelgard what had happened and arrange for a genetic test .
They wanted to determine the mutation she carried , in hopes of helping Krystie .
This would also confirm that Gammelgard was the donor .
Surrogate Alternatives ’ owner said she reached Gammelgard once and asked her to be tested but said she was unable to contact her again to follow up .
“ Her phone number has changed , ” owner Diane Van De Voort - Perez told The Times .
The newspaper found Gammelgard in the San Francisco Bay Area by using public records and Internet message boards .
She contradicted Van De Voort - Perez ’s account , saying she has had the same cellphone number since college and was in continual e-mail contact with Surrogate Alternatives in the months after Krystie ’s diagnosis .
Several e-mails she provided appeared to support her assertion .
She said she gladly would have been tested if Surrogate Alternatives had arranged for it and paid the costs in advance .
The agency wanted Gammelgard to do the legwork and then ask for reimbursement , according to her account , which is supported by e-mails she furnished .
“ That just pissed me off , ” Gammelgard said .
“ I said , ‘ Look , this is not my fault . ’ ”
As for the other recipients of Gammelgard ’s eggs , Van De Voort - Perez said Surrogate Alternatives has no way of contacting them .
Different agencies handled all of her other donations , she said , and her agency never asked which they were .
Sahakian said he treated one of the other women who conceived using Gammelgard ’s eggs but gave conflicting accounts of what transpired .
In an initial interview , he told The Times that he had not warned the woman about the Tay - Sachs risk .
He also said he had treated the woman before Krystie ’s conception , citing that successful birth as a reason why he thought Gammelgard was a safe choice as a donor for Karl and Steiger .
Asked for details weeks later , he said he had been mistaken :
He had treated the woman after Krystie ’s conception .
Once he knew about Krystie ’s Tay - Sachs mutation , he said , he had warned the woman about the risk .
The woman ’s baby is healthy , he said , although he would not say whether the baby had been tested for the Tay - Sachs mutation .
“ I ca n’t go out and tell every agency in the country to watch out for this donor , ” Sahakian said .
“ I would be totally breaking the law because I would be revealing her [ Gammelgard ’s ] private information .
“ The really scary thing is that nothing would stop her from donating again , ” he said .
“ She could simply go to another agency , another doctor , and not say anything about what happened . ”
Gammelgard said she assumes she carries the mutation and that she is through with egg donation .
But she said she is not inclined to try to contact the other agencies she worked with .
She does not recall their names , she said .
“ I kind of washed my hands of it , ” she said , “ and walked away . ”
A fragile child
Krystie is now nearly 2 , still fragile after an experimental stem cell transplant aimed at prolonging her life .
She was recently fitted with foot braces , in case she is ever able to walk .
Mostly , she sleeps .
“ Knowing what this disease is and what it does to kids , it ’s beyond my understanding how someone can play the dice by not telling other parents , ” said Dr. Lawrence Charnas , a neurologist treating Krystie at the University of Minnesota Children ’s Hospital in Fairview , Minn .
Steiger and Karl have all but moved from their Rancho Mirage home to be near the hospital .
Their careers are mostly on hold .
They keep a blog , detailing Krystie ’s hemoglobin levels , her steroid regimen , her days of vomiting and pain , her nights of crankiness and crying .
They rejoice over small improvements , grateful she is still alive .
They have helped launch the Cure Tay - Sachs Foundation , curetay - sachs.org , to raise money for research .
They wish they could do more .
“ Those other parents have a right to know what might happen to their children or that their children might be carriers of this disease , ” Karl said .
“ But there ’s nothing we can do about it .
We do n’t even know who they are . ”

Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Going Way of Northern Cod
By Stephen Leahy
Aug 6 ( IPS ) – Fishing wiped out Atlantic Bluefin tuna stocks in Northern Europe 50 years ago , according to a new study , while ongoing pressure on the remaining stocks is pushing the entire species to the edge of extinction .
Every summer in the early 1900s , Northern European waters from Holland to northern Norway teemed with Atlantic Bluefin tuna , some three metres long and weighing 700 kilogrammes , according to historical fishing records .
Few could catch the powerful , fast - swimming fish until the 1930s and 1940s when bigger , faster boats with better catch gear were designed .
“ The Bluefin population crashed in the 1960s and more than 40 years later it still has n’t recovered , ” said Brian MacKenzie of the Technical University of Denmark , who led the study to be published in the journal Fisheries Research .
“ You simply do n’t see bluefins in these waters any more , ” MacKenzie told IPS .
There is a clear parallel to the more recent collapse of once abundant Northern Cod stocks .
Also fished into near extinction on the other side of the Atlantic , the Cod have not recovered despite a no- fishing ban for the past 15 years .
“ I ’m afraid what happened to the Bluefin is similar to what happened to the Northern Cod , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Atlantic Bluefin are under intense fishing pressure , including use of spotter planes and helicopters , in the Mediterranean Sea region .
Bluefin are highly desired by the Japanese sushi market , with single fish selling for 60,000 dollars — the record is 174,000 dollars for a 444 - pound Bluefin tuna .
The Atlantic Bluefin fishery is regulated by the 44 - nation International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna ( ICCAT ) that set a 2007 quota of 29,000 tonnes , down from the previous year ’s quota of 32,000 for the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic .
Marine biologists and environmental groups say the ICCAT quota is twice what is sustainable .
Moreover the WWF , an international environmental group , says illegal fishing is rampant in the region and an independent study revealed the actual annual tuna catch approached 50,000 tonnes .
Atlantic Bluefin range across the entire Atlantic Ocean with three distinct populations .
The largest population breeds in the Mediterranean Sea , another is found in the western Atlantic and the third is found in the South Atlantic and is considered by many to be an endangered species , explains Barbara Block , a marine biologist at Stanford University and chief scientist of the Census of Marine Life Tagging of Pacific Predators programme and the Tag - a - Giant Bluefin tagging programme .
The western Atlantic population that breeds in the Gulf of Mexico is also in poor shape , suffering from a 90 percent decline in fish of breeding age , but despite that there is commercial fishing with a quota of 2,100 tonnes for this year .
“ There are few Bluefins mature enough to breed in the Gulf of Mexico , ” Block , one the world ’s foremost tuna experts , said in an interview .
Block and colleagues have been placing electronic tags on Bluefins for several years to learn more about their movements and breeding areas .

The 100,000 Turkish troops massing near the border with Iraq is a palpable presence here in the predominantly Kurdish towns of southeastern Turkey .
Heard above the shouts of children playing on the streets in this small city of Yuksekova are the thump - thump of military helicopters shuttling troops and supplies .
Periodically , armored vehicles merge with the honking cars and trucks .
On Sunday , Turkish soldiers killed 20 Kurdish guerrillas in a major military operation against separatist rebels about 400 miles northwest of here , Army sources told Reuters .
Residents in Yuksekova are sympathetic to the rebel aims of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) but are tired of the fighting .
They worry that recent political gains will be lost .
In the July parliamentary election , most voters here put their weight behind a mainstream political party – the ruling Law and Justice Party ( AKP ) .
In recent years , the PKK has been losing clout , but some analysts worry the current march toward war could revive local support for the rebels .
" I am 30 years old and this current government is the most democratic government that I have seen , " Ismail Arslan , a Yuksekova radio journalist .
" But I do n't think the government can continue in its democratic ways in the current situation . "
In response to stepped - up attacks from the PKK across the nearby Iraq border , public support for a tough , military response is building in Turkey .
As part of this fight with the PKK , some analysts expect Turkish troops will restrict the rights and movement of locals , and begin arresting residents who are perceived as PKK supporters .
" If the local population sees democratic reforms being rolled back [ here ] , they could fall back into supporting the PKK and following a more radical line , " says Volkan Aytar , a researcher at the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation , an Istanbul - based think tank .
Clearly , the renewed PKK attacks – particularly the Oct. 21 ambush that killed 12 Turkish soldiers – have also exposed a deep fault line running through Turkish society , one that is being watched with increasing concern in the southeast .
That attack in the nearby mountain village of Daglica led to protests across Turkey , with thousands of flag - waving marchers calling for Turkey to take action against the PKK .
More disturbingly to residents here , offices of the pro-Kurdish Democratic People 's Party ( DTP ) , which currently has 19 of its members in parliament , were attacked by mobs in several cities .
" While we are looking for terrorists in the Kandil Mountains [ of northern Iraq ] we should not forget that the supporters of terrorists are ... even in the corridors of the parliament , " Devlet Bahceli , leader of the right - wing Nationalist Action Party ( MHP ) , said at a recent party meeting , referring to the DTP .
Mr. Aytar warns that " the real danger is ... an increasing securitization of the Turkish political discourse , which is threatening democratization . "
Kurds , most of whom maintain a strong ethnic identity even if they do n't support the PKK 's goal of a Kurdish state on Turkish soil , are already feeling alienated by anti-PKK rhetoric and protests taking place across the country .
Turkey is pushing the US and Iraq to clamp down on the PKK .
Some 3,000 fighters are using Iraq as a base for carrying out attacks in Turkey .
On Sunday , US Gen .
David Petraeus said , " I am not going to say anything about what we may be doing with our long - standing NATO allies Turkey , although we clearly are doing things with them .
Nor will I say what we are doing with our Iraqi partners to endeavor to stabilize the situation and to ensure that the sides are talking and taking actions to reduce the tension . "
It 's not difficult to picture a scenario where local support returns to the PKK in a place like Yuksekova , where almost everyone knows a PKK fighter who has been killed or who is currently up in the mountains of northern Iraq .
" If you knock on any door here , you find someone who has lost a loved one , " says Yuksekova mayor Mehmet Salih Yildiz , a member of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) .
" The pain is deep , but still there 's a hope for peace , " says the mayor , whose two sons were killed fighting with the PKK .
Aliza Marcus , a former Reuters correspondent in Turkey and author of the recently published " Blood and Belief : The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence , " says these deep ties have left the rebel group with a strong reserve of sympathy and respect in the region .
" Certainly the PKK is not as popular as it was in the 1990s .
But still it is very strong and it's able to direct the Kurdish political debate in Turkey , " she says .
Halit Tekci , an older gentleman sitting at a sidewalk café in Yuksekova , says , " What will ruin Turkey are these protests [ in the cities calling for war against the PKK ] .
" These protests only increase hatred against the Kurds and will lead to a Turkish - Kurdish conflict . " .
Mayor Yildiz says he hopes that the normalcy that his city has been able to regain will hold , despite the drums of war that are beating throughout Turkey .
" If there is an incursion ... our democratic rights will be lost , " he says .
" People are sick and tired of this conflict .
They hate it . "
Christianity and war :
Are there any two things that one would think are so opposed to each other that “ never the twain shall meet ” ?
Unfortunately — and to the shame of Christians — that is not the case .
And that is why I have revisited this subject yet again .
I do n’t suppose there is anything I write and speak about with more fervor than the biblical , historical , and political fallacies of Christians on the general subject of Christianity and war .
In fact , my first article on the subject , back in 2003 , was called “ Christianity and War . ”
After twelve more essays that addressed the themes of Christians joining the military , Christians killing in war , the evils of war , standing armies , the follies of the Crimean War , World War I , and the Iraq War , Christian justification for the Iraq War , and the U.S. global empire , I published at the beginning of 2005 a slender volume titled Christianity and War and Other Essays Against the Warfare State that was introduced in an article here and reviewed on this site here and here .
After the completion of these essays , I honestly thought I would have nothing else to say about the subject .
But even as that book went to press , I realized that much more could and should be said , so I continued writing .
The attacks on me ( communist , anti-American , liberal , leftist , anarchist , pacifist , hippy , peacenik , Quaker , traitor , coward , appeaser , anti-war weenie ) and the continued Christian support for Bush , the Iraq war , and the military only confirmed that there was much more that needed to be written .
By the beginning of 2006 , I realized that a new edition of Christianity and War was needed .
I am pleased to report that a new , greatly expanded , second edition is now available .
I have repeated in the introduction to this new edition what I said in the introduction to the first edition .
These essays have one underlying theme : opposition to the warfare state that robs us of our liberty , our money , and in some cases our life .
Conservatives who decry the welfare state while supporting the warfare state are terribly inconsistent .
The two are inseparable .
Libertarians who are opposed to war on principle , but support the state ’s bogus “ war on terrorism , ” even as they remain silent about the U.S. Global Empire , are likewise contradictory .
Christians who condone the warfare state and its nebulous crusades against “ evil ” have been duped .
There is nothing “ Christian ” about the state ’s aggressive militarism , its senseless wars , its interventions into the affairs of other countries , and its expanding empire .
War is a subject that needlessly divides and sidetracks Christians .
It is the author ’s contention that Christian enthusiasm for the state , its wars , and its politicians is an affront to the Saviour , contrary to Scripture , and a demonstration of the profound ignorance many Christians have of history .
This edition is likewise dedicated to the leading opponent of the central state , its wars , and its socialism : Lew Rockwell .
New , however , is a foreword by Mike Reith , a retired Air Force major .
The book now contains seventy - nine essays , organized under the headings of Christianity and War , War and Peace , The Military , Christianity and the Military , The Iraq War , Other Wars , and The U.S. Global Empire .
The new table of contents can be viewed here .
The essays span the four - year period from late 2003 to late 2007 .
Although many of them reference contemporary events , the principles discussed in all of them are timeless : war , militarism , empire , interventionism , the warfare state , and the Christian attitude toward these things .
The first chapter is the largest , and contains twenty essays under the general rubric of “ Christianity and War . ”
Besides discussing that subject , here I introduce some real Christian ministers who spoke out against war , point out the biblical errors of two other ministers who favored war , give a test to Christians to see if they are warmongers , identify the Christian axis of evil , expose the hypocrisy of Christian warmongers , reveal the unholy desire of Christians to legitimize killing in war , declare what the Church should be saying about U.S. foreign policy , discuss the fallacy of those who say that the commandment “ Thou shalt not kill ” never applies to killing in war , describe the use of religion in wartime by the state , explain how killing for the state can be murder , explore the attitude of the early Christians toward war , and answer the questions “ What about Hitler ? ” and “ What happened to the Southern Baptists ? ”
In chapter 2 , “ War and Peace , ” the evils of war and warmongers and the benefits of peace are examined .
In chapter 3 , “ The Military , ” the evils of standing armies and militarism are discussed , including a critical look at the U.S. military .
In chapter 4 , “ Christianity and the Military , ” the idea that Christians should have anything to do with the military is shown to be illogical , immoral , and unscriptural .
In chapter 5 , “ The War in Iraq , ” the folly of U.S. policy in Iraq is laid bare .
In chapter 6 , “ Other Wars , ” the evils of war and the warfare state are chronicled in specific wars : the Crimean War ( 1854 — 1856 ) , the Russo - Japanese War ( 1904 — 1905 ) , World War I ( 1914 — 1918 ) , and World War II ( 1939 — 1945 ) .
In chapter 7 , “ The U.S. Global Empire , ” the beginnings , growth , extent , nature , and consequences of the U.S. Empire of bases and troops are revealed and critiqued .
The book also includes the text of my talk to the Republican and Democratic staff aides of the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington , DC , in May of 2006 and my lecture at the Future of Freedom Foundation ’s Conference on “ Restoring the Republic : Foreign Policy and Civil Liberties ” in June of 2007 .
In view of the terrible Christian track record on support for the state , its wars , and its military , I suspect that this will not be the last edition of this book .
Nevertheless , I send forth these seventy - nine essays as salvos against Christian warmongers and the warfare state that they shamelessly defend .

I 'm wearing a very special hat today to celebrate the official release of Fedora 8 , the latest version of the community - driven Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat .
Codenamed Werewolf , this release serves up some very impressive new features and includes a new visual style .
One of the most impressive new features included in Fedora 8 is the PulseAudio sound daemon , which will allow users to set the volume for each application individually , move streams between devices , redirect audio streams to other computers on the local network , and much more .
When we looked at PulseAudio last month when it was officially proposed for inclusion in GNOME 2.22 , we said that it would bring a next - generation audio experience the Linux desktop .
Fedora 8 is one of the first distribution to use PulseAudio by default .
One might say that it 's a sound investment .
The Fedora development community has traditionally declined to include codecs for proprietary encumbered multimedia formats in the distribution for legal and ideological reasons , encouraging users to adopt open formats like Ogg Vorbis and Theora instead .
That has n't changed in Fedora 8 , but the new Codeina utility ( do n't call it Codec Buddy ) will now make it possible for users to legally purchase support for proprietary formats directly from Fluendo .
This is different from Ubuntu 's codec installation tool , which will allow the user to install infringing open - source codecs for free that may not be legal to use in certain countries .
Another major change in Fedora 8 is the new Policy Kit authentication system that makes authority escalation more secure .
Instead of providing root access to an entire program when it needs higher privileges , Policy Kit makes it possible to isolate individual operations that require higher privileges and put them into system services that can be accessed through D - Bus .
Another advantage of PolicyKit is that it will give administrators more control over which users and programs have access to individual operations that use escalated privileges .
PolicyKit will eventually completely replace gksudo .
This is another area where Fedora is a bit ahead of the curve .
Other major distributions like Ubuntu are planning to add the feature in future releases , but Fedora 8 has it now .
Fedora 8 also has a new visual style called Nodoka that mixes beige and bright blue .
It has light gradients , subdued scrollbars , and gradients on inactive tabs .
The only visual oddity in Nodoka is the use of green for the checkmark in checkboxes even though filled in radio buttons use blue .
Nodoka has some nice characteristics , but I still prefer the default GNOME 2.20 theme .
More impressive than Nodoka is the optional color - changing wallpaper , which will rotate through shades depending on the time of day .
Compiz is now available in Fedora 8 , but it is not enabled by default .
Users with supported hardware can enable Compiz 's visual effects using Fedora 's Desktop Effects configuration tool .
The Fedora development community hopes that Compiz can be enabled by default in the next release , but will wait until certain fixes have been made in Xorg .
Many other features are included , so be sure to check out the feature list for more details .
Significant features planned for the next version — Fedora 9 — include a rewrite of the GNOME login system , integration of KDE 4 , broader support for of Xorg 's new XRandR capabilities , and adoption of PackageKit , a new distribution - neutral package management frontend that already supports Fedora 's Yum system .
Fedora is now back on a consistent six - month release cycle , so the official release of Fedora 9 is scheduled for early May .
Fedora 8 installation disc images will be hosted on numerous Fedora mirrors around the world ( you can even get it from Facebook ) , but BitTorrent will probably provide the best results as the traffic starts to pick up .
Please note that it might take a while for the release to propagate to all the various mirrors .
In addition to the basic Fedora 8 installer disc image , users can also get Spins — special installable Live CD or DVD disk images with custom package sets intended for specific audiences .
Support for Spins was added to the Fedora development infrastructure with the release of Fedora 7 and the feature has continued to evolve since then .
Fedora 8 introduces three new official Spins : a Games Spin with an assortment of popular Linux computer games , a Developer Spin with compilers and integrated development environments , and an Electronic Labs Spin with tools for simulating electronic systems .
I 've been experimenting with Fedora 8 test 3 , and I like what I see .
This is a nice release with a pretty sweet assortment of features that you wo n't find anywhere else .
Fedora still manages to differentiate itself and rise above many other contenders by delivering early access to new technologies .
You can check out the release notes for Fedora 8 for more information .
( for an expansion on these ideas , see Against Intellectual Property by Stephan Kinsella )
During the eBay v. MercExchange Supreme Court hearing of last week , Justice Scalia remarked , " We 're talking about a property right here and a property owner has the right to exclude others from using his property .
" But are we really talking about a property right , when we are talking about government - granted monopolies over ideas ?
Thomas Jefferson would certainly have disagreed with Scalia , but I wanted to further explain why this is such an absurd notion .
Some intellectuals have defined " property " as " the fruits of labor . "
Under this definition , ideas might qualify as property ( as long as one ignores the ' Eureka ' theory of ideas , in which case ideas are not the pure fruit of one 's labor ) .
But this definition is insufficient , both historically and philosophically .
Historically , property rights only arise in the presence of scarcity and conflict .
For example , during our ancestors ' hunter - gatherer days , there was no concept of land as a property right .
This is largely because land was not scarce , and there was little conflict over its use .
As populations grew , different groups crowded each other for the best hunting grounds , and conflict due to scarcity occurred -- but these conflicts were communal , and were usually resolved with tribal battles or other types of violence .
The concept of parcels of land owned by individuals did not arise until the introduction of agriculture , which gave rise to a new type of scarcity and conflict : competition for the most productive plots of land .
The same is true of other types of property throughout history : scarcity and conflict resolution plays a key role in definition of property rights .
It extends naturally , then , that when there is no scarcity of a certain resource , there cannot be any conflict over that resource 's use .
And , since there is no conflict , property laws for that resource are unnecessary .
No wars were fought in pre-industrial times over ownership of the air we breath , and no laws were needed to regulate atmospheric property rights .
This is because air was once considered to be a nearly infinite resource .
Are ideas scarce ?
Can the fact that I once imagined and invented a method for folding a paper into the shape of a peanut somehow cause you not to think of the same ( or very similar ) idea ?
Of course not .
Ideas are not exclusive , are not scarce , and conflict over their use does not naturally occur .
It is only when governments grant exclusive rights to the use of an idea ( via patents ) that such conflict can arise , only through government regulation can scarcity of ideas be born .
Ideas are not property .
But even worse , idea monopolies introduce a way for unconnected individuals to magically impede on the true property rights of one another .
If I had been granted a patent on my hypothetical peanut - shaped paper folding technique , I would have the legal authority to restrict you from engaging in foldingpaper , withhands and the exertion oflabor , into the patented peanut shape .
My government - invented paper - peanut patent ' property ' right over an intangible idea would trespass on your natural physical property right overhands , energy , andtangible paper .
Such a conflict between imaginary idea property and real physical property is inevitable , and it is made worse by the fact that my idea monopoly extends not only against you , but against every single living soul who is subject to the patent regime 's enforcement .
So , yes , Justice Scalia , we are talking about a property right here : we 're talking about every individual 's right to create using their own property in any way they see fit , as nature intended .
We 're talking about the government unreasonably interfering with that essential , natural right .
And we 're talking about how that is a bad deal for inventors , consumers , businesses , and society as a whole .
NBC finds ' controversy ' in scientists ' rebuke of creationism David Edwards and Nick Juliano

This A renowned national science panel is releasing a book urging educators to keep " intelligent design theory " -- a pseudo - creationist approach to explaining the world that is closer to religion than science -- out of science classrooms .
The National Academy of Sciences says in a new book that intelligent design -- which has been pushed almost exclusively by religious activists -- does not belong in science classrooms alongside evolution -- Darwin's theory of natural selection , which has persevered among scentists for nearly 150 years .
" As SCIENCE , EVOLUTION , AND CREATIONISM makes clear , the evidence for evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith .
Science and religion are different ways of understanding the world .
Needlessly placing them in opposition reduces the potential of each to contribute to a better future , " the book states .
NBC reported on Thursday on the new book , which seems to do little more than state the obvious : evolution is science , creationism is not .
However , because some religious fundamentalists insist that the Bible belongs alongside The Origin of Species in classrooms , NBC decided to present the story as a great " controversy . "
( The network noted that President Bush also has n't made up his mind as to whether humans are the result of billions of years of evolution or divine intervention and has said both versions should be taught in school . )
" The National Academy of Sciences plants its flag on the latest front in the battle over evolution , " correspondent Pete Williams intoned .
" It 's the issue of intelligent design , the idea that some forms of life are so complex they could not have evolved on their own but are the result of God 's design .
...
The new book turns up the voltage in a decades - old fight . "
The National Academy of Sciences was joined by the Institute of Medicine in releasing the third edition of Science , Evolution and Creationism , which was first published in 1984 .
The book says evidence supporting evolution is overwhelming and understanding it is essential to fighting disease ; the committee 's note that a federal judge in Dover , Pa. , ruled teaching intelligent design unconstitutional because it is based on religious conviction , not science .
" Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting evolution , opponents have repeatedly tried to introduce nonscientific views into public school science classes through the teaching of various forms of creationism or intelligent design .
... NAS and IOM strongly maintain that only scientifically based explanations and evidence for the diversity of life should be included in public school science courses , " the groups say in a press release .
" ' Teaching creationist ideas in science class confuses students about what constitutes science and what does not , ' the committee stated . "
The two groups that produce the book comprise perhaps the foremost minds in science .
The NAS is " independent society of scientists , elected by their peers for outstanding contributions to their field , with a mandate from Congress since 1863 to advise the federal government on issues of science and technology . "
Who did NBC find to question such scientific authority ?
Peter Sprigg , a mouthpiece for the Family Research Council , which is charged with promoting the Religious Right 's agenda in Washington .
Sprigg , whose FRC bio brags of his specialization in " the homosexual agenda " and " religion in public life , " boasts impressive educational credentials that include a " Master of Divinity degree cum laude from Gordon - Conwell Theological Seminary . "
" What 's lacking , " whined Sprigg , whose credentials do n't list any expertise or training in biology or other sciences , " is a true scientific debate about the merits and weaknesses of evolutionary theory as presented by Darwin . "

In an article full of hedged opinions and criticisms of Senator Clinton and praise for Obama , the New York Times endorsed Hillary Clinton because she was the safe choice .
Their conclusion :
Mrs. Clinton is more qualified , right now , to be president .
The also manage to deceive themselves into thinking that Senator Clinton can be as unifying as Senator Obama – and that she will win over her critics ; they paint the differences between Clinton and Obama as marginal – because both Senators propose similar policies .
But they ignore the difference in temperament and political approach that Obama would give – and the fact that his focus would be on improving the process rather than on achieving particular ends .
Senator Clinton has shown time and time again that she is willing to use any means at her disposal in order to achieve whatever end she believes is necessary .
Senator Obama has shown remarkable restraint – and his public record indicates a seriousness about the abuse of government power that Clinton lacks .
Especially at a time when the balance of power in Washington has been skewed in favor of the presidency , we need a president who will restrain himself or herself – as the Times acknowledges .
The Times makes the perplexing statement that “ Mrs. Clinton is equally dedicated to those issues ” as Obama while acknowledging that she does n’t talk about them .
The editors also fail to mention that the Bush administration built on many precedents set by the Clinton administration in their quest for further executive power – including one major early victory which was based on assertions of executive privilege by Hillary Clinton ’s health care task force .
In the end , I think the New York Times fundamentally mis-interprets the state America is in – and the relative qualifications of Senators Clinton and Obama .
Here ’s what I propose
Write a letter to the New York Times expressing your disapproval of their endorsement of Hillary Clinton .
Make the next news story that they received more mail disagreeing with this decision than any other in their history .
We can do it .
Email @ letters@nytimes.com
Fax @ ( 212 ) 556-3622
Mail to : Letters to the Editor
The New York Times
620 Eighth Avenue
New York , NY 10018
Or even better do all three .
Letters submitted for publication should be 150 words or less , must refer to an article that has appeared within the last seven days , and must include the writer ’s address and phone numbers according to the Times Letters to the Editor page .
If you can , let me know you ’re sending the letter by emailing nytimes@2parse.com so I can post updates on how much of a response the Times is getting .
Spread the word !
Post this information on your own blog !
We can show the New York Times that we , at least , can see the Great Need of the Hour .
And it ’s not Hillary Clinton .

One Year Later ...

Hello blog folks , it 's been a while .
One year to be exact ... one long crazy year .
This time last year , I announced my project called The Big Picture , hoping , of course , that it would do well .
It has really blown me away how well it has done .
I will happily take some of the credit , but much of the success belongs to the photographers who consistently deliver amazing imagery that makes choosing and editing both a pleasure and a difficult task .
Now , it 's been a year , so I 'll take some time to look at the good and the bad .
( Warning , this is a bit long ) .
I 'll start out with some of the bad , just to get it out of the way .
It 's a cliche , but be careful what you wish for .
If The Big Picture had flopped as a blog , it would have been much easier to walk away from or take a lax attitude towards things .
The more popular it got and more it was praised , I felt that much more need to keep it as good and consistent as I could ...
That 's stressful ( first world problems , I know ) .
Add to the mix another fulltime job ( my web developer position with the Boston Globe , which is still my primary job ) , some deadline - driven projects , exponential growth in comment moderation ( I approve all the blog comments myself , 91,000 in all so far ) , a full email inbox , and the constant need to be thinking ahead two or three entries , plus the whole " NY Times threatens to close down the Globe " storyline , and , well , I had a bit of a stress freakout a few weeks ago .
I took some steps to fix certain aspects , let go of some unnecessary baggage , and have been getting a lot of help and support , and things feel a whole lot more manageable now .
I especially needed to step back and get my life back into balance ( I swung way too far in one direction ) .
I do n't spend every night combing through wire photos now , and do n't obsessively check comments , and do n't stress if I can't answer an email immediately .
All in all , I feel much better now than I did a month or two ago .
It 's got to be this way if I plan to continue long - term with the blog , which I do .
Now , for some of the good .
This project has been the most fulfilling and rewarding thing I 've ever done professionally .
When I 'm compiling an entry , gathering the photographs , trying to fit them into a cohesive story , it can often be a very emotional experience .
More than once , I 've found myself in tears when looking at rough layout of an entry for the first time ( that 's always a good sign that the entry will be powerful ) .
I really feel like I 've tried to take the best advantage I can of this platform I find myself on : 165,000 Google Reader RSS subscriptions , tens of thousands of daily bookmark visitors , Twitter - powered ripple effects , frequent top spots on Digg and Reddit .
I know that it 's not me , Alan Taylor they are all interested in - it 's the story , the photographs , the " what will it be this time ? " , the virtual travelogue , the amazing , the sad - the world , wrapped into one story - 30 or 40 photographs to linger on , react to , wonder about .
I take that pretty seriously , and try to handle it with care .
I hate being manipulated , and try not to run news photo stories from a single source ( especially government sources ) .
I also try not to cover the most obvious stories ( except when I do cover them ) .
When I run entries on areas of serious conflict , I try to make it as balanced as is possible , sometimes , it 's nearly impossible ( notice I 've not yet done a comparative Israel / Palestine entry ) .
160 entries later , I think the blog is its own best testament to the level of fairness and diversity in subject matter I 've tried to maintain , and I 'm proud of that .
The success and visibility of the blog has brought a great number of people into my life I would never have known : cancer survivors and the families of those who have lost their battles with cancer , some amazing , generous photographers , both professional and amateur , some great people at NASA , many wonderful everyday people from many corners of the world and believers of many faiths ( and non-believers ) .
I am thankful to ( almost ) every one of them .
There are of course , the spoilsports , the trolls of every flavor , and , the blog comment spammers ( who deserve a special circle in Hell ) , but they really are few , and do n't spoil too much .
When I say the work is fulfilling , it 's not just because it makes me feel good when I hit " publish " , it 's because of the tremendous and powerful feedback I get in email and comments - words that make me realize the impact the blog can have .
For instance , when I ran an entry about Ramadan , I got many heartfelt emails from Muslims living abroad that felt cut off from home and the traditions they grew up with - who found such solace and happiness in the entry , and expressed surprise that such a positive photo story would run in a Western publication .
When I feel like I can do some good , to be helpful , that 's the most worthwhile .
If , by showing photographs , I can help someone like James Nachtwey spread awareness of XDR - TB , drug resistant tuberculosis , and the Hell it 's causing amongst HIV - positive patients in poorer nations - or can help humanize some banal news headline like " refugees in the Congo " , or bring to the forefront dazzling images from some of our best scientists -- those are the best times .
Aside from the stress of the labor itself and everything else I complained about above , there 's one other stress that 's harder to quantify - emotional .
I 've never been on such a constant emotional rollercoaster , storylines like goofballs chasing a roll of cheese down a hill one day followed up by teenagers with assault rifles killing each other the next day .
I 've had to step out of my comfort zone many times to contact others and ask permission to run their ( sometimes very personal ) photos , or to take efforts to promote myself , which never comes easy .
Also , my access to the raw wire photos has altered my point of view about human nature itself a bit , in a negative way .
Daily exposure to thousands of uncensored journalistic photographs has exposed me to levels of brutality that I was n't fully prepared for , and still have trouble processing sometimes .
Civilian population centers that are also war zones make for really disturbing - if moving - photographs .
I think you know what I mean .
I choose to show a handful of these photos when I think it makes a point without being gratuitous , but that 's always hard call .
However , I 'm still amazed by the overall situation I find myself in - and am thankful to my lovely wife and kids who keep me sane and grounded .
When I recently showed off a photo of me in the latest issue of PDN magazine , my daughter ran around the house yelling " Papa 's famous ! " .
Realizing how that might resound badly around the schoolyard , I told her that I was by no means famous , but might be " Internet Famous " , and explained the difference , which she readily accepted .
Where will things be in another year ?
Who knows - it 's a volatile world out there , especially for newspapers .
I will do my best to keep going , mostly because , at the heart of it all , I really , truly enjoy finding , compiling and sharing these photo stories .
I have plans , some small , some larger , which may see the light of day soon , or not - I 'm still remembering to take things a little easier , enjoy balance , and not sweat the small stuff .
Thanks everyone for your support - you know who you are .

Edmonds : Brewster Jennings outted in 2001 Diane Sweet

Print This Email This Former FBI agent turned whistleblower , Sibel Edmonds , has claimed that a senior official in the U.S. State Department tipped off a foreign contact to a CIA investigative cover during an investigation into a nuclear spy ring .
In today 's Timesonline , the third in a series of interviews with the former FBI translator , Edmonds reveals that the official told one of the CIA 's foreign contacts in 2001 that Brewster Jennings & Associates -- a firm that existed with little more than a name and telephone number -- was a cover for the U.S. government .
Brewster Jennings was also a front for former CIA agent Valerie Plame -- wife of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson -- who was publicly outted in 2003 by White House officials .
From the Sibel Edmonds interview : " One group of Turkish agents who had come to America on the pretext of researching alternative energy sources was introduced to Brewster Jennings through the Washington - based American Turkish Council ( ATC ) , a lobby group that aids commercial ties between the countries .
Edmonds says the Turks believed Brewster Jennings to be energy consultants and were planning to hire them .
But she said :  He [ the State Department official ] found out about the arrangement . . . and he contacted one of the foreign targets and said . . . you need to stay away from Brewster Jennings because they are a cover for the government .
 The target . . . immediately followed up by calling several people to warn them about Brewster Jennings .
 At least one of them was at the ATC .
This person also called an ISI person to warn them . 
If the ISI was made aware of the CIA front company , then this would almost certainly have damaged the investigation into the activities of Khan .
Plames cover would also have been compromised , although Edmonds never heard her name mentioned on the intercepts .
Shortly afterwards , Plame was moved to a different operation . "
A State Department official vehemently denied Edmonds ' claims , calling them " both false and malicious . 
Plame - Wilson declined comment citing her inability to comment on her covert work with the CIA .

When that bible of business , the Economist magazine , put Mao Zedong on their cover in a red Santa Hat , I thought it was their way of suggesting that the Chinese Communist Party had become the new stabilizer and bearer of gifts for a western - capitalist system in distress .
Mao fought a revolution for independence from the West , which now seems to have become dependent on loans and finance from his People 's Republic .
Mao had always preached , " no investigation , no right to speak , " so I investigated further to find an article inside the issue suggesting that " for all his flaws " - like maybe 60 Million or more deaths , 30 million from famine alone -- " Mao was inspiring . "
An article on " Mao and the Art of Management " calls him a " role model , of sorts . "
In what could be read as grudging testimonial to Mao 's revolution , the Economist lauds his strengths including " ruthless Media manipulation . "
" Mao knew not just how to make a point but how to get it out ... his message was constantly reinforced ... it 's hard to distinguish from the modern business practice of building brand value . "
What ?
Has the Great Helmsman returned from the other side to guide us ?
This Economist article suggests that Mao's media practices have also been adopted in the US and Britain through the use of syncophantic reporters , media management strategies and repetition .
Have the Chicom - commisars been watching Fox News to see how Rupert Murdoch , a big fave of the politbureau there , has marketed his own party - line news ?
And what about CNN ?
Similar propaganda techniques are driving news presentation here and there .
Yes , alas , we too have ideological correctness and sloganeering all over the media spectrum .
Consider the coverage of the Iraq war -- what there is left of it .
We have all seen how it has mostly disappeared .
I was watching CNN's Wolf Blitzer report on all the " progress " being made in Iraq .
No , he did n't go to a reporter in Iraq or seek out critics , but turned instead to the CNN's Pentagon correspondent who relayed the official view .
CNN noted ( how surprising ! ) that the Generals are glad the war is no longer a key issue in Presidential politics .
Yet no assessment is offered on how a fall - off in coverage is letting politicians off the hook .
CNN reported - for the upteenth time - that the " surge is working . "
How many times have you heard that ?
This focus assumes that the main problem is military , when everyone one who has looked closely recognizes that stability requires an equitable political settlement and the withdrawal of US forces .
Yes , casualties may be down but the Washington Post reports that Iranian influence may be more responsible than US military patrols .
That story has not seeped into much TV coverage because like Iraq before it , Iran is now the boogie man and a target in the crosshairs of neo -cons urging a military attack .
Balanced coverage is as rare on that front as it is from Iraq .
Conn Hallinan writes : " The narrative in the media these days is the success of the U.S. " surge , " which has poured an additional 30,000 U.S. troops into Iraq .
Last month , war critic and close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , U.S. Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa ) , said , " I think the surge is working . "
Polls indicate that concern over the economy has replaced the war as the major issue for voters , and , that while a majority of Americans want the troops out , those saying that things are going better jumped from 33 percent to just under 50 percent .
Are they going better ?
Car bombings , sectarian violence and attacks on U.S. troops are down , although 2007 has been the deadliest year of the war for the Americans .
But does the reduced violence have anything to do with the surge ?
As Patrick Cockburn of The Independent points out , Americans and the U.S. media tend to " exaggerate the extent to which the U.S. is making the political weather and is in control of events there . "
Even as voters express concerns about the economy , is economic coverage getting any better ?
The Economist says that " laudatory " reporting is still the norm here as in China .
Our media is barely keeping up with the economy 's free fall .
We were told Christmas shopping was setting new records .
Now we learn that it was a dud , the worst in five years .
Many business programs seem more concerned with whether CEO 's will lose their jobs than exposing the fraudulent practices they encouraged .
One day , the Treasury Department makes news by encouraging big banks to put up money to bail each other out .
A week later , we learn that the banks are about to chip in billions to form something called M - LEC ( Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit ) .
And then , as more banks take bigger losses , the Fund is dissolved .
Poof .
Gone !
At least that 's one acronym we can forget about .
One person wins a $ 151.9 million Powerball ticket in Rhode Island and that is big news .
Tens of thousands lose their homes and it's a footnote
The crisis may now be on the radar screen of big media but the reporting remains superficial and managed .
How different is all this from the way China 's CCTV covers scandals involving their government ?
The major media was late in covering the mortgage crisis and let the government off the hook , writes Dean Starkman in the Columbia Journalism Review : " it failed to understand the crisis for what I think it really is : a regulatory failure of mammoth proportions . "
What should readers and media consumers do to read between the often fuzzy lines between hype and journalism ?
Journalist Pepe Escobar has some suggestions :
First , he says , read the news from the bottom up and from the back of the paper to the front , " the crucial info most of the time is in the next to last paragraph , and the story is buried in the bottom half of page A - 21 .
Next , he says , seek out alternatives : " My suggestion is that readers forget about reading serious news on mainstream / corporate media : stick to the sports and entertainment pages ....
In the case of weeklies , stick to the actual reporting and forget about editorials ( well sometimes even that is impossible ; in Time magazine ideology drips from every report ) .
The Wall Street Journal or The Economist may carry excellent reportage , but frankly no one has to swallow as fact Wall Street and the City of London 's wishful thinking . "
In a season when people ask , " What would Jesus think ? " we might wonder : how would Mao react to his new acolytes in the western press ?

Soviet theme park features belt whippings , KGB interrogations David Edwards and Adam Doster
Published : Tuesday January 22 , 2008

Print This Email This Mickey Mouse , roller coasters , and cotton candy typify the average theme park .
But in one Lithuanian town , those amenities are exchanged for belt whippings and some good old fashioned KGB interrogation .
It 's called " Gulag tourism . "
And Grutas Park offers visitors a journey back to 1984 to remind citizens what life was like under Soviet rule .
Organizers believe that for those old enough to remember life in the Soviet Union , visiting the park can be therapeutic , filled with old memorabilia and humor .
" There are still many in Lithuania who are sick with Soviet nostalgia , " said one organizer , " so we 've started this show to help them recover . "
After an amiable introduction , visitors are quickly transported back 25 years .
They are ordered to stop smiling or thinking and are chased through an elaborate labyrinth of corridors .
Any misstep can result in a violent encounter with angry KGB agents .
All of the activity lasts two hours , costs more than 35 Euros , and takes place inside a bunker located in the woods .
For younger visitors , the park can serve as an interesting history lesson .
" It was scary indeed the way they treated people , " said a young woman who had just visited the park .
" And people did n't know what to do .
They would do whatever they want with people and that was frightening . "

Five voting integrity groups have sent a letter to presidential candidates urging them to call on states to use paper ballots for the 2008 primary elections .
The groups , among them Iowans for Voting Integrity ( whose state holds the first caucus tomorrow ) , cited a recent report out of Ohio that examined voting machines made by Diebold / Premier , Election Systems & Software and Hart InterCivic and found serious security vulnerabilities – among them a vulnerability in ES&S iVotronic touch - screen machines that would allow someone to manipulate code on the machines via an infrared port .
Ohio 's secretary of state declared all of the machines unfit and called for paperless machines to be replaced with optical - scan equipment .
The ES&S touch - screen machines are at the center of a controversy involving a 2006 congressional race in Sarasota , Florida , where more than 18,000 ballots cast on the machines showed no vote selected in the 13th congressional district race .
Numerous voters in that Sarasota election reported having problems with the machines recognizing their touch or failing to record their vote in the 13th congressional race .
ES&S iVotronic machines have also been implicated in several stories from various states involving vote - flipping .
In 2006 during early voting in Miami - Date and Broward counties in Florida , voters complained that they selected one candidate but had the machine record their vote for a different candidate .
ES&S officials said the issue was not a problem because voters caught the mistakes on the review screen at the end of the ballot and were able to go back and re-select their candidates .
A Broward County election staff member also dismissed the issue , telling a reporter that it was common for a certain percentage of voting machines to have such problems , which he said was a calibration error .
There were similar reports of problems with ES&S machines in Texas and Ohio .
In at least one incident in Texas the voter had a poll worker watch as the machine registered his correct vote when he touched the screen , but indicated a vote for a different candidate on the review screen at the end of the ballot .

The latest disorder prompted the Nairobi Stock Exchange to close barely an hour after opening .
The BBC's Odiambo Joseph in Mombasa says the coastal city has not escaped the disorder , witnessing running battles on Thursday morning between police and rowdy youths .
Mr Odinga , 62 , had vowed to press ahead with the rally , saying it would send a peaceful message to opposition supporters .
He told the BBC : " It is a defining moment for the country because , as you can see , the people of this country are not willing to take this just lying down . "
But Vice - President Moody Awori called on Mr Odinga to cancel the protest , urging him in a public appeal : " Overcome your anger , your bitterness and all negative emotions for the sake of our country . "
Supporters of President Kibaki ( a member of Kenya 's predominant Kikuyu tribe ) and Mr Odinga ( from the Luo community ) have accused each other of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the post - poll unrest .
Perhaps the most shocking of the violence in the past week was the torching on Tuesday of a church at Eldoret , in western Kenya 's Rift Valley , where at least 30 ( mainly Kikuyu ) people were burnt alive .
Mr Kibaki invited all MPs to crisis talks at state house on Wednesday but Mr Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement refused and demanded the president quit .
African Union chairman , Ghanaian President John Kufuor , had been expected to visit Kenya on Thursday but Kenya 's finance minister said there was no need for international mediation .

It is widely thought to give a baby the best start in life .
But breastfeeding may have another , more unexpected , benefit .
Smells associated with breastfeeding are a natural aphrodisiac , heightening sexual desire in other women , a study has found .
Researchers discovered exposure to the subtle odours produced by breastfeeding mothers and their babies can raise libido by almost 50 per cent .
Speaking at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine 's annual conference in Washington , the psychologists behind the study said they believe the smells - known as pheromones - act as a signal , telling a woman it is time to try for a baby .
They hope to use these chemicals to develop treatments to help women who suffer from a low sex drive .
The researchers from the University of Chicago looked at how the smell of sweat collected from the breast and armpits of nursing mothers affected a group of young women .
Half were asked to wipe pads soaked in the sweat across their upper lip every morning and evening for three months .
They were also asked to reapply the pads after showering , exercising and wiping their mouths after eating .
The remaining half were given similar pads , soaked in a dummy liquid .
Neither group knew what was on the pads .
By the end of the study , those given the sweat - soaked pads found their desire for their partner had risen by around 42 per cent , while those who were single had more sexual daydreams than usual .
The effects were particularly striking during the time of the month when the women 's fertility and sex drive was at its lowest .
In contrast , libido actually dropped among those with dummy pads .
It is thought those given the sweat - soaked pads were affected by the pheromones , which are secreted by the body to affect behaviour , including sexual attraction , on an unconscious level .
In this case , it is thought they acted as a signal to other women that food is plentiful and the environment is safe to bring a baby into .
Having a baby at the same time as other women would also allow the burden of childcare to be shared .
If the key compounds in the sweat , breast milk and baby 's saliva could be identified and bottled , they could be turned into a powerful aphrodisiac for women , the study added .
Researcher Professor Martha McClintock , said : " We found that being exposed to these chemicals sustained sexual desire during times in the cycle when it would normally be lower than other peak levels .
" It could be used for the treatment of disorders of desire .
A lot of basic research would need to be done to identify the specific compounds involved .
" For men the major problem is erectile dysfunction ( impotence ) for which there is Viagra .
" But for women it is a disorder of desire and there is n't anything as effective . "
Scientists also believe sweat may play a vital part in the mating game because we seek out partners whose body odour is different from our own .
It is thought the phenomenon evolved to prevent us unintentionally mating with relatives or seeking a partner who is genetically similar .
The flying car has been a dream pursued by inventors since the dawn of aviation and a fantasy long held by commuters wishing they could soar above traffic like George Jetson .
Engineers and eccentrics have patented more than 70 designs since 1918 , and even the U.S. government and Henry Ford tried to build flying cars .
But success has been elusive , the challenge too great , and such machines have remained the stuff of science fiction .
Until now .
An aeronautical startup called Terrafugia has developed a small airplane called the Transition that it says can take to the sky as easily as the road .
It is about the size of a large SUV and features innovative folding wings that collapse with the press of a button .
Terrafugia calls it a " personal air vehicle . "
The team behind the Transition still has to design a drivetrain to propel the craft and a mechanism to transfer power from the propeller to the wheels , but it expects to begin flight tests late next year .
Production could begin as early as 2009 , and Terrafugia says it 's already received more than 30 orders .
Not long after Henry Ford started building cars and the Wright brothers proved we could fly , an inventor and aviator named Glenn Curtiss built the first flying car in 1917 .
The Curtiss Autoplane was n't much to look at and it barely got off the ground , but it proved that it was possible to merge automobile and airplane into a single machine .
Still , the Autoplane and most of the " roadable " aircraft that followed had the same problem - combining the mechanics of an automobile with those of an airplane created something that did n't work well as either .
It also proved exceedingly difficult to design a machine light enough to fly but robust enough to drive without being blown off the road .
There were some that worked - most notably the Airphibian and the original Aerocar , the only flying cars certified by the Federal Aviation Administration - but most were unstable cars and clumsy airplanes .
Advancements in composite materials and metal alloys have addressed many of those problems , and Terrafugia is in a race with several other companies to bring a flying car to market .
They include Moller International , Aerocar and Urban Aeronautics .
The Transition is n't so much a car you can fly but an airplane you can drive , and it is meant to be an alternative to driving for trips between 100 and 500 miles .
" This is not going to replace your Toyota Camry , " company founder Carl Dietrich told the Boston Globe .
" You could take it to the store , but it does n't have the trunk space of your SUV . "
The preliminary specifications calls for an aircraft 19 feet long and 80 inches wide with the wings folded ( the wingspan is 27 feet ) .
It will have a 100 - horsepower engine powered by unleaded fuel and a propeller at the rear .
The airplane will cruise at 115 mph and have a range of about 460 miles , and it will have room for two people and 550 pounds of cargo .
It will weigh 1,320 pounds .
The self - folding wings make the Transition unique , as past flying cars used wings that had to be removed or folded manually .
The idea was to make the transition from airplane to automobile as quick and seamless as possible .
The design team unveiled the folding wing design in July at the annual AirVenture aviation festival , where they opened and closed the wings more than 500 times without a problem .
The wings feature several mechanical and electrical locks to ensure they do n't collapse in flight .
" Going into this , we knew our two biggest design challenges to make it practical would be the wings and the powertrain , " Anna Mracek , an engineer and chief operating officer at Terrafugia , told Technology Review .
" By validating the durability of the wing 's construction and engineering , we 've checked on major design challenge off the list , and now our focus is on the second . "
But the greatest challenge may be getting the Transition certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration .
The aircraft will be classified as a light sport aircraft , and a sport pilot license will be required to fly it .
Such licenses generally require less time to obtain than traditional licenses .
Mracek says the company has been working closely with the two agencies " to make working with them as painless as possible " and has made inroads toward certification .
The FAA says " the concept of airplanes as personal transportation " is on its radar , so to speak .
Dietrich founded Terrafugia - Latin for " escape from land " - three years ago while still pursuing a doctoral degree in aeronoautical and aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He got his pilot 's license at 17 , and even as a boy dreamed of building a flying car , and his design for the Transition was among a portfolio of ideas that earned him the prestigious Lemelson - MIT Student Prize last year .
He and the rest of the Terrafugia team believe the time is right for a flying car .
They note that there are 5,296 public airports in the United States , and most people are within 20 miles of one .
With many of those airports being underutilized and several studies , including the annual Urban Mobility Report , showing traffic congestion getting worse nationwide , Dietrich believes personal air vehicles may be the transportation of the future .
Maybe Henry Ford was right after all when he said in 1940 , " Mark my word - a combination airplane and motor car is coming .
You may smile , but it will come . "

Source Financing
Investors sent a letter to its investors this week saying that it was concerned about what had happened to the $ 40 million entrusted to Mr. Hsu , and that it had notified the Manhattan District Attorney ’s Office , which is investigating .
Mr. Rosenberg said fund managers were shocked by the discovery of Mr. Hsu ’s past legal troubles .
“ Obviously , people with a proven history of success in finance would n’t have invested unless they believed it made economic sense , ” he said .
“ They had every reason to believe these were authentic financial transactions that related to real business deals . ”
Mr. Hsu , a major bundler of campaign contributions for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign , was arrested last week after skipping a court appearance related to the 1991 fraud case .
It was the second time he had vanished , the first being in 1992 when he was due to be sentenced to up to three years in prison on the fraud conviction , but fled and went on to start a new life as a businessman and later as a political fund - raiser in New York .
He turned himself in last month after news accounts revealed an outstanding warrant for his 1992 disappearance .
Since then , further disclosures have raised questions about the nature of his businesses and how he was able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Democratic campaigns .
Mr. Hsu presented himself as an apparel executive , but little public information was available for his company , Components Ltd. , which accepted the $ 40 million investment from Source Financing Investors .
Financial records for Components Ltd. reviewed by The New York Times show that in 2003 it paid more than $ 100,000 to nine people who later made campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton and other candidates .
The records revealed a pattern of transactions  a flurry of transfers and checks , some of which bounced , totaling about $ 600,000 in a single month  that was similar in many respects to what was described in court records relating to the Ponzi scheme for which Mr. Hsu was convicted .
If , and that 's a big IF , Cheney order these documents forged in a cottage intel shop , I hope to God he kept the receipts .

One Saturday in August , Rhonda Roland Shearer , the widow of the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould , was on her way back from the park with her daughter and two grandsons .
They made a stop , as they often do , at the fire station on Sixth and Houston , so that the boys could check out the fire trucks .
Joey Graffagnino showed the kids around the truck while Shearer chatted with another firefighter , Bobby Beddia .
Shearer said recently , “ He mentioned that he was very lucky , because he was fifty - three , so this year he got to experience living in his ‘ birth year . ’ ”
Shearer , an artist who has done some work with fractal geometry and runs a group called Art Science Research Laboratory , asked Beddia what he meant .
He explained that he was born in 1953 ( in September ) , so his age matched the last two digits of the year in which he was born : a once - in - a - lifetime occurrence .
“ He had this glow that I recognized from seeing the faces of mathematicians when they ’ve discovered a beautiful idea , ” Shearer said .
“ I told him , ‘ You should really contact a mathematician to work out a proof . ’
As I was saying that , I was secretly planning to explore it myself and surprise him . ”
Shearer and her family went to lunch .
A few hours later , she got a call from a friend : a seven - alarm fire had broken out in the vacant Deutsche Bank Building , near Ground Zero , and two firemen — Graffagnino and Beddia — had been killed .
Shearer decided to continue investigating Beddia ’s observation , as a tribute .
She called her friend Richard Brandt , a retired N.Y.U. physicist .
He pointed out something that would be obvious to mathematicians : the “ birth year ” can happen only in an even - numbered year — in Beddia ’s case , the year beginning in 2006 , or , in Brandt ’s case , 1982 , the year when he turned forty - one ( since he was born in ’ 41 ) .
“ It ’s simple , but the originality is to recognize that it ’s happening , ” Brandt said the other day .
Shearer told the story to Barry Cipra , a freelance math writer in Minnesota .
“ When I described it to my wife , she immediately thought of the champagne birthday — when you reach the age of the day of the month you were born , ” Cipra said .
“ But nobody I ’ve run this by has ever heard of this notion .
What ’s sort of great about it is that it will happen to everybody if you live long enough .
If you were born in 2000 , it happens instantaneously .
The people who were born at the end of the century have to take care of themselves . ”
Cipra wrote a short paper on the idea , which he calls the “ Beddian year . ”
“ It struck me that , at any given moment , the world consists of two types of people : those who have reached their ‘ Beddian ’ age , and those who have n’t , ” Cipra writes .
“ I got to wondering which group is larger . ”
That question is really demographic — it depends on generational shifts — but he boils it down to a respectably difficult math problem :
“ What is the range of ages of people who currently ( in 2007 ) are pre-Beddian ? ” A hint : they do n’t fall into a single age group .
For example , in 2008 , Shearer , born in ’ 54 , and her grandson Fionn , born in ’ 04 , will share the same Beddian year .
( He ’ll be four , and she ’ll be fifty - four . )
It took Cipra the better part of a week to come up with the complete answer — one that describes , for any given year , the ranges of people who are pre-Beddian .
For those who can make sense of it :
Beddia
Theorem :
In any odd - numbered year , there are exactly 50 pre-Beddian ages .
In any even - numbered year , there are exactly 49 pre-Beddian ages .
Moreover , with three exceptions , these ages consist of two separate spans .
The exceptions are 1998 ( or any year ending in ’ 98 ) , for which the pre-Beddian ages comprise the single span 0 - 48 , 1999 ( or any year ending in ’ 99 ) , for which they comprise the single span 0 - 49 , and 2000 ( or any year ending in ’00 ) , for which they comprise the single span 1 - 49 .
The other night at the fire station , some friends of Beddia ’s confirmed that he was a numbers guy : he liked poker and golf ; when he played roulette , he always played twenty - four — the number of his engine company .
“ Let me tell you what this means , ” Lieutenant Ray O’Hanlon said , slipping off his boots .
“ It means that if you were talking to Bobby in a bar , and suddenly it came up ‘ How old are you ? ’ and Bobby says , ‘ I ’m the same age as the year I was born ’ — now you have to talk to him more .
That was Bobby . ” O’Hanlon continued , “ Trust me , it was n’t a math quandary .
It was a . . . would a pickup line be the wrong answer ? ” ♦
CIA DESTROYS TORTURE TAPES
I see from Memorandum that the only people writing about this at the moment are on the left .
I sincerely hope that changes because this is a very important story and I would hate to think that a sense of partisanship would intrude on what is a probable violation of the law .
There may be good reason to destroy DVD ’s of interrogations .
But not when they have probative value in a potential court case nor when they are destroyed to cover up wrong doing by employees of the government :
The Central Intelligence Agency in 2005 destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the interrogation of two Al Qaeda operatives in the agencyâ€™s custody , a step it took in the midst of Congressional and legal scrutiny about the C.I.
Aâ€™s secret detention program , according to current and former government officials .
The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terror suspects â€ ” including Abu Zubaydah , the first detainee in C.I.A. custody â€ ” to severe interrogation techniques .
They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy , several officials said .
The C.I.A. said today that the decision to destroy the tapes had been made â€ œwithin the C.I.A. itself , â€ and they were destroyed to protect the safety of undercover officers and because they no longer had intelligence value .
The agency was headed at the time by Porter J. Goss .
Through a spokeswoman , Mr. Goss declined this afternoon to comment on the destruction of the tapes .
This is bad enough .
But what makes this a budding scandal for the CIA is that both the 9/11 Commission and attorneys for Zacarias Moussaoui specifically requested such evidence and the CIA denied they had it :
The recordings were not provided to a federal court hearing the case of the terror suspect Zacarias Moussaoui or to the Sept. 11 commission , which had made formal requests to the C.I.A. for transcripts and any other documentary evidence taken from interrogations of agency prisoners .
C.I.A. lawyers told federal prosecutors in 2003 and 2005 , who relayed the information to a federal court in the Moussaoui case , that the C.I.A. did not possess recordings of interrogations sought by the judge in the case .
It was unclear whether the judge had explicitly sought the videotape depicting the interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah .
Granted the judge may not have asked for the specific tapes nor did the 9/11 Commission request anything specific .
But if the CIA is going to hang its hat on that defense , damn them .
Their failure to turn over potential exculpatory evidence may open an avenue of appeal for Zacarias Moussaoui to at least grant him a new trial .
And they impeded the 9/11 investigation by failing to fully cooperate with the Commission ’s requests for information .
It is against American law to torture prisoners – even terrorists .
And American law ’s definition of torture mirrors that of the definition given by the Geneva Convention .
The Geneva Convention prohibits the kind of “ severe interrogation techniques ” that were used on Zubaydah .
It ’s not a question of whether waterboarding is n’t really “ torture ” because our special forces guys go through it as part of their training .
Or other “ stress techniques ” are n’t really torture because they leave no marks or do n’t really distress the prisoner .
The law is the law and these special interrogation techniques are in violation of the Geneva Convention and hence , American law .
If one plus one still equals two , that would mean that the officials who were concerned that the tapes “ could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy ” and went ahead and destroyed them anyway are up for obstruction charges .
We can argue – and I have in the past on this site – that the Geneva Convention is ridiculously out of date , moldy in its thinking and laughably naive about men at war and the exigencies of the times .
And the fact that we and other western countries are the only ones who even make an attempt to conduct ourselves by its rules is patently unfair and revealing of a sickening double standard abroad in the world .
But until and unless it is amended , those officials who authorized the interrogations and who carried them out could be in violation of the law and subject to prosecution .
Destroying the tapes therefore is destroying potential evidence in a criminal trial .
I do n’t write much about the torture issue anymore because it sickens me to have my friends on the right trying to excuse it and it nauseates me when the left moralizes about it .
It is wrong and will come back to haunt us .
Not because , as some argue , that it puts our own soldiers in danger .
That argument flies in the face of history .
We have never fought a war where the enemy we were fighting followed the Geneva Convention .
In fact , most of the enemies we have fought have been flagrant violators of human decency in their treatment of prisoners much less paying any attention to the strictures in the GC .
We should not torture because of who we are not because of what the Geneva Convention says , or the left says , or the hypocritical third world moralists say .
It is wrong for Americans to do it .
And yes , waterboarding is torture .
Putting a prisoner in stress positions is torture .
Sleep deprivation is torture .
Forget the hysterics from our political opponents and examine the issue not as a partisan but as question of simple human decency .
If we Americans have lost that – if we ’ve forgotten that we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the brutes we are fighting and their allies in the hypocritical third world , then we will have lost a very important component of what makes us an exceptional nation .
I do n’t know if we have the courage to face this issue and bring the violators to some kind of justice .
I totally reject the idea of allowing any kind of foreign tribunal to judge Americans for the simple reason I would n’t trust them to be fair and objective , anti-Americanism being a dominant ideology in much of the world where the efficacy of such tribunals is acknowledged .
And facing the music on torture opens a chasm beneath our feet in that the techniques used on these prisoners were approved at the highest levels of the American government .
The idea that these officials will walk away scott free is troubling .
But if you put Bush on trial , what does that do as far as limiting the options of his successors ?
And is it the kind of precedent we really want to set ?
I do n’t know the answers to those questions .
And those on the left , blinded by their unreasoning hatred of this president , are not the ones to judge the best course of action .
But there clearly must be some kind of accounting for what has been done in our name .
How that plays out will say a lot about us as a nation that purports to stand for the best in humanity and not the worst .
UPDATE
More from the Times here .
And The Blotter is reporting that DCIA Hayden issued a statement to CIA employees before the Times article broke , giving a rather disingenuous reason for the destruction of the tapes :
CIA Director Mike Hayden sent a message to CIA employees today saying “ the press has learned ” that the CIA videotaped interrogations in 2002 and that the tapes were subsequently destroyed in 2005 .
The decision to destroy the tapes was made by the CIA , but he says the leaders of the congressional intelligence committees knew about the tapes and the decision to destroy them .
Hayden offers an explanation for why the tapes were destroyed — “ no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal , legislative , or judicial inquiries ” and offers another defense of the interrogation techniques used by the CIA .
John Sifton , a human rights attorney who is active in cases involving the CIA ’s secret prison program , said today that the destruction of the tapes is a scandal .
“ This is a major piece of the mosaic of evidence , and now it ’s gone , ” said Sifton .
“ They should be ashamed of themselves . ”
If the CIA did n’t have a history of stiffing Congressional Committees , judicial proceedings , and special tribunals like the Warren Commission , we might be more inclined to believe General Hayden .
But it is ridiculous for Hayden to say that the decision to destroy them was made in a political vacuum .
As the Times article points out , the tapes were destroyed at the height of Congressional interest in the CIA ’s interrogation techniques .
To then go ahead and destroy a tape that may have been instructive of how the CIA carried out interrogations would seem to infer cover - up rather than some kind of standard operating procedure .
That is , unless you trust what Hayden and others are saying about the subject .
And frankly , they lost the right to get the benefit of the doubt long ago .
UPDATE : 12/7 :
Jamses Joyner also sees obstruction of justice as a problem for those who ordered the tapes destroyed .
He also points out that there was Congressional oversight of a sort in that the Chairmen and Vice Chairs of the House and Senate Intel Committees were informed of the plan to destroy the tapes .
( No mention of informing the Speaker and Minority Leader in the House and the Majority / Minority Leader in the Senate which would also be the custom in these cases of limited notification . )
James pretty much takes Hayden at his word as far as why the tapes were destroyed but points out the discrepancies in his explanation .
Any way you slice it , someone needs to be held accountable for the tape ’s destruction .

An Army officer has become the 255th serviceman to die in Afghanistan or Iraq - equalling the toll of the Falklands War .
Captain John McDermid was killed by a roadside bombing as he led a patrol of Afghan troops in the lawless Helmand Province of southern Afghanistan .
The 43 - year - old father of three , who was serving with the 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment , was killed on Wednesday near the spot where another British soldier died recently .
Scroll down for more ...
He had volunteered for service in Afghanistan and is the 84th British soldier to die there since 2001 .
Captain McDermid , of the Royal Highland Fusiliers , 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland , is one of the most experienced servicemen to die in Iraq or Afghanistan .
He had served 21 years as a soldier and three as an officer .
Last night his wife Gill , a policewoman , and their children were being comforted .
In a statement , his family said : " John was such an important part of their lives and his death has left a void that can never be filled .
Everyone who knew John knew how loving , dedicated , strong , hilarious and truly wonderful he was .
" Although very much a family man , John 's sense of duty and responsibility were never overlooked . "
Lieutenant Colonel Paul Harkness , Commanding Officer of the Royal Highland Fusiliers , said : ' He loved the Army and everything that it represented .
It came as no surprise to those who knew him that he had volunteered to go to Afghanistan , as soldiering was in his blood . '
Captain McDermid , originally from Glasgow , had been training and mentoring Afghan officers .
He died shortly before 11 am as a joint force of British troops and members of the fledgling Afghan National Army were patrolling just south of Sangin town centre , when Taliban insurgents detonated an IED - an improvised explosive device .
The infantryman , who arrived in Afghanistan a few weeks ago , was declared dead at the scene .
IEDs are accounting for an increasing proportion of UK fatalities in Afghanistan , as Taliban fighters adopt tactics used by counterparts in Iraq .
Last night , British forces at Kandahar Air Base gathered for a repatriation ceremony as the body of 22 - year - old Lance Corporal Jake Alderton , who died last week close to the scene of Wednesday 's attack , was put on an RAF aircraft for the journey to the UK .
He was serving with 20 Field Squadron , 36 Engineer Regiment .
Intense fighting continued in the south of Helmand Province yesterday , where coalition forces fought around the strategically vital town of Garmsir , which controls Taliban supply routes from Pakistan in the south .
• Attacks against British and Iraqi forces have dropped by 90 per cent in southern Iraq since UK troops withdrew from the main city of Basra , the commander of British forces there has revealed .
The 5,000 troops moved to an airport on the city 's edge in September , resulting in a " dramatic drop in attacks , " Major General Graham Binns said .
• The Taliban gave a chilling example of their brutality yesterday .
A gang of armed men dragged a 16 - year - old boy from his school and shot him dead just because he had been teaching his friends English .
Gun-toting men stormed the school in the Sayed Karam district of Paktia province in south - east Afghanistan , grabbed the student and dragged him outside .
The local police chief said : ' Taliban militants took the boy out and killed him outside the school just because he was teaching English to his classmates ' .
This is the first time police have admitted such an attack , although militants have previously targeted teachers , threatening and killing scores to try to scare them away from working in government - run schools and especially to try to stop them teaching girls - which the militants consider un -Islamic .

Navigare nel web è a volte una definizione troppo riduttiva perché di solito quando si naviga si sa dove si va e come ci si vuole arrivare .
Per questo dirò che oggi mentre vagabondavo a cavallo del mio fidato browser sono capitato non so come su una pagina che racconta una storia davvero particolare .
Qualche anno fa in una webfarm come molti di noi ne hanno viste , piena di cavi e di server di ogni sorta , un computer proprietario che si occupava di processare e comunicare alle banche le transazioni con carta di credito , aveva cominciato a fare le bizze e sempre più spesso si bloccava brutalmente , senza nemmeno rispondere ad un semplice ping .
Erik , l’amministratore di rete , puntualmente spegneva il computer quando si accorgeva del blocco .
Putroppo però il servizio doveva essere attivo 24 ore al giorno , 7 giorni su 7 .
Il responsabile del dipartimento IT , Laura , indisse una riunione dove fu appurato che , visto che il contratto di supporto era scaduto da due anni e il budget era in quel momento esaurito , non c’era nessuna soluzione .
A quel punto Erik , uscendo dalla riunione , esclamò scherzando : “ Potremmo costruire un robot ! ” .
La responsabile , alla maniera del pointy haired boss , l ’inetto capo di Dilbert , lo prese in parola e gli chiese di farlo subito .
Erik , un attimo prima di confessare che stava scherzando , vide il suo pc che sputava fuori un dvd appena masterizzato e , dimostrandosi un vero hacker , ebbe un ’idea geniale !
Recuperò un vecchio pc , lo mise di fronte al server e , riciclando qualche vecchia rubrica telefonica , fece in modo che il cassetto del cd , aprendosi , andasse a premere il pulsante di reset del server bizzoso .
Uno script che ogni due minuti effettuava un ping e , in caso di mancata risposta , aprisse il cassetto del cd , fece il resto .
Gli anni sono passati , Erik ha cambiato lavoro e , infine , il server difettoso è stato sostituito .
Durante l’avvicendamento , il pc robot è stato spento , spostato in un angolo e quindi riacceso .
Da allora , il vecchio e fedele pc , ha passato le ultime settimane della sua vita aprendo fedelmente ogni due minuti il cassetto del cd , nella vana speranza di spegnere un server che non era più lì .
Probabilmente questa storia — scritta da Jake Vinson su TDWTF — è frutto della sua fantasia , visto che non ho trovato altri riferimenti al nome della società ( anche se l’autore potrebbe averlo camuffato di proposito ) ma ad ogni modo è verosimile .
Non so se avete visto il film “ A.I. Artificial Intelligence ” di Spielberg .
Io sì e , pur non essendomi piaciuto molto , ricordo il sentimento di tristezza che mi aveva destato il robot bambino che per anni poneva la stessa domanda ad una statua aspettando una risposta che non sarebbe mai arrivata .
Ebbene , me lo ha fatto tornare in mente proprio l’immagine di questo vecchio pc che imperterrito , fino alla fine , ha continuato ogni due minuti a cercare di premere un tasto oramai irraggiungibile .
A decade ago , the N.H.L. ’s Canadian franchises were the league ’s economic weak links , with two teams leaving for the United States and at least half the remaining six close to insolvency .
Now the skate is on the other foot .
The Canadian clubs are worth more on average than the league ’s American clubs , according to estimates by Forbes magazine .
And two Canadian teams are being sought for purchase by billionaires  not to move them to the American Sun Belt , but because they are so lucrative where they are in Canada .
The turnaround is largely because of the weakened United States dollar , which was worth about $ 1.50 Canadian throughout the 1990s and well into the 2000s , but is now at par .
The increased relative value of the loonie , and the salary cap instituted in 2005 after the N.H.L. lockout , effectively increased the values of Canadian teams by nearly half .
The rank of the average Canadian team in Forbes ’s annual N.H.L. franchise valuation estimates was 21st among the league ’s 30 teams in 2001 .
It was 13th last year , and is 11th this year .
Judge may order White House to recover ' lost ' e-mails Nick Juliano

Print This Email This UPDATE : Magistrate recommends
White House be forced to hand over records
The White House may soon be forced to prove it is not trying to cheat history by destroying archives of untold numbers of internal e-mails , as a federal magistrate has supported a private watchdog 's restraining order request .
On Friday , a federal magistrate recommended that a judge warn the White House that it could be held in contempt if it destorys archives records of e-mails that were deleted from White House servers , the Associated Press reported .
An ongoing lawsuit is seeking to confirm that White House e-mails that were lost from internal servers can and will be recovered from computer backup tapes .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says the administration has failed to prove that it is protecting the backups ; although officials deny that any tapes were lost , the White House has refused to hand over records backing up that assertion .
U.S. Magistrate John M. Facciola has asked CREW and the Justice Department for suggestions on how to word a court order that would mandate White House compliance , the Associated Press reports .
'' Unlike a court order , a declaration is not punishable by contempt , '' the magistrate wrote Friday .
'' In other words , without such an order , destruction of the backup media would be without consequences . ''
CREW filed a temporary restraining order earlier this month requesting the White House demonstrate it is preserving e-mails in compliance with the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act.
CREW says the White House has only been able to prove it used backup tapes once , although a Justice Department attorney argued such a court order is unnecessary .
The White House Office of Administration , which oversees recordkeeping and archival , has refused to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request for information relating to potentially millions of e-mails that were deleted .
The restraining order stems from a lawsuit demanding the White House hand over records detailing what records were detleted from White House servers .
" The Office of Administration is not recycling backup tapes , " Justice Department attorney Helen Hong told the judge , offering that the administration provide a sworn declaration of what it is preserving , according to AP .
Although the actual content of internal White House e-mails would not be subject to release for years , the archives will provide useful to future historians examining how the Bush administration really worked .

X - No - Thanks
Last week I spent some time dissecting what , I believe , is the reason behind the announcement that Windows Internet Explorer ( née “ Microsoft Internet Explorer ” ) will , as of version 8 , include the ability to emulate previous versions of its rendering engine and , in addition , will default to emulating IE 7 when no version is specified ( with the exception of HTML 5 , which reputedly will trigger a genuine “ standards mode ” in IE 8 ) .
At the time , I was only concerned with analyzing why Microsoft has chosen this route ; I was mostly thinking out loud and trying to determine the causes behind this unexpected shift in IE ’s policy toward compatibility and standards compliance , and held off expressing any judgment of its merits , largely because I simply had n’t had enough time to think about it .
Over the course of the weekend I spent quite a bit of time letting this percolate in the back of my mind , and I think I ’m ready to come to a couple of conclusions :
The X - UA - Compatible behavior will have a net negative impact on designers and developers .
The X - UA - Compatible behavior will not solve the problem Microsoft says it ’s worrying about .
To explain why I ’ve ended up at these conclusions I ’d like to start , as I often do , with a definition .
Our job
Web developers and web designers , despite long - standing differences of focus and eternal arguments about such things as their choice of tools or preferred techniques , ultimately have in common a single , simple job description : use the knowledge and tools at their disposal to produce web - based systems which work , and work well , for the people who will be using those systems .
Everything else — standards , browser compatibility , markup languages , programming languages , layout techniques , the whole shebang — is simply an implementation detail serving the ultimate end of producing something which works for a particular group of users .
Jeff has , I think , been trying to articulate this for months now , and frequently his attempts have been overlooked by people who ’d rather fight than think .
And that ’s a shame , because he ’s spot on in his belief that particular techniques — CSS versus tables , Flash versus JavaScript , CSS “ frameworks ” versus entirely hand - rolled style sheets — can only be meaningfully evaluated insofar as they serve a larger goal .
Or , as Jeff aptly put it :
I ’m done trying to convince anyone else why they should use the same tools I do .
I want to steer the direction of this blog towards talking about great design on the web .
I ’m less interested in the means to an end , and more interested in the end itself .
Of course , there is no Platonic ideal of “ a web site that works ” or — to use Jeff ’s phrase — “ great design on the web ” , and even if there were , there is no set of tools or techniques which is guaranteed to produce that result .
Anyone who reads this blog regularly will recognize that I ’m heading back into one of my favorite slogans : all of the choices made by designers and developers as they work to produce something that serves their users is , ultimately , a trade - off of one sort or another :
Using CSS instead of tables is a trade - off .
instead of tables is a trade - off .

Using JavaScript instead of Flash is a trade - off .
Using any or all of the above in combination with each other is a trade - off .
It ’s trade - offs all the way down : as the laws of physics eloquently remind us , you ca n’t get something for nothing .
All we can do is weigh the options and their impacts and decide whether a particular trade is worth making for a particular situation .
And it ’s in that context that designers and developers must look at X - UA - Compatible : it represents a trade - off , so we need to know what we ’re getting and what we ’re giving up .
The trade
In order to fully understand what “ we ” — web designers and developers — stand to get and stand to give up as a result of X - UA - Compatible , it ’s important to note first that “ we ” are not a homogeneous group ; generally speaking , there are three different groups who are affected differently :
Designers and developers who do standards - based work , avoid browser - targeting hacks and , when faced with an IE problem that ca n’t be worked around any other way , use the reliable technique of conditional comments instead of exploiting potentially - fleeting parsing bugs .
Designers and developers who do standards - based work but do use browser - targeting hacks .
Designers and developers who do not do standards - based work .
Next we have to consider two questions for each group :
What impact does using X - UA - Compatible have ?
What impact does not using X - UA - Compatible have ?
Let ’s start with the first group : standards - based designers and developers who do n’t use browser - targeting hacks .
Since this group already has a reliable way to work around issues in specific versions of IE without relying on bugs in the browser , making use of X - UA - Compatible offers them no net benefit , and a slight loss in increased work to ensure that it ’s used properly in each page served .
However , not using it represents an enormous loss : since the default behavior , as currently specified , is to emulate IE 7 , not using X - UA - Compatible negates the advantages of progressive enhancement by causing future versions of IE not to take advantage of enhancements even when they are capable of doing so .
At least , that ’s how it will apparently work ; I ’m not really sure how it could be any other way , though , because — for example — a fully IE7 - compatible emulation which still enables IE8 features does n’t really seem possible .
And note that the potential loophole of HTML 5 — which , again , will allegedly trigger a genuine “ standards mode ” without use of X - UA - Compatible — does not mitigate this : HTML 5 is still a long way from being a reliably - supported standard , and as such is unlikely to offer a solution in time for IE 8 .
Additionally , existing standards - based sites which cannot or do not want to transition immediately to HTML 5 will not be able to use this loophole .
So for the first group , X - UA - Compatible represents a net loss either way : they receive no benefit , and the only choice this group has is how much of a loss they want to take .
The second group — standards - based designers and developers who do use browser - targeting hacks — similarly face a net loss : if they do not directly use X - UA - Compatible , they will be able to rely on the default behavior emulating existing browser bugs , which is a gain , but they also suffer the loss of progressive enhancement .
If they do directly use X - UA - Compatible , they ’re in the same situation .
The only way they can get progressive enhancement — or any similar access to new features — is to stop relying on specific bugs , in which case they move into the first group and still have a net loss .
The third group — designers and developers who do not do standards - based work — do not receive any benefit from X - UA - Compatible one way or another , because they were already in quirks mode and — presumably , given the sudden focus on not “ breaking the Web ” — quirks mode is unlikely to develop any backwards incompatibilities .
They do face the same loss in terms of ability to take advantage of new features in a compatible fashion , but this group was not using and is not likely to want to use that ability .
So they effectively break even .
So from the perspective of a designer or developer , the best case is breaking even .
From the perspective of a designer or developer who does any form of standards - based work , the best case is a net loss .
The only available conclusion from this analysis is that the existence of X - UA - Compatible will be an overall negative for developers and designers .
The unsolved problem
Additionally , I believe that X - UA - Compatible will not and cannot solve the problem Microsoft claims to be facing ; allegedly , it gets around the limitations of DOCTYPE switching by giving IE a reliable way to handle sites which , though they use a DOCTYPE that should trigger standards mode , rely on bugs in an existing version of IE and so will no longer render properly if a future IE standards mode fixes those bugs .
Emulating historical rendering based on the X - UA - Compatible header and defaulting to emulating the current version of IE when it is not present is , we are told , the solution that works going forward , by allowing existing sites to continue rendering properly and allowing future sites to take advantage of an improved standards mode which will be present in future versions of IE .
Except for the fatal flaw .
If there were and are people building sites that worked in IE 6 but broke in IE 7 due to reliance on IE 6 bugs , and if there are people now building sites which work in IE 7 but which will break in IE 8 due to reliance on IE 7 bugs , then the only reasonable thing to conclude is that there will be people who will build sites that work in IE 8 but break in IE 9 due to reliance on IE 8 bugs , and who will build sites that work in IE 9 but break in IE 10 , and so on .
Attempting to counter this by pointing out that such people will now be able to take advantage of X - UA - Compatible cannot work .
IE has supported version targeting , via conditional comments , since the last millennium , and these people apparently have yet to properly take advantage of that feature ; if they had , there would be no perceived need for X - UA - Compatible .
Thus they will not properly take advantage of X - UA - Compatible either .
To see why this conclusion is inevitable , consider HTML 5 which will , we are told , trigger a genuine standards mode in IE 8 even when the X - UA - Compatible header is not present .
All it will take is a few bugs in IE 8 ’s implementation , and then they ’ll be right back in the same situation : if IE 9 fixes the bugs , it will also “ break the Web ” for anyone who relied on them .
At that point will Microsoft start versioning the version targeting ?
Perhaps they ’ll introduce an X - IE9 - UA - Compatible defaulting to emulating IE 8 , followed by an X - IE10 - UA - Compatible defaulting to emulating IE 9 , and so on into the future ?
It is sometimes quipped that madness consists of repeating the same mistake over and over while somehow expecting to get a different result .
In that sense of the word , X - UA - Compatible may very well represent madness .
At any rate , it does not represent a solution to the problem Microsoft claims to be worrying about .
Where to go from here
What we ’re left with , then , is the conclusion that X - UA - Compatible , if actually implemented , would n’t be a win for anybody : not for designers or developers and not for Microsoft .
I speculated the other day that corporate customers ’ response to Windows Vista , and worries about losing IE ’s last remaining stronghold if those customers migrate their intranet applications away from the usual IE - only stance , seemed a likely cause for the IE team ’s sudden bout of backwards - compatibility fever .
Having thought through the implications of X - UA - Compatible a bit more thoroughly , I no longer think it offers those customers anything tangible — most of them are probably running quirks - mode abominations anyway — but I still think that ’s a reasonable explanation for its announcement .
That it throws a monkey wrench into standards - based development at a time when IE desperately needs to play catch - up on that front is tempting fodder for a conspiracy theory , but ultimately I think the explanation is pretty mundane : Microsoft knows that it ’s losing browser share and that its corporate customers are unhappy , so it ’s providing a soothing bit of marketing fluff to calm the waters and buy time .
Molly Holzschlag ’s account of the process which led up to this lends credence to that explanation ; the level of corporate idiocy apparently involved in Microsoft ’s decision - making process seems to rule out the conspiracy angle because , if nothing else , an effective conspiracy requires the left hand to know what the right hand is doing .
About the only other explanation I can come up with is an attempt to harness the old fire and motion strategy again by forcing the rest of the market to react to what Microsoft is doing , but if that ’s the case it ’s backfiring .
The response on the WebKit blog shows just how much things have changed ; it ’s almost snarky in its statement that “ we have n’t really experienced the same problem ” , and comes to a conclusion that would have been unthinkable for an alternative browser a few years ago :
[ W]e do n’t see a great need to implement version targeting in Safari .
We think maintaining multiple versions of the engine would have many downsides for us and little upside .
The IE team is , of course , under different constraints and free to make their own choices .
The days when the world trembled at sudden strategic announcements from Redmond have gone ; the response today is “ OK , you just go ahead and do that . ”
Which gets me back to where I was last week :
Microsoft is no longer relevant to the future of web standards : their only two choices right now are to play a long and expensive game of catch - up while under fire , or consign IE to the dustbin of legacy software .
When I was a kid working in the bread factory , my nemesis was dough .
It was sticky and hard to remove and it got everywhere .
I got home with specks of dough in my hair .
Every shift included a couple of hours of scraping dough off of machinery .
I carried dough - scrapers in my back pocket .
Sometimes a huge lump of dough would go flying someplace where it should n’t and gum up everything .
I had dough nightmares .
I worked in the production side of the factory .
The other side did packing and shipping .
Their nemesis was crumbs .
Crumbs got everywhere .
The shipping crew went home with crumbs in their hair .
Every shift included a couple of hours of brushing crumbs out of machinery .
They carried little brushes in their back pockets .
I ’m sure they had crumb nightmares , too .
Pretty much any job that you can get paid for includes dealing with one gnarly problem .
If you do n’t have dough or crumbs to deal with , maybe you work in a razor blade factory and go home with little cuts all over your fingers .
Maybe you work for VMWare and have nightmares about emulating bugs in sophisticated video cards that games rely on .
Maybe you work on Windows , and your nightmare is that the simplest change can cause millions of old programs and hardware devices to stop working .
That ’s the gnarly part of your job .
One of our gnarly problems is getting FogBugz to run on our customers ’ own servers .
Jason Fried over at 37 signals has a good summary of why this is no fun :
“ You have to deal with endless operating environment variations that are out of your control .
When something goes wrong it ’s a lot harder to figure out why if you are n’t in control of the OS or the third party software or hardware that may be interfering with the install , upgrade , or general performance of your product .
This is even more complicated with remote server installs when there may be different versions of Ruby , Rails , MYSQL , etc. at play . ”
Jason concludes that if they had to sell installable software , they “ definitely would n’t be as happy . ”
Yep .
Work that makes you unhappy is what I mean by “ a gnarly problem . ”
The trouble is , the market pays for solutions to gnarly problems , not solutions to easy problems .
As the Yorkshire lads say , “ Where there ’s muck , there ’s brass . ”
We offer both kinds of FogBugz–hosted and installable–and our customers opt 4 to 1 to install it at their own site .
For us , the installable option gives us five times the sales .
It costs us an extra salary or two ( in tech support costs ) .
It also means we have to use Wasabi , which has some serious disadvantages compared to off - the - shelf programming languages , but which we found to be the most cost - effective and efficient way , given our code base , to ship software that is installable on Windows , Linux , and Mac .
Boy , I would love nothing more than to scrap installable FogBugz and run everything on our servers … we ’ve got racks and racks of nice , well - managed Dell servers with plenty of capacity and our tech support costs for the hosted version are zero .
Life would be much easier .
But we ’d be making so much less money we ’d be out of business .
The one thing that so many of today ’s cute startups have in common is that all they have is a simple little Ruby - on - Rails Ajax site that has no barriers to entry and does n’t solve any gnarly problems .
So many of these companies feel insubstantial and fluffy , because , out of necessity ( the whole company is three kids and an iguana ) , they have n’t solved anything difficult yet .
Until they do , they wo n’t be solving problems for people .
People pay for solutions to their problems .
Making an elegantly - designed and easy - to - use application is just as gnarly , even though , like good ballet , it seems easy when done well .
Jason and 37signals put effort into good design and get paid for that .
Good design seems like the easiest thing to copy , but , watching Microsoft trying to copy the iPod , turns out to be not - so - easy .
Great design is a gnarly problem , and can actually provide surprisingly sustainable competitive advantage .
Indeed Jason probably made a good choice by picking the gnarly problem where he has a lot of talent ( design ) to solve , because it does n’t seem like a chore to him .
I ’ve been a Windows programmer for ages , so making a Windows Setup program for FogBugz , from scratch in C++ doing all kinds of gnarly COM stuff , does n’t seem like a chore to me .
The only way to keep growing –as a person and as a company–is to keep expanding the boundaries of what you ’re good at .
At some point , the 37signals team might decide that hiring one person to write the Setup script and do installation support would pay for itself , and generate substantially more profit than it costs .
So unless they deliberately want to keep the company small , which is a perfectly legitimate desire , they might eventually lose their reluctance to do things that seem gnarly .
Or maybe they wo n’t .
There ’s nothing wrong with choosing the fun part of your business to work on .
I ’ve certainly been guilty of that .
And there ’s nothing wrong with deciding that you only want to solve a specific set of problems for a small , select group of people .
Salesforce has managed to become big enough by sticking to hosted software .
And there are plenty of smaller software shops providing a fantastic lifestyle for their crew with no desire to get any bigger .
But the great thing is that as you solve each additional gnarly problem , your business and market grows substantially .
Good marketing , good design , good sales , good support , and solving lots of problems for customers all amplify each other .
You start out with good design , then you add some good features and triple your customer base by solving lots of problems , and then you do some marketing and triple your customer base again because now lots of people learn about your solution to their pain , and then you hire sales people and triple your customer base yet again because now the people who know about your solution are reminded to actually buy it , and then you add more features to solve more problems for even more people , and eventually you actually have a chance to reach enough people with your software to make the world a better place .
P.S. I ’m not claiming here that 37signals would sell 5 times as many copies if they offered Installable Basecamp .
First of all , one of the reasons we may sell so many more installable versions of FogBugz is that it appears , to some customers , to be cheaper .
( It ’s not cheaper in the long run because you have to pay for the server and administer it yourself , but that ’s subjective . )
Also , our support costs for the installable version are only as low as they are because 80 % of our customers opt to run on Windows Server .
Because Windows systems are so similar , it ’s much easier for us to support the lowest common denominator .
The vast majority of our tech support costs are caused by the diversity in Unix platforms out there –I ’d guess that the 20 % of our Unix sales result in 80 % of our support incidents .
If an installable version of Basecamp required Unix , the support cost would be disproportionately expensive compared to a hypothetical installable Windows version .
Finally , another reason our experience might not translate to 37signals is that we ’ve been selling installable software for seven years now ; the hosted version has only been out for about six months .
So we have a big installed base used to running FogBugz on their own servers .
If you only look at new FogBugz customers , the ratio of installable to hosted goes down to 3 to 1 .

When we posted the “ 700 Club ” report on a group of missionaries who believe God is using Interstate 35 to “ invade ” gay bars and porn shops along the highway , many people remarked on the amateur video featured in the segment that purported to show a young man being “ freed ” from “ the desires to be with men ” through the laying of hands outside a nightclub :
CBN REPORTER : Stabile felt God moving in him then , saving him and taking away his homosexuality .
JAMES STABILE :
He just came in and complete transformed and radically saved me … I did n’t feel the desires to be with men like I had felt before .
JOE ODEN : We laid hands on him .
He was hit by the power of God and filled with the Holy Ghost , got plugged into our church , and is just living for God .
What really happened to James Stabile ?
John Wright of the Dallas Voice tracked him down .
When Stabile was interviewed by the “ 700 Club , ” he had already been kicked out of Heartland World Ministries ’ “ ex - gay treatment facility ” for lying compulsively .
But , as Wright reports , that did not prevent Heartland from “ asking Stabile to do an interview for a segment on televangelist Pat Robertson ’s ‘ The 700 Club ’ about the so - called purity sieges organized by the church outside gay bars . ”
Additionally , Stabile , who reportedly has bipolar disorder , “ had n’t taken his medication in 2 and - a - half weeks and had been drinking when he encountered the group from Heartland on the strip . ”
Wright also spoke with Stabile ’s parents , who helped explain how their son became a Religious Right media sensation for a day :
Joseph Stabile said the Heartland folks also may have advised James to throw away his medication , telling him that God would cure his bipolar disorder , too .
Joseph ’s parents said James has a tendency to be less than truthful , especially when he ’s off his medication , and that he loves attention .
They said they do n’t believe he ’s ever questioned his sexuality , but that the folks from Heartland manipulated and exploited him for publicity .
They also provided a glimpse of life inside the “ ex - gay ” facility :
James just told them it was “ horrible ” and that there are some things he will never be able to share .
James ’ mother , Suzanne , said he told her the people at Pure Life constantly threatened that he was going to hell .
Men in the program had to be fully clothed from the neck down at all times , including when they went to sleep , James told his parents .
And they were prohibited from any physical contact , including shaking hands .
Speaking with Wright , Stabile “ apologized to the LGBT community ” and said he hopes “ his story will discourage others from entertaining ideas that they can change their sexual orientations . ”
The way America has got involved in conflicts in regions like the Middle East has made some people very angry , including a group called al - Qaeda - who are widely thought to have been behind the attacks .
In the past , al - Qaeda leaders have declared a holy war - called a jihad - against the US .
As part of this jihad , al - Qaeda members believe attacking US targets is something they should do .
When the attacks happened in 2001 , there were a number of US troops in a country called Saudi Arabia , and the leader of al - Qaeda , Osama Bin Laden , said he wanted them to leave .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , on the Senate floor just a few minutes ago , proposed Oct. 11 , 2007 as the “ expiration date ” for the Iraq war .
“ It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq , ” she said .
“ If the president will not bring himself to accept reality , it is time for Congress to bring reality to him . ”
A measure by Mrs. Clinton and Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia would end Congress ’s use of force authorization five years to the day after the original use of force legislation took effect in 2002 .
“ I urge my colleagues to join Senator Byrd and me in supporting this effort to require a new authorization resolution for these new times , ” she said .
Text of Senator Clinton ’s remarks on the Senate floor .
Update : Senator Christopher J. Dodd , who has worked to stake a more aggressive stance on withdrawal than most of the other Democratic candidates , released a statement downplaying the significance of Mrs. Clinton ’s measure to deauthorize :
I support the efforts of Senators Byrd and Clinton to de-authorize the war in that we can all agree that the authorization has been de facto null and void because there were no weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein has been out of power for years .
While I applaud this effort , sadly , it will not change the President ’s course in Iraq .
There is only one binding and responsible way to end this war .
He reiterated his support for the Feingold - Reid legislation , which would not only set a withdrawal timeline but also ultimately cut off war funds .
For those parents and students whose New Year 's resolution is to start the search for the right college , some new – and free – tools are coming online to make that task a little bit easier .
The websites – College Portrait ( www.voluntarysystem.org) and U - CAN ( www.ucan-network.org) – offer essential information to make it easy to compare participating schools .
Interested in the professor - student ratio ?
The racial breakdown on campus ?
A detailed picture of costs and financial aid ?
Here 's where you can get a glimpse or follow the links to dig deeper .
These sites are one answer to the mounting pressure to make the often - frustrating system of admissions and financial aid easier for families to navigate .
Some education advocates hope they will prove to be the first step toward building an even more comprehensive website that would include guidance - counseling components .
Students should be empowered to choose for themselves what matters most , they say .
And they hope these nonprofit alternatives will help reverse the brand - name frenzy fed by popular rankings such as the annual guide by U.S. News & World Report .
Just over a year ago , the report of the Education Secretary 's Commission on the Future of Higher Education sounded the call for more accountability and transparency .
College and university groups moved quickly to make the information they already gather more available to the public , aiming to head off potential federal mandates .
" Parents and students ... are trying to make some big , difficult decisions , so the more transparent we are about our business and the outcome of our business , the better it is for everyone , " says Charles Reed , chancellor of the California State University system .
All 23 Cal State campuses will be represented on College Portrait , the joint venture of two public university associations , the National Association of State Universities and Land - Grant Colleges ( NASULGC ) and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities ( AASCU ) .
" It 's important for all of higher education to participate so that we can continue to gain the public 's confidence about how we use the public 's resources to educate America 's future workforce , " Mr. Reed says .
College Portrait will offer some innovative features – such as an interactive cost calculator .
People have a hard time figuring out the true cost of college , and low - income families often believe college is out of reach , says David Shulenburger , vice president for academic affairs at NASULGC .
" We put the calculator in so that by entering a dozen pieces of data , you can [ get ] a reasonable estimate of what the net cost will be of attending a specific university . "
Visitors to the site , which is still in its pilot stages , can see a breakdown of academic progress and graduation rates at each school – not only the percentage that graduate in four years and six years , but also the percentage that are still enrolled in higher education or have graduated from another institution .
Debate over access
Schools that want to be listed on College Portrait also have to agree to post " learning outcomes " data .
Various assessments already exist to measure how much students gain in broad areas such as problem - solving and writing skills .
But whether those results should be reported publicly is a matter of heated debate in higher education .
Because of the learning - outcomes requirement , the University of California , another public system in the state , has declined to participate .
Only about 300 out of more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the United States use such assessments so far , Mr. Shulenburger says .
Schools that sign on to College Portrait will have the next four years to begin tracking the learning - outcomes results before being required to post them .
U -CAN – a site put together by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities ( NAICU ) – offers similar information in a template .
It includes links to a school 's own website for details on areas such as internships and study abroad .
U - CAN does not require schools to post learning - outcomes data , but allows them to link to such information if they choose .
" Given the extraordinary diversity of our institutions ... what you need is a whole range of ways to assess quality , " says NAICU president David Warren .
A school whose curriculum is focused on the " Great Books " is going to measure success very differently from a school with strengths in engineering , for instance .
Launched in late September , U - CAN has nearly 600 colleges participating , and many others in the planning stage .
College Portrait expects to have many schools represented by the spring .
For members of Congress who have been advocating for more accessible information , both sites are encouraging .
A version of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act moving through the House would set up a voluntary system similar to U - CAN .
Focus on retention rates
Judy Bracken , a college and career specialist at George Mason High School in Falls Church , Va. , says U - CAN is " really user - friendly ; it 's a fun , bright site . "
And she expects the cost calculator on College Portrait to be a popular feature .
But she does n't see the sites as unique .
" The College Board has [ information ] on almost every single college , " she says .
While she relies on a search tool that her school district pays for , she says various free resources are already available .
Wherever people do their searches , one piece of data she advises them to scrutinize is the retention rate – the number of first - year students who return the next year .
" That really does tell you , Did they market themselves in a true fashion ? "
Ms. Bracken encourages students to shake off the pressure to chase the Ivy League or other name - brand schools .
" If I can just get kids to look really carefully at what is the best fit for them , then I feel like I 've done my job . "
Virtual counselors
There is an effort under way to incorporate some of the tried and true advice of guidance counselors into a free comprehensive website .
The nonprofit group Education Conservancy ( www.educationconservancy.org) is leading the charge to develop a prototype and raise the estimated $ 400,000 it would need to start up such a site .
With so many students not having enough access to college counselors , there 's a " dire " need for a site that will offer much more than just information templates , says executive director Lloyd Thacker , a former admissions officer and high school counselor .
Thacker is also in the forefront of the movement to have colleges boycott the U.S. News rankings .
" We 're serving the needs of kids in a process that 's become increasingly commercialized , " he says .
Add It All Up and It Spells Trouble
With a capital " T " , which rhymes with " P " and stands for " pool " ...
It 's that time of year again .
All the experts are weighing in with their take on videogames and how they 're harming our children .
The National Institute for Media and the Family released their 2007 Mediawise report to much self - generated fanfare .
" The Musicman " must be required study material for these guys .
In case you 've never seen the movie , a huckster trying to fraudulently sell band instruments comes into a small town and attempts to bilk them into protecting their kids from the evil influence of a pool table installed in the local billiard hall .
He convinces a bunch of the locals they would be keeping their kids moral after school by starting a marching band .
It 's a tactic certain people are using to great effect in the real world .
When it comes to getting straight answers about kids and videogames , supposed experts are n't much help .
The medical community is divided on the whole affair .
Their approach to the problem is greatly hindered by their methodologies and also by the sources of their information .
A great deal of their funding comes directly from anti-game groups who make their bread and butter trying to make non-gamer parents afraid of video games .
The American Psychological Association has published an article stating that , while they believe it is likely video games can cause aggressive behavior , parents can mitigate it by enforcing limits .
They have another article where they claim they have proved that media violence on TV causes violent behavior in children .
However , both of those articles cite as their base studies completed by a several professedly anti-video gaming groups such as the National Institute on Media and the Family , and Children Now .
These think - tanks are at the base of much of the mainstream " thinking " on the problem .
For example , an article entitled Violent Video Games : Myths , Facts , and Unanswered Questions by a Dr. Craig Anderson cites 11 " myths " about the research linking violent video games to violent actions .
The myths are not properly cited out , and not only that , but a quick look at the bibliographical list on the bottom shows that he participated in most of the studies , and ones that he did n't participate in were done by his colleagues .
If you read the media reports and their corresponding published study papers , a consistent group of practitioners emerges .
A Dr. Douglas Gentile is thoroughly cited at the bottom of the APA article .
He 's one of the staff over at National Institute on Media and the Family .
Dr. David Walsh is the president and founder of the National Institute on Media and the Family .
Dr. Craig Anderson is currently on staff at Iowa State University .
And he has a new book out .
Note who his co-authors are .
Dr. Gentile , I presume ?
That 's just part of the NIMF gang .
Other groups have their own pet researchers .
Take Dr. Vincent P. Mathews , professor of radiology at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis .
He recently published a study that was cited with a big writeup in Newsweek claiming to have proven there a biological change in teenage brains that were exposed to violence .
He has also provided this study , which was paid for by the Center for Successful Parenting .
There 's no wide groundswell of public concern about media content coming through to the watchdog agencies .
It 's a focused campaign by a specific group .
You can see just how effective they have been looking at the stats over the last several years .
The FCC received a total of 111 complaints about 101 shows in the year 2000 .
According to this Princeton courseblog , in 2003 the FCC " received 240,350 complaints about 318 programs . "
The difference is a group called the Parent 's Television Council , who coordinate to take the newly expanded options for complaint all the way out to the edge of the envelope .
All but 513 of those complaints in 2003 focused on nine shows , mostly specific episodes of particular shows the group targeted through it 's email network which gives it 's members incidents in specific episodes of shows so they can go to the FCC site and complain in great numbers .
They and similar groups are also targeting the ESRB and the MPAA ( who rate video games and movies , respectively ) and the proportion to what I 'll call " free range " complaints to group complaints is similar .
Who are these groups ?
National Institute on Media and the Family produces the MediaWise report each year .
The Center for Successful Parenting makes their feelings on the matter quite plain right there on their homepage .
The term " gamewashing " and the parental warnings all over it point out their target .
The Parent 's Television Council organization continues to grow , and with 28 state chapters they 're branching out into other media .
They 're at the head of an initiative in Colorado to stop the local transit systems from allowing advertising M- rated video games on buses and trains .
They 're not alone .
The Family Research Council is a conservative Christian group also founded by Dr. Dobson of Focus on the Family .
As gamers we may s{racist slur} at their antics ( and the fact they 're using a Dreamcast as their example of a game system ) .
But mainstream media here in America and all over the world uses the studies they pay for to write articles .
So What ?
These groups raise money to further their research supporting their assertion that video games directly cause violence .
Due to ignorance or having the same axe to grind , others take these biased numbers and baseless opinions and pass them .
And they go down the chain from pundit to teacher to preacher to parent and with each hand off they break down the links between the baldly false sound byte and the current rendition .
Eventually the tie is broken completely , and everyone hears the blindered junk science that originally started this as a proven fact .
Group and pundits like Dr. Dobson and his Focus on the Family group use that same research over and over again .
If you have an asbestos - covered temper , you can buy his seminal radio broadcast on the topic " Sounding the Alarm on Video Games " on their site .
Their political arm , the Family Research Council , is behind last week 's article on the conservative news site CNSNews.com which posted an article decrying the game Mass Effect as being pornographic in nature due to a cutscene contained within the game and accusing Bioware of marketing the game to children .
Then the tale gets embroidered .
This week , a conservative political site called Townhall.com posted a long diatribe full of fallacies and falsehoods that tries to paint the science fiction shooter as the equivalent of a pornography studio stocked with aliens on the basis of that same single 40 second long cutscene .
He ends his article with a call for politicians to begin to weigh in on the damage he perceives as being done to our children and society .
The site has since pulled the article and he himself has since retracted some of his statements , but still maintains his stance that videogames are an evil that needs to be fought for the sake of the children .
And as much as we would wish otherwise , people in secular authority are listening to these think tanks and these organized groups and spending pubic money based on their rhetoric .
Senators Clinton , Brownback , Lieberman , and Beyh , known for their anti-gaming stance , have decided to weigh in on the waning Manhunt 2 controversy by sending a rather pointed letter to the head of the ESRB asking , among other things , that the game 's M rating be reconsidered .
The text of the letter is available from Senator Lieberman 's website .
There have been several attempts to get a bill passed for a federal study on videogame violence , and not to mention the over a dozen failed attempts to get a law passed to limit videogame sales based on their content .
California 's governor has just sent their failed game sales limiting law up for yet another expensive appeal .
Our country has already played this game before .
In the 1954 a psychologist named Dr. Fredric Wertham wrote a book entitled Seduction of the Innocent .
He maintained that comic books were a serious cause of juvenile delinquency .
After all , an extremely high percentage of the kids in juvenile hall read comic books .
Therefore it must be the comics fault and it was turning our children bad .
The books claimed to find evidence that there was suggestive pictures hidden in the backgrounds of the art work , and he also decided Wonder Woman was a lesbian due to her strength ( remember that time frame here ; we would n't bat an eye but back then that was a serious charge ) .
It was a minor bestseller and galvanized parents to lobby for censorship and Congress muddled their way into the debate .
The Comics Code Authority was established by the industry in self - defense , and all comics were neutered down to what comic book afficiandos refer to as The Silver Age .
And it did absolutely nothing to affect the juvenile crime statistics .
Does this sound like a certain Colonel Grossman to you ?
Or perhaps a certain Florida lawyer who continues his crusade to convince the world that games are turning us all into killers .
His recent suit against the police chief of Omaha , Nebraska because the man wo n't announce that a mall shooting spree was caused by a young man playing violent videogames is merely the latest in a decade - long string of his attempts to litigate his paranoid fantasy of millions of mass - murders waiting to happen into reality .
The Musicman reference at the beginning of this article is there for a reason .
We have that same situation going on in our own town squares right now .
These groups and their pet experts are rousing all sorts of ire by convincing people that others are outraged or upset .
The currently demonstrated facts of the situation seem meaningless to them .
And those who have cause to worry about people 's opinions like elected officials are being fooled into thinking this group 's ideas are what people really want .
I try to speak out , but I have a hard time keeping calm sometimes .
When Colonel Grossman trots out his Ranger tab to bolster his credentials list I look at my eldest son's Ranger coin and shake my head .
It makes me furious that he 's using it that way .
I hate that they take the trappings of science and turn them to their own purposes for money and notoriety instead of truth .
I hate that many of them are doing it in the name of a faith I profess .
The most frustrating part is I want the answers they claim to have .
Being a parent is hard enough without the armchair moralizing and social engineering that they 're trying to pass off as truth .
I want to see a properly run study with a large enough statistical base and a long enough span to give us some real guidance .
There are other groups doing better studies , but in the current climate they 're not getting the attention they should be getting .
For a good start , try Gamestudies.org , which is a cross - disciplinary peer - reviewed journal that tries to academically address gaming and all it's issues .
This one is particularly interesting as it's an attempt by the authors to start to design a rational methodology for studying videogames and their content .
It 's a first step towards a real framework to design a study that might give us some clearer answers .
But real science takes time and I 'm not sure we 're going to get those answers before the powers that be start barking at the base of the NIMF tree again .
Just talking does n't give us our happy ending where we all dance off down the street with 76 trombones behind us .
Reading through the comments on that Townhall.com article gives a pretty good cross section of the standard reactions .
I 've never had much luck trying to have an unbiased conversation on the topic .
The game industry 's many attempts to bring John Bruce and his ilk to bay have their echoes in the foyer of my church every Sunday and in the boardrooms of the local school district offices .
I do n't necessarily disagree with some of their points .
But when you dig to the bottom of the whole mess , all they 've got to back them up is a study paid for by an organization with a cause , a designed - in results bias , an unproven methodology and just enough subjects to dance on the head of a pin , they are nothing more than opinions and hearsay .
Stacking a bunch of them up and repeating them over and over does n't make them real .
The plural of the word anecdote is not data .
What Do we Do ?
If you feel strongly about this topic , then get involved .
It 's the only way to counter this sort of organized tactics .
Groups like the ECA are trying to get the word out with communities like GamePolitics .
Gamer - run parenting sites like Gamerdad and WhatThey Play are trying to help other parents start to come to grips with the whole media influx and what it means for their families where it actually happens - their living rooms .
But they have nowhere near the resources of the anti-gaming crowd .
Do it now .
We 're coming up on a contentious election year and these groups have already demonstrated that they want game content on the agenda .
And the industry big -names are starting to take it seriously , too .
It was announced in the New York Times on January 15th that the videogame industry is forming a PAC of it's own .
It 's time to tell Washington and your local authorities that if they 're going to spend money on this then it better not be at the hands of special interest groups who have already made their position very clear .
And wasting it on yet another unconstitutional game sales law is n't the answer either .
We want hard facts .
We want our laws and public policies based on those facts instead of someone 's opinions .
And until they find a way to get those hard facts , we want them to stop wasting the taxpayer 's time and money on their opinions .
Simulators are becoming increasingly popular - especially for you we select the best representatives of this genre available for smartphones and tablets .

The Essence of the Iterator Pattern .
Submitted for publication .
The Iterator pattern gives a clean interface for element - by - element access to a collection .
Imperative iterations using the pattern have two simultaneous aspects : mapping and accumulating .
Various functional iterations model one or other of these , but not both simultaneously .
We argue that McBride and Paterson 's idioms , and in particular the corresponding traverse operator , do exactly this , and therefore capture the essence of the Iterator pattern .
We present some axioms for traversal , and illustrate with a simple example , the repmin problem .
The core of the solution is from McBride and Paterson 's paper Applicative programming with effects , which was n't posted to the home page before , but which was mentioned a couple of times in the LtU forum .
The context of this reseach is previous attempts to capture functional analogues of OOP design patterns :
He was a onetime utopian socialist who became an assertive right - winger , a libertarian nudist with a military - hardware fetish , a cold warrior who penned an Age of Aquarius sensation with a hero who preached free love .
He won admiration from Ronald Reagan , who enlisted his ideas in his “ Star Wars ” missile shield , and Charles Manson , who was captured with the novel “ Stranger in a Strange Land ” in his backpack .
He predicted the European Union and invented the water bed .
But Robert A. Heinlein , the California - based science - fiction writer who stood over the midcentury decades like a colossus , casts a different kind of shadow now , on the 100th anniversary of his birth , as his archives , held by UC Santa Cruz , are being placed online , making his work even more accessible to scholars and fans .
Most of his work is in print , but opinions vary wildly about how important a writer Heinlein was :
He ’s both a life - changing inspiration and a “ dinosaur ” who exerts less cultural presence than , say , Philip K. Dick , the drug - addled oddball who was a footnote during the field ’s golden age .
Heinlein , who in life was a divisive figure , has become , in death , a polarizing one and even something of a punch line .
“ When an emerging science - fiction writer ’s work earns him comparisons to Robert A. Heinlein , ” Dave Itzkoff begins a 2006 New York Times review , “ should he take them as a compliment ? ”
Advertisement
As the literary and academic worlds open to science - fiction and genre writing , Heinlein lacks the cachet of J.G. Ballard , Ursula LeGuin , Octavia Butler , Neal Stephenson , cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson and others .
Films based on Dick ’s books , good and bad , keep coming .
But Heinlein ’s film adaptations , in the last half century , since 1950 ’s “ Destination Moon , ” culminated in 1997 ’s “ Starship Troopers , ” widely disliked by his fan base .
Non-SF writer William Burroughs probably has more influence inside the genre ’s literary wing than Heinlein , who won four Hugos ( the award voted by the fans ) , sold millions of copies , and was termed the field ’s most significant writer since H.G. Wells .
“ His rabid fan base is graying , ” said Annalee Newitz , who writes about science fiction for Wired and Gawker .
“ To literary readers , the books look cheesy , sexist in a hairy - chest , gold - chain kind of way .
His stuff has n’t stood the test of time , ” because of characters ’ windy speechifying and their frontier optimism .
“ Here at the store I actively resist promoting him , because he was a fascist , ” said Charles Hauther , the science fiction buyer at Skylight Books .
“ People do n’t seem to talk about him anymore .
I have n’t had a conversation about Heinlein in a long time . ”
Advertisement
Still , hard - core admirers remain : David Silver , the Venice - based president of the 800 - member Heinlein Society , discovered the author ’s work as a boy in the ‘ 50s and said he rereads about four dozen of Heinlein ’s books every year .
And Heinlein ’s following shows up in unexpected places :
He ’s the hero of numerous astronauts , Silicon Valley types and those seeking to privatize space travel .
He is n’t just their favorite writer ; he set them on their life ’s course .
He generated public enthusiasm for the space race , inspired the genre called “ military science fiction . ”
Tom Clancy , Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and countless libertarians are fans .
A crater on Mars is named for him .
Tom Disch , author of the respected critical study “ The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of , ” said Heinlein ’s early work was often brilliant .
“ His great misfortune is the people who like him :
It ’s often old - fashioned , cantankerous , right - wing chest - beaters .
He was a better writer than that would suggest .
He had a gift for startling notions . ”
‘ He was the enemy ’
Advertisement
There are plenty of reasons for the polarized feelings over Heinlein , who was born in Missouri , attended the U.S. Naval Academy , left the military after a bout of tuberculosis and spent several decades in L.A. and Santa Cruz .
After campaigning for Upton Sinclair and running for the California Assembly , he dominated the pulp magazines , broke into the Saturday Evening Post and became the first science fictionist to land on the New York Times bestseller list .
Some of the divisiveness around Heinlein comes from a battle that redrew the field profoundly over politics and gender .
In the ‘ 40s and ‘ 50s , science fiction ’s “ golden age , ” there were three faces on the genre ’s Mt. Rushmore : Arthur C. Clarke , Isaac Asimov and Heinlein .
His books are far more likely than the others ’ to have the word “ controversial ” in their jacket copy .
“ He was the enemy , ” recalled Disch , who was an emerging novelist in the “ new wave ” of the 1960s .
Advertisement
Those writers , often liberal or radical , aimed to move away from pulp space operas and toward literature , from tales of physics to stories about psychology and sexuality and drugs .
There were more female writers , and the men exhibited a feminist consciousness that diverged sharply from the golden age , in which women were usually sex objects , foils to rugged male heroes or absent altogether .
Even “ Stranger , ” with its countercultural following and endless debates about alternative sexuality -- it ’s one of several of his books to dramatize group marriages -- enrages feminists these days .
“ It ’s like the sexist model of hippie life , ” said Newitz . “ ‘ We ’re all liberated , but the women still get the coffee . ’ ”
Though he became a symbol of all that was backward to the new wavers , some cite him as a major influence .
“ He was the enemy -- yes , ” said Samuel R. Delany , a leader of the ‘ 60s insurgence who is also black and gay .
“ But he was the enemy to be bested at his own game .
We took his rhetorical tricks , his ways of dramatizing an argument , and then used them to dramatize arguments he would have hated . ”
Advertisement
Despite a backlash of masculine , hard - science - driven work in the early Reagan era , the new wave effectively won the war when cyberpunk and its variations became the dominant strains over the last few decades .
“ He was certainly temporarily defeated by that generation , ” said Newitz .
“ But we ’re really going through a renaissance of space opera ” in movies and television and books by writers such as Iain M. Banks and Ken MacLeod , who lean as far to the left as Heinlein did to the right .
“ Any form goes through phases , and we ’re seeing a backlash against cyberpunk .
We ’re sick of implants .
We want to go to another galaxy .
This new generation is writing stuff that ’s more literary and more relevant to issues we ’re grappling with as a culture . ”
The core of his following
Advertisement
For years , the intellectually ambitious novels of the 1960s , especially “ Stranger in a Strange Land , ” about a spiritually and sexually messianic Martian - born human , and “ The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress , ” which concerns a free - market revolt by prisoners on the moon , were considered Heinlein ’s great work .
These books still have followings ; “ Moon ” sits in the International Space Station library .
But the bestselling “ Stranger , ” which Kurt Vonnegut Jr. reviewed on the cover of the New York Times Book Review in 1990 when it was reissued in an expanded edition , now reads like a long - winded relic of the ‘ 60s , philosophy for junior high kids .
Meanwhile , the books aimed squarely at a youth audience , the “ juveniles ” of the ‘ 40s and ‘ 50s , such as “ Red Planet ” and “ Orphans in the Sky , ” have seen their stars rise .
Advertisement
“ There ’s always this Heinlein character pontificating , ” said Junot Diaz , who immersed himself in the books as background for his recent novel “ The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao . ”
“ I never liked that .
And he always cut that down in his juveniles .
He was so much more humane ” in those books . ”
“ One of my favorites was ‘ Have Space Suit Spacesuit -- Will Travel . ’
I used to have dreams about that book . ”
George Slusser , who ’s taught science fiction at UC Riverside for 25 years and sees Heinlein as reflecting many currents of American literature , concedes that many of the late books are self - indulgent and solipsistic .
But his students continue to respond to Heinlein ’s juveniles , especially science students .
“ Have Space Suit -- Will Travel , ” said Slusser , “ is like ‘ Huckleberry Finn ’ redone , even though the title is silly and it involves a kid getting a space suit by saving box tops . ”
Advertisement
L.A. writer M.G. Lord loves the juveniles and credits their strong , self - reliant females with making her a feminist .
The tendency of Heinlein heroines to use initials led young Mary Grace to do the same .
But Heinlein ’s adult books are not as good , she said , and some written during and after the sexual revolution are disturbing , including “ Friday , ” in which a heroine falls in love with her rapist .
“ The minute he could make his sexual fantasies explicit it was , ‘ Oh , gross ! ’ ”
The serious books , especially those he wrote in the two decades before his death in 1988 , seem culturally out of step .
“ I do n’t see any of his novels as being especially relevant for my students in the 21st century , ” said H. Bruce Franklin , a Rutgers professor and author of “ Robert Heinlein : America as Science Fiction . ”
Advertisement
Heinlein ’s gift was to catch the zeitgeist .
“ That ’s what made him so successful , but it makes his work seem dated . ”
As space travel has moved from its Cold War centrality to the margins , his work has dated further .
In short , Franklin said , the future does n’t look as he predicted it would .
Still , even detractors see his shadow .
“ The idea of combining a space opera about the military with a soap opera about sex is a pretty cool thing , ” said Newitz .
“ Film directors are still wrapping their heads around that .
“ Maybe there will be a Heinlein renaissance , ” she offered .
“ But I sure hope not . ”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) and other members of his panel have pressed Democratic leaders to hold the contempt vote .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Top Dems stall Miers , Bolten contempt vote
House Democrats will postpone votes on criminal contempt citations against White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , while congressional leaders work with President Bush on a bipartisan stimulus package to fend off an economic downturn , according to party leaders and leadership aides .
Senior Democrats have decided that holding a controversial vote on the contempt citations , which have already been approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of its investigation into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys , would “ step on their message ” of bipartisan unity in the midst of the stimulus package talks .

Bush , citing executive privilege , has refused to allow Bolten or Miers to testify before the House Judiciary panel about the prosecutor purge .
And former deputy White House chief of staff Karl Rove was barred by the administration from appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the same issue .
“ Right now , we ’re focused on working in a bipartisan fashion on [ the ] stimulus , ” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , indicating that the contempt vote is not expected for weeks , depending on how quickly the stimulus package moves .
Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , said “ no decision has been made ” as to when a criminal contempt vote would be held by the House .
The Judiciary Committee approved contempt citations against Bolten and Miers on July 25 , but Pelosi has yet to bring the measures to the floor .
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved similar contempt citations against Bolten and Rove shortly before Congress adjourned in December .
The White House has declined to turn over internal documents sought by House and Senate Democrats looking into the U.S. attorney firings .
And White House counsel Fred Fielding has offered only very limited circumstances under which current and former top White House aides can be interviewed about the firings .
Miers , a lawyer now back in private practice in Dallas , cited a White House claim of executive privilege and declined to appear at a July 12 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee .
White House aides have dismissed the prospect of a contempt battle with the Democratic - controlled Congress as a distraction from more pressing work , such as dealing with the war in Iraq and the nation ’s sagging economy .
The Justice Department also threatened to prevent Jeffrey Taylor , the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , who would represent the Congress in a legal battle with the White House , from going to court to enforce the subpoenas .
And Gonzales ’ successor , Michael Mukasey , declined during his confirmation hearing to say definitively how he would handle the issue .
Pelosi , who personally supports the contempt citations , has gotten mixed messages from her own leaders , as well as rank - and - file members , on whether to move ahead , although it is clear that there are not now enough votes for the citations to be approved by the House , according to Democratic insiders .
“ When we have the votes , we ’ll go ahead with this .
Right now , the votes are just not there , ” said one top House Democratic insider , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) and other members of his panel have pressed Democratic leaders to hold the contempt vote , arguing that a failure to move would set a dangerous precedent that could weaken the Congress in any future investigations of the White House .
Conyers ’ staff declined to comment Tuesday .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has not received any word from Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) when a floor vote on contempt citations might occur .
“ Sen . Reid is consulting with Sen. [ Patrick ] Leahy [ D - Vt. ] and others when to hold a vote , ” said Reid ’s spokesman , Jim Manley .
This story was updated on Jan. 24 to clarify that the Justice Department , not former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , threatened to prevent Jeffrey Taylor , the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , from going to court to enforce the subpoenas .
The Bloggerati response to Judge Taylor 's ruling in the NSA Case
Guest Blogger
Laurence Tribe
[ This posting was based on an e-mail addressed to Adam Liptak at the New York Times ]
Dear Adam ,
Good story on this morning 's front page about Judge Taylor 's unusually casual and surprisingly breezy way of dispatching the Bush administration 's legal defense of its NSA warrantless surveillance program , .
However , I have a reaction that may not be exactly what the " doctor " ordered -- or what you might have anticipated -- that I wanted to share with you and with some of those you quoted , as well as with a couple of other friends and that you should feel free to use as you wish .
It 's altogether too easy to make disparaging remarks about the quality of the Taylor opinion , which seems almost to have been written more to poke a finger in the President 's eye than to please the legal commentariat or even , alas , to impress an appellate panel , although I certainly agree with the many who predict that , while her reasoning is bound not to be embraced , her bottom line is very likely to survive appellate review .
Had I been in her place , I never would have reached the difficult First and Fourth Amendment issues that she disposed of so summarily when a powerful , and indeed all but impregnable , statutory path to decision at least appeared to be available under the FISA .
I also would have been less ready to find standing on the part of the complainants without much more meticulous analysis than Judge Taylor undertook ; I would obviously have grappled with the " special needs " exception if I had reached the Fourth Amendment claim ; and I can't imagine not addressing the 2002 decision by the FSIA Court of Review .
But as legal academics many of us -- and I do n't exclude myself from this observation -- sometimes miss the forest for the trees and act as though making an argument water - tight is more important than steering the legal boat in the right direction , much less reaching the correct shore .
When a presidential program that would n't have been exposed at all but for leaks that the administration is trying not just to plug but to prosecute is manifestly lawless in the most fundamental respects ; when that program challenges constitutional as well as statutory constraints on executive authority ; when it is promulgated by an executive branch in the hands of characters who care little about the rule of law , much less about legal nuance ; and when the lawmakers who are posturing as the program 's critics have in fact engineered a statutory " fix " that amounts to little more than a whitewash in the offing -- when all these things are true , it 's not costless to harp on the details of a basically correct legal denunciation of that program to the point of ridiculing the motives and capacities of the judge delivering the blow .
Taking that tack is likely to play into the hands of the administration that was caught red-handed .
My point is n't that judges who play the role Judge Taylor did should never be held to account for the shoddy quality of their legal analysis ; of course they should , especially in the context of sober second thoughts offered in law reviews and other scholarly venues .
But
It 's those with constitutional blood on their hands who deserve to be chastized most insistently in the public press , and it seems to me something of an indulgence to spend so much time complaining in the media that the judge who called foul used some ill - chosen rhetoric , and that she stuttered and sputtered a bit more than necessary , when the principal effects might well be to underscore one 's own professional credentials and one 's cleverness and even - handedness and fair - mindedness at the expense of distracting the general public from the far more important conclusion that the nation 's chief executive has been guilty of a shamelessly unlawful power grab .
Even at the level of legal analysis , it 's a bit much to treat Judge Taylor as though she idiotically and gratuitously injected the Constitution into her argument when all she needed to do was rely on the FISA .
Even the FISA , after all , is subject to constitutional restictions to the degree that a particular presidential maneuver that it purports to forbid is arguably immune under Article II from the particular exercise of Article I power on which the FISA prohibition rests .
And although Judge Taylor 's opinion does n't do a good job of explaining just why the administration was wrong in arguing that FISA would be unconstitutional to the degree it has the effect claimed by the critics of the NSA program , it remains the case that no explanation of that conclusion would be possible without undertaking a constitutional rather than entirely statutory dissection of the relevant materials .
Moreover , it seems to me misguided to say that Judge Taylor 's reliance on the chilling effects of the government 's eavesdropping program represents poor legal argument simply because it is n't deeply rooted in settled precedent or entails what Jack Balkin described as a " rather innovative " line of argument .
Before many of us grew accustomed to the Rehnquist Court 's unfortunately dismissive reaction to " chilling effect " arguments of the sort that were routine in Justice Brennan 's day and that came to seem adventuresome only in an era that could take decisions like Laird v. Tatum more or less for granted , the argument that struck Judge Taylor as compelling would have been regarded as altogether routine .
Finally , it 's something of a cheap shot to chide Judge Taylor for her failure to exploit Justice Stevens ' more than mild hint , in his Hamdan v. Rumsfeld opinion , that the administration 's reading of the AUMF was too sweeping by a country mile .
Of course Hamdan offered a major crutch that Judge Taylor failed to grab .
But , by all accounts , she is no fool .
My immediate assumption -- an assumption that explains why I praised her opinion and not just her result in my remarks to Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe the other day -- was that Judge Taylor was being rather clever in her seemingly deliberate and rather daring decision to reject the administration 's far - fetched construction of the AUMF without relying on the Supreme Court 's June 2006 pronouncement on the subject .
Although my good friend Cass Sunstein , whom I admire in more ways than I can count , seems to remain of the view that the administration 's invocation of the AUMF was at least a plausible way around the prohibitive effect of the FISA prior to the rejection of that reading in Hamdan , I was among those -- including some of those whom you quote as critical of the Taylor opinion -- who had no doubt whatsoever , long before Hamdan was handed down a couple of months ago , that the administration was reading the AUMF for vastly more than it could conceivably have been worth and , in the bargain , was twisting Justice O'Connor 's words and the Court 's conclusions from Hamdi v. Rumsfeld in treating that earlier decision 's analysis of the AUMF as support for the far - reaching use the administration sought to make of it .
I took the view , in talking with the Boston Globe , that the principal effect of Judge Taylor 's admittedly risky decision to go after the government 's reading of the AUMF without relying on Hamdan was to make the point , none too subtly , that the administration had been not just skating on thin legal ice all along but had been skating well below the surface of the water , and that it did n't take any hint from Justice Stevens this June to establish the point .
That 's a matter of more than academic interest , for it bears on the bedrock question whether the President and his advisors were merely failing to anticipate an invariably controversial recent ruling of a closely divided Supreme Court or were instead , as I believe , betraying a contemptuous disregard for law and a willingness to grasp at legal straws in order to mask a naked assertion of boundless power .
DailyKos , Rep. Wexler — Dear Friends ,
We have been following the diaries on Daily Kos and elsewhere with great interest and excitement , as it has been the Netroots that has truly given weight to our call for Impeachment Hearings .
Without you , I believe we would have been completely ignored by the mainstream press .
Thanks to your calls and letters to publications , we have started to break through the mainstream press , and the pace of signatures has climbed back up .
I have been encouraging those that have already signed to continue to contact their representatives in Congress and encourage them to support our effort .
There is no doubt in my mind that whether I go back with 200,000 or 250,000 – the message will be clear to my colleagues : there is massive support for hearings , and there will be increased anger and disillusionment if we do n’t address these abuses of power soon .
I think it ’s important to point out that while there may not currently be 218 votes in support of actual impeachment , it ’s premature to think that support would not be there AFTER hearings .
* Wexler For Congress Campaign 's diary :: ::
*
The whole purpose of hearings is to investigate and verify credible allegations of wrongdoing .
Let us remember that it was n’t until after hearings began that the Watergate tapes emerged .
Who knows what will be uncovered when we explore the evidence already on the table ?
Who knows what support will emerge when the truth comes out ?
This administration has obstructed our agenda since we took the majority .
There is little reason to think that if we avoid hearings , we will suddenly find ourselves in an easier position .
In fact , there is good cause to believe the opposite – that if we avoid hearings , we will STILL be obstructed .
Such an outcome would be tragic .
Lastly , there are those that suggest that there is too little time to conduct hearings .
This is a dangerous idea , as it signals to future presidents that after the third year of their term , they ’re effectively immune from serious inquiry .
No President or Vice President should have such immunity .
The Constitution does not include a statute of limitations .
I hope this diary will help you as you make your arguments to Congress and to the media .
If you have n’t already signed up , please go to www.WexlerWantsHearings.com.
Happy New Year to you all .
With warm regards ,
Congressman Robert Wexler

The Nina Ricci show in 1'st of march was the best , silky pants , velvet frocks , vintage - inspired beaded embellishment and long train accents .
The show inspire a very romantic mood despite a few sharp - shouldered jackets that appeared on the scene .
Here si a " trend alert " : matchy match is back .
Think same colour frock and footwear .
If you are a fashion victim here are " must haves " : short gloves with brooch accent and silk pleated harem pants witch you can see at Haine Lux or Adidasi Puma .
The hair and makeup message had an ethereal / Victorian tingle with crimped sections of loosely styled locks , overall everything was fabulous .
For many in the dotcom world , 2007 was dominated by one story : the rise of Facebook .
The success of the social networking service has increased optimism about the internet industry .
After all , if Microsoft is prepared to buy a 1.6 % share for $ 240 m ( £ 121 m ) , there is evidence that good ideas can be worth a lot of money .
It is no surprise then that investors are looking for the next big thing - and these are some of the favourites .
The New York - based internet retailer says it is " your place to buy and sell all things handmade " .
Where Amazon revolutionised online commerce and eBay made its name allowing people to sell off their unwanted possessions , Etsy hopes to tap into the trend for hand - crafted and personalised items .
With thousands of craftspeople selling everything from clothes and ceramics to jewellery , the site has quickly become an Aladdin 's Cave of the internet .
Its innovative sales approach - such as letting shoppers browse by colour , or allowing geographical searches to support local suppliers - has drawn a legion of followers .
Etsy now has more than half a million registered users and 60,000 sellers .
Founded by 27 - year - old Robert Kalin from Boston , the site was launched in 2005 and now has more than 40 staff in New York and San Francisco .
Some critics find it a contradiction - a mass market dedicated to niche products - but Kalin says : " Etsy is a distribution platform for any kind of content that is n't mass produced ... not just craft - based , it might include music . "
Twitter lets you text message large groups of people simultaneously , and for free .
Sign up and send it a message - from a phone , internet or instant messaging service - and it will be sent to your contacts .
Updates are limited to just 140 characters , leading Twitter 's creators to call it " microblogging " .
The craze caught on with the technology cognoscenti in 2007 , but many pundits expect it to now reach out to the mainstream .
Some say it is a simple way of keeping a connection with friends and family , regardless of time and distance .
" Twitter is about the intimacy of details , " said author David Weinberger .
" Through it I see small events in the lives of friends about whom I otherwise might only learn the big events when we catch up after long intervals . "
Crucially , it has also been picked up by businesses as an easy way to push messages out to their customers .
Co-founder Ev Williams helped popularise blogging with Blogger.com before selling it to Google in 2002 .
With Facebook so prominent in 2007 , many copycat services are expected in the next few months .
But Dopplr.com is trying to find a different angle .
Aimed at frequent travellers , the site lets users keep track of where their friends and colleagues are and enables them to meet up in unexpected places - or keep tabs on who is visiting their home town in the next few days .
The site had a public launch this month .
During the test phase the audience was limited to international jet - setters and conference veterans , but thanks to a series of canny features - including integration into Facebook - it is ready to break out and gather many more users .
The site , founded by an international team of web technologists , is run from an office in Hoxton , in east London .
This year two of its masterminds , Matt Biddulph and Matt Jones , were named among the capital 's most influential people .
Jimmy Wales , co-founder of Wikipedia , has said it is his favourite website .
" You put in your travel schedule and link to your friends .
It allows you to see where everyone is .
I love it , " he told the New York Times .
Mike Butcher , the editor of startup news website Techcrunch UK , said Moshi Monsters is " Tamagotchi meets Facebook for 7 - 12 year olds , but with education thrown in " .
Created by London games firm Mind Candy , Moshi Monsters takes the idea of virtual pet games such as Nintendogs , and adds the concepts of social networking and puzzles .
Players " adopt " a monster by buying a small charm which gives them an access code to the website .
They then pick their monster , and look after them by solving regular puzzles .
Monsters can interact with each other online , providing a socialising aspect for children with strict systems in place to keep players safe .
With its cartoon graphics and addictive qualities , Moshi wants to become the next craze for UK children - and has plans to launch in Europe and the US .
The site is going through testing but the so - called " tween " market can be incredibly lucrative .
Club Penguin , a children 's virtual world started two years ago , was bought by Disney this year for $ 350m .
Since Google bought YouTube two years ago , a slew of video sites have arrived on the web .
One to watch could be Seesmic .
While YouTube has become dominated by spoofs , skits and professional marketing videos , Seesmic hopes to recapture the spirit of those who first made the site a success : people who want to put video diaries on the internet .
Focused on short webcam " conversations " between individuals , the site has not gone public yet , but has had positive reviews from testers and could become the home for a generation of opinionated , attention - seeking web surfers .
It is backed by Ron Conway , an early investor in Google and PayPal , and European entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , responsible for Kazaa , Skype and internet TV company Joost .
When it does go public , the site hopes to plug into other hugely popular websites - such as MySpace and Facebook - rather than replace them .
It was founded by a French entrepreneur , Loic Le Meur .
The businessman and blogger is known for his brash style , but it is his role as an internet adviser to the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , that could lend most weight to the site .

NEW YORK / LOS ANGELES , Jan 4 ( Reuters ) - Time Warner Inc's TWX.N Warner Bros studio on Friday said it would exclusively release high - definition DVDs in Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T Blu-ray format , dealing a big blow to Toshiba Corp 's 6502 .
T rival HD DVD technology .
Warner Bros , Hollywood ’s biggest seller of DVDs , representing about 18 to 20 percent of sales in the United States , was one of the few studios that backed both formats .
All sides of the format war had agreed it was confusing to consumers and a stumbling block for a potential multibillion - dollar industry .
Total DVD unit sales fell 4.5 percent in 2007 , the first major year - over - year decline since the disc format debuted in 1997 , according to Adams Media Research .
Sales fell 4.8 percent to $ 15.7 billion .
“ The window of opportunity for high - definition DVD could be missed if format confusion continues to linger .
We believe that exclusively distributing in Blu-ray will further the potential for mass market success and ultimately benefit retailers , producers , and most importantly , consumers , ” Warner Bros Chairman and Chief Executive Barry Meyer said in a statement .
News Corp's NWSa .N 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney Co DIS.N , and Lionsgate LGF.N are among studios backing the Blu-ray format .
Viacom Inc's VIAb .N Paramount studios and General Electric 's GE.N NBC Universal release movies in HD DVD format .
Warner said it would continue releasing in the HD DVD format until the end of May , although those releases would follow the standard DVD and Blu-ray releases .

A View from Huygens - Jan. 14 , 2005 - Movie
This movie was built with data collected during the 147 - minute plunge through Titan 's thick orange - brown atmosphere to a soft sandy riverbed by the European Space Agency ’s Huygens Descent Imager / Spectral Radiometer on Jan. 14 , 2005 , In 4 minutes and 40 seconds , the movie shows what the probe “ saw ” within the few hours of the descent and the landing .
On approach , Titan appeared as just a little disk in the sky among the stars , but after landing , the probe 's camera resolved little grains of sand millions of times smaller than Titan .
At first , the Huygens camera just saw fog over the distant surface .
The fog started to clear only at about 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) altitude , making it possible to resolve surface features as large as 100 meters ( 328 feet ) .
Only after landing could the probe 's camera resolve the little grains of sand .
The movie provides a glimpse of such a huge change of scale .
A music - only version of the video is available at : http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08118
The Huygens probe was delivered to Saturn 's moon Titan by the Cassini spacecraft , which is managed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
NASA supplied two instruments on the probe , the descent imager / spectral radiometer and the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C.
The descent imager / spectral radiometer team is based at the University of Arizona , Tucson .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Roundworms may infect close to a quarter of inner city black children , tapeworms are the leading cause of seizures among U.S. Hispanics and other parasitic diseases associated with poor countries are also affecting Americans , a U.S. expert said on Tuesday .
Recent studies show many of the poorest Americans living in the United States carry some of the same parasitic infections that affect the poor in Africa , Asia , and Latin America , said Dr. Peter Hotez , a tropical disease expert at George Washington University and editor - in - chief of the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases .
Writing in the journal , Hotez said these parasitic infections had been ignored by most health experts in the United States .
“ I feel strongly that this is such an important health issue and yet because it only affects the poor it has been ignored , ” Hotez said via e-mail .
He said the United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars to defend against bio-terrorism threats like anthrax or smallpox or avian flu , which were more a theoretical concern than a real threat at present .
“ And yet we have a devastating parasitic disease burden among the American poor , right under our nose , ” Hotez said .
He noted a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , presented in November , found that almost 14 percent of the U.S. population is infected with Toxocara roundworms , which dogs and cats can pass to people .
“ Urban playgrounds in the United States have recently been shown to be a particularly rich source of Toxocara eggs and inner-city children are at high risk of acquiring the infection , ” Hotez wrote , adding that this might be partly behind the rise in asthma cases in the country .
Up to 23 percent of urban black children may be infected , he said .
“ Because of its possible links to asthma , it would be important to determine whether covert toxocariasis is a basis for the rise of asthma among inner-city children in the northeastern United States , ” he added .
“ Cysticercosis is another very serious parasitic worm infection ... caused by the tapeworm Taenia solium , that results in seizures and other neurological manifestations , ” Hotez wrote .
He said up to 2,000 new cases of neurological disease caused by tapeworms are diagnosed every year in the United States .
More than 2 percent of adult Latinos may be infected , and with 35 million Hispanics in the United States , this could add up to tens of thousands of cases , Hotez said .
“ In the hospitals of Los Angeles , California , neurocysticercosis currently accounts for 10 percent of all seizures presenting to some emergency departments , ” he wrote .
" We need to begin erasing these horrific health disparities , " Hotez wrote in the paper , available onlinehere .
The Songwriters Association of Canada has released an important new proposal calling for the legalization of peer - to - peer file sharing .
The SAC has proposed the creation of a new right – the Right to Equitable Remuneration for Music File Sharing .
The new right would make it legal to share music on peer - to - peer networks .
In return , the SAC is proposing a license fee of $ 5.00 per Internet subscription per month .
The songwriters argue that this approach would legalize peer - to - peer file sharing ( both uploading and downloading ) , while generating significant new revenue for creators and the music industry .
Distributions of the revenue generated through this new fee would be allocated by sampling file sharing activities .
The SAC addresses digital rights management and the legal protection for digital locks , noting that it is not opposed to legal protection ( as distinguished from the Canadian Music Creators Coalition ) but that it believes its proposal renders DRM " obsolete . "
Moreover , " given the consumer aversion to TPMs , we believe their use will inhibit the success of recordings in which they are embedded , and that they will simply fall out of use . "
While the SAC could have taken a stronger stand against DRM , this proposal should ( though likely wo n't ) cause the government to rethink its decision to import the DMCA into Canada .
Even if you disagree with portions of this proposal , it is great to see Canadian songwriters , musicians , and music labels now singing the same song , promoting ways to make money from P2P rather than engage in failed attempt to stop it .
Rudolph W. Giuliani likens himself to a boxer who never takes a punch without swinging back .
As mayor , he made the vengeful roundhouse an instrument of government , clipping anyone who crossed him .
In August 1997 , James Schillaci , a rough - hewn chauffeur from the Bronx , dialed Mayor Giuliani ’s radio program on WABC - AM to complain about a red - light sting run by the police near the Bronx Zoo .
When the call yielded no results , Mr. Schillaci turned to The Daily News , which then ran a photo of the red light and this front page headline : “ GOTCHA ! ”
That morning , police officers appeared on Mr. Schillaci ’s doorstep .
What are you going to do , Mr. Schillaci asked , arrest me ?
He was joking , but the officers were not .
They slapped on handcuffs and took him to court on a 13 - year - old traffic warrant .
A judge threw out the charge .
A police spokeswoman later read Mr. Schillaci ’s decades - old criminal rap sheet to a reporter for The Daily News , a move of questionable legality because the state restricts how such information is released .
She said , falsely , that he had been convicted of sodomy .

The vaccine is designed to protect against all flu strains
The vaccine , made by Acambis , should protect against all strains of influenza A - the cause of pandemics .
Currently , winter flu jabs have to be regularly redesigned because the flu virus keeps changing .
The new vaccine would overcome this and could be stockpiled in advance of a bird flu outbreak , say experts .
Promising results
Each year winter flu kills around 4,000 people in the UK .
Globally , between 500,000 and one million people die each year from influenza .
But a pandemic of the human form of bird flu , which experts believe is inevitable , could kill as many as 50 m people worldwide .
The US trials show that the jab is safe and it works fast to make the body immune against flu .
It could be stockpiled in advance of a pandemic
Dr Michael Watson of Acambis
Nine out of 10 of those who had two doses of the jab ACAM - FLU - A developed antibodies against flu virus .
Scientists at Acambis are now working alongside Professor Walter Fiers and his team from the University of Ghent in Belgium and the Flemish Institute of Biotechnology to perfect the formulation before doing larger human trials .
Dr Michael Watson of Acambis said : " As a universal vaccine , ACAM - FLU - A can potentially overcome many of the drawbacks of existing influenza vaccines .
" It can be manufactured at any time of the year , and could be stockpiled in advance of a pandemic or potentially used routinely to ensure population protection against future pandemics . "
Unique action
Current flu vaccines work by giving immunity to two proteins called haemagglutinin and neuraminidase , which are found on the surface of flu viruses .
However , these proteins keep mutating which means doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up .
The Acambis vaccine homes in on a different protein , called M2 , which is found on the surface of all A - strains of flu and does not appear to mutate so readily .
Professor Ian Jones , a University of Reading virologist , said the jab could end the scramble to produce a new winter jab each year .
But he said it would still be some years before it was widely available for patients .
" Larger trials and tests on a wider range of viruses will be needed before the full potential for pandemic protection can be assured , " he said .
Welcome to a Scientific American experiment in " networked journalism , " in which readers — you — get to collaborate with the author to give a story its final form .
The article , below , is a particularly apt candidate for such an experiment : it 's my feature story on " Science 2.0 , " which describes how researchers are beginning to harness wikis , blogs and other Web 2.0 technologies as a potentially transformative way of doing science .
The draft article appears here , several months in advance of its print publication , and we are inviting you to comment on it .
Your inputs will influence the article ’s content , reporting , perhaps even its point of view .
So consider yourself invited .
Please share your thoughts about the promise and peril of Science 2.0 . — just post your inputs in the Comment section below .
To help get you started , here are some questions to mull over :
What do you think of the article itself ?
Are there errors ?
Oversimplifications ?
Gaps ?
What do you think of the notion of " Science 2.0 ? "
Will Web 2.0 tools really make science much more productive ?
Will wikis , blogs and the like be transformative , or will they be just a minor convenience ?
Science 2.0 is one aspect of a broader Open Science movement , which also includes Open - Access scientific publishing and Open Data practices .
How do you think this bigger movement will evolve ?
Looking at your own scientific field , how real is the suspicion and mistrust mentioned in the article ?
How much do you and your colleagues worry about getting “ scooped ” ?
Do you have first - hand knowledge of a case in which that has actually happened ?
When young scientists speak out on an open blog or wiki , do they risk hurting their careers ?
Is " open notebook " science always a good idea ?
Are there certain aspects of a project that researchers should keep quite , at least until the paper is published ?
-- M. Mitchell Waldrop
The published version of this piece can be found here .
The explosively growing World Wide Web has rapidly transformed retailing , publishing , personal communication and much more .
Innovations such as e-commerce , blogging , downloading and open - source software have forced old - line institutions to adopt whole new ways of thinking , working and doing business .
Science could be next .
A small but growing number of researchers -- and not just the younger ones -- have begun to carry out their work via the wide - open blogs , wikis and social networks of Web 2.0 .
And although their efforts are still too scattered to be called a movement -- yet -- their experiences to date suggest that this kind of Web - based " Science 2.0 " is not only more collegial than the traditional variety , but considerably more productive .
" Science happens not just because of people doing experiments , but because they 're discussing those experiments , " explains Christopher Surridge , editor of the Web - based journal , Public Library of Science On - Line Edition ( PLoS ONE ) .
Critiquing , suggesting , sharing ideas and data -- communication is the heart of science , the most powerful tool ever invented for correcting mistakes , building on colleagues ' work and creating new knowledge .
And not just communication in peer - reviewed papers ; as important as those papers are , says Surridge , who publishes a lot of them , " they 're effectively just snapshots of what the authors have done and thought at this moment in time .
They are not collaborative beyond that , except for rudimentary mechanisms such as citations and letters to the editor . "
The technologies of Web 2.0 open up a much richer dialog , says Bill Hooker , a postdoctoral cancer researcher at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland , Ore. , and the author of a three - part survey of open - science efforts in the group blog , 3 Quarks Daily .
" To me , opening up my lab notebook means giving people a window into what I 'm doing every day .
That 's an immense leap forward in clarity .
In a paper , I can see what you 've done .
But I do n't know how many things you tried that did n’t work .
It 's those little details that become clear with open notebook , but are obscured by every other communication mechanism we have .
It makes science more efficient . "
That jump in efficiency , in turn , could have huge payoffs for society , in everything from faster drug development to greater national competitiveness .
Of course , many scientists remain highly skeptical of such openness -- especially in the hyper - competitive biomedical fields , where patents , promotion and tenure can hinge on being the first to publish a new discovery .
From that perspective , Science 2.0 seems dangerous : using blogs and social networks for your serious work feels like an open invitation to have your online lab notebooks vandalized -- or worse , have your best ideas stolen and published by a rival .
To Science 2.0 advocates , however , that atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust is an ally .
" When you do your work online , out in the open , ” Hooker says , “ you quickly find that you 're not competing with other scientists anymore , but cooperating with them . "
Rousing Success
In principle , says PLoS ONE 's Surridge , scientists should find the transition to Web 2.0 perfectly natural .
After all , since the time of Galileo and Newton , scientists have built up their knowledge about the world by " crowd - sourcing " the contributions of many researchers and then refining that knowledge through open debate .
" Web 2.0 fits so perfectly with the way science works , it 's not whether the transition will happen but how fast , " he says .
The OpenWetWare project at MIT is an early success .
Launched in the spring of 2005 by graduate students working for MIT biological engineers Drew Endy and Thomas Knight , who collaborate on synthetic biology , the project was originally seen as just a better way to keep the two labs '
Web sites up to date .
OpenWetWare is a wiki -- a collaborative
Web site that can be edited by anyone who has access to it ; it even uses the same software that underlies the online encyclopedia Wikipedia .
Students happily started posting pages introducing themselves and their research , without having to wait for a Webmaster to do it for them .
But then , users discovered that the wiki was also a convenient place to post what they were learning about lab techniques : manipulating and analyzing DNA , getting cell cultures to grow .
“ A lot of the ' how - to ' gets passed around as lore in biology labs , and never makes it into the protocol manuals , " says Jason Kelly , a graduate student of Endy 's who now sits on the OpenWetWare steering committee .
" But we did n't have that . "
Most of the students came from a background in engineering ; theirs was a young lab with almost no mentors .
So whenever a student or postdoc managed to stumble through a new protocol , he or she would write it all down on a wiki page before the lessons were forgotten .
Others would then add whatever new tricks they had learned .
This was not altruism , notes steering - committee member Reshma Shetty .
" The information was actually useful to me . "
But by helping herself , she adds , " that information also became available around the world . "
Indeed , Kelly points out , " Most of our new users came to us because they 'd been searching Google for information on a protocol , found it posted on our site , and said ' Hey ! '
As more and more labs got on , it became pretty apparent that there were lots of other interesting things they could do . "
Classes , for example .
Instead of making do with a static
Web page posted by a professor , users began to create dynamically evolving class sites where they could post lab results , ask questions , discuss the answers and even write collaborative essays .
" And all stayed on the site , where it made the class better for next year , " says Shetty , who has created an OpenWetWare template for creating such class sites .
Laboratory management benefited too .
" I did n't even know what a wiki was , " recalls Maureen Hoatlin of the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland , where she runs a lab studying the genetic disorder Fanconi anemia .
But she did know that the frenetic pace of research in her field was making it harder to keep up with what her own team members were doing , much less Fanconi researchers elsewhere .
" I was looking for a tool that would help me organize all that information , " Hoatlin says .
" I wanted it to be Web - based , because I travel a lot and needed to access it from wherever I was .
And I wanted something my collaborators and group members could add to dynamically , so that whatever I saw on that Web page would be the most recently updated version . "
OpenWetWare , which Hoatlin saw in the spring of 2006 , fit the bill perfectly .
" The transparency turned out to be very powerful , " she says .
" I came to love the interaction , the fact that people in other labs could comment on what we do and vice versa .
When I see how fast that is , and its power to move science forward -- there is nothing like it . "
Numerous others now work through OpenWetWare to coordinate research .
SyntheticBiology.org , one of the site 's most active interest groups , currently comprises six laboratories in three states , and includes postings about jobs , meetings , discussions of ethics , and much more .
In short , OpenWetWare has quickly grown into a social network catering to a wide cross-section of biologists and biological engineers .
It currently encompasses laboratories on five continents , dozens of courses and interest groups , and hundreds of protocol discussions -- more than 6100 Web pages edited by 3,000 registered users .
A May 2007 grant from the National Science Foundation launched the OpenWetWare team on a five - year effort to transform OpenWetWare to a self - sustaining community independent of its current base at MIT .
The grant will also support development of many new practical tools , such as ways to interface biological databases with the wiki , as well as creation of a generic version of OpenWetWare that can be used by other research communities such as neuroscience , as well as by individual investigators .
Skepticism Persists
For all the participants ' enthusiasm , however , this wide - open approach to science still faces intense skepticism .
Even Hoatlin found the openness unnerving at first .
" Now I 'm converted to open wikis for everything possible , " she says .
" But when I originally joined I wanted to keep everything private " -- not least to keep her lab pages from getting trashed by some random hacker .
She did not relax until she began to understand the system 's built - in safeguards .
First and foremost , says MIT 's Kelly , " you ca n't hide behind anonymity . "
By default , OpenWetWare pages are visible to anyone ( although researchers have the option to make pages private . )
But unlike the oft - defaced Wikipedia , the system will let users make changes only after they have registered and established that they belong to a legitimate research organization .
" We 've never yet had a case of vandalism , " Kelly says .
Even if they did , the wiki automatically maintains a copy of every version of every page posted : " You could always just roll back the damage with a click of your mouse . "
Unfortunately , this kind of technical safeguard does little to address a second concern : Getting scooped and losing the credit .
" That 's the first argument people bring to the table , " says Drexel University chemist Jean - Claude Bradley , who created his independent laboratory wiki , UsefulChem , in December 2005 .
Even if incidents are rare in reality , Bradley says , everyone has heard a story , which is enough to keep most scientists from even discussing their unpublished work too freely , much less posting it on the Internet .
However , the Web provides better protection that the traditional journal system , Bradley maintains .
Every change on a wiki gets a time - stamp , he notes , “ so if someone actually did try to scoop you , it would be very easy to prove your priority -- and to embarrass them .
I think that 's really what is going to drive open science : the fear factor .
If you wait for the journals , your work wo n't appear for another six to nine months .
But with open science , your claim to priority is out there right away . "
Under Bradley 's radically transparent " open notebook " approach , as he calls it , everything goes online : experimental protocols , successful outcomes , failed attempts , even discussions of papers being prepared for publication .
" A simple wiki makes an almost perfect lab notebook , " he declares .
The time - stamps on every entry not only establish priority , but allow anyone to track the contributions of every person , even in a large collaboration .
Bradley concedes that there are sometimes legitimate reasons for researchers to think twice about being so open .
If work involves patients or other human subjects , for example , privacy is obviously a concern .
And if you think your work might lead to a patent , it is still not clear that the patent office will accept a wiki posting as proof of your priority .
Until that is sorted out , he says , " the typical legal advice is : do not disclose your ideas before you file . "
Still , Bradley says the more open scientists are , the better .
When he started UsefulChem , for example , his lab was investigating the synthesis of drugs to fight diseases such as malaria .
But because search engines could index what his team was doing without needing a bunch of passwords , " we suddenly found people discovering us on Google and wanting to work together .
The National Cancer Institute contacted me wanting to test our compounds as anti-tumor agents .
Rajarshi Guha at Indiana University offered to help us do calculations about docking -- figuring out which molecules will be reactive .
And there were others .
So now we 're not just one lab doing research , but a network of labs collaborating . "
Blogophobia
Although wikis are gaining , scientists have been strikingly slow to embrace one of the most popular Web 2.0 applications :
Web logging , or blogging .
" It 's so antithetical to the way scientists are trained , " Duke University geneticist Huntington F. Willard said at the April 2007 North Carolina Science Blogging Conference , one of the first national gatherings devoted to this topic .
The whole point of blogging is spontaneity -- getting your ideas out there quickly , even at the risk of being wrong or incomplete .
" But to a scientist , that 's a tough jump to make , " says Willard , head of Duke 's Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy .
" When we publish things , by and large , we 've gone through a very long process of drafting a paper and getting it peer reviewed .
Every word is carefully chosen , because it 's going to stay there for all time .
No one wants to read , ' Contrary to the result of Willard and his colleagues … ’. "
Still , Willard favors blogging .
As a frequent author of newspaper op - ed pieces , he feels that scientists should make their voices heard in every responsible way possible .
Blogging is slowly beginning to catch on ; because most blogs allow outsiders to comment on the individual posts , they have proved to be a good medium for brainstorming and discussions of all kinds .
Bradley 's UsefulChem blog is an example .
Paul Bracher 's Chembark is another .
" Chembark has morphed into the water cooler of chemistry , " says Bracher , who is pursuing his Ph.D. in that field at Harvard University .
" The conversations are : What should the research agencies be funding ?
What is the proper way to manage a lab ?
What types of behavior do you admire in a boss ?
But instead of having five people around a single water cooler you have hundreds of people around the world . "
Of course , for many members of Bracher 's primary audience -- young scientists still struggling to get tenure -- those discussions can look like a minefield .
A fair number of the participants use pseudonyms , out of fear that a comment might offend some professor 's sensibilities , hurting a student ’s chances of getting a job later .
Other potential participants never get involved because they feel that time spent with the online community is time not spent on cranking out that next publication .
" The peer - reviewed paper is the cornerstone of jobs and promotion , " says PLoS ONE 's Surridge .
" Scientists do n't blog because they get no credit . "
The credit - assignment problem is one of the biggest barriers to the widespread adoption of blogging or any other aspect of Science 2.0 , agrees Timo Hannay , head of Web publishing at the Nature Publishing Group in London .
( That group 's parent company , Macmillan , also owns Scientific American . )
Once again , however , the technology itself may help .
" Nobody believes that a scientist 's only contribution is from the papers he or she publishes , " Hannay says .
" People understand that a good scientist also gives talks at conferences , shares ideas , takes a leadership role in the community .
It 's just that publications were always the one thing you could measure .
Now , however , as more of this informal communication goes on line , that will get easier to measure too . "
Collaboration the Payoff
The acceptance of any such measure would require a big change in the culture of academic science .
But for Science 2.0 advocates , the real significance of Web technologies is their potential to move researchers away from an obsessive focus on priority and publication , toward the kind of openness and community that were supposed to be the hallmark of science in the first place .
" I do n't see the disappearance of the formal research paper anytime soon , " Surridge says .
" But I do see the growth of lots more collaborative activity building up to publication . "
And afterwards as well : PLoS ONE not only allows users to annotate and comment on the papers it publishes online , but to rate the papers ' quality on a scale of 1 to 5 .
Meanwhile , Hannay has been taking the Nature group into the Web 2.0 world aggressively .
" Our real mission is n't to publish journals , but to facilitate scientific communication , " he says .
" We 've recognized that the Web can completely change the way that communication happens . "
Among the efforts are Nature Network , a social network designed for scientists ; Connotea , a social bookmarking site patterned on the popular site del.icio.us , but optimized for the management of research references ; and even an experiment in open peer review , with pre-publication manuscripts made available for public comment .
Indeed , says Bora Zivkovic , a circadian rhythm expert who writes at Blog Around the Clock , and who is the Online Community Manager for PLoS ONE , the various experiments in Science 2.0 are now proliferating so rapidly that it is almost impossible to keep track of them .
" It 's a Darwinian process , " he says .
" About 99 percent of these ideas are going to die .
But some will emerge and spread . "
" I would n't like to predict where all this is going to go , " Hooker adds .
" But I 'd be happy to bet that we 're going to like it when we get there . "
Democrats inside and outside the Clinton campaign on Sunday debated and in some cases bemoaned the degree to which former President Bill Clinton ’s criticism of Senator Barack Obama last week had inflicted lasting damage on his wife ’s presidential candidacy .
“ I think his harsh style hurt Senator Clinton  it polarized the campaign and polarized the electorate , and it also made it harder for Senator Clinton ’s positive message to break through , ” said Celinda Lake , a Democratic strategist and pollster who is not affiliated with any of the candidates .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign team , seeking to readjust after her lopsided defeat in South Carolina and amid a sense among many Democrats that Mr. Clinton had injected himself clumsily into the race , will try to shift the former president back into the sunnier , supportive - spouse role that he played before Mrs. Clinton ’s loss in the Iowa caucuses , Clinton advisers said .
But Democrats said it was not clear whether the effects of Mr. Clinton ’s high profile could be brushed away by having him modulate his campaign style .
They said Mr. Clinton had upset some of the central themes of Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , including her appeal to women and her assertions that her time in the White House during the 1990s amounted to vital experience rather than a link to a presidency defined as much by scandal and partisan divisions as by its successes on fronts like the economy .

Hamas reiterated Saturday that it would forcefully resist the deployment of a multi-national force in the Gaza Strip .
The group 's armed wing , the Izz a - Din al - Qassam Brigades , said in a statement that they would regard " any foreign force as an occupying force , and we will respond decisively . "
Hamas issued similar warnings when the proposal to deploy a multinational force was initially made after Hamas ' takeover of the Gaza Strip a few weeks ago .
" We will not receive them with roses , but with rockets and shells , " Hamas members vowed Saturday .
Hamas forces in Gaza ( Photo : AFP )
Senior Hamas officials stressed their intent to appeal to Arab nations with the demand that they too actively oppose such an initiative .
Referring to Arab entities in support of the move , and especially Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , a Hamas spokesperson said : " Only those helpless ones , who take orders from external elements , support the deployment of a multinational force ( in Gaza ) . "
" They are running and crying for the help of international forces to carry out their disgraceful plan .
And this is after the Palestinian people rejected the plan and threw its representatives into the dumpster of history , " Hamas representatives said .
Meanwhile , Abbas met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris Friday to discuss the proposal .
Abbas also called for early general elections under the security supervision of foreign forces .
Exactly 40 years ago a British evacuation fleet was steaming away from the abandoned colony of Aden ending over 130 years of imperial control .
An insurgency had been crushed under the leadership of a British soldier nicknamed Mad Mitch .
As the last BBC Aden correspondent , Brian Barron reported on these seismic events - and has returned to take in the mood .
The best way I can describe the betrayal and melodrama that engulfed Britain 's last post in Arabia is to say that a Falklands moment it was not .
Among the half - dozen or so end - of - empire sagas that I have witnessed , this was the saddest , the most abject .
But at least it marked the final act - for Her Majesty 's forces and proconsuls - of a big mess in a very small place .
Each person is chewing a bunch of green leaves of Qat , a mild narcotic , which sedates millions across the nation every afternoon
Whoever chose Things Are n't What They Used to Be for the military band bidding farewell to the last governor - as I watched at the RAF [ Royal Air Force ] base in 1967 - evoked the right note of seediness and frayed national self - belief .
Once - and that word " once " encompasses well over a century of unchallenged British supremacy - Steamer Point was as famous as Piccadilly Circus .
Everyone came through heading east or west , from chroniclers of empire , like Kipling , to viceroys of India , to millions of migrants heading for white dominions at the bottom of the world .
Today Steamer Point looks unchanged from 1967 , but the crescent of curio shops and watch dealers stands shuttered and silent , beneath a massive Rolex sign , weathered and rusting , that once enticed liner passengers ashore .
Britain 's imperial stamp is everywhere , including Her Majesty 's moribund pillar boxes
The only outlet open from colonial days is Aziz 's bookshop .
Aziz himself has long gone to some trinket - filled stall in paradise , but his grandson sits on the pavement at the threshold , playing cards with three friends .
Each person is chewing a bunch of green leaves of Qat , a mild narcotic , which sedates millions across the nation every afternoon .
The Aziz emporium is a cornucopia of vinyl records still in their sleeves , Christmas cards from the 1940s , photo panoramas of Aden as the world 's third busiest port , and children 's books printed before World War II .
Tourism hit
" Today not many tourists , " says Aziz junior , gazing out at a port which has been undermined by al - Qaeda attacks on shipping .
Britain 's imperial stamp is everywhere , including Her Majesty 's moribund pillar boxes .
What was Flagstaff House , the British commander 's HQ overlooking the Gulf of Aden , is now the president 's palace , when he is visiting from united Yemen 's capital in the north .
Looking back we can see the magnitude of Britain 's strategic blunder here
Above Steamer Point stand the ruins of the Naval Semaphore Station , from the heyday of the Victorian empire .
It was destroyed by missiles in the 1986 civil war that finally doomed the revolutionary regime in power since Britain left .
But the failure for two decades to repair one of Aden 's most prominent , historic landmarks reveals the inertia today and the lack of entrepreneurial instincts .
Maybe that commercial spirit sailed away with the British - and whatever remained was destroyed by the revolutionary regime .
Mutiny
Colonial Aden expired under a state of emergency .
British civilians like me were given revolvers because of the risk of assassination .
The heart of the insurgency was Crater , an Arab town nestling in the hot embrace of an extinct volcano .
It was here that a mutiny by the British - trained Aden armed police in mid-1967 led to a massacre of British troops .
British troops reacted forcibly to demonstrations in 1967
As the British high command and London government hesitated , a controversial colonel named Colin Mitchell seized the initiative .
He re-occupied Crater with his Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders - earning the nickname Mad Mitch - and in Fleet Street 's judgment he restored British military honour .
A fearless soldier , he was born 100 years too late .
His mouth often ran ahead of him .
Once we stood together in Crater watching the Argylls stacking , as in a butcher 's shop , the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said : " It was like shooting grouse , a brace here and a brace there . "
Today Crater is calm .
Any Western veneer has gone .
Women are veiled .
Arab tea shops are thriving .
The bank building used as Mad Mitch 's headquarters , with his snipers on the roof , once again dispenses banknotes , not bullets .
Beside it , the old Anglican Church is no longer the secret police interrogation centre it became following the British retreat .
Battered and bruised
Looking back we can see the magnitude of Britain 's strategic blunder here .
The political , military and diplomatic establishment in the late 1950s and early 1960s misjudged the strength of Arab nationalism , completing a colossal military base despite local hostility .
There was an absence of reliable intelligence ( does n't that sound familiar ? ) .
As the insurgency turned deadlier , we withdrew - abandoning moderate allies .
Twenty - three years of police state thuggery followed , with the Soviet KGB replacing the British .
Even after Aden and the rest of the south merged with North Yemen , there was another civil war in the 1990s .
No wonder Aden today seems battered and bruised , and its people frustrated by the follies of their rulers : a forgotten place anchored to a forgotten time .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2007 December 28
Explanation :
This symmetric cloud dubbed the Boomerang Nebula was created by a high - speed wind of gas and dust blowing from an aging central star at speeds of nearly 600,000 kilometers per hour .
The rapid expansion has cooled molecules in the nebular gas to about one degree above absolute zero - colder than even the cosmic background radiation - making it the coldest known region in the distant Universe .
Shining with light from the central star reflected by dust , the frigid Boomerang Nebula is believed to be a star or stellar system evolving toward the planetary nebula phase .
This Hubble image was recorded using polarizing filters ( analogous to polaroid sunglasses ) and color coded by the angle associated with the polarized light .
The gorgeous result traces the small dust particles responsible for polarizing and scattering the light .
The Boomerang Nebula spans about one light year and lies about 5,000 light years away toward the constellation Centaurus .
The personal details of virtually every child in the UK has been lost by HM Revenue and Customs , the chancellor , Alistair Darling , admitted today .
The missing information includes the names , addresses and dates - of - birth of the children and the national insurance numbers , and in some cases the bank details , of parents claiming child benefits .
More than 25 million individuals are affected .
Paul Gray , the chairman of HM Revenue and Customs , today resigned over the " extremely serious failure " of security .
In a Commons statement greeted by gasps of astonishment from MPs , Darling said that two discs containing details of the 7.25 million families claiming child benefit , sent to the National Audit Office , failed to reach the addressee .
The chancellor told MPs the information went missing after a junior official in the department failed to follow standard procedures and sent a " full copy of the data " to the NAO by courier - not by recorded or registered mail .
When it became clear the discs had not arrived , the same official sent the information again - this time by registered post .
The first set of data was sent on October 18 , and senior management at HMRC was told it was missing on November 8 .
The chancellor said he found out 10 days ago .
" I deeply regret this and apologise for the anxiety caused , " Darling said .
But he insisted there was no suggestion the information had " reached the wrong hands " .
The Metropolitan police has confirmed it is investigating the loss of the discs .
Officers have searched a child benefit office in Washington , Tyne and Wear , sources said .
A spokesman for the force said : " We have got officers in the area assisting with inquiries in connection with the missing child benefit data . "
Earlier this month , BBC Radio 4's Money
Box programme reported that a CD containing the personal details of thousands of Standard Life pension holders had gone missing .
Nearly 15,000 customers were warned to be on high alert for potential scams after their data was lost in transit by an external courier .
It is understood Gray 's resignation was accepted because the discs had been transported in breach of rules governing data protection .
It is not yet clear how damaging the revelation will be for the chancellor but the move comes less than 24 hours after he had to face MPs over the Northern Rock crisis .
Downing Street said the prime minister had " full confidence " in Darling despite the benefits records blunder .
Gordon Brown 's spokeswoman added that Darling has not offered to resign .
Vincent Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman and acting leader , said earlier today : " Cumulatively , it is very damaging , taken together with other Treasury disasters such as the penalty system introduced for benefit overpayments .
" Obviously this predates Alistair Darling 's time in office , but if there is a wider political point it is that it shows Gordon Brown paid little interest to the complex tax systems he introduced . "
Chris Huhne , one of the two candidates for the Lib Dem leadership , said : " We will have to see exactly how much Alistair Darling knew and exactly how much has been covered up over what period of time .
" But frankly it is a very major problem of delivery of this kind in an absolutely key department and I think it 's going to be very hard for ministerial heads not to roll . "
Michael Fallon , a Conservative member of the House of Commons Treasury committee , said that he was " stunned " by Gray 's departure .
" Paul Gray is a very distinguished public servant who had served successive governments and we thought had a very good grip on the problems at Revenue & Customs , " he told BBC News 24 .
" HMRC was created by the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise at a time when the Treasury was demanding thousands of staff cuts , and has been under " immense pressure " , said Fallon .
He said that the affair raised new questions about Darling 's performance as chancellor .
" We were already beginning to wonder whether the chancellor was up to this .
Being chancellor of the exchequer is an enormous job and so far Mr Darling has not looked very sure - footed , " he said .
" He was slow to respond to the Northern Rock crisis and there have been persistent rumours that all was not well at Revenue & Customs .
" It may be that he has taken his eye off the ball with the organisation . "
MPs would want reassurance that Revenue & Customs - which is responsible for gathering in taxes , as well as ensuring people get the tax credits to which they are entitled - is " fit for purpose " , said Fallon .
" This is a major department of government and we need to be reassured pretty urgently that this department is fit for purpose , " he said .
Security experts said ministers should have taken immediate action to prevent ID theft and fraud .
Mike Greene of software security company PC Tools said : " If they knew that the disc had gone missing they should have told people immediately so that they could more closely monitor their bank accounts for signs of fraudulent activity .
" Once the information is out there , there is absolutely nothing that you can do to get it back .
" Heads need to roll if it turns out that the vital bank and personal details on the CD were not properly encrypted .
" There 's no excuse to be carrying around physical copies of this data in this day and age without encryption . "
Campaign group Action on Rights for Children ( Arch ) warned that children could have been put in danger .
" It 's a simple and vital precaution which any self - respecting government agency should be practicing , " its director , Terri Dowty , said .
" This appalling security lapse has placed children in the UK in immediate danger especially those who are already vulnerable .
" Child benefit records contain every child 's address and date of birth .
We are not surprised that the chair of HMRC 's board has resigned immediately . "
Arch accused the government of ignoring warnings over the dangers of creating " large centralised databases " of sensitive information about children .
Apparently the RIAA is so busy suing consumers that they forgot to hire a decent programmer .
With a simple SQL injection , all their propaganda has been successfully wiped from the site .
It started out on the social news website Reddit , where a link to a really slow SQL query was posted .
While the Reddit users were trying to kill the RIAA server , someone allegedly decided to up the ante and wipe the site ’s entire database .
The comments on Reddit are only speculation so far .
Based on the username , which was apparently “ webReadOnly ” , it might not have been setup correctly , or someone could have found another way to delete the content form the site .
Another possibility is that the website has some sort of database flood protection that disables new connections , or perhaps the RIAA themselves removed the content temporarily .
The latter seems unlikely , as a better solution would be to take it entirely offline to fix the bigger problem .
While they could fix a small vulnerability like this in a matter of seconds , the chances are it ’s not an isolated problem .
As pointed out by Haywire , playing around with the urls a bit can return some funny results .
It is pretty easy to make the RIAA link to The Pirate Bay for example .
For now it sure does look like all the content has been wiped from the RIAA homepage .
Let ’s hope they have backups , or not .
Update : After a few hours the RIAA restored the site .
They seem to have fixed the vulnerability , but we have saved some screenshots .
Update :
They did n’t fix it all , this still works .

Copenhagen ( TGW ) – A new material known as nano flakes could revolutionize the solar power industry .
The new nano flakes can convert twice as much solar energy as conventional solar cells .
" We believe that the nano flakes have the potential to convert up to 30 per cent of the solar energy into electricity and that is twice the amount that we convert today , " says Martin Aagesen who is a PhD from the Nano - Science Center and the Niels Bohr Institute at University of Copenhagen .
During his work on his PhD thesis , Martin found a new and untried material .
" I discovered a perfect crystalline structure .
That is a very rare sight .
While being a perfect crystalline structure we could see that it also absorbed all light .
It could become the perfect solar cell , " says Martin Aagesen .
The discovery of the new material has sparked a lot of attention internationally and has led to an article in Nature Nanotechnology .
" The potential is unmistakeable .
We can reduce the solar cell production costs because we use less of the expensive semiconducting silicium in the process due to the use of nanotechnology .
At the same time , the future solar cells will exploit the solar energy better as the distance of energy transportation in the solar cell will be shorter and thus lessen the loss of energy , " says Martin Aagesen who is also director of the company SunFlake Inc. that pursues development of the new solar cell .

Bush Opens Roadless Tongass National Forest to Logging
This move by Bush officials to reverse roadless area protections parallels two others made recently in national forests located in Idaho and Colorado .
Conservationists from across the country are indignant that roads will be punched through some of the nation 's last , best roadless areas to allow private corporations to log America 's public lands .
" The few remaining roadless areas of our national forests are some of the only safe harbors for America 's wildlife , " said Mary Beth Beetham at Defenders of Wildlife .
" As global warming threatens to dramatically change the landscape we must have the foresight to preserve these last remaining pristine forests for future generations .
It 's folly for the Bush administration , in its last few months , to work to destroy these areas . "
In December 2003 , Bush officials " temporarily " exempted Alaska 's Tongass rainforest from the Clinton era Roadless Rule , designed to protect 58 million acres of roadless wild forests in 39 states .
The Bush administration 's new management plan for the Tongass National Forest will raise no revenue for the U.S. government , as the U.S. taxpayers will have to pay to build the roads the timber companies need to access the forest .
" With so much of our forest heritage already lost , every roadless acre counts .
The spectacular roadless areas in Alaska deserve as much protection as those in every other state , " said Larry Edwards with Greenpeace in Sitka , Alaska .
" The Roadless Rule and the courts have sheltered many of the last , best places in our national forests , even during an administration hostile to forest protection .
Now , with one foot out the door , Bush officials are looking for whatever way they can to give away the family silver , " said Franz Matzner at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
Tongass logging fell dramatically in the 1990s , and for years now has existed at levels that do not require slicing roads and clearcuts into virgin old - growth forests , as the Forest Service itself has acknowledged .
" The new plan suffers from the same central problem as the old plan .
It leaves 2.4 million acres of wild , roadless backcountry areas open to clear cutting and new logging roads , " said Earthjustice attorney Tom Waldo .
" The Tongass is worth a whole lot more to the American people as a standing forest than it is as a sea of stumps and logs . "
The land management plan released today was ordered more than two years ago by a federal court which concluded that the old plan justifying opening Tongass wildlands for development was invalid due to several factors , including a gross overestimation of demand for Tongass logs .
Congress also has expressed concern with Tongass wilderness logging .
The House of Representative has voted three times to stop taxpayer dollars from funding new logging roads there .
In September 2006 , the federal District Court of Northern California ordered the Bush administration to reinstate the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule to protect almost 50 million acres of National Forests and grasslands across the lower 48 states and Puerto Rico from road construction , logging , and other harmful development .

Judge Elizabeth Laporte ruled that the Bush administration violated both the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act by when it repealed the Roadless Rule and put into place another rule without any substantial analysis or need .
But the long term status of the roadless areas in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska was not settled by Judge Laporte .
In 2003 , the Bush administration exempted the Tongass from the roadless rule by creating a separate amendment that was based on the validity of the Tongass Land Management Plan .
" The Forest Service is losing money hand over fist on roads that Americans do n't even want , " said Christy Goldfuss of Environment America .
" Today , " said Caitlin Hills with American Lands Alliance , " the federal government , in defiance of the facts and the strongly expressed sentiments of the American people to protect all roadless areas , has answered ' fire up the chainsaws . ' "
" The Tongass is the crown jewel of our nation 's roadless wildlands , " said Trish Rolfe at Alaska Sierra Club .
" Wild salmon , bears , eagles , and wolves thrive there among moss - draped ancient trees , along crystalline fjords and untamed rivers .
It has nine million acres of roadless areas that lack permanent protection .
The Bush administration has just put some of the best of them on the chopping block . "
" All over the Tongass there are roadless wildlands that local people and visitors hold dear , jeopardized by this new plan , " said Gregory Vickrey with Tongass Conservation Society .
" These are special places critical to the region 's incredible fish , deer and other wildlife , world - famous recreational opportunities , cherished subsistence practices , and the businesses and jobs that depend on the region 's natural treasures , " said Vickrey .
" These are the very things that make Southeast Alaskans most want to live here . "

Experts : Baby Tax Needed to Save the Earth
Here we go with more global warming insanity , this time from Australia .
It seems as though having children is destroying the planet , so now Australia want to tax childbirth and child raising .
A WEST Australian medical expert wants families to pay a $ 5000 - plus “ baby levy ” at birth and an annual carbon tax of up to $ 800 a child .
This story is going to get even more strange as I continue , so hold on .
First let me try to wrap my arms around this absurdity .
Any species first and most basic instinct is to multiply , to continue the species .
This includes man .
This is nature , and is natural .
We are told that if we do not stop global warming that the planet will be destroyed and man will cease to exist .
So in order to ensure that man will continue to prosper we must ….. stop multiplying .
Okay , I tried to get my arms around it , but I must be stupid because this makes no sense to me .
Evidentally , Australia currently pays it ’s new mothers $ 4133 to have children in the form of a baby bonus .
The new plan being proposed would do away with that and punish people who decide to have children .
“ Every newborn baby in Australia represents a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions for an average of 80 years , not simply by breathing but by the profligate consumption of resources typical of our society , ” he wrote .
“ Far from showering financial booty on new mothers and rewarding greenhouse - unfriendly behaviour , a ‘ baby levy ’ in the form of a carbon tax should apply , in line with the ‘ polluter pays ’ principle . ”
A greenhouse unfriendly behavior ?
Does anyone else realize how stupid this statement is ?
It is natural for people to have children , sinse when is it a crime ?
I suppose it is n’t a crime but rather an opportunity .
An opportunity to tax the shit out of the Australian people .
Professor Walters , clinical associate professor of obstetric medicine at the University of Western Australia and the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Perth , called for condoms and “ greenhouse - friendly ” services such as sterilisation procedures to earn carbon credits .
Condoms and sterilization are greenhouse friendly and should be condoned , while people who are just trying to start and raise a family should be punished .
This is just further proof that the whole reasoning behind politicians pushing this global warming agenda is to tax people for everything they can get away with , all in the name of saving the planet .
There is an upside here though .
Once Hillary realizes that her $ 5000 “ baby bond ” idea will be an incentive to destroy the planet she will have to take it off the table .
If it ever really was on the table in the first place .
Publisher Erol Karaaslan said yesterday that he would be questioned by an Istanbul prosecutor as part of an official investigation into The God Delusion , written by the British expert in evolutionary biology .
Karaaslan could go on trial if the prosecutor concludes the book incites religious hatred and insults religious values , and faces up to one year in prison if found guilty , Milliyet newspaper reported .
The prosecutor started the inquiry into the book after one reader complained that passages in the book were an assault on " sacred values " , Karaaslan said .
The publisher said he would be questioned today and faces prosecution both as the book 's publisher and translator .
The book has sold 6,000 copies in Turkey since it was published by his Kuzey publishing house in June .
No one was available for comment at the prosecutor 's office .
The investigation follows controversy about free speech in Turkey after Nobel prizewinning author Orhan Pamuk went on trial in 2005 over comments about the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century .
The charges were later dropped .
The EU , which Turkey hopes to join , is pressing Ankara to change laws that curb free expression and do not fit within the bloc 's standards of free speech .
Turkey has said it will soften a law which makes it a crime to denigrate Turkish identity or insult the country 's institutions .
Excerpted from : Death of Democracy : The Erosion of Freedom Doctrine of the Second American Revolution By J.C. “ Jake ” Laughton
Chapter 1 A Renewed Purpose : The Erosion of Freedom
John Kennedy once said , “ Let us be the masters , not the victims of our history ” .
Current US Senator and Presidential Candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton was quoted as saying , “ We ’re all in it together ” .
President Bush calls America the “ Ownership Society ” .
Not only does he believe it but he supports it with his Policies .
To paraphrase a commonly used expression in America , 1 % of the population of the US owns and controls 85 % of it .
Recently I watched George Carlin doing a comedy stand up show on HBO ; in one bit from his show he called the People that run the US “ The Owners of America ” .
In the Michael Moore movie “ Sicko ” , Americans who now live in France tell us the Government there is concerned enough about its people to enact laws that not only protect them but give them extra things to make their lives easier .
Some of the things mentioned include full health care , but 5 weeks of PAID vacation each year .
5 weeks of paid vacation each year makes them nicely rested and refreshed and as a result France has one of the world ’s highest productivity rates from its workers .
When asked why the French government gave them all these great perks , the answer was straight forward and to the point , “ Here the government is afraid of the People , in American the People are afraid of their government ” .
Most important here is the fact that over 90 % of the French people vote .
Voting is the power that the people have in a democracy .
In America people are afraid that if they stand up to the government that the government will take away its freedom , but this is already happening .
In the pages that follow I show you how this is happening and the key factors that point directly to it .
We as a nation are being lead towards a time and place in history where democracy no longer exists .
In fact Democracy is all but gone already .
Democracy was established here in America to fight the financial oppression of England ’s King George , not only taxation without any representation , but price fixing and the elimination of open competition that allowed the British to charge whatever price it wanted for its goods .
Democracy is where the people elect others to enact laws , rules and regulations that serve their collective conscious for the common good of all .
Nowadays , corporations pay lawmakers , through huge campaign donations and fabulously extravagant FREE vacations and trips , to enact laws , rules and regulations for the good of the Corporations ONLY , with no regard to the People who are supposed to have that sole privilege .
If 1 % of the US population owns so much of it , what exactly does that mean ?
For you and me in the 99 % group , what it means is this ; there are 3 million people worth at least $ 1 million that is exactly 1 % .
So in the US there are 297 million people who do not have a million dollars or are not worth one million dollars .
There is a shift in what defines the middle class , people like me who a few years ago would have been considered middle class can no longer say that .
Anyone who does not yet have a worth of one million , but has income of more than $ 250,000.00 per year can be labeled as middle class .
To truly be “ middle class ” you either have to have an income that will earn you a million in less than 5 years or be in the class of millionaires who have a worth of fewer than 2 million dollars .
Those who are worth more than 3 million dollars are not the upper class , but the “ super class ” .
And those of the 297 million Americans who are not worth a million dollars are the “ sub class ” .
Back about 20 years ago give or take a few years , there was a commercial on TV with a man saying , “ I make more money than my father made during his life but I have so much less and ca n’t afford to give my family all the things that my dad did ” .
The commercial was about starting an account to save for your retirement , given the statement made by the man in the commercial , how could he or anyone save for their retirement ?
One of my favorite retirement benefits ( and I am being sarcastic here ) is the 401K that companies use to lure minimum wages employees .
How is a single person that ca n’t afford even the rent for an apartment , going to be able to contribute to a 401 K plan ?
In the last 30 years every price in America has risen nearly 1000 % with some prices going higher then that .
Our government leaders are knowingly creating a situation where a dictatorship may quickly come to be .
President Bush has suggested that he would like to be dictator of America .
The term doctrine is used to refer to a principle of law , in the common law traditions , established through a history of past decisions , such as the doctrine of self - defense , or the principle of fair use .
My message is delivered in what I call the ‘ Erosion of Freedom ’ doctrine made up of 4 factors they are ,
1. Freedom is taken away by stifling and controlling your money , this control over your finances is being accomplished with high prices on everything you buy .
2. Elections are being manipulated to get puppet candidates in office ; the greatest example of this is the Election of George Bush .
3. Creating and maintaining a climate of fear is central to this discussion .
Creating fear also has a side detriment in that it quite often creates Panic Buying .
4 . The government is actively involved in creating higher prices in the Meat , Diary and Produce industries .
In the pages that follow you will read examples of this taking place now .
I use personal information , facts and opinions to illustrate to you what I am describing and how you can start doing something to change this downward spiral and restore true freedom for you , your family and your descendants for generations to come .
The first super hero ever created was Superman .
His Credo was “ To Fight for Truth , Justice and The American Way ” .
In the 2006 remake “ Superman Returns ” Superman ’s credo is now Truth , Justice and that other stuff !
So why was “ and The American Way ” dropped ?
To be less objectionable to an international audience ?
Are they saying that the OLD “ American Way ” is dead and gone ?
This book is not just about the current President George Bush , but since it was written while he is in office he gets lots of the blame for the problems in the US today .
George Bush is just one shining example of the poor leadership that has lead us to this point in American history .
There are horrible things going on in this country , I feel that if Americans do n’t act now , these trends will continue regardless of who is our president .
Democracy , our democracy has been swept away .
In my 47 years , I have often heard the phrase used in regards to a Dictator in a foreign land , “ That absolute power corrupts absolutely ” President Bush has been caught on tape saying , “ I wish this was a dictatorship , it would be easier to handle ” .
Usually a dictator is at least a smart person , but Bush is out there in LALA land , a 1 - dimensional product of wealth and privilege .

Teachers banned a nine - year - old boy from his class Christmas party because his parents had barred him from RE lessons .
Douglas Stewart was forced to stay at home while his friends received presents from Santa and tucked into ice cream and jelly .
His parents were told he was not welcome at the celebration because they had pulled him out of religious eduction classes earlier in the year .
Scroll down for more ...
Headmaster Ian Davidson said that because the youngster had no interest in religion he could not celebrate the birth of Christ .
Furious mother Dawn Riddell , 38 , said yesterday : " I 've helped out at the Christmas party before and it's got absolutely nothing to do with Jesus .
Douglas was heartbroken he could n't go .
It was cruel . "
The boy and his brother Callum , 11 , attend Cluny Primary , a council - run school in Buckie , Banffshire .
As the family have no religious beliefs , Miss Riddell had asked for them to be exempt from RE lessons .
But she was stunned when the head called with the news about the party .
She contacted Moray Council to find out its policy on school parties and was told these were non-religious .
After the council spoke to the school , the decision to exclude Douglas was put down to a " misunderstanding " .
Callum was allowed to attend his party a few days later and Douglas received a present Santa had left behind .
From the Kucinich campaign :
There are literally just weeks left before the primaries in Iowa , New Hampshire and Nevada .
We are proud of how far we 've come , and the way the American people have embraced our message of " Strength through Peace . "
According to recent polls we are in 4th place in New Hampshire .
You could help put us over the top in New Hampshire by making a contribution today , and Double Your Impact , by taking advantage of the federal matching funds program .
Your support is essential as you can help us : * Run advertisements and media *
Hire field coordinators and staff * Provide housing for volunteers willing to come to New Hampshire to help get Dennis ' message out .
*
Have all the resources we need to compete in New Hampshire and other early primary states
You know our campaign does not take contributions from corporations or from special interest groups .
We have relied on people like you to help support our campaign .
You have always come through during our end of quarter drives .
This is such an important opportunity for us and we can not let it go by .
Kucinich has disporpotiantely been supported by small donors and so the fact of doubling our contribution is something that we simply need to take advantage of .
Even a small donation now becomes more significant .
If you have already donated , I sincerely thank you .
But , if you can make the extra committment for Mr. Kucinich 's leadership , it will go twice as far until tommorow .
Let us not forget what Kucinich 's leadership has been :
The only Democratic Candidate to oppose the War and the subsequent Occupation
The only Democratic Candidate to show the judgement and Constitutional integrity to vote against the Patriot Act
One of only six House members to vote against the Homegrow Terrorism Act
The only Democratic Candidate who is taking the threats to our Democracy seriously and actually holding this Administration accountable through Impeachment
The only Presidential Candidate offering a truly universal , not - for - profit health care system
The only Democratic Candidate who will cancel U.S. involvement in job killing , deficit building , human expoliting , environmental raping trade agreements , NAFTA / WTO
Really it goes on .
We have seen this leadership .
Kucinich has been the heart and soul of this party ; the only Democrat willing to stand up for the party 's principles , rather than play party politics ; the only one willing to put the Constitution and all Americans ahead of politics .
We need to support Dennis because he is speaking for us .
And we need to support him now before it is too late .
Please follow this link and make your contribution now .
Thank you for your support !
The nanoparticle polymer is made of peroxalate esters .
A fluorescent dye ( pentacene ) is then encapsulated into the polymer .
When the nano particles bump into hydrogen peroxide , they excite the dye , which then emits photons ( or light ) that can be detected .

Most people think of hydrogen peroxide as a topical germ killer , but the medicine cabinet staple is gaining steam in the medical community as an early indicator of disease in the body .
Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University researchers are the first to create a nanoparticle capable of detecting and imaging trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide in animals .
The nanoparticles , thought to be completely nontoxic , could some day be used as a simple , all - purpose diagnostic tool to detect the earliest stages of any disease that involves chronic inflammation — everything from cancer and Alzheimer ’s to heart disease and arthritis .
The research , lead by the laboratories of Niren Murthy at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University and Dr. Robert Taylor in the Division of Cardiology at the Emory University School of Medicine , will appear in the October issue of Nature Materials and was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .
Hydrogen peroxide is thought to be over - produced by cells at the early stages of most diseases .
Because there were previously no imaging techniques available to capture this process in the body , the details of how the hydrogen peroxide is produced and its role in a developing disease must still be determined .
The Georgia Tech and Emory nanoparticles may be the key to better understanding the role of hydrogen peroxide in the progression of many diseases and later play an important diagnostic role , Murthy said .
“ These nanoparticles are incredibly sensitive so you can detect nanomolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide .
That ’s important because researchers are n’t yet certain what amounts of hydrogen peroxide are present in various diseases , ” Murthy said .
The ultimate goal , however , is that the nanoparticles could some day be used as a simple , all - purpose diagnostic tool for most diseases .
In the future , the nanoparticle would be injected by needle into a certain area of the body ( for instance , the heart ) .
If the nanoparticles encountered hydrogen peroxide , they would emit light .
Should a doctor see a significant amount of light activity in the area , the doctor would know that the patient may be presenting early signs of a disease in that area of the body .
The Georgia Tech and Emory nanoparticles penetrate deep tissue and operate at a high wave length , making them sensitive indicators of the presence of hydrogen peroxide produced by any sort of inflammation .
The nanoparticle polymer is made of peroxalate esters .
A fluorescent dye ( pentacene ) is then encapsulated into the polymer .
When the nano particles bump into hydrogen peroxide , they excite the dye , which then emits photons ( or light ) that can be detected in a simple , photon - counting scan .
“ It ’s using this nanoparticle made of peroxalate esters that allows you to do this three component reaction in vivo .
If you were to inject a peroxalate ester and a dye , they would go their own ways once in the body .
With the nanoparticles we can sequester both of these reagents within nanometers of each other , in vivo , ” Murthy said .
The goal was to maximize the wavelength of the particles .
Wavelength determines the sensitivity in vivo .
And if the particle ’s wavelength is high enough , it can penetrate the skin and display clearly on a scan .
The research team started with a nanoparticle that was made of dye and filled with peroxide esthers .
They later realized that the reverse ( a particle made of peroxalate esters and filled with dye ) was more effective at imaging hydrogen peroxide , Murthy said .
The group will conduct further tests with the nanoparticles to confirm their safety and effectiveness .

Gary King recently blogged a question about whether a use of EVAL he had recently made in some Common Lisp code was legit .
This caught my eye because I suspect this question came up while Gary was working on a project that I once worked on .
Anyway , since he asked , the short answer is , “ No .
The old rule that if you ’re using EVAL you ’re doing something wrong is still true . ”
A slightly longer answer follows .
The problem Gary set out to solve is that he ’s got a a bunch of chunks of text coming out of some sort of database and he wants to query them with logical expressions like this one :
( or ( and " space " " mission " ) ( and ( or " moon " " lunar " ) " landing " ) )
These expressions are obviously not Lisp but rather a query language where the logical operators AND and OR ( and presumably other ones like NOT ) have their usual logical meaning and literal strings should evaluate to true if the text we ’re matching against testing contains the string and false if not .
Thus the expression above would match text containing the words “ space ” and “ mission ” or either of “ moon ” or “ lunar ” along with “ landing ” .
Gary considered , and rejected , writing “ a simple recursive evaluator to deal with ands and ors ” .
Instead he wrote some code to munge around expressions like the one above into a form that he could EVAL .
In other words , instead of writing his own interpreter he just munged his code into a form that Lisp could interpret for him .
Which is okay .
Except for the rule that if you ’re using EVAL you ’re doing something wrong .
What he should have done is written a compiler .
Luckily Common Lisp comes with a Lisp compiler built in so all we have to do to write our own compiler is translate our source language into Lisp .
Here ’s how I ’d do it .
First define a function that takes a query expression and returns two values , an equivalent expression with all string literals replaced with GENSYM ’d variable names , and an alist of the strings and the corresponding GENSYM ’d names .
In this phase we also detect if the same literal string appears more than once so we only generate a single binding for each unique string .
( defun translate ( tree &optional bindings ) ( typecase tree ( cons ( multiple - value - bind ( newcar newbindings ) ( translate ( car tree ) bindings ) ( multiple - value - bind ( newcdr newbindings2 ) ( translate ( cdr tree ) newbindings ) ( values ( cons newcar newcdr ) newbindings2 ) ) ) ) ( symbol ( values tree bindings ) ) ( string ( let ( ( binding ( assoc tree bindings : test #'equal ) ) ) ( cond ( binding ( values ( cdr binding ) bindings ) ) ( t ( let ( ( sym ( gensym ) ) ) ( values sym ( acons tree sym bindings ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
With this function we can translate an expression like :
( or ( and " a " " b " ) ( and ( or " c " " d " ) ( or " a " " b " ) ) )
Into this expression :
( OR ( AND #:G1 #: G2 ) ( AND ( OR #:G3 #: G4 ) ( OR #:G1 #: G2 ) ) )
and this list of bindings :
( ( " d " . #: G4 ) ( " c " . #:G3 ) ( " b " . #: G2 ) ( " a " . #: G1 ) )
Now we just need to use those two values to build up a bit of Lisp .
Gary ’s solution was to build up an expression that he could EVAL .
But it ’s better to generate a LAMBDA expression because then we can compile it .
Here ’s the function :
1
( defun make - lambda - expression ( expr ) ( multiple - value - bind ( tree bindings ) ( translate expr ) ( let ( ( string ( gensym ) ) ) `( lambda ( , string ) ( let ( , @( loop for ( word . sym ) in bindings collect `( , sym ( find - word - in - string , word , string ) ) ) ) , tree ) ) ) ) )
If we pass the same expression to this function we get the following lambda expression back .
( LAMBDA ( #: G9 ) ( LET ((#:G8 ( FIND - WORD-IN - STRING " d " #:G9 ) ) ( #:G7 ( FIND - WORD-IN - STRING " c " #:G9 ) ) ( #:G6 ( FIND - WORD-IN - STRING " b " #:G9 ) ) ( #:G5 ( FIND - WORD-IN - STRING " a " #:G9 ) ) ) ( OR ( AND #:G5 #: G6 ) ( AND ( OR #: G7 #: G8 ) ( OR #:G5 #: G6 ) ) ) ) )
We could use FUNCALL to evaluate this expression which would at least get us out of using EVAL .2
But the real advantage of this approach is that we can compile this expression .
Since Gary said he wanted to find all the strings in his database that match a given expression , he ’s probably going to be evaluating his query once per string in his database .
In that case it ’s probably worth it to take a small up front hit in order to speed up the execution of the query since we ’re going to be executing it many times .
Luckily compiling a lambda expression is about as trivial as EVAL ing any other expression :
( defun compile - expression ( expr ) ( compile nil ( make- lambda - expression expr ) ) )
This function , fed a query expression , returns a compiled function that takes a single string argument and returns true if the query expression matches and false if not .
On Lisps with native compilers the returned function will be compiled down to machine code just the same as if we had written it by hand in our source code .
We can FUNCALL this function such as in this code that collects all the strings returned by a cursor function that match the query expression :
( defun query - strings ( query database ) ( loop with predicate = ( compile - expression query ) with cursor = ( string - cursor database ) for string = ( next - string cursor ) while string when ( funcall predicate string ) collect string ) )
We can also use the query function with all of Lisp ’s higher - order - functions , such as REMOVE -IF - NOT :
( remove - if - not ( compile - expression query ) * all - strings * )
Now , one could argue that there ’s a whole heck of a lot of difference between using EVAL and wrapping something in a lambda expression and compiling it — in both cases you can generate , and then evaluate , arbitrary Lisp code .
But there is an important difference , namely that EVAL just evaluates — it takes some data and interprets it as Lisp and gives you an answer straight away whereas compiling a lambda expression gives you a function , something that can interact with the rest of your code , as an argument to higher - order functions , and so on .
Or , if you do n’t buy that , at least you avoid breaking the no EVAL rule .
Update :
It hit me as I was brushing my teeth that while nicely avoiding EVAL , my first solution had a big problem — because all the FIND - WORD - IN - STRING calls are done in the LET before the boolean expression is evaluated we lose all the advantage of AND and OR ’s short - circuiting behavior .
That is , the generated code searches for all the strings and then combines the results of all those searches .
Much better ( and simpler ) would be to implement TRANSLATE and MAKE - LAMBDA -EXPRESSION this way :
( defun translate ( tree &optional ( stringvar ( gensym ) ) ) ( typecase tree ( cons ( cons ( translate ( car tree ) stringvar ) ( translate ( cdr tree ) stringvar ) ) ) ( symbol tree ) ( string `( find - word - in - string , tree , stringvar ) ) ) ) ( defun make - lambda - expression ( expr ) ( let ( ( string ( gensym ) ) ) `( lambda ( , string ) , ( translate expr string ) ) ) )
This has the slight disadvantage that if the same literal string appears in the pattern more than once , we will potentially search for it more than once .
But that ’s probably much less of an issue than the problem this code fixes .
Obviously if we cared to , we could generate code that caches searches once they are done to get the best of both worlds .
But I ’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush will make a statement Friday morning in the Rose Garden about homeownership financing , a senior administration official said Thursday .
The statement is scheduled for 11 a.m .
" The president will discuss a number of initiatives and reforms intended to help homeowners with subprime mortgages keep their homes , " the official said .
" He will also discuss reform efforts to prevent these kinds of problems from arising in the future . "
Bush will direct Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson to team up to help troubled mortgage holders get the services and products they need to avoid defaulting on their loans , the official said .
He will also push Congress to pass Federal Housing Administration legislation that will give the agency more flexibility to assist mortgage holders with subprime loans , the official said .
The need for rigorous enforcement of predatory lending laws and stronger , more transparent lending practices are also on the agenda for the statement , the official said .
" He will discuss his willingness to work with Congress in a bipartisan way on legislation to reform the tax code to help troubled borrowers rework their loans , " he said .
Risky loans have fueled a rise in foreclosures and forced some lenders to shut down or file for bankruptcy themselves .
Foreclosure filings , which include default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions , in July were up 9 percent over June - and 93 percent over July 2006 .
Opinion Bush 's Mideast Pipe Dream
The American president came to the Middle East in an attempt to deliver peace .
Instead , George W. Bush 's visit to the Holy Land has only deepened the divide between the Israelis and Palestinians .

A teenager with a death - wish has filmed himself lying on a railway track as a speeding train drives straight over him .
In a sick twist of the game " chicken " , the youth places himself flat out on the sleepers before a train hones into view behind him .
He remains motionless as it hurtles over his head , leaving him just inches from death - with the whole episode videoed to show off later .
Amazingly , he escapes entirely unharmed but lies still after the train has passed to ensure another one is not on its way .
After checking behind him , he raises his arm to the camera - thought to be in his mobile phone - in triumph before standing up and nonchalantly walking off .

The video on YouTube is thought to be part of a sick twist on " chicken " , in which teenagers are now seeking to outdo each other with their daredevil stunts .
Internet sites have been flooded with footage of dangerous games which see youngsters vying with each other by risking their lives .
Police have warned that people will die unless the activity stops .
And the British Transport Police has warned that anyone caught performing such a stunt on railtracks would be prosecuted .
A transport source said : " All it would take is for something to be hanging from the train and it could take a limb - or a head - clean off .
" It is surely only a matter of time before someone ends up dead . "
The image of a Muslim man pleading with his imam for a second chance with his wife , only to be told that it is his wife 's decision , is not what most people would expect from a sharia court .
But his case is typical of hundreds each year dealt with by a group of scholars who provide judgments on sharia law for Muslims across the country .
Sharia law has not only become synonymous with brutal punishments meted out by hardline Islamic states ; it has also come to be seen as a source of oppression within Muslim communities across Europe .
The Qur'an has been used to justify forced marriages , honour killings and even the call to holy war by fundamentalist clerics such as Abu Hamza .
But sharia also has another face .
Islamic law is a code for living that governs every aspect of life , from which food is halal , to donations to the poor and the proper way to dress .
The Muslims who consult the Islamic Sharia Council are not asking for permission to stone adulterous wives , or chop off the hands of thieves , but simply for day - to - day guidance on living in accordance with their faith .
" The only thing we want sharia to mean here is when it comes to their religious belief , their marriages , their divorces , their right to prayer , " says Mushtaq Bux , until recently general manager at the Leyton council .
" That is what we mean by sharia , nothing else . "
The council , which has no legal authority , issues fatwas , or religious judgments , from two rooms that resemble a hard - up solicitors ' practice , tucked away on a quiet terraced street of small family homes with roses in the front gardens .
It considers everything from inheritance settlements and whether property deals comply with Islamic laws against accruing interest , to the proper time to start Ramadan ( in a country that is always overcast , how can you rely on the first sighting of the crescent moon ? ) and whether a soft drink that advertises itself as a non-alcoholic alcopop can actually be allowed to call itself alcohol - free .
In one email , a woman who is losing her hair asked if Muslim women are allowed to wear wigs .
But the overwhelming majority of cases are to do with divorce - 95 % of the roughly 7,000 cases the council has dealt with since opening its doors in 1982 - and , specifically , with releasing women from bad or forced Islamic marriages .
When he worked at the Leyton council , Bux used to get about 40 letters and emails a day from women asking for divorces .
" People do n't understand the scale of the epidemic , " he says .
The flood of applications stems from husbands ' misuse of Islamic laws on marriage .
Under Islamic law , a man is allowed to have up to four wives and has the primary right to call for divorce , known as talaq .
As a result , it is possible for a husband to leave his wife and re-marry , refuse to give his first wife a divorce , and still consider himself living in accordance with his faith .
In the eyes of the Muslim community , his first wife is still married , and because women are only allowed one husband at a time , she is stranded .
" She is left hanging in midair , " says Najma Ebrahim , a coordinator with the Muslim Women 's Helpline , which receives 2,000 calls a year , 70 % - 80 % of which are from women with marital problems .
And with divorce comes stigma from the community .
" To them , the woman is a failure : she could n't keep her husband . "
The council writes to the husband on behalf of the wife - a process known as khul 'a - and asks him to grant his wife talaq .
If he does not agree , or refuses to respond , after three months the council aims to issue a divorce .
Ebrahim says the council is providing a vital service .
" It 's very important for [ the wife 's ] self , for her healing , " she says .
" Her faith - her fate - is important to her , so when she goes to the council and gets that decision , at least for her she knows she is not doing something wrong . "
Suhaib Hasan , the secretary of the council , puts it more bluntly .
" If she remarries without taking the divorce , she would be an outcast in society , " he says .
" This is why she has to have an authority where she can get the solution of her problems . "
When Razia , 40 , left her home in Manchester for rural Pakistan two years ago , she thought she was just going to visit her family .
But when she got there she found herself under intense pressure to marry a man 10 years her junior .
After weeks of emotional blackmail by her aunt and her aunt 's family , eventually she gave in .
She explains how she was ground down by her family and disorientated by being thousands of miles from home .
" I did tell them I 'm not over here to get married , but they were n't taking no for an answer , " she says .
" When you are over there with your family , family wins . "
She quickly realised the marriage was really about obtaining a visa for her new husband .
" They just wanted to get it over and done with , thinking he'd get the visa straight away , " she says .
" I have had no contact from him since he found out it was not a quick process . "
As soon as she got back , she set about trying to get a divorce , but as a Muslim , she not only needed a civil divorce but an Islamic one as well .
She felt the Islamic Sharia Council were the only people who could help .
The council says her case is typical , and Sayeed , 55 , president of the council , is furious that sharia law is used to justify forced marriages like Razia's .
He says that forced marriage is an ingrained cultural tradition , but it is not sanctioned under sharia law .
It is a " tribal or traditional interpretation of Islam " , he says .
" Not incorrect interpretation of sharia - no interpretation of sharia . "
" In every situation our motto is : reconciliation first .
So we try to reconcile , but in cases where a marriage was enforced on a girl against her wishes , against her own opinion , we do n't want to negotiate .
What we do is , we try to make their guardians , their parents , understand the Islamic position , and also we tell them what is the position of British law on marriage . "
Sayeed tells them that they " will also be guilty of [ breaking ] heavenly laws - that is how we try to convince the parents " .
Does it work ?
" Not all the time .
We are human and working in human society .
Not all the time ; most of the time , yes . "
But not all councils are as committed to liberal interpretations of sharia .
Estimates of the number of mosques across the country range from 1,000 to 2,000 .
They serve a hugely diverse Muslim community - at 1.6 million people , Muslims are the largest religious minority in Britain .
Each mosque has its own imams , some of whom are scholars like Sayeed , while others are simply devout Muslims fulfilling a need for religious guidance in their communities .
The Islamic Sharia Council is one of the oldest and most respected , but it admits that there is no single body that can claim to be fully representative of all British Muslims .
Neither is there any regulation of imams , or any benchmark for the quality of advice that they give .
Abdul Jalil Sajid , former secretary of the mosque and community affairs committee of the Muslim Council of Britain , estimates that 35 % of imams are unqualified .
No one knows how many of them are operating in sharia councils , applying their own interpretations of Islamic law .
According to Cassandra Balchin , of Women Living Under Muslim Laws ( WLUML ) , too many of them promote a highly conservative interpretation of sharia that overemphasises the rights of the husband .
" They do n't seem to recognise the multiple forms of divorce that are available to women , " she says .
" There are usually no women involved , whereas in a lot of Muslim countries you can have women judges involved in family courts . "
" They are bringing the husband in and saying , can he please release her . "
But , says Balchin , " If the husband has violated his wife 's rights within the marriage , Islam gives the wife the right to divorce irrespective of his consent .
The woman is left with this feeling that she is powerless and that she has to beg for everything .
This is a very conservative interpretation . "
The question of which councils are at fault is as hard to pin down as the range of interpretations of sharia .
Shahien Taj , founding director of the All Wales Saheli Association , says that this confusion itself leaves many women bewildered and uncertain of their rights .
" If I ca n't get my head around it , I ca n't expect anyone else to , " she says .
Parvin Ali , founding director of the Fatima Women 's Network , which is based in Leicester , counsels women on the receiving end of one - sided judgments .
She says she has not seen women from the Islamic Sharia Council in Leyton , but has heard complaints about councils elsewhere .
Another major problem is bad advice over what exactly constitutes a valid marriage and divorce in the first place .
The councils " seem to imply that their decisions would be valid in some other legal context " , says Balchin , " but that , in fact , is not the case " .
Islamic marriages and divorces conducted in Muslim countries such as Pakistan or Bangladesh are recognised as valid in the UK , but the British courts do not recognise Islamic ceremonies carried out in this country unless they are registered separately with the civil authorities .
The result is that some Muslims think they are protected by family law when they are not , and others think they are properly divorced when , in fact , they are still married .
In one case , Luton police contacted WLUML after pursuing a man for bigamy who had married in Luton , then flown to Pakistan and married again .
After looking into the case , they found that the first marriage was invalid as it had been conducted by an imam in an unregistered mosque .
His first wife was left with no legal protection by the family courts , and the husband was free to bring his second wife back to Britain as his legal spouse .
There are also consequences for ex-husbands .
One 39 - year - old man came to the Islamic Sharia Council after he had split up with his wife , whom he had married Islamically but not civilly .
They have a young daughter , and he had provided the down payment on their home , which is in his ex-wife 's name .
All the sharia council could do was issue a recommendation that under sharia law their assets should be split proportionally , and that both parents should have equal access to their daughter .
But as they were not legally married , the husband had no claim over the family home , and when his wife began to prevent him from seeing his daughter , he found he had very limited rights as a father .
" I do n't have a leg to stand on , " he says .
" If I approach her house holding a letter from the sharia council ... if she calls the police , it 's not a letter that can be used in a court of law . "
The Islamic Sharia Council , along with other sharia councils , argues that much of this confusion could be swept away if sharia law on marriages and divorces were recognised under civil law .
But according to Lord Justice Thorpe , deputy chair of the Family Justice Council , there is already legislation available to them .
" It seems to me they have n't really got a problem at the marriage end , " he says .
" All you have to do is register your place of worship and , once registered , then marriages solemnised will be good in civil law . "
And as far as divorces are concerned , he sees no reason why a recent act brought in to tackle the problem of so - called limping marriages in the British Jewish community , could not also be applied to British Muslims .
But that is as far as it is likely to go .
" What we can't accept is marrying polygamously under English law , " Lord Thorpe says .
According to Werner Menski , professor of South Asian Laws at the School of Oriental And African Studies and an expert on comparative law , the rather vague demands of the sharia councils are as much about British Muslims attempting to define what they mean by sharia , as they are about incorporating Islamic law into the British legal system .
" At the moment , there is a period of confusion and insecurity , " he says .
" The question is , how far can we go in this pluralism , how far can we go in accepting these things ?
But do n't expect any answers - it 's really very difficult .
Everybody in this field is scratching their heads about how to do this . "
In the council 's backroom , however , surrounded by gold - embossed tomes of Islamic jurisprudence and brown cardboard boxes , Sayeed puts his hand on his chest with pride as he explains what his work means to him .
" I feel I could at last do some real good thing in the practical life of people , " he says .
" I am not doing it for any financial gain in this world ; I am doing it for immense reward from the Lord Almighty in the hereafter , so it fills my heart with all these riches " .
By Martin Bosworth
Two seemingly coincidental bits of news crossed my desk yesterday morning .
First , the Wall Street Journal contains excerpts of an interview with Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell in which he outlines a vast new initiative to police Internet traffic “ for abuse . ”
Meanwhile , AT&T announced that it plans to extend its initiative to examine packets of information on its network for illegally traded content , becoming , in effect , the Internet ’s traffic cop .
Let ’s see …the world ’s largest telecom company states it ’s in negotiations with major entertainment conglomerate to police the Internet on their behalf , on the same day the DNI announces the government wants more eyes on Internet traffic ?
Mike McConnell is an old friend to the major telecom companies , having most recently stumped on their behalf to grant them retroactive immunity from prosecution in the NSA ’s illegal surveillance program .
He ’s also a big fan of privatizing national security functions , favoring everything from outsourcing background checks to enlisting credit bureaus to handle the work of verifying identities .
I find it not at all unfeasible that even as AT&T is offering its services to Big Content , Big Government is waiting expectantly in the visitors ’ room for its turn at the till .
There are no coincidences .
The soothsayers have slaughtered the ox and are examining the gloppy entrails for signs :
Rising unemployment , a falling dollar , weak consumer spending , the credit crisis , a swooning stock market .
Could there be something wrong here ?
Could we actually be approaching a , god forbid , recession ?
To which the only sane response is :
Who cares ?
According to a CNN poll , 57 percent of Americans thought we were already in a recession a month ago .
Economists may complain that this is only because the public is ignorant of the technical – or at least the newspapers ’ standard – definition of a recession , which specifies that there must be at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the GDP .
But most of the public employs the more colloquial definition of a recession , which is hard times .
If hard times have already fallen on a majority of Americans , then “ recession ” does n’t seem to be a very useful term any more .
The economists ’ odd fixation on growth as a measure of economic well - being puts them in a parallel universe of their own .
WorldMoneyWatch ’s website tells us that , for example , that “ The GDP growth rate is the most important indicator of economic health .
If GDP is growing , so will business , jobs and personal income . ”
And the latest issue of US News and World Report advises , “ The key … for America is to keep its economy growing as fast as possible without triggering inflation . ”
But hellooo , we ’ve had brisk growth for the last few years , as the president always likes to remind us , only without those promised increases in personal income , at least not for the middle class .
Growth , some of the economists are conceding in perplexity , has been “ de - coupled ” from mass prosperity .
Growth is not the only economic indicator that has let us down recently .
In the last five years , America ’s briskly rising productivity has been the envy of much of the world .
But at the same time , real wages have actually declined .
It ’s not supposed to be this way , of course .
Economists have long believed that some sort of occult process would intervene and adjust wages upward as people worked harder and more efficiently .
And what about the unemployment rate ?
The old liberal faith was that “ full employment ” would create a workers ’ paradise , with higher wages and enhanced bargaining power for the little guy and gal .
But we ’ve had nearly full employment , or at least an unemployment rate of under five percent , for years now , again , without the predicted gains .
What the old liberals were n’t counting on was a depressed minimum wage , impotent unions , and a witch ’s brew of management strategies to hold wages and salaries down .
Now if those great and solemn economic indicators – growth , productivity and employment rates – have become de-coupled from most people ’s lived experience , then there ’s something wrong with the economists , the economy , or both .
The clue lies in the word “ most . ”
We have become so unequal as a nation that we increasingly occupy two different economies – one for the rich and one for everyone else -- and the latter has been in a recession , if not a depression , for a long , long time .
Not all economists can bring themselves to admit this .
I suspect that America ’s fabulous growth in productivity is another illustration of the disconnect between economic measures and human experience .
It ’s been attributed to better education and technological advances , which would be nice to believe in .
But a revealing 2001 study by McKinsey also credited America ’s productivity growth to “ managerial innovations ” and cited Wal - Mart as a model performer , meaning that we are also looking at fiendish schemes to extract more work for less pay .
Yes , you can generate more output per apparent hour of work by falsifying time records , speeding up assembly lines , doubling workloads , and cutting back on breaks .
Productivity may look good from the top , but at the middle and the bottom it can feel a lot like pain .
When employees are squeezed hard enough , then you have the possibility of a genuine recession as technically defined .
People buy less , so growth declines , to the point where even the economic over - class has to sit up and take notice .
This is happening in Japan , where a recent Wall Street Journal headline announces : “ Growing Reliance on Temps Holds Back Japan ’s Rebound : Firms Increasingly Add Part - Time Workers ; Spending Power Lags . ”
The U.S. , where consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of the economy compared to a little more than half in Japan , is even more vulnerable to a downturn in personal consumption .
What is this fixation on growth anyway ?
As a general rule of biological survival , any creature or entity that depends on perpetual growth is well worth avoiding , lest you be eaten alive .
As Bill McKibben argues in his book Deep Economy , the “ cult of growth ” has led to global warming , ghastly levels of pollution , and diminishing resources .
Tumors grow , at least until they kill their hosts ; economies ought to be sustainable .
Apocalypse aside , the mantra of growth has deceived us for far too long .
What it translates into is :
Do n’t worry about the relative size of your slice , just concentrate on growing the pie !
Now , with a recession threatening even more suffering for those who are already struggling , may be the perfect time to get out the pie-cutter again .
Too bad that the one leading Democratic candidate who promises to do so now appears to be on the ropes .
One popular explanation for the triumph of right - wing economics , familiar to readers of Thomas Frank 's What 's the Matter with Kansas ? , is that cultural issues have obscured pocketbook ones .
Conservatives have tricked the masses into voting on the basis of social issues , thus ignoring their economic self - interest .
It is certainly true that tens of millions of potential Democratic voters support the Republican Party on the basis of its opposition to abortion , gays , and the like .
But the phenomenon of conservative elites using culture and patriotism to win support from the masses is an old one .
Left - wing populism of the kind that Frank and others favor may have failed to take root because of working - class social conservatism .
This does not , however , explain a slightly different question : how and why the economic right has gained so much strength over the last three decades .
After all , by nearly any measure , the American public has grown more socially liberal over this span .
Since 1977 , the proportion of Americans believing gays should be allowed to teach in elementary school has doubled , from 27 to 54 percent .
Those favoring gay adoption has risen from 14 to 49 percent .
Since 1976 , the proportion of Americans who believe women deserve an equal role in business and political life has nearly doubled , from 30 to 57 percent .
The proportion who believe that a woman 's place is in the home has collapsed from 10 to 2 percent .
If the public is not moving right on economics , and if it is not even moving right on social issues , then we cannot explain the rise of right - wing economics by looking at the voters .
We can only understand it by examining Washington .
This book has two parts .
The first half explains how the Republican Party my father admired , the party of social and fiscal responsibility , was transformed into the party of class warfare .
It is an astonishing tale , and it begins in the mid-1970s with the rise of a sect of pseudo - economists known as the supply - siders .
This small cult of fanatical tax - cutters managed , despite having been proven decisively wrong time after time , to get an iron grip on the ideological machinery of the conservative movement .
The supply - siders were not maverick conservative economists , as you might assume ; they were amateurs and cranks , convinced that their outsider status enabled them to reach conclusions that had escaped the scrutiny of professional economists .
The most prominent among them spent their lives advocating a number of patently ludicrous ideas .
( One supply - side guru compared Slobodan Milosevic to Abraham Lincoln .
Another said that American upper -class women " are averse to science and technology and baffled by it . " )
While their other preposterous ideas went nowhere , the equally preposterous notion of supply - side economics took the political system by storm .
Why ?
Because it attracted a powerful constituency : the rich .
An almost theological opposition to taxation quickly took hold within the GOP , opening up the opportunity for business lobbyists to hijack the party 's agenda .
And so they did , as described in chapter 2 .
Far from being ideological fanatics , these were the most coolly calculating men .
Their distinguishing quality was cynicism .
Some of them were flamboyant crooks , like the gangster wannabe Jack Abramoff .
But most were crooks of a more respectable variety - the kind with seven - figure salaries and offices at prestigious law firms .
All of them understood that the destruction of the old Republican ethos of restraint opened up the public coffers to them , and they have availed themselves and their clients of a massive looting of the Treasury .
Their takeover of the Republican Party took years to complete .
The supply - siders and the business lobbyists had two internal obstacles to overcome before they could take full control : the Republican rank - and - file voting base , and the old Republican Washington establishment , both of which still clung to the old ethos of fiscal responsibility and public - mindedness .
To deal with them there arose a new breed of ideological enforcer - propagandists , party organizers , lobbyists , or often ( as in the case of prototypes like Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed ) all of these things at once .
They drove out the old party establishment and created a new party line that fused in a seamless web supply - side ideology with their own financial interests .
There is something distinctly cultlike about their thinking .
Their canon is presumptively infallible , and any apparent failure must instead be seen as an impetus to recommit themselves to doctrinal purity .
Last spring , in an example typical of this thinking , the Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel diagnosed the Republican Party 's ailments thusly : " The base is in the dumps , disenchanted with a party that has lost sight of its economic moorings . "
The solution ?
Tax cuts , and lots of them .
Strassel ran through how all the leading Republican presidential candidates had pledged their fealty to the governing supply - side faith .
Each of them promised to make permanent all of Bush 's tax cuts , but of course this was a given .
The competition was between which candidate would promise even deeper cuts in upper - bracket rates .
As a diagnosis of what ails the Republicans today , this was , of course , insane .
Bush signed a major tax cut each of the first six years of his presidency .
Whatever the GOP 's political liabilities may be , an insufficient commitment to tax - cutting is obviously not among them .
To propose that the road to victory lies in recommitting the party to even more upper - bracket tax cuts requires a detachment from reality that would have been the envy of the Manson gang .
But this is the sort of thinking that now predominates in conservative and Republican circles , and the obeisance of all the leading GOP presidential hopefuls shows just how deeply it has sunk in .

Q&A With Gregory Cochran , Part One
Michael Blowhard writes : Dear Blowhards --
In the commentsfest on a recent Friedrich von Blowhard posting , a certain Gregory Cochran made some sharp and wittily - put points .
I was tickled to see Cochran show up and to read his thoughts because -- in my hyper - amateurish and spotty way -- I 've been aware of him and of his very impressive work for some years now .
Some visitors might not have realized who we were hearing from , though .
A professor at the University of Utah , Cochran is a physicist , an anthropologist , and a genetics researcher and theorist .
He 's well known for his belief that many ailments that we now think of as genetic might well be of pathogenic origin instead .
With Henry Harpending and Jason Hardy , he authored a paper suggesting that the high average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews -- as well as their pattern of genetic diseases -- might be an evolutionary consequence of their history of persecution and their emphasis on jobs involving lots of brainpower .
The paper received extensive coverage in The Economist and The New York Times .
Cochran has worked in defence and aerospace ; he has speculated that homosexuality might be caused by an infection ; he has written a number of articles for the American Conservative scornful of the Bush administration ; and he shows up periodically at Gene Expression .
Cochran is a formidable heterodox intellectual , in other words : not only legendarily smart and fearless , but blessed with a remarkable memory -- he was once a College Bowl contestant .
The Economist called him " a noted scientific iconoclast . "
GNXP 's Razib says of Cochran , " Information technology is a deadly weapon in this man 's hands .
Greg Cochran is a genius , and he's got the ' fuck you ' money to prove it . "
Steve Sailer has written of Cochran : " I stay in touch with some quite smart people , but even among them , Gregory Cochran is legendary for the ferocity of his scientific originality ...
I can attest that , although a physicist by education and the leading theorist of evolutionary medicine by avocation , Cochran also has memorized almost the entire political and military history of the human race ...
When I 'm reviewing a historical film such as ' Master and Commander ' or ' Hero ' and I need to pretend to actually know something about the Age of Nelson or China 's Warring States era , a call to Cochran will not only fill me in on what happened , but , more importantly , why it happened . "
Not irrelevant to all this is the fact that Cochran has been right about Iraq .
He knew Iraq had n't been involved in 9 - 11 , and did n't have the resources to build anything nuclear ; he knew not just that the war would become a mess but precisely which kind of mess ; he saw through the delusions of those who thought we could bring democracy to the mideast ...
It 's eerie how right his predictions have been , and it 's impressive that he arrived at them not from some uninformed political point of view but from a practical , fact - driven , and down - to - earth one .
No one can accuse Gregory Cochran of being a sentimental , knee - jerk leftie , let alone a frisee - munching , Manhattan - dwellin ' metrosexual , that 's for sure .
Cochran looked into the facts , he assessed the facts , and he reached conclusions that have so far proven to be 100 % correct .
Eager to learn more about Cochran 's thinking on current events , I emailed him and asked if he'd be willing to do a q&a with 2 Blowhards about Iraq , the mideast , the Bushies , and foreign policy .
I 'm pleased to report that he agreed .
Here 's Part One of our interview with Gregory Cochran .
*** Q&A With Gregory Cochran , Part One
2 Blowhards :
How'd you get interested in the mideast in the first place ?
Gregory Cochran : I 'm not , really .
I have lived through a fair chunk of relevant history .
Since I 'm a near - grognard , I 've looked fairly closely at some of the wars , particularly the ' 67 and ' 73 Arab - Israeli wars and the Gulf War .
I also followed the Iran - Iraq war pretty closely , and the Russians in Afghanistan .
Naturally I know the role the Middle East played in World War I and II .
I read the papers and I remember most of what I read .
And I 've read two or three general histories about the Arabs and the Ottoman Empire , but there are areas and eras that interest me a lot more .
This means that I know a lot more than the average political player , certainly .
Some naughty reporter was asking various high muckety - mucks if they knew the difference between a Sunni and a Shi'ite , not the deepest piece of information .
Gary Bald , the FBI 's counterterrorism chief , did n't .
Willie Hulon , chief of the bureau 's new national security branch , did n't .
Representative Terry Everett , a seven - term Alabama Republican who was vice chairman of the House intelligence subcommittee on technical and tactical intelligence , did n't .
Representative Jo Ann Davis , a Virginia Republican who headed a House intelligence subcommittee charged with overseeing the C.I.A.'s performance in recruiting Islamic spies and analyzing information , did n't .
Incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Sgt. Silvestre Reyes , D - Texas , did n't .
I 'm pretty sure that George Bush did n't .
2B : What do you make of the other administration higher - ups who are involved in the mideast ?
Cochran : Judging from Wolfowitz 's Congressional testimony about Iraq being secular , highly educated , and free of holy cities , he knew nothing .
I think that Condi Rice started out not knowing a damn thing about the Middle East and I doubt if she knows much more today : I remember her ( back in 2000 ) suggesting that Iran was backing the Taliban , which was just ridiculous -- they 'd come within an inch of war back in 1998 .
Which I had followed at the time , since I read the papers .
Judging from other issues , I 'd say that neither Condi nor Rumsfeld know any history at all .
Some might suggest that all the crap they spouted about guerrilla warfare in postwar Germany was a talking point , but I think they were sincere -- i.e. utterly clueless .
Condi was supposed to be an expert on the Soviet Union , once upon a time , but I doubt if she knew much about that , either .
I knew quite a bit -- Russia was interesting and a real rival -- enough that I was impatiently predicting the end of the Soviet Union by 1990 , to the point of boring all my friends .
I was trying to predict the order in which the SSRs would secede -- I got it mostly right , too .
From everything I read and hear , none of the people running for President are any better .
They know nothing about Iraq or the Middle East .
Mind you , I sympathize , since it's a boring subject , but they really should know what they 're doing .
2B : You have some connections in the military and government , do n't you ?
Cochran : I have n't had much to with anyone very famous .
I have lots of friends in aerospace and in places like Los Alamos and Livermore .
Physicists , mathematicians , engineers mostly , some of whom read widely .
In recent years , some evolutionary biologists , geneticists , and anthropologists .
2B : When did you start to make sense of the current mess ?
Cochran : I knew enough about nuclear weapons development to make my own estimate of what was going on in Iraq .
It was obvious to me that Administration was full of shit back in late 2002 , either lying and / or totally deluded .
2B : How did you know that ?
Cochran : I looked at freely available evidence .
For example , when the Feds started telling us that Iraq was a nuclear menace , I knew that the hardest step in making a bomb is obtaining fissionable materials , and I knew what the four ways of making those fissionable materials were ( breeder reactors , gaseous diffusion plant , centrifuge , calutron ) , their costs and difficulty , and it seemed to me that none of them were possible ( while remaining undetected ) in Iraq , considering sanctions , inspections , aerial recon , negligible local talent , and being stony broke .
Since I read the paper every single day , I knew roughly how much oil Saddam was smuggling out by truck and how big a kickback he was getting on the oil - for - food exports .
A horseback guess said that the whole Iraqi state was running on a billion dollars a year .
Took about fifteen minutes of Googling to determine that .
Not much to pay for an army , secret police , palaces out the wazoo , and an invisible , undetectable Manhattan project .
Which was right on the money , as later laid out in reports by Duelfer and Paul Volcker .
I 'm told that the CIA does n't do this kind of capacity analysis , why , I dunno .
I 've also heard that they had only one guy in the entire agency who knew enough to do the technical - capacity analysis I just mentioned and that he was working on something else .
They do n't have a lot of physicists , partly because they pay peanuts , partly because it 's a hateful place to work where you need a key to go to the bathroom .
Sheesh , they do n't even play " Secret Agent Man " in the elevator .
There were plenty of people at DOE who could have done that kind of capacity analysis -- but the Administration refused to listen to the technical experts .
2B : What do you hear from your friends in the field ?
Cochran :
They tell me that there 's not one political appointee in the government who could do that analysis .
Likely true .
That must always have been the case .
However , the Bush people seem to pay no attention to technical expertise , ever .
They do n't believe in it .
As far as I can tell , their position is that everything ever said by anybody is propaganda .
Projection ?
Ad Hominem rules ok , there is no other argument .
Steve Sailer calls it " marketing - major post- modernism . "
2B : How did your reasoning proceed ?
Cochran :
When I began to hear people claiming that Iraq was a big backer of international terrorism , in particular , anti-American terror , I knew that every single article touching upon this subject in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal over the past twenty years said otherwise .
When I checked later , official US - GOV statements did too , up until late 2001 .
The stories I remembered had Saddam down as the fourth - largest funder of the one of the main Palestinian organizations and , once upon a time , a backer of one of the less memorable factions in Lebanon , nobody you 've ever heard of .
Everything I 'd ever heard said that the Mukhabarat spend most of its time looking to whack Iraqi exiles .
In other words , never a big player in that game , too busy with the Iran - Iraq war in the ' 80s , too broke in the '90s .
Everybody knew that the Baathists had been a spent force , nothing that would attract any young and coming hothead , for at least thirty years .
When I heard people talk about how civilized and secular and educated Iraq was , I started out remembering how they 'd torn the Hashemite royal family to bloody pieces in the streets back in ' 58 .
As I said , not a real middle East aficionado , but that incident is hard to forget .
When Wolfowitz talked about literacy , I looked it up in the online CIA Factbook : 60 % adult illiteracy , worse than any of their neighbors .
When he said they did n't have pesky holy cities as in Saudi Arabia , I thought to myself " Karbala ? " --
I guess I did remember something from those medieval histories .
And of course I noticed when the IAEA inspectors followed up about 30 of our tips and every one came up dry .
I figured our entire case was wrong , a product of fantasy .
Judging from the Israeli occupation of Lebanon , I figured low - level guerrilla resistance in Iraq was more likely than not .
Partly came to that conclusion because of recent examples in the Middle East , partly because of what I 've read of the long - running story of nationalism and anti-colonialism over the last hundred years and more : books like Alistair Horne 's " A Savage War of Peace , " accounts of the Boer War , the Philippine Insurrection , Maximilian in Mexico , Portugal 's endless colonial wars in Africa , and Vietnam of course .
2B : What are some of the reasons so many observers went so wrong ?
Cochran : I think that most people writing about international politics do n't have much useable history .
They keep making the same two analogies ( everything is either Munich or Vietnam ) because they simply do n't know any other history , not that they really know much about Vietnam or WWII either .
I also think that they have zero quantitative knowledge .
Comparisons of Saddam's Iraq and Hitler 's Germany used to bug me , since Germany had the second largest economy in the world and was a real contender , while Iraq had the fortieth largest GNP and did n't have a pot to piss in .
I once assumed people were deliberately lying , but now I think that they simply do n't have any quantitative picture of the world at all .
One , two , three -- many !
In the same way , people who equate the dangers of jihadism with that of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union really do n't know big from small , do n't know anything about the roots of national power .
I think most writers and columnists are innumerate , just like the average American .
Perhaps more so .
If they could count , why the hell would they have gone into opinion writing ?
2B : Is everyone involved in the great game inept ?
Cochran : I think that some of the Washington lifers know what they 're doing , particularly in less - technical areas .
There are plenty of people in DOE -- Los Alamos and Livermore and Sandia -- who know exactly what they 're talking about .
As for the generals , a mixed bag .
Some knew what they were talking about , some were downright dense .
I 'd say that Tommy Franks was effectively stupid .
So was Sanchez , so was Odierno , who is still there as # 2 .
In different ways .
I 'm not sure that any commander we 've tried is what you 'd call smart , in the sense that Sherman , Grant , Nimitz and Spruance were smart .
Since Bush wanted people who " believe in the mission , " it was hard to get good execution , considering that mission is and always was stupid .
2B : Is this a new kind of situation ?
Cochran : I think that once upon a time the service academies were competitive , and picked up some very smart people .
Today , when the Air Force Academy is the 78th - best engineering school in the country , they do n't get the same quality that West Point could before the Civil War , as the best free education in the country .
Today , the average general spends his spare time reading BassMaster Journal , according to Tom Ricks , and that sounds believable to me .
Now I 've been known to read von Manstein 's " Lost Victories " ...
2B : Does the same hold true for the intelligence services ?
Cochran :
They 're not very good but the politicos do n't pay any attention anyhow .
When I say " not very good , " I 'm thinking of Saddam 's invasion of Kuwait , which I foresaw just by reading the paper -- but could the CIA ?
Some years later , the Hindu- nationalist party in India said they 'd run nuclear tests if they won the elections .
They won , I expected tests , and they happened .
The CIA did n't see it coming , though .
I guess they could n't afford a subscription to the Economist .
I also hear that the average CIA " analyst " today has four years experience -- that , for instance , I hear that the young guys specializing in Lebanon have n't heard about Israel 's 1982 invasion .
Let me talk about the broader leadership class in the country , though , opinion - makers as well as decision - makers .
I think the typical member of that class has no idea what he 's doing .
I think that the typical pundit is a cheerleader and no one cares if he does n't know what he 's talking about or if his predictions never come true .
2B : Under what kinds of circumstances does it make sense for you for the US to go to war ?
Cochran :
If someone else started to build up a power that threatened to become overwhelming , such that straight - line extrapolation said they'd be able to run all the shows in the near future , a war that put a spoke in their wheel would be worthwhile .
Particularly if the gathering threat were infamous assholes , as has been known to happen .
Now dealing with some country whose power was expanding solely because of their charm and efficiency -- creeping Swissification -- would raise new and intriguing questions .
If that ever happens , maybe we should just surrender .
That 's the old idea of balance of power : England stuck to it and made it work for centuries , helping stop first Spain , then France , then Germany and finally Russia .
That would mean peripheral wars , as in the Cold War .
2B : That 's an expensive path to take .
Cochran :
You have to think hard about that kind of policy , of course ( which means we will never do a good job ) .
More often than not imperial adventures are money - losers nowadays and do n't actually make the central country stronger .
For example , the Soviets thought that the tide was with them after Vietnam and intervened in Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Angola , Mozambique , etc .
All cost money and none did them a lick of good .
You could make a pretty good case that our losing in Vietnam and electing Carter sucked them into a losing game in the Third World .
Are n't we subtle ?
Anyhow , China might evolve into a second Cold War that , but it has n't yet .
You do n't need a sophisticated ideology to look for that kind of trouble .
Wilhelmine Germany did n't have one .
As for the idea that we face such a threat from the Moslem world , hell , that 's just stupid .
You can't be a threat without being powerful : they 're not and they never will be .
2B : How about in some other cases ?
Cochran :
If someone attacked us , and if it was up to me , I 'd clobber them .
As my Dad said , when they reach out a claw , let them draw back a bloody stump .
So attacking Afghanistan was justifiable -- although if they 'd immediately handed over Osama , there would n't have been much point in it .
And as for the idea that we 're going to " fix " Afghanistan , rather than just flattening the government that pissed us off -- that was a bad idea because we have no idea of how to do it .
We still do n't .
We 'll fail .
Resource wars :
If we were starving , I 'd support stealing food .
Reluctantly .
I would help defend treaty allies -- but I 'd think three times before signing such a treaty .
I would defend other countries , sometimes , depending on how easy it was , their strategic importance , and whether the struggle really had anything to do with us .
Often it does not .
Preemptive wars : almost never .
If a US submarine had stumbled onto the Japanese fleet near Hawaii , on the night of December 6th -- sure , in that situation , fire your torpedoes .
Iraq was n't doing a damn thing .
There was no case at all .
2B : You make some of the same points that the Chomskyan left makes .
In what ways do your views of our military efforts differ from those on the kneejerk left ?
Cochran : I 'm not all that familiar with Chomsky 's political views , although I do know that he has said unsound things about the evolution of language .
If he thinks that we were worse than the Russians in the Cold War , I disagree .
If he thinks that evil rational reasons are at the core of US international policy generally , I also disagree .
I think it 's more stupidity .
I probably know more about current left opinion on the Web : I hear a lot of talk about mercenary motives for the Iraq war and I doubt it .
There are far easier ways to steal , if that 's you want .
I think that they usually have no idea what they 're talking about when it comes to facts .
For example , I still hear people complaining about the US not guarding a particular weapons dump with 380 tons of explosives in Iraq ( Al Qaa - qaa ) , not realizing that we left more like 600,000 tons of explosives and ammunition unguarded .
No quantitative sense , no knowledge of history .
I think they were close to right on Iraq , a totally pointless war , but I think it 's a coincidence .
I think they , like everyone else , have not bothered to acquire the sorts of knowledge that allow to judge whether something made sense or not .
I think that they , like almost everyone else , are more interested in supporting the " side " than the truth .
Although , with Bush , they do n't have to lie .
Who knows , maybe they 'll get in the habit of telling the truth .
I 'm neglecting " war liberals , " a separate category of chuckleheads .
As for the ' kneejerk right ' , at this point I think I 'd bag them and sell them for fertilizer .
2B : Are there any aspects of our current overseas adventure that seem even semi well - conceived and well - executed to you ?
Cochran : No .
The initial phase in Afghanistan was reasonably competent .
That was the last competent thing we did .
Letting Bin Laden escape was rank incompetence .
Deciding to remake Afghanistan was stupid because it was infeasible .
Invading Iraq was stupid , because the current unpleasant situation was the likely outcome .
2B : Why did the Administration think we needed to attack Iraq ?
Cochran :
If the Administration thought that Iraq was really the coming threat ( and they may have ) they were incompetent -- and they worked at being wrong , rejecting every bit of competent advice .
If they really believed that Saddam was a big player in international terrorism , they were stupid .
If they believed that they could easily install a democratic , pro-US , pro-Israel government in Iraq -- one that would somehow diffuse democracy to the countries that actually have produced anti-US terrorists , mainly Saudi Arabia -- they were perhaps the stupidest people who have ever lived .
Iraq is one of the worst candidates for democratization in the world , in terms of education , literacy , political experience and traditions , and dependence upon extractive resources .
Invasion was the worst imaginable approach .
The idea that lack of democracy somehow caused anti-US feelings is incorrect ( note that real dictatorships like Iraq and Syria produced none of the 9 - 11 hijackers ) , and the idea that democracy would be catching is also ludicrous .
Now some think that our real motive was to control Iraq and its oil , also that of the Persian Gulf .
It is n't working .
Colonial ventures like that have n't worked in a long time .
Still stupid , anyway you slice it .
Oh , and then there 's alienating the entire world , another predictable consequence .
The invasion also increased support for Al - Qaeda - style jihadism severalfold , but that is one of the less important effects , since jihadism never had much strategic importance , and three times epsilon is still a small number .
2B : So for you it 's been less about political cynicism and more about ...
Cochran : Personally , I think that the key players in the Administration did believe many of these things .
Looking at what they did rather than what they said -- you have to do that because they 're near - compulsive liars -- it 's clear that they thought they could pull all but a division out of Iraq by September 2003 .
They expected zero resistance and wasted a lot of time denying its existence when it showed up .
Cretins .
Remember when Rumsfeld tried to redefine the insurgency out of existence ?
That 's not Machiavellian -- that 's fucking goofy .
Since they had to be almost supernaturally stupid to invade in the first place , it was certain that they would continue to be stupid , would make mistakes in running the occupation that were barely imaginable .
Because you can repent of being a snake or a weasel but damn foolishness is forever .
So they laid off the entire Iraqi Army and declared all the mid-level Baathists forever unemployable .
It took me 20 seconds to see how dumb that was .
It took the Administration years , thousands of dead and hundreds of billions down the drain .
Some of their defenders have said that the Iraqi Army disbanded itself -- a lie .
They would have shown up on payday , never doubt it .
Iraq has no jobs , outside the state .
It makes the Great Depression look like a fucking walk in the park .
The army policy of treating all Iraqis like enemies -- particularly true of Odierno 's 4th division ( Odierno is the # 2 in Iraq ) -- was counterproductive , not just because it filled up Abu Ghraib .
But we had to do stupid things like that , because that 's the only Army we have .
An Army in which the vast majority of soldiers thought that we were punishing Iraq for 9 - 11 , something that Iraq had nothing to do with .
Of course , one can't really expect the Administration to carefully explain that we invaded for no reason at all .
Then there was the CPA , which we were careful to staff with College Republicans who could n't find a real job -- ones crazed and dumb enough to ' " believe in the mission . "
Shit , why did n't we torture them ?
We even hear the Prez and the head of the Joint Chiefs saying that we have to stay in order to prevent the birth of the Caliphate .
I mean , there is no Caliphate , there 's not a square mile controlled by something resembling the caliphate , there 's no strong underground movement working for it , and it sure looks as if the Arabs are the most fissiparous pinheads who ever walked the Earth .
The countries they do have barely hold together .
But that 's why we have to stay in Iraq forever -- although we may have a new reason by Tuesday .
Maybe we 'll realize that the Yazidis , as worshippers of Lucifer , are our natural allies .

It seems to me that the EU may represent what Dr. Cochran refers to as " creeping Swissification " as they continue their slow but persistent absorption of ever more countries .
Where the US tries to spread democracy and respect for human rights by miltiary force , the Europeans just demand that people stopping being so dashed beastly to each other or they sha n't be allowed to join the club .
Posted by : Ian Gould on September 10 , 2007 8:32 AM
Thanks , Michael .
That was an interesting read .
Unfortunately , underlying the entire interview is a false assumption ... one that I hear a lot among the newly minted intellectual class ...
Cochran believes that IQ ( or intelligence ) should rule the political process .
This has never been the case , and I doubt that it ever will be .
For our technical and professional classes , it just seems obvious that intellect should rule .
Sorry , but they 're wrong , and they will continue to be wrong .
Cochran fairly reeks with this arrogance .
He 's undoubtedly smarter than the rest of us .
And , that 's a whole hell of a lot more irrelevant than he thinks .
In recent weeks , I played at Democratic and Republican political events .
In both cases , the entire agenda delivered to the party faithful was vengeful hatred and the desire to wreak revenge .
Politics , like music , is about our base motives and selves .
I know that it is hard for intellectuals to conceive of this , but the triumph of the intellect is achieved at considerable cost .
You can see this clearly in the childless , bloodless society of the self - interested that Manhattan has become .
Or , to put it another way , blues and country music would never have existed if people like Cochran were our predecessors .
For most of us , the bloody stupid reality of people who think primarily in terms of loyalty to their clan is better than what the arid , empty intellectual communities have become .
I loved playing for those Jerseys suburbanites towing along their children and grandchildren .
They do n't care about intellect .
They care about their children producing grandchildren , reproducing their religious tradition , and reproducing their patriotism .
The computer will take over one day .
I believe Ray Kurzweil 's predictions .
I do n't plan to become a computer , and most people share my outlook .
Cochran does n't like people much .
I like people the way the are .
Give me Homer Simpson over Cochran any day .

Good stuff .
The deliberate neglect of history is pretty systematic in American intellectual life , and I think it goes pretty deep .
It is tied in with a tendency to be indifferent to particular cases and only interested in general rules .
From what I 've read , the disastrous application of economic " shock therapy " to post - USSR Russia was similarly oblivious the Russian particulars and Russian history .
I have n't studied it , but a lot of management and finance training also seems to deal only in high abstractions , while bracketing out all concrete details .
This can be part of the scientific method , of course , but there are pitfalls if you overdo it .
Economics , analytic philosophy , and psychology also seem to tend toward historical blindness .
I think that this is the result of an overemphasis of physics and math models and a neglect of historical and evolutionary models .
One quibble : I think that the intelligence problem in the military is a result of retention and promotion , not the military academies .
When I was researching schools for my son around 1990 , I found that the military academies ranked pretty high in SAT scores .
Right now Annapolis is tied with Oberlin , for example .
When I run into smart military guys , they often seem to have left the service as captains , majors , or colonels .
Posted by : John Emerson on September 10 , 2007 9:03 AM Brilliant ... and depressing .
I would be interested in Cochran 's views regarding the increasing influence of Islam in Europe vis a vis immigration .
Maybe we 'll see that tomorrow .
Posted by : Bob Grier on September 10 , 2007 9:18 AM
Do n't see any brilliance ; what is present , in large quantities , is arrogance and baseless bragging .
He was the only one who foresaw collapse of SU by 1990 ?
Thanks for a good laugh .
He knows the difference between Shia and Sunni and that makes him an expert on Middle East ?
What a big deal this guy makes of himself .
There are no WMD found in Iraq / Oh , really ?
And if knows so much about SU - he would have some idea where the bulk of chemical and biological weapons disappear from Iraq .
He misse his true calling - selling used vacuum cleaners door - to - door ( not cars ... drivers tend not be so easily intimidates as housewifes ) .
Reminds me of the superintendent of my first apartment in Brooklyn , who anounced every 3rd sentence " I 'm smart ! "

I 'm not that smart and I came to all the same conclusions about Iraq pre-invasion that Cochran did .
That 's the thing : you did n't have to be that smart to predict this shit .

" Cochran is a genius , and he's got the ' fuck you ' money to prove it " " Condi was supposed to be an expert on the Soviet Union , once upon a time , but I doubt if she knew much about that , either .
I knew quite a bit ... "
" I was impatiently predicting the end of the Soviet Union by 1990 , to the point of boring all my friends .
I was trying to predict the order in which the SSRs would secede -- I got it mostly right , too . "
" I knew enough about nuclear weapons development to make my own estimate of what was going on in Iraq .
It was obvious to me that Administration was full of shit ... "
" I 'm thinking of Saddam 's invasion of Kuwait , which I foresaw just by reading the paper " " Since I read the paper every single day , I knew roughly how much oil Saddam was smuggling out ... " " ... they were perhaps the stupidest people who have ever lived . "
" It took me 20 seconds to see how dumb that was . " " ... sure looks as if the Arabs are the most fissiparous pinheads who ever walked the Earth "
And there 's more of this to come , Michael ?

I have just begun reading this interesting interview when I came to this sentence :
" When Wolfowitz talked about literacy , I looked it up in the online CIA Factbook : 60 % adult illiteracy , worse than any of their neighbors . "
I Googled the CIA fact book and the following came up for Iraq : Literacy :
definition : age 15 and over can read and write
total population : 74.1 %
male : 84.1 %
female : 64.2 % ( 2000 est. ) as I read Cochran he seems to imply Iraq literacy ( according to the CIA ) of about 40 % while the CIA own numbers claim 74 % .
Perhaps somebody would be kind enough to point out my obtuseness or you can query Cochran about this in part2 .
Posted by : Mark on September 10 , 2007 10:50 AM
How can someone profess to be widely read on politics and history and not read Chomsky ?
Inexcusable .
Not that it stops him from making an inaccurate assumption of Chomsky 's views regarding the morality of state power .
Even better - the Moslem world is not powerful and " they never will be " ?
Why did n't he tell us he is clairvoyant !
Posted by : John Wagner on September 10 , 2007 11:42 AM
Hey , y'all are being the rowdy , brainy , and disputatious bunch I love you for being .
Great fun watching you jump into the debate .
Can I get you to think about one meta - thing , though ?
Completely apart from whether you agree with him or not , it 's a wonderful thing that Cochran did this q&a with us .
He is n't hiding behind handlers , he is n't spinning anything , he is n't holding out for fawning treatment by Big Media .
There 's no career or ego reason for him to be doing this , and god knows he ain't getting paid for it .
Instead , he 's taking the time and making the effort -- hours ' worth -- to talk directly to us .
That 's a hyper - admirable thing .
More people with interesting info and p-o-v 's should make the effort .
And do n't we wish that more Influential Big Deals ( and Cochran is an Influential Big Deal ) had the balls to do so ?
Let 's do what we can to encourage more ( and not less ) of this kind of thing .
So first let 's pause to give him an honest round of applause for effort , directness , lack of putting on airs , and even guts .
Then , on into the fun of debate .
Tks , and ( as always ) enjoying the fray , MB

Methinks Dr. Cochran is thinking a tad short term regarding Afghanistan .
No , democratization in Afghanistan wo n't occur soon .
But that does n't mean it wo n't happen at all .
Establishing a democratic society takes generations .
You need to establish the traditions , the political infrastructure .
Without the foundation democratization is n't going to work .
Witness what happened with Russia .
Think we made a mistake by not providing support to Afghanistan ?
Our lack of substantial support for Russia and other former Soviet states bids fair to give us even more trouble over the next century .
It 's time to start thinking long term and putting forth the effort again .
When you 're the leader of the world , slacking off is n't going to work .

John Wagner ,
In other words , you 're asking how can anybody say he 's widely read on evolution if he has n't read Michael Behe ?

The people who are critical of Cochran here are rather humorous .
He may come across as arrogant in this interview , but everything he says about the Bush administration , Iraq , and jihadism in general is spot on .
Everything he was saying about Iraq in 2002 is identical to the things that my friends and I were saying about Iraq in 2002 .
My friends and I ( who created transhumanism ) were taking bets on when the USSR was going to dissolve by in 1986 , when we were all living in LA .
My friend predicted 2000 .
I predicted 2010 .
Some of my other friends predicted " sometime in the nineties " .
The thing about Cochran is that he is smart .
However , everything he said in this interview did not require a " supergenius " to figure out at the time he figured these things out .
It required some intellect and mostly horse - sense .
If a healthy dose of horse sense and calling a spade a spade is considered " arrogant " today , then our society is in deep doo - doo .
To one of the critical posters here :
Do you honestly believe the vengeful hatred and revenge seeking of the right and left is preferable to self - controlled intellects ?
Which do you think offers more freedom and opportunity to define yourself as you seek to be ?

Nice Q&A , but Shouting Thomas is more thought provoking : " The computer will take over one day .

And then the microchip jihadi will be able to download their Islam virus into our heads ( unless you are wearing a firewall helmet ) .

I 'd like Cochran 's thoughts on the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf as it relates to world oil supplies and the possibilities of disruption ?
Could a major disruption occur , and if it did would it trigger a world depression ?
Is there anything we can do about it in the short - run ?
In other words , do we have anything to worry about in the Middle East , or can we go home and relax ?
Seriously .

Mr. Kellog :
You say
When you 're the leader of the world , slacking off is n't going to work .
Can I enquire , who the heck is this effort supposed to pay off for ?
Given the immense range of possible future threats to the U.S. , and given the immense short - term problems of the U.S. internally ( been reading the paper about the credit market turmoil lately ?
ever heard of the little problem with entitlements that the baby boomer retirement is going to put on steroids ? , etc . ? ) , I 'd love to know by what calculus inculcating democracy in a region that has no democratic tradition , lacks most of the social resources that were taken for granted in Western Europe in 1700 , and is not interested in obtaining them by any obvious measure , qualifies as a sensible investment of our limited resources .
I know our society has been systematically fed 70 years of propoganda that asserts that our self - worth consists of bestriding the world like a colossus , but methinks Americans need to enter a twelve - step program to wean themselves from this expensive and dangerous delusion .

I last checked out that literacy number in 2005 : _then_ the CIA world factbook said this : " Literacy :
definition : age 15 and over can read and write
total population : 40.4 %
male : 55.9 %
female : 24.4 % ( 2003 est. ) "
Posted by : gcochran on September 10 , 2007 12:58 PM
Michael , I think that I did say that it was a great read .
I found Cochran 's insights to be very interesting and , probably , true .
Everybody 's job becomes their viewpoint of what the world ought to focus on , and Cochran is no exception .
Early on in your prefacing remarks , however , things started falling apart for me .
This , I believe is your statement : " ... he knew not just that the war would become a mess but precisely which kind of mess ... "
Can you clue me in on a war that was n't a mess ?
Forty years ago , the anti-Vietnam war movement suggested that it might be a good idea for individuals to cease marching lemming like to the slaughter .
I think that this was an important message at the time .
Over the past few years , I 've begun to think that , as always happens , this lesson was completely over - learned .
At what point does simply rooting for your side because it is your side override all the intellectual sophistication ?
Is there any end to the cult of the individual ?
Or is there a point at which it also becomes an evil ?

Can you clue me in on a war that was n't a mess ?
you 're hiding behind the vagueness of language .
many people ( to some extent i myself ) were hoping this would be gulf war 1990 .
that the conquest of iraq would result in an occupation like germany 1945 or japan 1945 .
it has n't turned out like that at all .
you know what greg is trying to say .
and yes , he did say it back then .
he was leaving enraged comments on blogs in 2002 and early 2003 ( on mine , on randall parker 's , emailing steve sailer ) .
there were others out there of course .
the point is that many of greg 's sneering critics can't say " i was wrong . " nor can they say " someone else was right . " i went to washington d.c. recently and i talked to several people who had a hard time identifying with the Right anymore do the insanity that iraq has wrought .
Posted by : razib on September 10 , 2007 1:13 PM razib , you have a point to make ?
we 're in the mess we are because people did n't think that the shia - sunni difference was something to worry about .
my tax dollars , and yours ( perhaps willingly ) , will go to supporting our 51st state indefinitely because of this .
even if greg is arrogant i doubt most americans would be bothered by this at this point , we 're fed up with excuses , we 're fed up with the arrogance of ignorance , we 're fed up with the religious certitude and the inability to admit error on the part of those who supported the war .
i was wrong , i admit it .
you grow up , you learn .
and some people do n't , and never will .
that 's my point .

Cochran is certainly in true Cochran form here ; taking some basically good points , and then just running with them .
His position on a good many issues seems to be that everyone but him is an idiot , including people who have spent years studying the areas that he just dabbles in .
On this point , I 'm afraid that I must disagree ...

While I agree with Cochran 's general conclusions about Iraq and Washington , and I share his generally isolationist views , some of his " fifteen - minutes - of - Googling " thoughts strike me as a little rushed .
At least , based on my fifteen minutes of Googling .
Here , for example , is a summary of Iraq 's nuclear program , written in 1998 , when George W. Bush was still just the giggling , chimp - eared governor of Texas , by arms - control investigator David Albright and Iraqi defector Khidhir Hamza : http://www.isis-online.org/publications/iraq/act1298.html
It 's generally acknowledged that in 1990 , Iraq was about a year from producing a crude device .
Are Iraq 's resources really so different from those of Pakistan , which has been quite successful with its gas centrifuges ?
Or those of Iran , which held its own for most of the Iran - Iraq war , a decent indication of national wealth and organizing power ?
Granted , Iraq under sanctions was a shithole , and certainly no match for its pre-1990 incarnation .
But the sanctions regime was falling apart .
No one , right or left , imagined it as a permanent solution .
And I have no idea where Cochran gets his " $ 1 billion a year " figure .
Oil - For -Food alone generated $ 50 billion in six years .
Oil smuggling was also widespread , and I somehow doubt that the Iraqi tax rate was zero .
It occurs to me that one feature that has described the entire American response to Iraq , left or right , has been arrogance .
Iraqis are either moronic devils who need to be bombed to smithereens , or moronic , lovable children who just need a hug .
Well , the Iraqi national IQ is what it is .
But Iraq has and had plenty of doctors and lawyers .
No country in the world is genetically homogeneous .
Saddam himself was certainly no fool , and neither were his cronies .
Or the dominant Sunni elite .
I do believe in Cochran 's hypothesis of American governmental idiocy .
Because why , for example , would the US invade Iraq with a promise to discover its evil , incriminating WMD programs ?
There are two possibilities : ( a ) Iraq has evil , incriminating WMD programs .
( b) Iraq does not have evil , incriminating WMD programs .
In case ( b ) , the US invades Iraq and looks like an ass .
And in case ( a ) , why in Allah 's name would the Ba'athists leave their files , factories , and scientists , to be inspected and discovered ?
Do n't they have fires , explosives , and guns in Iraq ?
Even if they had some moral qualms or affectionate attachments , why could n't they ship all of the above to Syria , as many allege they did ?
What could possibly be implausible about this ?
Would the omnipotent CIA have magically discovered it ?
So , in either case , the Ba'ath make America look like a bumbling , bullying ass .
Which they have motive , opportunity , and propensity to do .
And what do the neocons do ?
They pull down their pants , bend over , and say " stick it to me . "
Confirming Cochran 's broad thesis - if not his logic or his Googling .
Posted by : Mencius on September 10 , 2007 3:40 PM
Also , Cochran seems to be laboring under a misapprehension concerning the nature of the threat that most people see in the Jihad .
I do n't know of a single person who believes that the U.S. is going to be challenged by a Muslim superpower in the near future , or invaded by a Jihadist army .
Most worries about the Jihad center around two very real possibilities ;
1 ) That a rogue state such as Iran or a Jihadist Pakistan will provide terrorists with a bomb or bombs , which will be detonated in an American city , killing millions ; and 2 ) The de facto demographic " conquest " of portions of the world through unchecked immigration , and subsequent imposition of Islamic Law .
Niether of these possibilities requires vast technical competence or lots of money ; only manpower , and will , and such worries are not absurd .
I would also like to point out that those " fissiparous pinheads " carved out an empire that reached from Cordova to the gates of Samarkand in a couple of generations , and to dismiss the latent power in the Islamic World is the purest blinkered chauvanism .
Who developed Pakistan 's bomb - Martians ?
And are the Iranians too stupid as well ?
I guess we 'll see .
Cochran is to smart to spout some of the fatuous crap that he comes up with .
Posted by : tschafer on September 10 , 2007 3:49 PM RE : The Arrogance Thing
Geniuses ( and Cochran is a genius ) tend to have low agreeableness .
To do anything really interesting at some point you just have to not give a damn about what other people think .
A little contempt for lesser minds is not always a bad thing .
Get - along - charlies , no matter how smart they may be , tend to just follow along with the prevailing conventional wisdom , and thats not much of a formula for getting things right .
Now , in some situations it is best just to get along , but sometimes it is important to actually get things right , and the Iraq War would seem to be one ot the latter .
BTW Cochran 's attitude , and the reaction to it , kind of reminds me of another fellow at the top of his heap : the famously arrogant literary critic Harold Bloom .
Now , Bloom knows more about literature than anyone out there .
He 's has read way more than any of his detractors and he knows it , and he 's got better taste than any of them and knows that too .
And so he ends up stepping on a lot of peoples toes and a lot of people do n't like it .
Everybody has an opinion , but some people actually know stuff .
While I think that manners and presentation are important , I also think its pretty understandable if someone like Cochran or Bloom gets impatient swatting away all the thousands of petty objections that get thrown up in their faces all the time .
The stupidity of mankind is an endless sea , and at some point , if you want to get anything done , you have to stop being solicitous of everyone 's feelings .

Here , by Iraqi centrifuge man Mahdi Obeidi , is the best postmortem of the Iraqi program I can find , at least with another fifteen minutes of Googling .
As Obeidi writes :
Over the course of the 1990's , most of the scientists from the nuclear program switched to working on civilian projects or in conventional - weapons production , and the idea of building a nuclear bomb became a vague dream from another era .
So , how could the West have made such a mistaken assessment of the nuclear program before the invasion last year ?
Even to those of us who knew better , it 's fairly easy to see how observers got the wrong impression .
First , there was Saddam Hussein 's history .
He had demonstrated his desire for nuclear weapons since the late 1970's , when Iraqi scientists began making progress on a nuclear reactor .
He had used chemical weapons against his own people and against Iran during the 1980's .
After the 1991 war , he had tried to hide his programs in weapons of mass destruction for as long as possible ( he even kept my identity secret from weapons inspectors until 1995 ) .
It would have been hard not to suspect him of trying to develop such weapons again .
[...]
To the end , Saddam Hussein kept alive the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission , staffed by junior scientists involved in research completely unrelated to nuclear weapons , just so he could maintain the illusion in his mind that he had a nuclear program .
Sort of like the emperor with no clothes , he fooled himself into believing he was armed and dangerous .
But unlike that fairy - tale ruler , Saddam Hussein fooled the rest of the world as well .
Was Iraq a potential threat to the United States and the world ?
Threat is always a matter of perception , but our nuclear program could have been reinstituted at the snap of Saddam Hussein 's fingers .
The sanctions and the lucrative oil - for - food program had served as powerful deterrents , but world events - like Iran 's current efforts to step up its nuclear ambitions - might well have changed the situation .
Of course , this does not address anything else Saddam may have been doing .
The whole " WMD " label is BS - what do chemical and biological weapons have in common with nuclear ?
Nothing , except that they 're scary .
But the Iraqi ballistic missile program , which violated the same UN resolutions , continued .
And none of this violates Cochran 's general point .
The invasion of Iraq was a success .
The occupation was not , and since no one involved in the invasion intended it to be either a British - style punitive expedition which destroyed and left , or a full - on 1945 style reconstruction as razib suggests , the whole plan was clearly a mistake .
Moreover , what if Iraq had nuclear weapons ?
Stalin had nuclear weapons , and he was as much of an asshole as Saddam , if not quite as crazy .
The scalable solution is deterrence , not empire .
Similarly , I think Cochran understates the Ba'athist connection to terrorism - Ba'athism was a terrorist movement from day one .
Read any good biography of Saddam , such as Said Aburish's .
But deterrence is a solution to terrorism , as well .
And so is just closing the goddamn borders .
So I am not questioning Cochran 's conclusions .
But , as another isolationist who believes in deterrence , I think it 's important not to overstate the case .
Otherwise you end up just like the lefties .

The countries they do have barely hold together .
Truer words have never been spoken .
Six years ago today , on September 10 , 2001 , any mention of the Arab / Muslim military threat would have provoked laughter and jokes ( " Didja hear about the new tanks designed for Arab armies ?
They have one speed forward and five speeds in reverse ! " )
Well guess what ... it 's still a joke .
Nothing has changed , except for the way America has become a nation of panty piddling cowards .

Thanks for the interview and your comment regarding Iraq literacy and your source .
It seems that the CIA world factbook #'s vary substantially from 05 to 07 .
The 2007 #'s come from a 2000 estimate and the 2005 # 's from a 2003 estimate ( odd ) .
So both you and Wolfowitz can make very different arguments about Iraqi relative literacy and use the CIA " factbook " as the source .
One more real shot of confidence when it comes to CIA data .
Posted by : mark on September 10 , 2007 4:18 PM
Why is the assumption made that tailoring a " solution " to the region has anything to do with real facts ?
Would a military adventure be necessary if the will and traditions of the people in Iraq were considered important ?
The military is used to impose one will upon another .
I do n't think you measure for curtains when you plan on razing the house .
" Anybody could see " , or " from a study of the region " does n't really matter much from this perspective .
I would never make the assumption that the war and its consequences are due to stupidity .
Its often said that you should never attribute to malice that which can be explained by incompetence .
I think you can reverse that in this case .
If you were to study the miltary 's own plans for Iraq , rather than the history of the region or what you read in the paper , you would find out that stoking sectarian violence and dividing the country up into three different sections was the plan from the beginning .
I would also think that the establishment of 6 permanent and huge military bases would also be a tip off that the " dragging out " of the conflict was indeed planned on from the beginning also .
The result seems eerily similar to the former Yugoslavia , does n't it ?
Were n't we involved in that one too , and are there any critical oil pipelines in that area ?
Former Secretary Paul O'Neill said in a 60 minutes piece that it was the obsession of the new Bush administration in winter 2001 to go into Iraq .
WMD is pretty irrelevant when youfind that out -- you see it was just a ( convenient ) lie .
O'Neill also said that there was a list of companies who were compiled who wanted to bid on the oil exploration rights in Iraq at the time as well .
Hmmmm ... interesting !
Also , anybody who thinks that the oil in Iraq , or the region itself ( OPEC has 75 % of all known oil reserves on the planet ) is not central to the question must be loony .
Its not about the price of oil , but control of who gets it and what currency they pay for it in ( and what currency reserves of individual nations are denominated in ) .
I was snookedred in for a while , but I 'm dead set against the War now too .
But the public debate means little .
Its not a war really , because the Congress never declared it .
The public debate should first be to have the representative system restored as per the Constitution , and then what we should do .
None of us was ever consulted on this boondoggle / genocide from the beginning .

Mark , re literacy , maybe Cochran was thinking of this USAID report :
" As a result of two decades of wars and economic hardship brought on by misrule , Iraqi schools fell into disrepair , enrollment dropped , and literacy levels stagnated .
Iraq 's adult literacy rate is now one of the lowest in all Arab countries ; UNESCO estimates literacy rates to be less than 60 percent , or 6 million illiterate Iraqi adults .
Rural residents and women have been hit hardest ; only 37 percent of rural women can read , and 30 percent of Iraqi girls of high school age are enrolled in school compared with 42 percent of boys . "

1 ) yes , their resources are different .
look at the population sizes .
iraq had oil wealth , but it has only about 1/7 pakistan 's pop .
and iran is a more advanced country than iraq , mostly because it is something of a natural country .
2 ) and of course pakistan got help .
and it 's helping saudi arabia now .

" The invasion [ of Iraq ] also increased support for Al - Qaeda - style jihadism severalfold , but that is one of the less important effects , since jihadism never had much strategic importance , and three times epsilon is still a small number . "
Funny , I 'm one of those dummies who does n't know what epsilon is , but I do know that jihadism is a HUGE strategic threat .

Representative Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) was against the war in Iraq for pretty much the same reasons as Cochran .
Holt 's a physicist , by the way .
I disagree w / Cochran that stupidity is the reason for the march into Iraq .
Even reasonably bright people 's emotions can be swayed by events .
Sometimes dumb people are hard to sway
It 's a temperament thing .
Oh yeah , I think Wolfowitz was fucking lying .
He 's far from dumb , and he knew about those sacred cities .
He just thought that when the US installed the Sunni elite - class in power ( the people who had RUN things w/ out RULING them and who were secularized and fairly well - educated ) , the dumb oxen Shia would go along as they always have .
What he did n't seem to realize was that it was like taking a lid off a jar that had been sealed 50 years .

Oil - For -Food alone generated $ 50 billion in six years .
Oil smuggling was also widespread , and I somehow doubt that the Iraqi tax rate was zero .
Cochran 's original prediction is here ( scroll down ) .
The " Volcker committee " that officially investigated the oil - for - food program has a summary of estimates of the total amount Iraq got from oil - for - food and smuggling .
The time period is different for different reports , but it 's about 10 years total - so Saddam got about 1 - 2 billion dollars per year from the whole thing .
Here , for example , is a summary of Iraq 's nuclear program , written in 1998 , when George W.

Confusing , but that just points out the need for a method of judgement that does n't depend on defectors or the reports of intelligence agencies - such as the laws of physics .

Thursday ,
I 'm not saying Cochran and H. Bloom are n't geniuses , but I find it to be the case with the smartest people I know that they are the opposite of arrogant grandstanders -- diffident , rather than arrogant , usually , but also often deeply engaged with their readers or audiences in a way that never smacks of arrogance .
I think of the other Bloom , Allan , and many others for whom being a great teacher not only was n't at odds with being a great genius , but part of it .
And arrogance seldom works as a teaching tool .
The arrogant ones are usually a step down on the ladder from geniuses .
Usually , not always -- and so I repeat , I 'm not saying Cochran 's not a genius .
I suspect he may be .
Though nothing in the interview itself is news , exactly , which is why I suppose the tone grated on some people .

You 're statement below would imply that Chomsky is a marginal figure with a clearly debunkable theory rather than the most - cited living author ( 8th all time ) .

Cochran :
If someone else started to build up a power that threatened to become overwhelming , such that straight - line extrapolation said they'd be able to run all the shows in the near future , a war that put a spoke in their wheel would be worthwhile .
Particularly if the gathering threat were infamous assholes , as has been known to happen . "
This neatly describes Iran , does it not ?
Posted by : DHGPJ on September 10 , 2007 11:16 PM tc , Saddam got about 1 - 2 billion dollars per year from the whole thing .
On oil - for - food : we are talking about Saddam 's revenue , not his " smuggling " revenue .
At least for the purpose of funding a nuclear program , there is absolutely no sense in separating " licit " and " illicit " revenue ( your link refers only to the latter ) .
Which would you rather have , 50 million dollars , or 50 million dollars worth of wheat ?
Unless you get your economics from a different planet than me , your answer will be " either . "
Incidentally , Albright has repudiated Hamza , who is now considered to be a " false " defector who was sent to discredit a previous defector .
First : from the Grauniad , hardly a hotbed of neocon spies , what Albright said about Hamza .
Then there is David Albright , Hamza 's former mentor in the US and himself a former nuclear inspector involved in assessing the scope of Iraq 's nuclear ambitions .
Then there is David Albright , Hamza 's former mentor in the US and himself a former nuclear inspector involved in assessing the scope of Iraq 's nuclear ambitions .
' If Hamza has become a monster , ' he told The Observer last week , ' I partly blame myself .
He had good information on what he knew about , but where we fell out was that I was concerned he was telling me stuff he had read elsewhere , including stuff he could have read in Time magazine .
He was not one of the technical experts on the programme , but I found he was a bright man who picked up things very quickly . '
One of the problems , says Albright , was that Hamza was given access in the US to Iraq 's own declaration of what its nuclear programme comprised .
This was provided in the mid-Nineties after another high - level defector disclosed the scope of the Iraqi programme .
Hamza , says Albright , was recycling this as his own first - hand knowledge .
Second : all we know is that the two men had a falling out .
Why do you assume Albright is right ?
How do you know they 're both not lying ?
Your skepticism strikes me as awfully selective .
Third : the facts in the discussion I linked to are , as far as I 'm aware , basically undisputed .
Everyone agrees that Iraq had an active and reasonably successful nuclear program which was close to device production at the time of the first Gulf War .
Whether it was a year or three years away may not have been clear .
It certainly was n't thirteen years .
Yes .
From the 2002 factbook , population and GDP : Iran 66 m 456 billion , Pakistan 147 m 299 billion , Iraq 24 m 59 billion .
Iraq was known not to have reactors , so that scratches one method .
Centrifuges were the central claim in Powell 's speech , but those turned out to be unsuitable - as the USA 's own centrifuge designers said .
Your link is to a story on the aluminum tubes , which - as we certainly all agree - had nothing to do with centrifuges .
And certainly not with Obeidi's centrifuge design , which was never in mass production .
Are you saying that , because Pakistan has six times as many people , it is six times as able to build centrifuges ?
What , are all 147 million of them on the project ?
Posted by : Mencius on September 10 , 2007 11:42 PM razib : ( a ) see the reply above : ( b ) actually , Pakistan may have had help from the Chinese on device design , but the centrifuge design they stole themselves ( via AQ Khan ) ; ( c ) no one , so far as I 'm aware , disputes that Obeidi had something like a working centrifuge design , whether he invented it himself , or got it from Khan , or whatever .
And ( d ) , I mean , who cares ?
The broad argument is that Iraq and Iraqis are too poor and stupid to build a nuclear device .
And I think this is just plain arrogant .
Smart military thinkers just do n't underestimate their enemies this way , especially when we 've seen plenty of " fissiparous pinheads " - including the Iraqis themselves - solve the problem .
Cochran 's best point is that we have no reason at all to make these pinheads our enemies , or give a rat 's ass what they think or do , unless and until they actually physically attack us .
In which case we should turn them into little puddles of black Iraqi snot .
I agree with this pint I would be very surprised if the Iraqis , or for that matter the Iranians , Pakistanis , etc , built a good nuclear device .
I 'm sure that , simply from the perspective of engineering quality and aesthetics , their work sucks ass .
Which I 'm sure offends the likes of Cochran .
But ya gotta put it in perspective .
This argument that the Iraqis could n't possibly have built or been building nuclear weapons is n't even necessary for Cochran 's main point .
Cochran 's main point is that we have no reason at all to make these pinheads our enemies , or give a rat 's ass what they think or do , unless and until they actually physically attack us .
In which case we should turn them into little puddles of black smoking Iraqi juice .
Which is why they wo n't even consider doing it .
I agree with this point .
I think it 's an excellent point .
I just think he is supporting it in the wrong way , which detracts from rather than adds to the impact of the whole .

And we used that veto , so much so that a lot of the money went unspent .
You can't fund an arms project with money you can only spend on wheat .
I quote : " The Oil - for - Food Programme started in December 1996 , and the first shipments of food arrived in March 1997 .
Some 60 percent of Iraq 's 26 million people were solely dependent on rations from the oil - for - food plan .
The program used an escrow system : oil exported from Iraq was paid for by the recipient into an escrow account possessed until 2001 by BNP Paribas bank , rather than to the Iraqi government .
The money was then apportioned to pay for war reparations to Kuwait and ongoing coalition and United Nations operations within Iraq , with the remainder ( and majority of the revenue ) available to the Iraqi government for use in purchasing regulated items .
The Iraqi government was then permitted to purchase items that were not embargoed under the economic sanctions .
Certain items , such as raw foodstuffs , were expedited for immediate shipment , but requests for most items , including such simple things as pencils and folic acid , were reviewed in a process that typically took about six months before shipment was authorised .
Items deemed to have any potential application in chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons systems development were not available to the regime , regardless of what their stated purpose was . "
About 90 % of Iraqi revenue had been from oil or from tariffs - tariffs on imports paid for with oil .
Other taxes could , at best , cause the government to claim a bigger chunk of internally - produced Iraqi stuff - but there was very little internal production .
Remember , it 's the oil , not the Iraqis .
Components _had_ to be imported .
So revenue from smuggled oil or from kickbacks was key .
Now , how much money did that bring in ?
GAO says 10.1 billion from 1996 to 2002 , mostly oil smuggling .
Duelfer says 10.7 billion , mostly oil smuggling .
That works out to about 1.4 - 1.5 billion a year .
Sanctions were going to last as long as the US wanted them to .
That 's what UN vetoes are for .
And enforcement was easy , with Iraq having only one port .
There was no Iraqi missile program : you 're wrong again .
Paper studies only , by wannabees .
No metal bent , no tests .
We knew from DSP that there had been no launches .
tschafer : " two very real possibilities ;
1 ) That a rogue state such as Iran or a Jihadist Pakistan will provide terrorists with a bomb or bombs , which will be detonated in an American city , killing millions ; and 2 ) The de facto demographic " conquest " of portions of the world through unchecked immigration , and subsequent imposition of Islamic Law . " # 1 is unreal : no one hands out their strategic crown jewels .
# 2 : How 's invading Iraq supposed to affect that ?
Anyhow , if you 're that worried about European demographic decline , go have a baby .
" dismiss the latent power in the Islamic World is the purest blinkered chauvanism " I 'd be happy to dismiss it .
Islam is a zero in science and engineering : this matters .
Look at it this way :
_I_ have a quarter as many patents as all of Pakistan over the past forty years .
" No major invention or discovery has emerged from the Muslim world for well over seven centuries now . " ricpic : " Funny , I 'm one of those dummies who does n't know what epsilon is , but I do know that jihadism is a HUGE strategic threat . "
You 're wrong .
Go watch " Doctor Strangelove " .
Tatyana :
There was no nuclear program in Iraq in 2003 .
We spent a billion dollars finding bupkus .
There were no fissionables , no plants for making fissionables , no construction in progress on plants to make fissionables .

It does not .

Thanks for the interview !
A lot of people seem to be reading a little too deeply between the lines .
The point is not that civilization should be run by wise , high - IQ geniuses .
It 's that it should NOT be run by people who are both indifferent and prescientific .
If we need complicated things done well , and we do , our leaders have to be cautious and let the evidence guide their actions .
That means we do n't let junior appointees rewrite climate science ( such as it is ) , or invade countries willy nilly , or deliberately hide the size of the money supply , etc .

Mencius says : Second : all we know is that the two men had a falling out .
Why do you assume Albright is right ?
How do you know they 're both not lying ?
Your skepticism strikes me as awfully selective .
With hindsight it 's clear who was lying - but you 're right , if there were no other sources of information , I 'd have no reason to choose one side over the other .
But as Cochran points out , we do have other ways of knowing : there are only a few ways in which to make fissile material , and strong reasons to believe that Iraq under sanctions was not capable of performing them ( at least not without being seen ) .
The calutron method which Iraq used before the Gulf War was low - tech , but would have used up enormous amounts of electricity - enough to be detectable .
And something you said earlier :
And in case ( a ) , why in Allah 's name would the Ba'athists leave their files , factories , and scientists , to be inspected and discovered ?
Do n't they have fires , explosives , and guns in Iraq ?
Even if they had some moral qualms or affectionate attachments , why could n't they ship all of the above to Syria , as many allege they did ?
What could possibly be implausible about this ?
Would the omnipotent CIA have magically discovered it ?
The CIA is certainly not magically good at finding things out , but neither would Saddam and company be magically good at hiding or moving things .
When people say things like " they could have moved it all to Syria without leaving a trace " that strikes me as giving in to conspiracy theorizing - I do n't believe it 's possible to completely get rid of something that employed hundreds or thousands of people , or to pack up all equipment and traces of physical evidence , etc in a few days or weeks .
Most of the wanted people on the " deck of cards " have been captured , including " Mrs. Anthrax " and " Dr. Germ " , and then some have been simply released - because there was nothing to find out .

I was of course arguing that the specific country of Iraq , with its specific resources , in those specific circumstances , could n't have built an invisible , undetectable Manhattan project .
Not only were they broke as hell and virtually devoid of local productive capacity , but their human resources were , shall we say , bounded .
Iraqis on average have low IQ scores .
Those that are literate at all have , on average , low levels of education .
And the effective population Saddam could recruit from was far lower than it might appear , since the Kurds were effectively independent during all this time , while the Shi'ites were either restive or in active revolt .
I doubt if he would have wanted any on such a project .

" If someone else started to build up a power that threatened to become overwhelming , such that straight - line extrapolation said they'd be able to run all the shows in the near future , a war that put a spoke in their wheel would be worthwhile .
Particularly if the gathering threat were infamous assholes , as has been known to happen . "
This neatly describes Iran , does it not ?
Iran does not threaten to become " overwhelming " .
Iran threatens to become a dominant regional power at worst .
Wars to put spokes in wheels have traditionally been proxy wars whenever possible , e.g. Afghanistan vs. the USSR and Iraq vs. Iran .
Direct attack is the last choice .
One of the dispiriting things about this whole debate has been the attempt to elevate the Islamic threat to the level of the Nazi or Soviet threat .
The Islamists have only two cards in their hand : a pool of kamikazes , and a location near the oilfields .
They 're not even unified , and except probably for Pakistan , no one nation or group is much more threatening than Taiwan or the Czech Republic .
( Hyperbole , I suppose , but not by a lot ) .
And on top of that , Saddam was a secularist .

Well - documented .
He did n't import the gassing agents , he produced them .
Nuclear facility : to wait till actual facilities will be built would be an unforgiveable negligence and a height of stupidity .
With threatening dictator like Saddam it is enough that he had an ability and intent to supply nuclear threat .
He had to be stopped before it was too late .
As to everything else - if you 're such an expert on Russia ( with excellent source of expertise being newspaper articles ) , you should have better ideas where the documents , equiipment and other physical evidence disappeared from Iraq in ample time our too - trusting military and State department gave Russian " diplomats " at the time of campaign .

I am sure you are a smart guy , but I think you are dismissing tschafer 's two threats way too casually .
Nobody thinks it will be * easy * for Islamists to get their hands on a nuclear bomb .
But there is a great deal of nuclear material in the world , and a great many corrupt people .
I 'm sorry , but I do n't respect your intellect enough to accept your assurance -- ex cathedra -- that the risk is trivial .
A single game of Russian roulette has a fairly low risk too , but that is n't much comfort if you are being forced to look down the barrel .
As for the demographic threat , which would play out over the next 50 years or so , I would love to given a convincing reason to dismiss it .
But you just totally blew it off ?
" Go have a baby " ?
What kind of answer is that ?
Posted by : JohnB on September 11 , 2007 12:08 PM tc : But as Cochran points out , we do have other ways of knowing : there are only a few ways in which to make fissile material , and strong reasons to believe that Iraq under sanctions was not capable of performing them ( at least not without being seen ) .
First , I think you 're overstating the word " strong . "
As we 've seen , Iraq had plenty of both things you need for a nuclear project : scientists and revenue .
As the missile program shows , it also had plenty of channels for smuggling .
Those aluminum tubes were rocket tubes , not centrifuge tubes , but they were n't bought through the UN , either .
Second , one of the problems with this discussion is that everyone on the planet has gotten into the habit of confusing the real reason the Pentagon decided to invade Iraq , and the official reason the Pentagon decided to invade Iraq .
There was at least a plausible case to be made for both , but they should n't be confused .
The official reason the Pentagon decided to invade Iraq is that the Ba'athist regime was in long - term , continuous violation of sixteen UN resolutions .
For example , the fact that he had expelled weapons inspectors , even if he had no prohibited weapons projects - as he clearly wanted the world to think - was the precise equivalent of pointing a toy gun at a cop .
In hindsight , it 's very easy to say that the cop should have noticed that the device pointed at him was a Super Soaker , and the homeless guy behind it was too drunk to aim straight .
But it 's basically a Johnnie Cochran - class argument .
If you do n't want a sucking chest wound , do n't go around pointing large black things at cops .
( Note : I am not defending the proposition that the US should be the world 's policeman , I 'm just noting that it has been acting as such . )
The actual reason that the Pentagon decided to invade Iraq was that the sanctions regime was clearly not a viable long - term solution .
It was leaky and falling apart .
Did you notice how every unscrupulous leftist in the world , in 2002 and 2003 , spun around in the wind and decided that the baby - killing sanctions were actually the best thing since sliced bread ?
And at least if you believe Obeidi , Saddam certainly intended to reactivate his centrifuge program after the end of sanctions , which he certainly had good reason to expect in the medium term .
They were never popular in Europe .
The CIA is certainly not magically good at finding things out , but neither would Saddam and company be magically good at hiding or moving things .
Magic is not required .
Only competence .
Which I would be surprised to find in either the CIA or Saddam and company , quite frankly - but probably more surprised in the case of the former .
And you missed a third option : destroying things .
Saddam was certainly good at that .
Burned files , blown - up buildings and dead scientists tell no tales whatsoever .
gcochran :
Not only were they broke as hell and virtually devoid of local productive capacity , but their human resources were , shall we say , bounded .
Iraqis on average have low IQ scores .
Those that are literate at all have , on average , low levels of education .
A nuclear program is n't an Egyptian pyramid .
It is not built by 47 million average Iraqis .
It is built by tens of thousands of non-average Iraqis .
And only a couple hundred of those have to be very bright or competent .
Furthermore , whatever the bell curve might tell you about the number of 130 +
IQs in Iraq , it 's probably wrong .
The use of national IQ statistics , while certainly relevant in many ways , tends to hide the fact that national genetic homogeneity is a myth , especially in a migrational truck - stop like Iraq .
I suspect that the Iraqi aristocratic class ( largely the Sunni elite ) is about as smart as any set of patricians anywhere .
Iraq certainly has a very high plebeian - to - patrician ratio , but this has nothing to do with their ability to generate the brains needed for a nuclear program .
Which , as we 've seen , in the ' 80s and '90s they did .
There 's no question that after the Gulf War , Iraq was a shambles of its former self .
There 's no question that this knowledge should have been better appreciated in the Pentagon .
Given the stupid game - theory example I gave above , clearly if the Pentagon had an ounce of brains on its shoulders it would have not invaded Iraq while promising to find a Manhattan Project , because any country competent enough to build a Manhattan Project is competent enough to destroy it .
However , I still think that describing anyone who thought it was possible that Saddam was enriching uranium as a fool or a knave is overdoing it .
I suppose in the end this is simply a matter of opinion , though .
John Emerson : Saddam was a secularist .
Yeah , I suppose that 's why he added a Koranic verse in his own handwriting to the Iraqi flag .
Geeze , man , do you believe everything you read in the New York Times ?
Saddam did n't give a rat 's ass about anything besides money and power , preferably the latter .
I really really recommend the Said Aburish biography .
Posted by : Mencius on September 11 , 2007 12:31 PM
Mencius , Saddam 's Iraq was a secular state where the Muslim clergy had little institutional power .
Contrast Iran and Saudi Arabia .
The US is a secular state even with " In God We Trust " on the coins and " under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance .
I did n't say that Saddam was a nice guy .
One of the advantages we have is that the Islamic world has far too much leadership .
No matter how you slice it ( secular , Shi'a , Sunni , Iraqi , Egyptian ) you have schisms .
Neither the Iraqi Sunni nor the Iraqi Sh'ia are united , and if they were they would n't necessarily work well with the Saudi Sunni or the Iranian Sh'ia .
The contrast between Chinese and Muslim history is pretty striking .
China has been unified about half of the last 2000 years , and most periods of disunity have been North - South divisions caused partly by non-Chinese conquest of the North .
The few periods of serious fragmentation have been transitional .

Tatyana : " First , WMD includes chemical and biological weapons . "
Prior to the runup to the Iraq war , I had never heard the Weapons of Mass Destruction phrase .
The phrase itself mixes together very unlike things , and hence is an impediment to clear thinking .
It should be obvious that nuclear , chemical and biological weapons are not at all alike .
Of the three , only nuclear weapons are very dangerous .
Chemical and biological weapons have never been much use to anyone .
Simple things like rain and sunshine tend to destroy most of them , and they are hard to deploy effectively .
There are good reasons that have n't seen much use in warfare .
The worst case scenarios for hostile use of chemical weapons are several orders of magnitude less deadly than a nuclear bomb .
Suspicion of arguments that employ phrases that obfuscate more than they illuminate is always justified .
[ The next - worse offender after WMD is IP ( Intellectual Property ) . ]
Posted by : Jeff on September 11 , 2007 1:43 PM
Oh , it 's not a matter of opinion , Mencius Iraq produces almost nothing locally , has almot zero _ability_ to produce locally , therefore had to buy parts and materials from elsewhere .
Those parts , previously freely available in many cases , had become very much more difficult to buy under sanctions .
And Iraq had far less foreign exchange with which to buy such things than previously .
Any nuclear project had become much more difficult , because it was necessary that it be undetectable to American national technical means .
As for the idea that money in an oil - for - food account could be used to support an arms program ?
How ?
You ca n't just say ' econ 01 '
or ' fungibility ' , you have to look at the details .
One can imagine that food imports might have eventually freed up agricultural labor for use in underground factories making calutrons or centrifuges - but that would have taken years .
Moreover , you would first have had to educate those workers - sub - high school education is n't enough .
Then there are the security clearance questions : Saddam could n't have hired anyone who might have talked , which leaves out 80 % of the population of Iraq , minimum .
And as for the idea that there 's a pool of smart people in Iraq - or Syria or Jordan or Egypt - the distribution of H1B visas sure does not support that idea .
_ Nothing_ supports that idea .
And of course _no_ country could hide the remains of a Manhattan project when under occupation , anymore than Germany was able to hide any of their projects after they lost the war .
_ One_ person willing to give physically verifiable testimony in return for a green card and a house in the Arlington suburbs would have blown the whole story .
One person , and there would have been thousands in any real project .
It was obvious by June 2003 ( a " slam - dunk " ) that no such person existed - and that there was no story to tell .
This was obvious to me but it surely was n't obvious to you .
As for the Pentagon deciding to invade Iraq , certainly the Joint Chiefs , most of them , never thought it made any sense .
Bush decided to invade Iraq , not the Pentagon , as an example of that deep strategic thought for which he is so famous .
Posted by : gcochran on September 11 , 2007 1:55 PM
Jeff ,
You very well might nover heard of the term , that does n't mean it did n't exist , nor the phenomenon it describes .
I know some smirk at Wiki , but it 's the closest to the top in a quick googling ( and my lunch is coming to the end ) , but even there the article gives it good 50 years ' life .
Nobody argues that chemical / biological weapons are as or more effective as nuclear in terms of number of lost lives .
They still remain deadly enough to kill hundredds of thousands pretty quickly - ask the Kurds in Iraq .
Posted by : Tatyana on September 11 , 2007 2:37 PM
H1B visas ?
Now , that 's a strange dataset .
You do n't think there are maybe one or two confounding variables ?
Iraq had an open smuggling path through Iran for just about anything .
Whatever it bought through oil - for - food it could sell .
But besides this , basically : Iraq 's only major revenue stream came from oil before 1990 , after 1990 , after 1996 , and ( except for Uncle Sam ) now .
The only change in the OFP era is that its balance of trade was centrally planned , quite ineffectively , by the UN , whose main purpose was to earn a cut .
If it had the brains and dollars to run a nuclear program before 1990 , why not after 1990 ?
Again , I encourage you to read a little more about Iraq .
It was once considered the Germany of the Arab world , it had a substantial educated middle class , and it defeated Iran in a quite nontrivial war .
Have you ever heard of Mutanabbi Street , for example ?
Where is the Mutanabbi Street of Angola , Bangladesh or the Congo ?
What community do you think bloggers like Riverbend came from ?
How do you think Iraq ended up with physicists such as Hamza , Shahristani , Obeidi , Khadduri , etc , etc ?
Sure , none of these guys is a Fermi or a Feynman .
They did n't have to be .
As for persons willing to testify : you do n't think Saddam knew how to kill people ?
Same goes for your 80 % figure .
Nuclear physics , whatever .
We 're talking core competence here .
Baghdad under Saddam was basically the Los Alamos of murder and intimidation .
Again , read some stuff about Saddam .

John ,
The problem is that when people say " Iraq was a secular state , " typically what they mean is that the Ba'athists had been reading Dawkins and would never have worked with those nasty Islamic nutcases , or vice versa .
To say this has no relationship to the reality of Iraq , or of any of today 's Islamic movements , is putting it mildly .
They are all part of the Frantz Fanon third - world gangster complex .
Ideological details are entirely irrelevant and easily take a back seat to expediency .
It 's like saying there 's no way the Mafia could have collaborated with Murder Inc , because the Mafia are Catholics and Murder Inc were Jews , and the Jews killed Christ .
Saddam was a little late getting on the Islam train , but he was certainly figuring it out .
" Arab unity " - a la UAR - the original basis of the Ba'ath ideology - was definitely last year 's flavor .
Posted by : Mencius on September 11 , 2007 3:54 PM
There is no Arab Germany .
There 's not even an Arab Belgium .
And I know a lot about the Iran - Iraq war - a war in which Saddam , with a near - monopoly of modern battle tanks , decided that the best course was to _bury_ them and use them as an inferior substitute for pillboxes .
A war of blunder and counter - blunder - particularly inexcusable since all the relevant lessons had already been learned in the world wars .
This is silly - I 'm supposed to think that Iran was going to allow nuclear imports into Iraq ?
That never happened .
Enough already : you do n't know what you 're talking about and you do n't care to think it through .

Jesus , Mencius , you say smart things sometimes , but not this time .
What you said points directly back to the second half of the same statement you 're responding to .
Saddam , Qaddafi , Prince Bandar , Musharraf , Assad , Osama , and the others are all thuggish guys , but none of them is willing to be subordinated to any of the others , and they can be set against one another .
The Pan -Islamic and Pan-Arabic movements have all flopped .
In your words , it 's a complex , not a state or an organization .
Usually when people conjure up nightmares , they 're talking about unified Islam .
Saddam certainly was an impediment to unified Islam , and he would have been even if he had become an Islamist .
But he did n't .
The only card you really have left to play is an Islamic nuclear bomb .
That 's certainly something to think about , but I tend to accept Cochrane 's judgment over yours , especially in thinking that they key factor is the ex-USSR 's stocks of fissionable material .

Gangsters always have a lot of trouble working together .
It 's hard to establish any kind of trust .
The same could be said for the Soviet bloc - just because you 're a Communist and I'm a Communist does n't mean we 're not trying to kill each other .
My point is that when people say " Saddam was a secularist , " what they mean is that he and al - Qaeda were sworn eternal enemies , like the Pope and the Elders of Zion .
Which just ai n't so .

BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA — Monday , November 19 , 2007 — The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today published the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ( GNU AGPLv3 ) .
This is a new license ; it is based on version 3 of the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPLv3 ) , but has an additional term to allow users who interact with the licensed software over a network to receive the source for that program .
By publishing this license , the FSF aims to foster user and development communities around network - oriented free software .
The GNU GPL allows people to modify the software they receive , and share those modified versions with others , as long as they make source available to the recipients when they do so .
However , a user can modify the software and run the modified version on a network server without releasing it .
Since use of the server does not imply that people can download a copy of the program , this means the modifications may never be released .
Many programmers choose to use the GNU GPL to cultivate community development ; if many of the modifications developed by the programs ' users are never released , this can be discouraging for them .
The GNU AGPL addresses their concerns .
The FSF recommends that people consider using the GNU AGPL for any software which will commonly be run over a network .
Both GPLv3 and the GNU AGPL allow developers working on a project under one license to combine it with code released under the other .
As a result , programmers who want to use the GNU AGPL for their own work can take advantage of the many libraries and other source files available under GPLv3 .
Developers working on GPLv3 - covered projects will often be able to use modules under the GNU AGPL with minimal hassle as well , since the GNU AGPL 's additional term has no requirements for software that does n't interact with users over a network .
FSF board member Benjamin Mako Hill said , “ The GNU GPL has been the most successful free software license because it makes a program 's source available to its users .
This enables massive collaboration between developers , since everyone gets the same benefits from this rule .
The GNU AGPL will enable the same kind of cooperation around web services and other networked software . ”
A first draft of the GNU AGPL was published on June 5 , and a second draft on August 14 .
The FSF heard comments on both through its web - based feedback system .
“ The GNU AGPL is very much a community license , ” said Peter Brown , executive director of the FSF .
“ The feedback we received while working on GPLv3 demonstrated a clear desire for this sort of license .
And thanks to the community 's help during the drafting , we 're happy that the GNU AGPL meets those needs . ”
The final license is published at http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html.

“ Give me half a tanker of iron , and I ’ll give you an ice age ” may rank as the catchiest line ever uttered by a biogeochemist .
The man responsible was the late John Martin , former director of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory , who discovered that sprinkling iron dust in the right ocean waters could trigger plankton blooms the size of a small city .
In turn , the billions of cells produced might absorb enough heat - trapping carbon dioxide to cool the Earth ’s warming atmosphere .
Never mind that Martin was only half serious when he made the remark ( in his “ best Dr. Strangelove accent , ” he later recalled ) at an informal seminar at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) in 1988 .
With global warming already a looming problem , others were inclined to take him seriously .
At the time , ice - core records suggested that during past glacial periods , natural iron fertilization had repeatedly drawn as much as 60 billion tons of carbon out of the atmosphere .
Laboratory experiments suggested that every ton of iron added to the ocean could remove 30,000 to 110,000 tons of carbon from the air .
Early climate models hinted that intentional iron fertilization across the entire Southern Ocean could erase 1 to 2 billion tons of carbon emissions each year — 10 to 25 percent of the world ’s annual total .
Since 1993 , 12 small - scale ocean experiments have shown that iron additions do indeed draw carbon into the ocean — though perhaps less efficiently or permanently than first thought .
Scientists at the time agreed that disturbing the bottom rung of the marine food chain carried risks .
Twenty years on , Martin ’s line is still viewed alternately as a boast or a quip ; an opportunity too good to pass up or a misguided remedy doomed to backfire .
Yet over the same period , unrelenting increases in carbon emissions and mounting evidence of climate change have taken the debate beyond academic circles and into the free market .
Today , policymakers , investors , economists , environmentalists , and lawyers are taking notice of the idea .
A handful of companies are planning a new round of larger experiments .
The absence of clear regulations for either conducting experiments at sea or trading the results in “ carbon offset ” markets complicates the picture .
But economists conclude that the planet ’s growing urgency to solve its emissions problem will reward anyone who can make iron fertilization work .
In past experiments “ we were trying to answer the question , ‘ how does the world work ? ’— not ‘ how do we make the world work for us ? ’ ” Kenneth Coale , the present - day director of Moss Landing Marine Lab , said recently .
“ They ’re totally separate .
We have not done the experiment to address the issues that we ’re talking about today . ”
“ We ’re in a learning process that involves a balance of science , commercial , and a whole variety of social activities and interests , ” Anthony Michaels , director of the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Southern California , said .
“ We ’ve got to set up a measured process for moving forward . ”
The two scientists were speaking at a fall 2007 conference that brought together some 80 participants representing the scientific , commercial , regulatory , and economic sides of the debate .
The conference was convened by WHOI marine geochemists Ken Buesseler and Scott Doney , and Hauke Kite - Powell of the WHOI Marine Policy Center .
In talks and wide - ranging discussions , participants raised serious doubts about the practicality , efficacy , and safety of large - scale iron fertilization .
Yet many also seemed to accept that more science — in the form of carefully designed and conducted experiments — was the best way to put those doubts to rest .
Not as simple as it sounds
Martin made his pronouncement jokingly because he knew that he was glossing over several hindrances to using iron fertilization to sequester carbon in the ocean .
Opponents to the idea are quick to point out the three major ones :
It may be less efficient than it at first seems ; it raises a host of new , worrying consequences ; and its effectiveness is difficult for anyone to measure .
In certain regions , including the equatorial and north Pacific and the entire Southern Ocean , a simple iron addition does cause phytoplankton to grow rapidly .
But tiny zooplankton , known as “ grazers , ” eat much of the bloom almost as soon as it starts .
This begins a chain of recycling that ensues from the sea surface to the seafloor as grazers , krill , fish , whales , and decomposers feed upon each other .
Much of the immense carbon prize won by the iron addition quickly leaks back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas .
What is critical for the effectiveness of iron fertilization schemes is the amount of organic carbon that actually sinks from the surface and is sequestered in the depths .
Only a small percentage of carbon — in the form of dead cells and fecal pellets — falls to the seafloor and stays there , unused , for millennia .
A higher percentage ( between 20 and 50 percent ) will at least reach middle - depth waters , where the carbon will remain in underwater currents for decades .
Proponents consider this result good enough to buy society time to come up with other , more permanent solutions to greenhouse gas increases .
Beyond the inefficiency of carbon sequestration , iron fertilization would likely cause other changes “ downstream ” of the ocean patches where iron was added .
The huge green phytoplankton blooms would take up not just iron but other nutrients , too — nitrate , phosphate , and silica — essentially depleting nearby waters of the building blocks needed for plankton growth .
“ You might make some of the ocean greener by iron enrichment , but you ’re going to make a lot of the ocean bluer , ” said Robert Anderson , senior scholar at Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
Other participants at the WHOI conference — John Cullen , a biological oceanographer at Dalhousie University in Canada , Andrew Watson , a biogeochemist at the University of East Anglia , U.K. , and Jorge Sarmiento , a modeler at Princeton ’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory — pointed out several other ecological concerns .
Large - scale iron fertilization , in altering the base of the food chain , might lead to undesirable changes in fish stocks and whale populations .
Increased decomposition of sinking organic matter could deprive deep waters of oxygen or produce other greenhouse gases more potent than carbon dioxide , such as nitrous oxide and methane .
The plankton - choked surface waters could block sunlight needed by deeper corals , or warm the surface layer and change circulation patterns .
On the other hand , more plankton might produce more of a chemical called dimethylsulfide , which can drift into the atmosphere and encourage cloud formation , thus cooling the atmosphere and helping to counteract greenhouse warming .
And others argue that increased plankton supplies might enhance fish stocks .
Then there is the practical problem of verification .
Iron fertilization companies would earn profits by measuring how much carbon they sequester and then selling the equivalent to companies ( or people ) that either wish to or are required to offset their emissions .
Any plan to sell sequestered carbon requires a reliable accounting , and this promises to be difficult in the ocean .
So far , only three of 12 iron addition experiments have been able to show conclusively that any sequestration happened at all , according to Philip Boyd of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research .
Perhaps more worrying to an investor , those sequestration numbers were low — about 1,000 tons of carbon per ton of iron added , as opposed to the 30,000 to 110,000 suggested by laboratory experiments .
Carefully designed research
Despite the suspected drawbacks to full - scale iron fertilization , private companies — and many scientists — support the idea of another round of experiments .
Learning more about the ocean is in everyone ’s interest , they argue , and the larger experiments now being proposed are still far too small to wreak environmental havoc .
While the past experiments showed widely variable results , proponents read this as an opportunity for refinement through engineering .
For millennia , humans have been repeating processes that at first were marginally useful and tuning them to our purposes .
Continued research could address a number of key questions ( see box below ) , and those answers could point the way to higher yields and efficiency .
Proponents of iron addition do acknowledge the possibility of environmental ill - effects .
Still , no such effects have been detected during the past 12 experiments , probably because the experiments were small — around a ton of iron added over a few hundred square kilometers of ocean .
By incrementally scaling up , they believe they can detect and avoid environmental problems .
As for the verification problem , both carbon markets and international ocean law are moving to accommodate so - called “ carbon sink ” projects , such as iron fertilization , which capture and sequester carbon from the air , according to Till Neeff of EcoSecurities , a leading trader of carbon credits , based in London .
By the time the science is worked out , he said , the economics may be worked out as well .
Anchoring all of the arguments for continued research is the brutal fact of global carbon emissions .
The most practical hope for dealing with emissions at the moment lies in a piecemeal strategy of “ stabilization wedges . ”
Under this proposal , the world develops a portfolio of emissions reductions and carbon - capture projects , each of which offsets one piece of the global emissions pie .
Combined , these wedges must begin to slow the growth of , and eventually lead to a net reduction in , our current global emissions of 7 to 8 billion tons of carbon per year .
But with minimal progress so far on any wedges , and with China and India committing to major emissions increases as they develop , iron fertilization beckons as one tool in a toolbox of partial solutions .
“ No option is without its impacts , ” said WHOI biogeochemist Ken Buesseler , “ whether we use wind turbines , grow biofuels or use energy - saving fluorescent bulbs , which contain mercury . ”
But is it legal ?
At present , iron fertilization falls into a gray area in both international law and formal carbon - trading markets , but this is changing .
Iron fertilization would happen on the open ocean , which is not owned by any country , according to David Freestone , senior adviser in the Legal Office of the World Bank , who briefed the symposium participants .
While international treaties such as the London Convention , which governs ocean dumping and pollution , might address iron addition , treaty nations have not yet decided whether it might constitute pollution because its possible side effects remain unknown .
Further , no overarching international agency exists to enforce the treaty , so responsibility falls to individual nations , he said .
Ship crews intending to flout an international treaty could do so by electing to fly the flag of a country that has not signed it — a route that has already been publicly considered by one company .
Carbon trading markets are young but growing , Neeff said .
Strictly regulated markets , set in motion by the Kyoto Protocol treaty , last year traded 430 million tons of carbon offsets ( worth billions of dollars ) among companies required to reduce total emissions .
( One ton of carbon equals 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide . )
Regulatory markets do n’t allow for iron fertilization at present , but this may change as more carbon sink projects gain approval .
Then there are voluntary markets , Neeff said , where concerned individuals or companies buy carbon offsets to assuage their conscience or green their image .
Traders would be free to sell offsets from iron fertilization in these markets .
Voluntary markets are growing rapidly , Neeff said , but so far they are much smaller than regulatory markets , equivalent to 7 million tons of carbon , worth about $ 400 million , per year .
Voluntary markets represent one more worry for opponents of iron fertilization .
Iron fertilization companies might make superficial estimates of the amount of carbon they sequester and enter a hefty balance in their trading ledgers .
Any large profits made from under - regulated credits would encourage other outfits to go into business .
The collective impacts to the world ’s international waters could be both disastrous and impossible to trace to any single liable party , Cullen said .
But those are future scenarios .
By the time iron fertilization moves from experiment to industry , laws may well be in place to regulate it , said Kite - Powell .
Over the same period , increasing demand for carbon offsets is likely to ensure that iron fertilization is profitable , he said , referring to a recent economic analysis indicating a potential value of $ 100 billion over the next century .
Next steps : scientists and industry
Iron fertilization is being pulled in two directions , as comments during a panel discussion at the conference made clear .
Iron fertilization is not a silver bullet , said Margaret Leinen , the chief science officer at the firm Climos and former assistant director of geosciences at the National Science Foundation .
But given the enormity of the greenhouse gas problem and the lack of progress so far , “ let ’s look at it in our portfolio for mitigation , ” she said .
“ Uncertainty about the impacts should n’t preclude careful research . ”
Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense Council took a different view : “ There is a limited amount of money , of time , that we have to deal with this problem , ” she said .
“ The worst possible thing we could do for climate change technologies would be to invest in something that does n’t work and that has big impacts that we do n’t anticipate . ”
Between these viewpoints a middle ground emerged : “ There are plenty of ways to do it wrong , but done right , [ iron fertilization ] does actually sequester carbon for hundreds of years in the place that it would ultimately end up anyway , ” Watson said .
That may be a tremendous advantage compared with more familiar but less secure approaches like planting trees , he said .
Skeptics should not dismiss the idea out of hand before scientists have had the chance to work out the details .
One way to quell doubts lies with carefully conducting larger experiments .
But iron fertilization is unlikely to receive much more federal funding .
It falls to entrepreneurs concerned about the climate problem to fund the work , and they need scientists ’ participation to make sure the right questions are asked and answered .
In a parallel with the way universities routinely conduct trials of the safety and efficacy of potential pharmaceuticals , Michaels pointed out that oceanographers may need to learn how to be involved with tests of iron fertilization .
“ We have to evolve a set of skills within our community to have those kinds of roles , ” he said .
“ Who else should be figuring that out but us ? ”
Though many scientists are keen on the idea of future research , fewer are willing to team up with a private company to do it , for fear of a real or perceived effect on the impartiality of their research .
Still , researchers may need to convince themselves that just because the idea is potentially profitable does n’t mean it ’s wrong — or simply accept that further research is going to happen .
“ Commercial efforts are moving forward with or without scientific input , ” Buesseler said .
“ We need to be able to evaluate their impacts and changes to the ocean carbon cycle , based upon the best possible oceanographic methods . ”
For their part , private companies hope to collaborate with researchers .
Of the handful already in business , one — Climos — recently proposed a code of ethics supporting involvement by scientists and full environmental audits of experiment plans .
Russ George , president of rival company Planktos , who also attended the conference , agreed in principle to the code .
On Nov. 5 , Planktos announced that it had dispatched a ship equipped for an iron fertilization experiment but made no statements about how it might comply with the code .
What ’s emerging for the next few years is the prospect of a round of experiments involving around 100 tons of iron , which is 100 times larger than previously tried .
Financed by private companies , they could either be conducted by private interests with limited sampling gear or by teams of scientists through grants .
New , autonomous technology promises to extend the duration of monitoring and improve measurements of how carbon sinks through the ocean .
Yields from previous experiments cannot be used to project whether larger - scale fertilizations would send millions , thousands , or even fewer tons of carbon into the ocean ’s middle depths , Buesseler said .
Still , commercial groups sponsoring new experiments hope to sell those carbon dioxide equivalents as voluntary offsets .
While scientific research would focus on learning more about how the ocean works , the companies involved would be looking for ways to increase efficiency , make larger blooms in the future , and monitor any negative effects .
As government - sponsored research on iron fertilization moves ahead in different countries , funding for larger experiments could develop into private and public partnerships .
Experiments on such a scale drive home one final point : that the near future of iron fertilization is modest on all counts — size of experiments , likely profits , environmental side - effects , and amount of carbon sequestration .
However profitable iron fertilization becomes , the dent it puts in atmospheric carbon levels in coming years will remain a small one .
As these ocean scientists work to assemble their stabilization wedge to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions , they remind the rest of the world that many more wedges must be found .
The Ocean Iron Fertilization Symposium : Some 80 natural and social scientists from several countries — along with environmental advocates , business representatives , policymakers , legal experts , economists , and journalists — gathered at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) on Sept. 26 - 27 , 2007 , to discuss the pros and cons of ocean iron fertilization as a means to mediate global warming .
This series of Oceanus articles summarize the wide range of issues raised at the conference , convened by WHOI scientists Ken Buesseler , Scott Doney , and Hauke Kite - Powell .
They reviewed and edited these articles , with input from many conference participants .
All the articles in this series will be published next week in a print edition of Oceanus ( Vol. 46 , No. 1 ) .
Videos and PDF versions of presentations at the conference are available at http://www.whoi.edu/conference/OceanIronFertilization.
The symposium was sponsored by the Elisabeth and Henry Morss Jr. Colloquia Fund , the Cooperative Institute for Climate Research at WHOI , the WHOI Marine Policy Center , the WHOI Ocean and Climate Change Institute , the WHOI Ocean Life Institute , and Woods Hole Sea Grant .
Unresolved Questions
Twelve small experiments have shown that blooms of phytoplankton consistently result from intentional addition of iron to the ocean .
But the efficacy and ecological impacts of iron fertilization remain uncertain , particularly with larger - scale experiments .
If and when a new round of experiments is begun , these questions will be first on the list :

Some more mercury with your tuna ?
You are what you eat .
While I always questioned this in a literal sense as a child , it is pretty much the case .
But I do n’t want to be made of heavy metals , and my body agrees .
It is no news to anyone that we are poisoning our oceans , and unfortunately that means our food supplies .
There has been much talk over the years about the amount of mercury in seafood , and while the studies have thus far been inconclusive as to the extent of the contamination , certain individuals , especially children and pregnant women , have always been steered away from the deep , cold water predatory fish out of fear of mercury contamination .
We know that there is mercury in fish , but unless certain species made a bulk of your diet , it was never an issue if you ate of them sparingly .
That may be no longer the case .
Media fear mongering being what it is , making a gross generalization about contamination is sushi is ridiculous , but it is prudent to be aware of the potential health issues with eating certain sushi items , and it seems that tuna may be worse for us than we realize .
Mercury is naturally present in seawater , but modern industry has increased those levels exponentially , and as it is absorbed by plankton and other creatures that encompass the base level of the food chain .
Heavy metals also concentrate as they work their way up the chain to the larger fish .
Now , according to a recent study , mercury concentrations have reached potentially unsafe levels in bluefin tuna .
With some of the tuna tested , it was found that by eating six pieces per week ( or even two or three pieces per week of some samples ) , which is not unheard of , a person would exceed the mercury levels determined by the FDA as being safe .
That ’s no fun .
Contamination has become a very real problem , and I definitely think that children and pregnant women would do best to completely avoid bluefin tuna ( and even ahi , yellowfin tuna , just to be safe ) until we can be assured of the safety of the food supply .
This is not something that can be fixed overnight , either , especially as no single nation seems to be willing to step up to the plate to reduce pollution in any form .
Frankly , there is another reason to not eat bluefin tuna , as I have pointed out in numerous entries in the past ( Trouble for Tuna I , II III , and IV ) , the fish are in very real danger of being wiped out due to over fishing .
Perhaps the silver lining of the mercury issue will be that people will eat less , and the fish may be offered some time to recover from their predicament .
There are still many sushi items available for you to enjoy , even for those whose preference was maguro ( tuna ) .
The toro lovers may have more to be sad about , but with the variety of seafood available , hopefully even they might be placated by minimizing their intake of toro and expanding to other buttery selections such as buri toro and ‘ white tuna , ’ which is usually not any form of tuna anyway .
Tuna has been out of my rotation for some time , and with these new data it seems that we should all take a hard look at what is on our plate .
Be moderate with the predatory fish such as tuna , tilefish , swordfish , shark , and even salmon , and treat yourself to some new sushi items that you may have been eyeballing , but have n’t tried because you were happy with your spicy tuna roll .
There is a lot out there and now is your chance to expand your repertoire .
It is too bad that we have ruined what is a staple for many sushi fans , but at least I still have my spicy scallop roll .
Meshi agare !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. chain stores , reeling from the slowest holiday shopping season in five years , got some more bad news on Sunday : 2008 will not be any better and could see changes that may shift the retail playing field forever .

As the National Retail Federation kicked off its annual convention in New York , two retail consultants offered negative outlooks for the U.S. retail industry , which has seen consumers pull back amid higher gasoline and food prices , a credit crunch and a prolonged housing market decline .
“ It ’s anarchy , ” said Wendy Liebmann , chief executive of WSL Strategic Retail , frequently repeating the word she used to sum up the latest results of her company ’s bi-annual shopper study .
“ Americans cannot control the big things such as oil prices , falling home values , mortgage costs and rising property taxes , so they want to control the small things , ” Liebmann said .
“ They are watching what they spend on everything . ”
Liebmann said most shoppers were making fewer weekly shopping trips and spending significantly less on discretionary items such as home appliances and decor , fashion accessories , electronics , perfume , computers and software .
The only two categories getting a larger share of consumers ’ wallets are food and pet supplies , Liebmann said , noting however , that food prices have increased .
But with shoppers changing their habits , opportunities also emerge , she noted .
Liebmann projected this year 's winning retail sectors will be department stores such as Saks Inc SKS.N and J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N , in part because they have improved their offerings , and drug stores such as CVS Caremark Corp CVS.N , that have added things such as better brands of beauty products and in - store health clinics .
Losers are likely to be mass merchants like Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N and Target Corp TGT.N , and specialty stores such as Barnes & Noble BKS.N , Liebmann said , citing the impact of shoppers making fewer trips and spending more prudently .
Yet retailers with exposure to emerging markets such as China and India may be able to offset the weakness in the United States , according to a report by Deloitte Research .
REBALANCE OF POWER
As consumer spending slows in the United States , it is speeding up in Asia , said Ira Kalish , global director of Deloitte Research .
He said the global economy is transforming from how it was over the last decade .
“ U.S. consumes , China produces and everyone ’s happy -- that ... ca n’t last forever , ” Kalish said , adding that the imbalance is “ starting to unwind and will impact where spending growth takes place .
“ Global economic growth in 2008 is likely to be slow , ” Kalish said , citing a slowdown in U.S. consumer spending and modest decelerations in Europe and Japan as well .
“ The main engine of global growth will continue to be China and , to a lesser extent , India and the major oil producing countries , ” in the Persian Gulf and Russia , Kalish said .
Aside from that geographic shift , other trends in global retailing include increased focus on added services , such as Best Buy Co Inc 's BBY .N Geek Squad , social responsibility , improving customers ' shopping experiences and retailers aggressively improving their marketing messages , Kalish said .
The BRAD BLOG
By Brad Friedman from on the road …
London ’s Sunday Times has just published a follow - up to their explosive front - pager from two weeks ago which described allegations by former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel Edmonds .
Though there has been worldwide coverage of the recent blockbuster in the Rupert Murdoch - owned British paper , the U.S. media have remained entirely mum , a point which has drawn great consternation from both Edmonds and the 70 ’s - era “ Pentagon Papers ” Daniel Ellsberg , whom The BRAD BLOG has spoken to this evening , following the release of tonight ’s extraordinary new Times piece .
The paper now reports that they are able to corroborate an apparent FBI cover - up of documents detailing an investigation of the theft and sale of nuclear secrets to agents working for Turkey and Israel , who in turn shared the secrets with Pakistan , who in turn may have shared those secrets with Iran , North Korea , Libya , and possibly even al - Qaeda .
As The BRAD BLOG reported along with the Times two weeks ago , the operation also includes allegations that high - ranking U.S. officials — such as Marc Grossman , a former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey , who served as the # 3 official in the State Department under Colin Powell and Richard Armitage from 2001 to 2005 — were involved in the sale of those secrets and may have accepted pay - offs from agents in the black market network in the bargain .
The Times article tonight was originally published under the headline “ FBI ‘ covers up ’ file exposing theft of nuclear secrets , ” according to Google News .
Though that header has already been changed to “ FBI denies file exposing nuclear secrets theft . ”

Two hedge funds , managed by Bear Stearns , are on the verge of liquidation due to making highly leveraged bets on securities backed by subprime mortgages .
Bear Stearns ’ woes have investors worried that any negative developments in the credit markets will also drag down the stock market — which has become quite volatile since the bad news , from Bear Stearns , surfaced .
To be sure , the ripple effects of the subprime - mortgage implosion will continue to roil the credit and stock markets .
But is the subprime - mortgage bust truly large enough to drag down Wall Street , and its precious Dow Jones Industrial Average , with it ?
If the recent performance of General Motors ’ stock is an indicator , the Working Group on Financial Markets ( aka : the Plunge Protection Team ) is answering this question with a resounding " yes . "
As Karen De Coster and I asserted in our essay General Motors , Market Engineering , and " Confidence " Protection , the Working Group manipulates General Motors ’ stock in order to prop up the Dow Jones Industrial Average so as to maintain investor confidence in the stock market , Wall Street , and the economy in general .
Indeed , based upon our assertion , General Motors ’ stock definitely has big shoes to fill .
In light of GM ’s stunning performance , during the exact period of Bear Stearns ’ hedge fund catastrophes , the " General " is strutting up and down Wall Street as if he is Sasquatch … with members of the Plunge Protection Team peering from behind the curtain in delight .
This past quarter — April 1 , 2007 to June 30 , 2007 — has been a barnburner for GM ’s stock .
Through this period , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 8.5 % while GM was up by nearly 23 % ; talk about market leadership .
During the trading week of June 25th , when Wall Street was really feeling the heat of Bear Stearns ’ meltdown , General Motors ’ stock closed the week up by 6.6 % .
This is n’t just leadership ; no , the General is fearlessly spearheading the stock market ’s charge upward .
And it gets even better ; for during this hard - charging week , GM ’s stock hit a 52 - week high which tallies up to nearly a 43 % gain from its 52 - week low .
General Motors ’ stock , most certainly , closed this last quarter with a magnificent performance that served to steady a jittery stock market .
Interestingly enough , this magical week began with an upgrade from a Wall Street brokerage powerhouse .
On June 25th , Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry put out a " buy " recommendation on General Motors citing his rather dull insight that " GM can make a compelling case to UAW members that material wage and benefit cuts are needed …
And we suspect members and retirees are increasingly amenable to such cuts . "
Although this wo n’t go down as an awe - inspiring recommendation , the reasoning is much less important than putting the prestige of Goldman Sachs ’ name behind General Motors ’ stock .
And this is where , in my opinion , the heavy hand of the Plunge Protection Team has been exposed yet again .
So let ’s connect a few important dots here .
For openers , the four key members of the Plunge Protection Team ( which reports directly to the President of the United States ) are the Secretary of the Treasury , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Henry M. Paulson is the current Secretary of the Treasury .
Before being sworn in as the Secretary of the Treasury last year , Mr. Paulson was the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of — you guessed it — Goldman Sachs .
Thus , Henry Paulson was once the aforementioned Robert Barry ’s boss .
In light of this , it is highly plausible that Goldman Sachs ’ buy recommendation — regarding GM stock — was a political favor to help the Plunge Protection Team do damage control on Wall Street .
Now , let ’s look a little deeper into the company whose common stock Robert Barry so uninspiringly recommended to American investors .
Upon reviewing GM ’s December 31 , 2006 fiscal year - end audited financial statement , I certainly can see why Mr. Barry was so bland .
To analyze General Motors ’
12/31/06 FYE financial statement is to understand that this once great company is likely heading towards bankruptcy .
Here are the gruesome details :
GM ’s " as stated " net worth is negative $ 5.4 billion
$ 5.4 billion
By fully discounting intangible assets , which includes deferred tax assets , GM ’s net worth is arguably negative $ 48.5 billion ( refer to Note 13 of GM ’s 12/31/06 financial statement )
$ 48.5 billion ( refer to Note 13 of GM ’s 12/31/06 financial statement ) GM ’s as stated working capital is negative $ 3.7 billion
$ 3.7 billion
By fully discounting current deferred tax assets , GM ’s working capital drops to negative $ 14 billion
$ 14 billion General Motors ’ total liabilities amount to a staggering $ 190.4 billion
GM ’s net loss , in 2006 , was nearly $ 2 billion
In spite of the " General ’s " ill financial health , Robert Barry proclaimed a 52 - week target price of $ 42 per share .
This target price was simply pulled out of thin air .
Without earnings and without a tangible net worth , it is impossible to apply basic analytical tools — such as a price - to - earnings ratio and a price - to - book - value ratio — in order to derive a rational target price - per - share for General Motors ’ common stock .
Since most " investors " are financially illiterate , it is easy for Wall Street analysts to get away with making such absurd proclamations .
This is not to say that Robert Barry did n’t comprehend the gravity of GM ’s financial condition .
When Barry stated that " GM can make a compelling case to UAW members that material wage and benefit cuts are needed " he clearly understood the grim reality of General Motors ’ financial situation .
In essence , Barry ’s " buy " recommendation is based upon the bizarre logic that although GM ’s acute financial weakness may be a " strength " when bargaining for concessions from the UAW , that investors should ignore this extreme financial fragility — but the UAW should not — so go out and purchase GM stock today .
After all , this company just may survive if its negotiations , with the UAW , go exceedingly well .
And what if the UAW does n’t give an inch ?
Heck , let ’s not spoil the convincing case ( wink , wink , nod , nod ) made by Goldman Sachs ’ star auto - industry analyst .
There is little doubt that Robert Barry " took one for the team " … the Plunge Protection Team that is .
Typically , a " buy " recommendation is accompanied by exciting and positive developments regarding the company being analyzed .
All Barry could muster was tortured logic intertwined into an insipid endorsement of a company teetering on failure .
But the deed was done .
Goldman Sachs ’ endorsement , of GM , gave the Plunge Protection Team the cover it desired to continue pushing GM ’s share price higher ; thereby providing market leadership investors yearn for when instability is afoot .
As I see it , the intense manipulation of GM ’s stock indicates that the Plunge Protection Team is frightfully worried about the damage subprime mortgages will inflict upon Wall Street .
In the end , it is quite ironic that General Motors ’ financial condition really is n’t substantially different relative to the financially - strapped individuals who are defaulting on the very mortgages that toppled Bear Stearns ’ hedge funds .

The Dalai Lama could end 600 years of history by forgoing rebirth in a bid to stop China seizing control of his reincarnation , he has revealed .
The exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader proposed to hold a referendum among his 14 million followers to decide whether he should be reborn .
If the majority vote " no " it would end a lineage that reputedly dates back to the 14th century , when a young shepherd was appointed the first Dalai Lama .
But if they vote " yes " he might appoint a reincarnation while he was still alive , breaking the tradition of being reborn as a small boy after his death .
Scroll down for more ..
Traditionally , the death of a Dalai Lama triggers a search for his reincarnation among children born in Tibet at the same time .
But many Tibetans fear the death of the current , 14th Dalai Lama , 72 , would be
seized by China in a bid to thwart their battle for independence .
China has held control of the Himalayan nation since 1950 and the Tibetan spiritual leader has been in India since 1959 .
The 1989 Nobel Peace laureate , who has met several world leaders including George Bush , yesterday said a referendum was on the cards .
“ Yes , a referendum , yes , it 's possible , ” he said at an interfaith conference in the north Indian city of Amritsar .
“ When my physical condition becomes weak and serious preparation for death has started , then that should happen , ” he said .
“ According to my regular medical check - up it seems another few decades , I think , are there , so no hurry . ”
The Dalai Lama has traditionally been chosen by senior monks who interpret signals from the last reincarnation , scour the region for promising young candidates and then set a number of tests .
The current Dalai Lama was born into a farming family and identified at the age of 2 after passing tests , including identifying his predecessor 's rosary from among several others .
He fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has been living in India ever since , heading a 200,000 - strong Tibetan exile community from the northern town of Dharamsala .
He now campaigns for greater autonomy within China , but Chinese leaders accuse him of still seeking independence for Tibet , which they see as an integral part of their territory .
FOR most people , the idea of isolation is an uncomfortable one .
It interests Paul Turner , however , because it goes hand in hand with the formation of new species .
Dr Turner is a biologist at Yale University , and he and his team have just become the first people to create a new biological species in a laboratory by encouraging the sort of ecological isolation that happens in the wild .
Admittedly the species in question is a virus , but the proof of principle is important .
Moreover , Dr Turner 's method might be adapted to examine how animal viruses jump the species barrier to become agents of human disease .
One definition of a species is a group of organisms whose members can breed with each other but not with outsiders .
Such groups can form in several ways .
One is that a species splits into groups that adapt to different foodstuffs .
If those foodstuffs live in different places , the groups will never meet .
Since they no longer meet , they no longer interbreed .
They have thus become ecologically isolated and natural selection can then drive their genetic make - ups apart .
It has been a source of disappointment to researchers into evolution that although they can replicate the effects of natural selection on individual traits ( for example , resistance to pesticides or changes in behaviour ) , no one has managed to evolve a new species this way .
Laboratory species have been created only by the isolating effects of hybridisation .
Speciation by hybridisation does happen in the wild , but is exceptional .
As they report in Evolution , Dr Turner and his team performed their trick with a type of virus called a bacteriophage .
As their name suggests , these infect bacteria .
Those the team study can live in more than one bacterial species .
The normal versions of Dr Turner 's phages are able to parasitise four types of bacteria .
He and his team , however , found a mutant that could infect two additional species .
They cultivated a population of this mutant in one of the newly available species and found that after 15 days it had adapted to its new host so well that it had lost the ability to infect other bacteria .
It had thus become effectively isolated , because it could never hook up with individuals from other strains .
It could therefore be considered a new species .
Bacteria are not people , of course .
Neither are phages retroviruses .
But what Dr Turner has done is logically equivalent to the step taken by , for example , one particular chimpanzee retrovirus when it leapt to humans and evolved into what is now known as HIV .
By showing that viruses can evolve into new species this way in the laboratory , Dr Turner may thus have invented a tool with medical applications .
And he has certainly given a psychological boost to evolutionary biologists .
On May 3 , the House voted to pass the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 .
The Senate will take up a companion bill , known as the Matthew Shepard Act , when it returns from its summer recess .
If enacted , this law would authorize the Justice Department , in certain narrowly defined circumstances , to criminally prosecute an individual who “ willfully ” causes bodily injury to another person or “ through the use of fire , a firearm or an explosive . . . attempts to cause bodily injury ” to another person because of that person ’s race , color , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability .
A coalition of conservative African American pastors has aggressively lobbied against this legislation on the premise that it would make it unlawful for them to preach that homosexuality is a sin .
Bishop Harry R. Jackson Jr. , pastor of the Hope Christian Church in College Park , Md. , for example , has asserted that the act would “ keep the church from preaching the Gospel . ”
This objection to the legislation is fanciful .
To begin with , there is no doubt of the act ’s constitutionality .
In 1993 , the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a virtually identical state law in Wisconsin vs. Mitchell .
The court made clear that “ a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive conduct protected by the 1st Amendment . ”
Moreover , the court emphasized that the government has a perfectly legitimate interest in punishing “ bias - motivated crimes ” because such crimes are especially likely to inflict emotional harm on their victims , incite community unrest and provoke retaliatory violence .
Of course , the pastors do not intend to assault anyone physically .
Their claim , rather , is that they could be prosecuted merely for preaching against homosexuality .
They fear that such sermonizing might be transmogrified by the law into an attempt to incite members of their congregations to lynch gays because of their sexual orientation .
For at least three reasons , this argument is completely unfounded .
First , the Matthew Shepard
Act would not prohibit “ attempts to incite . ”
It would prohibit only the infliction of bodily harm and attempts to cause bodily harm .
The latter refers to firing a gun and missing , not giving a sermon .
Second , it is settled 1st Amendment law that an individual cannot constitutionally be punished for attempting to incite others to commit crimes unless the speaker expressly incites unlawful conduct and such conduct is likely to occur imminently .
The last time the Supreme Court upheld a criminal conviction for incitement was more than half a century ago , in the case of Dennis vs. U.S. , and that involved incitement to violent overthrow of the government .
Unless the pastors intend to expressly incite wild - eyed mobs to beat up gays because of their sexual orientation , they are in no danger from this law .
Third , the legislation expressly provides that “ nothing in this act . . . shall be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct protected ” by the 1st Amendment .
In other words -- indeed , in the most explicit words possible -- the act could not be applied to the pastors unless their sermons are unprotected by the 1st Amendment , a concept that is impossible to imagine .
The 1st Amendment protects the right of Nazis to march in Skokie , the right of racists to assert that blacks are inferior , the right of atheists to denounce Christianity and the right of homophobes to condemn homosexuality .
The argument of the pastors that the proposed legislation in any way threatens their right to preach their version of the Gospel is , to be frank , ridiculous .
There might be rational reasons to question the wisdom of this legislation .
But the argument that it endangers the 1st Amendment rights of these pastors is certainly not one of them .

A chronology tracing the life of the Glass - Steagall Act , from its passage in 1933 to its death throes in the 1990s , and how Citigroup 's Sandy Weill dealt the coup de grâce .
Glass - Steagall
Act creates new banking landscape Following the Great Crash of 1929 , one of every five banks in America fails .
Many people , especially politicians , see market speculation engaged in by banks during the 1920s as a cause of the crash .
In 1933 , Senator Carter Glass ( D - Va. ) and Congressman Henry Steagall ( D - Ala . ) introduce the historic legislation that bears their name , seeking to limit the conflicts of interest created when commercial banks are permitted to underwrite stocks or bonds .
In the early part of the century , individual investors were seriously hurt by banks whose overriding interest was promoting stocks of interest and benefit to the banks , rather than to individual investors .
The new law bans commercial banks from underwriting securities , forcing banks to choose between being a simple lender or an underwriter ( brokerage ) .
The act also establishes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , insuring bank deposits , and strengthens the Federal Reserve 's control over credit .
The Glass - Steagall Act passes after Ferdinand Pecora , a politically ambitious former New York City prosecutor , drums up popular support for stronger regulation by hauling bank officials in front of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee to answer for their role in the stock - market crash .
In 1956 , the Bank Holding Company Act is passed , extending the restrictions on banks , including that bank holding companies owning two or more banks cannot engage in non-banking activity and cannot buy banks in another state .
First efforts to loosen Glass - Steagall restrictions Beginning in the 1960s , banks lobby Congress to allow them to enter the municipal bond market , and a lobbying subculture springs up around Glass - Steagall .
Some lobbyists even brag about how the bill put their kids through college .
In the 1970s , some brokerage firms begin encroaching on banking territory by offering money - market accounts that pay interest , allow check - writing , and offer credit or debit cards .
Fed begins reinterpreting Glass - Steagall ; Greenspan becomes Fed chairman
In December 1986 , the Federal Reserve Board , which has regulatory jurisdiction over banking , reinterprets Section 20 of the Glass - Steagall Act , which bars commercial banks from being " engaged principally " in securities business , deciding that banks can have up to 5 percent of gross revenues from investment banking business .
The Fed Board then permits Bankers Trust , a commercial bank , to engage in certain commercial paper ( unsecured , short - term credit ) transactions .
In the Bankers Trust decision , the Board concludes that the phrase " engaged principally " in Section 20 allows banks to do a small amount of underwriting , so long as it does not become a large portion of revenue .
This is the first time the Fed reinterprets Section 20 to allow some previously prohibited activities .
In the spring of 1987 , the Federal Reserve Board votes 3 - 2 in favor of easing regulations under Glass - Steagall Act , overriding the opposition of Chairman Paul Volcker .
The vote comes after the Fed Board hears proposals from Citicorp , J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust advocating the loosening of Glass - Steagall restrictions to allow banks to handle several underwriting businesses , including commercial paper , municipal revenue bonds , and mortgage - backed securities .
Thomas Theobald , then vice chairman of Citicorp , argues that three " outside checks " on corporate misbehavior had emerged since 1933 : " a very effective " SEC ; knowledgeable investors , and " very sophisticated " rating agencies .
Volcker is unconvinced , and expresses his fear that lenders will recklessly lower loan standards in pursuit of lucrative securities offerings and market bad loans to the public .
For many critics , it boiled down to the issue of two different cultures - a culture of risk which was the securities business , and a culture of protection of deposits which was the culture of banking .
In March 1987 , the Fed approves an application by Chase Manhattan to engage in underwriting commercial paper , applying the same reasoning as in the 1986 Bankers Trust decision , and in April it issues an order outlining its rationale .
While the Board remains sensitive to concerns about mixing commercial banking and underwriting , it states its belief that the original Congressional intent of " principally engaged " allowed for some securities activities .
The Fed also indicates that it will raise the limit from 5 percent to 10 percent of gross revenues at some point in the future .
The Board believes the new reading of Section 20 will increase competition and lead to greater convenience and increased efficiency .
In August 1987 , Alan Greenspan -- formerly a director of J.P. Morgan and a proponent of banking deregulation -- becomes chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .
One reason Greenspan favors greater deregulation is to help U.S. banks compete with big foreign institutions .
Further loosening of Glass - Steagall In January 1989 , the Fed Board approves an application by J.P. Morgan , Chase Manhattan , Bankers Trust , and Citicorp to expand the Glass - Steagall loophole to include dealing in debt and equity securities in addition to municipal securities and commercial paper .
This marks a large expansion of the activities considered permissible under Section 20 , because the revenue limit for underwriting business is still at 5 percent .
Later in 1989 , the Board issues an order raising the limit to 10 percent of revenues , referring to the April 1987 order for its rationale .
In 1990 , J.P. Morgan becomes the first bank to receive permission from the Federal Reserve to underwrite securities , so long as its underwriting business does not exceed the 10 percent limit .
Congress repeatedly tries and fails to repeal Glass - Steagall In 1984 and 1988 , the Senate passes bills that would lift major restrictions under Glass - Steagall , but in each case the House blocks passage .
In 1991 , the Bush administration puts forward a repeal proposal , winning support of both the House and Senate Banking Committees , but the House again defeats the bill in a full vote .
And in 1995 , the House and Senate Banking Committees approve separate versions of legislation to get rid of Glass - Steagall , but conference negotiations on a compromise fall apart .
Attempts to repeal Glass - Steagall typically pit insurance companies , securities firms , and large and small banks against one another , as factions of these industries engage in turf wars in Congress over their competing interests and over whether the Federal Reserve or the Treasury Department and the Comptroller of the Currency should be the primary banking regulator .
Fed renders Glass - Steagall effectively obsolete
In December 1996 , with the support of Chairman Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve Board issues a precedent - shattering decision permitting bank holding companies to own investment bank affiliates with up to 25 percent of their business in securities underwriting ( up from 10 percent ) .
This expansion of the loophole created by the Fed 's 1987 reinterpretation of Section 20 of Glass - Steagall effectively renders Glass - Steagall obsolete .
Virtually any bank holding company wanting to engage in securities business would be able to stay under the 25 percent limit on revenue .
However , the law remains on the books , and along with the Bank Holding Company Act , does impose other restrictions on banks , such as prohibiting them from owning insurance - underwriting companies .
In August 1997 , the Fed eliminates many restrictions imposed on " Section 20 subsidiaries " by the 1987 and 1989 orders .
The Board states that the risks of underwriting had proven to be " manageable , " and says banks would have the right to acquire securities firms outright .
In 1997 , Bankers Trust ( now owned by Deutsche Bank ) buys the investment bank Alex .
Brown & Co. , becoming the first U.S. bank to acquire a securities firm .
Sandy Weill tries to merge Travelers and J.P. Morgan ; acquires Salomon Brothers
In the summer of 1997 , Sandy Weill , then head of Travelers insurance company , seeks and nearly succeeds in a merger with J.P. Morgan ( before J.P. Morgan merged with Chemical Bank ) , but the deal collapses at the last minute .
In the fall of that year , Travelers acquires the Salomon Brothers investment bank for $ 9 billion .
( Salomon then merges with the Travelers - owned Smith Barney brokerage firm to become Salomon Smith Barney . )
Weill and John Reed announce Travelers - Citicorp merger
At a dinner in Washington in February 1998 , Sandy Weill of Travelers invites Citicorp 's John Reed to his hotel room at the Park Hyatt and proposes a merger .
In March , Weill and Reed meet again , and at the end of two days of talks , Reed tells Weill , " Let 's do it , partner ! "
On April 6 , 1998 , Weill and Reed announce a $ 70 billion stock swap merging Travelers ( which owned the investment house Salomon Smith Barney ) and Citicorp ( the parent of Citibank ) , to create Citigroup Inc. , the world 's largest financial services company , in what was the biggest corporate merger in history .
The transaction would have to work around regulations in the Glass - Steagall and Bank Holding Company acts governing the industry , which were implemented precisely to prevent this type of company : a combination of insurance underwriting , securities underwriting , and commecial banking .
The merger effectively gives regulators and lawmakers three options : end these restrictions , scuttle the deal , or force the merged company to cut back on its consumer offerings by divesting any business that fails to comply with the law .
Weill meets with Alan Greenspan and other Federal Reserve officials before the announcement to sound them out on the merger , and later tells the Washington Post that Greenspan had indicated a " positive response . "
In their proposal , Weill and Reed are careful to structure the merger so that it conforms to the precedents set by the Fed in its interpretations of Glass - Steagall and the Bank Holding Company Act .
Unless Congress changed the laws and relaxed the restrictions , Citigroup would have two years to divest itself of the Travelers insurance business ( with the possibility of three one - year extensions granted by the Fed ) and any other part of the business that did not conform with the regulations .
Citigroup is prepared to make that promise on the assumption that Congress would finally change the law -- something it had been trying to do for 20 years -- before the company would have to divest itself of anything .
Citicorp and Travelers quietly lobby banking regulators and government officials for their support .
In late March and early April , Weill makes three heads - up calls to Washington : to Fed Chairman Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , and President Clinton .
On April 5 , the day before the announcement , Weill and Reed make a ceremonial call on Clinton to brief him on the upcoming announcement .
The Fed gives its approval to the Citicorp - Travelers merger on Sept. 23 .
The Fed 's press release indicates that " the Board 's approval is subject to the conditions that Travelers and the combined organization , Citigroup , Inc. , take all actions necessary to conform the activities and investments of Travelers and all its subsidiaries to the requirements of the Bank Holding Company
Act in a manner acceptable to the Board , including divestiture as necessary , within two years of consummation of the proposal .
...
The Board 's approval also is subject to the condition that Travelers and Citigroup conform the activities of its companies to the requirements of the Glass - Steagall Act . "
Intense new lobbying effort to repeal Glass - Steagall Following the merger announcement on April 6 , 1998 , Weill immediately plunges into a public - relations and lobbying campaign for the repeal of Glass - Steagall and passage of new financial services legislation ( what becomes the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 ) .
One week before the Citibank - Travelers deal was announced , Congress had shelved its latest effort to repeal Glass - Steagall .
Weill cranks up a new effort to revive bill .
Weill and Reed have to act quickly for both business and political reasons .
Fears that the necessary regulatory changes would not happen in time had caused the share prices of both companies to fall .
The House Republican leadership indicates that it wants to enact the measure in the current session of Congress .
While the Clinton administration generally supported Glass - Steagall " modernization , " but there are concerns that mid-term elections in the fall could bring in Democrats less sympathetic to changing the laws .
In May 1998 , the House passes legislation by a vote of 214 to 213 that allows for the merging of banks , securities firms , and insurance companies into huge financial conglomerates .
And in September , the Senate Banking Committee votes 16 - 2 to approve a compromise bank overhaul bill .
Despite this new momentum , Congress is yet again unable to pass final legislation before the end of its session .
As the push for new legislation heats up , lobbyists quip that raising the issue of financial modernization really signals the start of a fresh round of political fund - raising .
Indeed , in the 1997 - 98 election cycle , the finance , insurance , and real estate industries ( known as the FIRE sector ) , spends more than $ 200 million on lobbying and makes more than $ 150 million in political donations .
Campaign contributions are targeted to members of Congressional banking committees and other committees with direct jurisdiction over financial services legislation .
Congress passes Financial Services Modernization Act After 12 attempts in 25 years , Congress finally repeals Glass - Steagall , rewarding financial companies for more than 20 years and $ 300 million worth of lobbying efforts .
Supporters hail the change as the long - overdue demise of a Depression - era relic .
On Oct. 21 , with the House - Senate conference committee deadlocked after marathon negotiations , the main sticking point is partisan bickering over the bill 's effect on the Community Reinvestment Act , which sets rules for lending to poor communities .
Sandy Weill calls President Clinton in the evening to try to break the deadlock after Senator Phil Gramm , chairman of the Banking Committee , warned Citigroup lobbyist Roger Levy that Weill has to get White House moving on the bill or he would shut down the House - Senate conference .
Serious negotiations resume , and a deal is announced at 2:45 a.m. on Oct. 22 .
Whether Weill made any difference in precipitating a deal is unclear .
On Oct. 22 , Weill and John Reed issue a statement congratulating Congress and President Clinton , including 19 administration officials and lawmakers by name .
The House and Senate approve a final version of the bill on Nov. 4 , and Clinton signs it into law later that month .
Just days after the administration ( including the Treasury Department ) agrees to support the repeal , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , the former co-chairman of a major Wall Street investment bank , Goldman Sachs , raises eyebrows by accepting a top job at Citigroup as Weill 's chief lieutenant .
The previous year , Weill had called Secretary Rubin to give him advance notice of the upcoming merger announcement .
When Weill told Rubin he had some important news , the secretary reportedly quipped , " You 're buying the government ? "

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that international pressure has compelled the Islamic Republic to back away from its pursuit of the bomb .
The new findings represent a retreat from a fundamental U.S. assumption about one of its main adversaries , and an admission that a central component of previous intelligence estimates on Tehran ’s nuclear program was wrong .
But the report makes it clear that Iran could decide at any point to resume its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon .
The assessment , which represents the consensus of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , including the CIA and the National Security Agency , is expected to have major implications for the ongoing debate over whether to confront Iran militarily or through diplomatic means , an issue that has been a source of friction within the Bush administration and with some members of the international community .
As recently as October , President Bush was warning that a nuclear - armed Iran could lead to World War III , and Vice President Dick Cheney threatened Tehran with “ serious consequences ” if it did not abandon its nuclear program .
Senior U.S. intelligence officials said that Bush and Cheney were briefed on the intelligence estimate on Iran Wednesday , but declined to say when they were informed that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons work .
Iran stopped developing nuclear weapons designs and ended covert efforts to produce highly enriched uranium suitable for use in a bomb , the report says .
“ We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program , ” the report concludes .
And it says the intelligence community judged “ with moderate confidence ” that Tehran had not restarted the program as of mid-2007 and did not have a nuclear weapon .
At the same time , the findings , which will be shared with Israel and other U.S. allies , note that “ Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons . ”
The report says that despite threats of international economic sanctions , Iran resumed installing centrifuges at Natanz in 2006 , but “ still faces significant technical problems operating them . ”
The Natanz installation is part of Iran ’s much - publicized program to enrich uranium for nuclear reactors capable of generating electrical power , but the degree of enrichment necessary for so - called weapons - grade uranium is far higher than that of the fuel it is able to produce there .
The report also says that Iran is unlikely to be able to make enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb before 2009 at the earliest , and possibly as late as 2015 .
The acquisition of weapons - grade material is considered the main obstacle to Iran building a bomb .
The intelligence estimate was contained in a report titled “ Iran : Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities . ”
The key judgments of that report were declassified and released Monday .
The bulk of the report , which is said to span nearly 140 pages , remains classified .
The report acknowledges that emerging evidence has forced analysts to alter their views on Iran ’s intentions and capabilities , as well as its susceptibility to outside pressure .
“ Tehran ’s decisions are guided by a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic and military cost , ” according to the report .
Overall , it says , Iran “ is less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , ” and “ may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . ”
As a result , the report could give new leverage to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and others within the administration who have pushed for diplomatic initiatives over military strikes against the Islamic regime .
Indeed , the document suggests , “ some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures , ” along with opportunities for Iran to achieve its regional goals , could “ prompt Tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program . ”
At the White House , national security advisor Stephen Hadley described the report as “ good news ” that validated the administration ’s approach to keeping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon .
“ It tells us that we have made some progress in trying to ensure that that does not happen , ” Hadley said .
“ But it also tells us that the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a very serious problem . ”
From Vienna , a senior official at the International Atomic Energy Agency said the report “ basically validates what the IAEA has been reporting :
There is no indication of a secret program , though we ca n’t rule it out . ”
The report comes five years after a hastily assembled National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq erroneously concluded that the country had chemical and biological weapons stockpiled and was aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons .
That document , cited by the Bush administration in making the case for invading Iraq , proved to be wrong on almost all of its major findings .
In the case of Iraq , intelligence agencies were also accused of succumbing to interference from officials within the Bush administration .
Leading members of Congress said the substance of the new Iran report suggests that the community is now better insulated from such pressures .
“ This demonstrates a new willingness to question assumptions internally , and a level of independence from political leadership that was lacking in the recent past , ” said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va. ) , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Indeed , the new report goes so far as to include a table that makes side - by - side comparisons between its assessments from 2005 and the superseding judgments released Monday .
At the top of the table is language from an assessment two years ago that said Iran was “ determined to develop nuclear weapons . ”
It was set against the current view that all work on nuclear weapons stopped in 2003 .
Senior intelligence officials said that the National Intelligence Estimate , or NIE , on Iran had been in the works for more than a year , but that new information and analysis prompted major revisions of the document within the last three months .
The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , declined to elaborate .
A former U.S. official familiar with intelligence on Iran said that one critical new piece of information stemmed from an intercepted call involving a senior Iranian government official who was heard “ complaining that the program was suspended . ”
One of the senior U.S. intelligence officials who discussed the matter cautioned against concluding that a single piece of information , or “ Rosetta stone , ” had surfaced .
Instead , the officials pointed to a number of developments , including Tehran ’s decision to allow foreign journalists to visit the country ’s nuclear facility at Natanz last summer .
The centrifuges at Natanz are designed to produce low - enriched uranium , officials said , which is not suitable for nuclear weapons .
But intelligence officials said that the expertise that Iranian scientists had developed working with those centrifuges could be exported to other facilities designed to make weapons - grade material .
Advocates of diplomacy seized on the new Iran report , saying that it makes a compelling case against military intervention .
“ This is a blockbuster development and requires a wholesale reevaluation of U.S. policy , ” said Jon B. Wolfsthal , senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
“ This NIE suggests that outside pressure has turned off Iran ’s nuclear weapons program .
This is the piece of evidence that was missed in the case of Iraq . ”
But proponents of a more forceful approach with Iran scoffed at the suggestion that diplomacy could dissuade the country from its nuclear ambitions .
Developing nuclear weapons “ is a strategic decision they ’ve been pursuing for 20 years , ” said John R. Bolton , formerly the Bush administration ’s ambassador to the United Nations .
To give weight to a single intelligence estimate , he said , “ would be a mistake . ”
Asked what effect the document might have on the debate within the Bush administration , Bolton said : “ There really is n’t any debate .
Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates have fundamentally won .
This is an NIE very conveniently teed up for what the administration has been doing . ”
In some respects , however , the intelligence estimate could be viewed as providing evidence that the aggressive policies of the Bush administration were effective in putting pressure on Tehran .
Senior intelligence officials said they could not establish that it was directly a result of Washington ’s policies , noting that Iran appears to have halted its program around the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , Libya ’s decision to abandon its nuclear program , and the unraveling of the nuclear proliferation network led by Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
These things “ created an atmosphere that clearly led to this decision ” by Iran , said one of the senior U.S. intelligence officials .
Officials said the evidence was clearer that international pressure and the threat of isolation pushed Iran to halt the program .
The intelligence estimate concludes that Iran ’s military was pursuing nuclear weapons until the fall of 2003 as part of a program that was kept secret from the international community for decades .
Iran probably would use covert facilities , not those that it has declared to international inspectors , for the production of highly enriched uranium for a weapon , the report said .
“ We assess with high confidence that Iran has the scientific , technical and industrial capacity eventually to produce nuclear weapons if it decides to do so , ” the report concludes , noting that “ only an Iranian political decision to abandon a nuclear weapons objective would plausibly keep Iran from ” eventually doing so .
Donald M. Kerr , the second - ranking U.S. intelligence official , said the U.S. government decided to release the key findings because they had changed so significantly from previous releases and public testimony from top intelligence officials .
“ Since our understanding of Iran ’s capabilities has changed , we felt it was important to release this information , ” Kerr said .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon named actor George Clooney , who has campaigned for refugees in Darfur , as a U.N. “ messenger of peace ” on Friday to promote the world body ’s peacekeeping efforts .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Clooney is the ninth U.N. messenger -- people chosen from the fields of art , music , literature and sports who have agreed to help focus attention on the United Nations ’ work .
U.N. spokeswoman Michele Montas said Clooney would have a special emphasis on peacekeeping .
She said he had been “ recognized for focusing public attention on crucial international political and social issues . ”
Clooney , who is currently in Sudan , will receive his designation on January 31 at U.N. headquarters .
With fellow actors Don Cheadle and Brad Pitt , Clooney , 46 , has used his celebrity status to raise money for refugees through their “ Not On Our Watch ” charity and draw attention to the crisis in Darfur in western Sudan .
The United Nations is trying to deploy a peacekeeping force in Darfur , where international experts say some 200,000 people have been killed and more than 2 million driven from their homes in fighting between Sudan ’s government and Darfur rebels .
Clooney has starred in a number of films with political themes and won an Oscar in 2005 for his role in “ Syriana . ”
Last month , he and Cheadle were honored by Nobel peace laureates in Rome for their efforts in Darfur .
The other U.N. messengers of peace are actor Michael Douglas , musicians Daniel Barenboim , Midori Goto and Yo- Yo Ma , authors Paulo Coelho and Elie Wiesel , naturalist Jane Goodall and Olympic equestrian Princess Haya of Jordan .
The program was started by Ban ’s predecessor , Kofi Annan , in 1998 .
Driver 's quick thinking prevents head - on crash on GG Bridge
A Mill Valley man prevented a potentially serious crash on the Golden Gate Bridge today by using his pickup truck to guide a sport utility vehicle - in which the driver had gone unconcious - away from oncoming traffic , the California Highway Patrol said .
A 62 - year - old Tiburon woman driving south over the bridge at 6:50 a.m. slumped over her steering wheel after suffering a medical condition from which she later died .
John Beatty , a 50 - year - old electrician who was driving to work across the bridge as he 's done almost every weekday for the past 30 years came up behind the Jeep Grand Cherokee stopped in the second lane from the center divide .
" I nearly hit it , and the car behind me nearly hit me , " Beatty said .
" All of the sudden the vehicle in front of me starts to drive to the left very slowly . "
The Jeep was headed toward oncoming traffic .
" You never know what you 're going to do when something like that happens , " Beatty said .
" I did n't think about it .
I just did it . "
Beatty drove up along side the car , saw the woman slumped over the wheel and acted quickly .
He maneuvered his Ford F350 pickup in front of her vehicle to block it from moving into the oncoming cars .
" I let her hit me , " Beatty said .
Then - with the Jeep still moving - Beatty used his truck to guide it across two lanes of traffic to the right hand curb as other cars passed , he said .
" They were going crazy all around us , but as soon as they saw what I was doing they left me a big hole to do this maneuver , " Beatty said .
" Everybody just kind of stopped to let me slowly pull off to the right to park her . "
The CHP credited Beatty with selfless act that prevented a potentially " extremely serious " headon collision on the bridge .
Beatty said he called the CHP and pounded on the woman 's windows .
But she was unconscious and the doors were locked , Beatty said .
A CHP officer arrived on the scene and smashed a window to unlock the woman 's door , and a paramedic found a pulse and began CPR , Beatty said .
The woman was taken to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco , where she later was pronounced dead , authorities said .
" When you think about all the lawsuits and liability that goes on today , I probably would n't have done it , " Beatty said .
" But you do n't think .
I saw she was going into oncoming traffic , and it would have been a horrible accident . "
Beatty said that afterward , he pulled off into a parking lot to calm down for an hour as his adrenaline raced .
" I lead a kind of low - key life .
Excitement 's not my bag , " he said .

Rising from stormy seas , the giant turbine towers of an offshore wind farm seem almost miraculous to the untrained eye .
But how do you put them there ?
Most boats do not have legs .
But a jack - up barge has six , protruding high into the air when the ship is in transit .
Extending to a length of 48 m from the bottom of the ship , and penetrating up to 5 m into the sea bed , the " legs " of these ships provide a stable " ground " in a place where there is only roiling water .
As the legs push down , the ship is lifted above the waves .
Purpose - built at a Chinese shipyard , the £ 60 m jack - up barge MPIO Resolution is an extraordinary piece of engineering in itself .
The jack - up barges sail with their legs up
Enlarge Image
With a solid platform achieved , the windmill is fixed into place using a crane from the ship .
These procedures are becoming more common as the drive goes on to increase wind power .
If government targets are to be met , the UK could have as many as 7,000 offshore wind turbines by 2020 .
In the process , it would increase the amount of energy produced by that means about 60 - fold .
The building of each offshore site tends to be contentious , with complaints about disruption to wildlife and eyesores .
And after surmounting any planning concerns , the big engineering question of putting the turbines in place remains .
The offshore environment does present a number of challenges that you do n't face onshore
E.ON spokesman
The giant jack - up barges are purpose - built for the expanding industry and one such vessel is the £ 60 m MPIO Resolution .
Its most recent appointment has been to help with construction of the 60 - turbine Robin Rigg scheme in the Solway Firth , about six miles off the south west coast of Scotland .
In August last year , the £ 325 m scheme 's progress was delayed by the late arrival of another jack - up barge , the Lisa A . The Resolution was purpose built at a cost of about £ 60 m to help with the construction of offshore wind farms
Then 38 workers had to be rescued from Lisa A after it started to list dangerously .
It was taken to Belfast to undergo checks and the Resolution was drafted in .
The barge itself is a major piece of construction to overcome the difficulties of working at sea .
The vessel was purpose - built at the Shanhaigun Shipyard in China and delivered to the UK in February 2004 .
The Robin Rigg site is about six miles from the Scots coast
On average , it takes about 24 to 36 hours to install wind turbine foundations from a vessel like the Resolution .
At locations where drilling is required , it can taking closer to three days .
Then the vessel often has to wait for high water to allow it to move to the site of the next turbine .
Finally , it can return to fit the rest of the structure - usually in a period of about 24 hours for each turbine .
E.ON , the company behind the Robin Rigg project , has been philosophical about the difficulties encountered in the Solway .
MAJOR PROJECTS USING THE MPIO RESOLUTION Robin Rigg , Solway Firth North Hoyle , Wales Kentish Flats , Kent Barrow , Morecambe Bay Lynn & Inner Dowsing , Lincolnshire Horns Rev , Denmark " The offshore environment does present a number of challenges that you do n't face onshore , " said a company spokesman .
" However , offshore wind does offer a number of advantages such as the potential to build larger and more powerful wind farms .
" Certainly the availability of vessels capable of carrying out offshore work is an issue .
Jack - up barges rise out of the water to form a stable platform " And there 's always the possibility that bad weather and high seas can affect construction , but the more we learn about building these projects the easier it will become . "
Offshore wind farms like Robin Rigg play a key role in helping the UK deliver its renewable energy targets , E.ON believes , and in teaching lessons for the next generation of bigger , more powerful wind farms .
Which may mean we see more massive jack - up barges patrolling the waters around the UK in years to come .
Below is selection of your comments .
The Resolution 's original owners went into receivership even before the ship was complete .
Its new owners are a local company who keep it based on the Tees and now have long term contracts to install windfarms .
We should do more to ensure that people with the vision to keep such projects alive are encouraged to do so and put Britain in the lead in this field .
Paul Langham , Middlesbrough / UK
Why not use old rig platforms - less cost and more turbines .
Tony G , Preston
I see lots of comments about how it would be great to build such ' wonders ' in the UK .
I 've got news for you : jack - up barges were built in the Clyde for 30 years , at the old John Brown Shipyard at Clydebank .
I surveyed them and took them down the river for most of these years .
This Chinese one is purpose built and is self - propelled , more like a ship with legs than a barge but the principal is the same .
Former jack - ups could not be used as it would be too costly to modify them and remove the drilling derrick .
This one is a ' mini ' .
Some of the Clyde - built ones were very big indeed having legs 500 ft in length .
Capt Jim Currie , Glasgow
Why not put the turbines on the sea bed ?
Sea water is over 800 times denser than air and a non-compressible medium , so an 8 knot tidal current is the equivalent of a 390 km / hr wind speed .
And tidal power is predictable to the minute for centuries ahead .
Alan Burnham , Perth Australia Britain will never achieve anywhere near self - sufficiency in renewable energy so long as the Nimby attitude exist
Ishkandar , London Renewable energy , such as wind farms , is an obvious " must " .
And location off - shore is the least invasive .
But will there be serious risks of collisions by shipping ?
Could a collision cause serious power disruption ?
Albert Topliss , Wigston , United Kingdom
The windmills look beautiful and are a huge salvation for energy needs .
As Radio 4 pointed out in a recent podcast , mirror - driven steam turbines powered by the sun in the Gobi desert can deliver 16 % of Europe 's power too .
When can we be rid of the grip of the oil barons ?
Mrs Marie Marshall , Shepton Mallet , UK Offshore wind is only viable if heavily subsidised and the huge costs of transmission infrastructure from remote locations and the cost of keeping back up supplies on standby are charged to others .
The real cost of wind power to the consumer is over 25 p per kwh .
Bruce Gawler , Chippenham
I think that wind turbines are a fantastic piece of engineering , they appear graceful on the landscape , all governments should veto any local government body 's that delay the erection of these , nature is a wonderful thing and any short term impact caused during construction will heal , i care about my planet , so lets stop the nanny state , the idle rich that have nothing better to do than cause delays stamp there feet and complain because we will not have a planet soon .
Robert Ringer , Weston Super Mare , Somerset I was part of Global Marine and took part in the installation and commissioning of the world 's first commercial offshore windfarm at Horns Rev , 11 miles off the coast of Denmark .
Then we used a " dumb " jack - up barge ( it had to be towed ) .
The problems we encountered during installation were setting the project timelines back , weather and the fact that it was a learning curve for all .
This vessel certainly makes life safer and easier for all in a hostile environment .
Robert , Cumbria
I think this is a wonderful piece of engineering that will deliver a much needed boost to our cleaner , more greener energy needs .
What still puzzles me is the amount of opposition to these offshore farms .
I cannot see how the wildlife could be severely impacted and if it is then surely the impact is less than the longer term prospects of climate change .
It makes me wonder if it is the same people campaigning against these wind farms , who also demand less use of the coal , gas and nuclear power stations .
No doubt they would also find a complaint about a safe and efficient fission reactor when the technology is introduced .
James Doyle , Leicester , UK Perhaps the designers of this barge should read your excellent article on the use of a parasail in shipping vessels .
It seems that at least three sails could be employed on this type of vessel .
Justin Askins , Naples , FL USA Amazing , but there 's really nothing fundamentally new about these vessels .
The offshore oil and gas industry has been using jack - up rigs for many years in relatively shallow water .
The principle is the same and I 'll warrant that most of the technology for these vessels comes from the offshore hydrocarbon industry .
Interesting , is n't it , how the technology developed in one energy industry is being used in another energy industry that seeks to supplant ( or at least complement ) the first ?
John Levins , Rome , Italy ( ex of Kuwait )
Wind turbines are very good , both onshore and offshore .
The engineering technology behind them is very complicated and quite advanced ( having worked for a wind turbine company in a previous job ) .
Can you please stop referring to them as windmills , as they are not used for milling anymore .
These are wind turbines and not windmills , which use the wind to grind the corn .
Ian Millignton , Loughborough Awesome , I always loved Meccano .
Grant Mair , Dunedin , New Zealand
I have spent a lot of time working in Scandinavia and found the people there can not understand why the UK population are so against wind turbines .
They are proud of them .
I look in awe .
M Jackson , Dudley I 've seen Resolution working off the Skeggy coast - it 's quite a sight to see .
Especially at night .
James Hardaker , Skegness , UK
It 's just a pity the UK shipyards cannot produce such vessels as MPIO Resolution .
They 'd have a lucrative market there .
A point , often forgotten , is the time factor in building these wind farms .
For all that the detractors talk about the relative cost compared to nuclear power , they ignore the decades required in time to build and decommission nuclear , compared to the few months obviously needed for an offshore wind farm .
Why do we always come back to the bottom line of the costs spreadsheet , why not the relative benefit ?
Steve Brereton , York , UK I like to put a wind turbine in my garden .
A planning permission is required , which I think is headache , and costly .
Why does the govt not make it easier , so people like me can get one is fitted , and benefit from it .
Mukarram , Bolton
How long will it take for these ships to off - set the amount of energy it took to fabricate them ?
Joe Harris , Lampeter £ 60 m ?
Is there a reason why the barge could not have been built here ?
Or is it so we can meet our carbon targets here ?
It 's good to know that we and our businesses are moving manufacturing to a country that has such an appalling human rights record .
Thom , Reigate
Why do we have to use foreign shipyards , whatever happened to our own ?
Laurie Chapman , Cambridge , England Amazing engineering .
Bring it on wind , wave , tidal , solar , geothermal etc .
We 're awash with free energy , the sooner we harness enough to replace carbon fuels AND the expensive and polluting nuclear power the sooner we will have a warm , cosy , clean and secure energy supply without having to rely on or be at the whim of hostile gas / oil exporters .
Simon Wolfers , Harlech , Cymru Impressive stuff , and it 's got me intrigued .
How are the turbines held in place on the sea bed - what stops them falling over ?
Alistiae , Sheffield
How are turbines built at sea ?
Well , we 're not much wiser after reading this item .
What are the wind turbine foundations made from ?
How are they fixed to the sea bed ?
How is the tower fixed to the foundations ?
Lots of detail about six - legged ships but the basic question posed in the main page link is unanswered .
Michael , Amersham - England Maybe new to wind turbines , but the offshore oil industry has been using jack - ups for decades .
All over the world .
Hundreds of them .
Did we really keep it so quiet ?
Don Wilson , Roppongi , Tokyo , Japan
Whilst I agree that we need to build these offshore wind farms , why on earth are we buying specialist ships made in China ?
Surely we have plenty of ship yards more than capable of building these ships in the UK .
The government should do everything in its power to ensure the ships are designed and built locally to support the shipbuilding industry and communities in the UK .
David Ewbank , Ashby de la Zouch , UK I 'm all for renewable energy , but how much energy is required , and what is the environmental impact , of building these barges , let alone the wind turbines ?
Have the environmentalists and politicians really considered all the costs ?
Jon , Ipswich I love the idea of offshore windfarms , not only does this aid renewable energy but this will help the marine ecosystems recover from the over fishing of the last generation and provide long term spawning grounds for much of our marine wildlife which needs our protection also .
Jez , Portsmouth The Resolution is soon to start installing 54 turbines on the bases put in the Wash last year .
It will bring six from Denmark , install them and return to Denmark for another six - what a carbon footprint .
Roy Malt , Skegness
You forgot to mention that it fell over recently .
Alex , Cumbria
This project , and others like it , can make an immense contribution to what should be a determined and single - minded policy of energy self - sufficiency .
This is a volatile world in which we are increasingly becoming dependant on others for our energy .
Tomorrow 's conflicts will be fought through gas pipes and energy reserves , so let 's be dependant on no-one .
Mike Wilks , Ruardean , Forest of Dean
This is an irrelevance - we should build our own wave platforms to operate off the Outer Hebrides .
What happened to Salter 's Duck and other relevant technologies that are more suited our maritime geography ?
R Burgess , Manchester I do n't care if it's a little more expensive to produce .
That will only be short term until more and more wind farms enter into service .
Renewable energy sources MUST be of the highest priority .
Nuclear core bunkers , covering them in thick concrete and leaving them for our children to sort out is NOT an answer , and makes me feel quite sick that my generation have promoted this .
Ian , Bristol Shame there was no mention of the engineers .
Fiona , Essex I just wonder if the maintenance of these structures will require equally as large an investment in specialised equipment ?
Turbines will go wrong and weather being what it is will cause WOW ( Waiting on Weather ) to be a major performance issue as it is for the oil & gas Business offshore .
You can imagine the HSSE issues getting people up there to work on repairs and routine care .

Science & Exploration Mars Express probes the Red Planet ’s most unusual deposits
01/11/2007 898 views 0 likes
The radar system on ESA ’s Mars Express has uncovered new details about some of the most mysterious deposits on Mars : The Medusae Fossae Formation .
It has given the first direct measurement of the depth and electrical properties of these materials , providing new clues about their origin .
The Medusae Fossae Formation ( MFF ) are unique deposits on Mars .
They are also an enigma .
Found near the equator , along the divide between the highlands and lowlands , they may represent some of the youngest deposits on the surface of the planet .
This is inferred from the marked lack of impact craters dotting this terrain , unlike on older terrain .
Mars Express has been collecting data from this region using its Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) .
Between March 2006 and April 2007 , Mars Express orbited the region many times , taking radar soundings as it went .
For the first time , these radar soundings revealed the depth of the MFF layers , because of the time it took for the radar beam to pass through the top layers and bounce off the solid rock beneath .
“ We did n’t know just how thick the MFF deposits really were ” says Thomas Watters , lead author of the results at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies , National Air and Space Museum , Smithsonian Institution , USA .
Topographic divide between the Martian highlands and lowlands “ Some investigators thought they might be a thin veneer overlaying topographic rises in the lowlands .
The new data show that the MFF are massive deposits over 2.5 km thick in some places where MARSIS orbits pass over them , ” Watters added .
The MFF deposits intrigue scientists because they are associated with regions that absorb certain wavelengths of Earth - based radar .
This had led to them being called ‘ stealth ’ regions because they give no radar echo .
The affected wavelengths are 3.5 to 12.6 centimetres .
MARSIS , however , works at wavelengths of 50 to over 100 metres .
At these wavelengths , the radar waves mostly pass through the MFF deposits creating subsurface echoes when the radar signal reflects off the plains material beneath .
A variety of scenarios have been proposed for the origin and composition of these deposits .
Firstly , they could be volcanic ash deposits from now - buried vents or other nearby volcanoes .
Second , they could be deposits of wind - blown materials eroded from other martian rocks .
Thirdly , they could be ice - rich deposits , somewhat similar to the layered ice deposits at the poles of the planet , but formed when the spin axis of Mars tilts over , making the equatorial region colder .
MARSIS Radargram
Deciding between these scenarios is not easy , even with the new data .
The MARSIS data reveal the electrical properties of the layers .
These suggest that the layers could be poorly packed , fluffy or dusty material .
However it is difficult to understand how porous material from wind - blown dust can be kilometres thick and yet not be compacted under the weight of the overlying material .
On the other hand , although the electrical properties are consistent with water ice layers , there is no other strong evidence for the presence of ice today in the equatorial regions of Mars .
“ If there is water ice at the equator of Mars , it must be buried at least several metres below the surface , ” says Jeffrey Plaut , MARSIS Co-Principal Investigator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , USA .
This is because the water vapour pressure on Mars is so low that any ice near the surface would quickly evaporate .
So , the mystery of Mars ’s Medusae Fossae Formation continues .
“ It is still early in the game .
We may get cleverer with our analysis and interpretation or we may only know when we go there with a drill and see for ourselves , ” says Plaut .
Giovanni Picardi at the University of Rome , La Sapienza , Principal Investigator of the experiment , says , “ ’ Not only is MARSIS providing excellent scientific results but the team is also working on the processing techniques that will allow for more accurate evaluation of the characteristics of the subsurface layers and their constituent material .
Hence , the possible extension of the mission will be very important to increase the number of observations over the regions of interest and improve the accuracy of the evaluations .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
From the outside it ’s an ordinary , red - brick house in a terraced row , not unlike tens of thousands of others scattered across Britain .
But on the inside , Jean Preston ’s spartan Oxford home contained works of art of international significance , carefully acquired over a lifetime and haphazardly displayed .
Preston , a thrifty 77 - year - old spinster who rode the bus and ate frozen meals , died in 2006 .
But art experts and auctioneers have now completed the sale of the exceptional works hoarded in her modest home .
The auctions have raised an estimated 4 million pounds ( $ 7.95 million ) , according to valuers , about 20 times the price of the house they were kept in , stunning experts and Preston ’s relatives alike .
Among the treasures were two paintings by Fra Angelico , the 15th century Italian Renaissance master , that were the missing pieces of an eight - part altar decoration .
They were sold together for $ 3.4 million and are expected to be returned to the Uffizi Gallery , Florence ’s famed art museum .
“ We knew we were going to a house that contained some important works , ” Guy Schwinge of Dukes art auctioneers in Dorchester , which helped with the sale , told Reuters .
“ But I was amazed to see quite how many treasures there were ...
The Fra Angelicos were behind the bedroom door and we only spotted them on the way out . ”
Hanging in the kitchen was a 19th century watercolor by pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti , and in the sitting room , above an electric fire , a work by Sir Edward Burne - Jones .
Those two , estimated to be worth $ 2 million , have been saved for Britain and are expected to go on display at Oxford ’s Ashmolean Museum , Schwinge said .
Another hidden treasure was a rare edition of the works of Chaucer that was too big to fit on Preston ’s bookshelf and was found buried in a wardrobe .
It sold for nearly $ 150,000 .
“ We often go to fabulous homes to evaluate artworks , but in this case the house was just so modest from the outside , and had very modest decor on the inside too , ” said Schwinge .
“ It ’s just rare to stumble across something quite so breathtaking . ”
Preston , who worked as a librarian for much of her life , inherited many of the works from her father , a keen collector .
Her relatives were stunned by the artworks she had tucked away .
“ My aunt bought her clothes from a catalog , ate frozen meals and went everywhere on the bus , ” the Daily Mail newspaper quoted one of them as saying .
“ Who would have thought she had the equivalent of a winning lottery ticket in her spare room all these years ? ”

She won the hearts of the British public and put size - zero models to shame with her modest curves .
But despite becoming the star of the television series Make Me A Supermodel , Jen Hunter , 24 , has been forced out of her modelling contract - for being too large .
The size 12 blonde was booked by a fashion agency after impressing voters for refusing to diet when judges in the Channel Five series said she was fat .
Cape London Model Management helped secure Miss Hunter work as the face of mobile phone giant Nokia and cosmetics company Avon .
But she has faced repeated knock - backs at catwalk castings .
Yesterday , the mother - of - one from Wigan , Lancs . , said she was quitting the agency to join one for larger - sized women - despite being below average size .
The decision comes as the mainstream fashion industry comes under increasing pressure to ban size - zero models .
Miss Hunter , who is 5ft 11in and weighs 11 stone , said : " I 'm grateful to the Cape Model agency for taking me on when other agencies would n't .
They secured me some great contracts .
" However , they are a mainstream agency and when I went into castings I saw very few size 12 models and came up against the same old prejudice .
" I just did n't feel comfortable so I decided to change to Excel Models which is a plus size agency . "
Miss Hunter , a divorcee , was shocked by judges , including model Rachel Hunter , who described her as " fat , lazy and greedy " while competing in the 2006 reality show .

But although she was urged to lose weight , Miss Hunter refused , saying she would not " hang her head in shame " and drop three sizes just for the fashion industry .
Despite being voted the leading female by the public , the stunning barmaid was not given a contract by chosen agency Select , who instead booked sub - zero Marianne Berglund - known as the " walking skeleton " .
Cape Management - a mainstream agency - then stepped in to offer Miss Hunter work - the first size 12 on their books .

But her decision to quit to seek employment with plus - size agencies highlights the need for a radical shake - up in the fashion industry .
Despite increasing pressure to ban size - zero models for creating a bad impression for younger women , the average model size is still a size six to eight .

In contrast , the average size of the UK woman is between 14 to 16 .
Although models have always been thinner than average , 25 years ago the size difference was eight per cent .
It is now 23 per cent .
The need for models to conform to the skeleton look has resulted in two deaths in the past year .
Both Ana Carolina Reston , 21 , of Brazil , and Luisel Ramos , 23 , of Uruguay , died of starvation .
Last week , an inquiry by British Fashion Council concluded that models aged under 16 should be banned from the catwalk .
But the report failed to demand a ban on size - zero models , and instead said all models should be medically examined to make sure they are fit and healthy .
A spokeswoman for eating disorder charity Beat said : " We are very sad to hear that Jen Hunter feels she can't succeed in the mainstream fashion industry .
" This shows that there is still a lot of work to be done .
" It is only through the fashion industry acting as a whole , from designer to retailer , that changes will be made . "
Soll Wasserstoff eines
Tages tatsächlich fossile Brennstoffe in unseren Autos ersetzen , muss erst noch ein Weg gefunden werden , den energiereichen Stoff wirklich kostengünstig und umweltfreundlich herzustellen .
Eine Möglichkeit ist die Verwendung von Elektrizität , um Wassermoleküle in Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff zu spalten – und dieser Strom kommt am besten aus alternativen Energiequellen wie beispielsweise Windturbinen .
Allerdings ist dieses so genannte Elektrolyse - Verfahren noch immer zu teuer , um wirklich weitläufig eingesetzt werden zu können .
Forscher beim US - Technologiekonzern
GE haben nun den Prototyp einer unkompliziert herstellbaren Maschine vorgestellt , mit der Wasserstoff mit Hilfe der Elektrolyse für ungefähr drei Dollar pro Kilogramm herstellbar sein soll .
Zu diesem Preis wäre der Treibstoff ungefähr so teuer wie Benzin es jetzt in den USA ist , während man mit anderen gängigen Wasserstoff - Produktionsverfahren noch mindestens acht Dollar pro Kilogramm bezahlt .
Mit dem billigen Wasserstoff könnte der Traum einer " Wasserstoff - Wirtschaft " Wirklichkeit werden , in der auch ganz normale Autos mit dem sauberen Treibstoff fahren .
Geräte zur Elektrolyse sind relativ einfach aufgebaut : Wasser wird mit einem Kalium - Hydroxid - Elektrolyt gemischt und fließt dann an einer Reihe Elektroden vorbei .
Die Elektrizität veranlasst dabei die Wassermoleküle , sich in Wasserstoff und Sauerstoffgas aufzuspalten , die aus der Lösung aufsteigen .
Der Vorgang ist ein immer wieder gerne durchgeführtes Experiment für den Chemieunterricht , allerdings lassen sich große Mengen an Wasserstoff derzeit wesentlich billiger aus Erdgas herstellen .
Die grundsätzliche Effizienz des Elektrolyse - Prozesses lässt sich jedoch kaum steigern , wie Richard Bourgeois , Elektrolyse - Projektleiter bei GE Global Research im US - Bundesstaat New York , sagt .
" Man kann das heute kaum billiger machen .
Deshalb haben wir uns nun darangemacht , die Investitionskosten zu senken . "
Denn diese sind noch sehr hoch : Heutige Elektrolyse - Geräte bestehen aus Metallplatten , die von Hand zusammengenietet werden , dazwischen befinden sich Dichtungen .
Die ganze Elektrodeneinheit ist normalerweise in einer Metallkammer verbaut , die aus dem gleichen Metall wie die Elektroden selbst besteht .
Das Material ist teuer , und der Zusammenbau verbraucht teure Arbeitskraft .
Bourgeois ' Forscherteam hat es nun geschafft , einen
Weg zu finden , wie man die Elektrolyse - Kammer künftig aus Kunststoff aufbauen könnte .
Dazu kommt ein von GE entwickeltes Material namens Noryl zum Einsatz , das nicht gegen das hochalkalische Kalium - Hydroxid anfällig ist .
Durch die leichte Formbarkeit des Kunststoffes lassen sich die neuen Elektrolyse - Geräte deutlich günstiger herstellen .
In dem Kunststoffgehäuse erledigen die gewohnten Metallelektroden weiter ihren Job .
Da GE allerdings insgesamt weniger Elektrodenmaterial verwenden wollte , wurde die Reaktionsfähigkeit ihrer Oberfläche gesteigert .
Um dies zu erreichen , liehen sich die GE - Forscher einen Sprühbezug , der sonst bei Maschinenteilen von Flugzeugmotoren verwendet wird , um die Elektroden mit einem selbst entwickelten Nickel - basierten Katalysator zu überziehen , der eine große Oberfläche besitzt .
GE hat die Technologie in Prototypen - Form bereits demonstriert und arbeitet derzeit an einem größeren Produktionsmodul , mit dem sich ein Kilogramm Wasserstoff pro Stunde produzieren lassen soll .
Eine Maschine dieser Größe könnte dann an eine kleine Stromquelle angeschlossen werden , um Wasserstoff quasi " nebenher " zu produzieren .
Die Technik könnte potenziell sogar derart stark skaliert werden , dass eine Art Wasserstoff - Tankstelle möglich wird , die ihren Wasserstoff selbst produziert .
Die neue GE - Elektrolyse- Maschine soll in ein paar Jahren in Produktion gehen .
" Man kann zwar viel über den Wechsel in die Wasserstoff - Wirtschaft reden , aber solange die Wirtschaftlichkeit nicht gegeben ist , bewegt sich dort nichts " , meint Bourgeois .
" Unser Gerät reduziert die Investitionskosten für Elektrolyse - Systeme derart , dass man sie kaufen und über eine Anzahl von Jahren abschreiben kann .
Dadurch können wir mit Benzin konkurrieren . "
Paul Bakke , Elektroingenieur und Programmmanager beim US - Energieministerium , hält eine billige Elektrolyse - Maschine für eine zentrale Komponente der Wasserstoff - Zukunft : " So weit ich weiß , ist GE der einzige Anbieter , der dieses Problem anzugehen versucht .
Sollte GE erfolgreich dabei sein , diese Geräte mit hoher Zuverlässigkeit und vor allem günstig zu produzieren , wird die Barriere durchbrochen , die derzeit bei Elektrolyse - Geräten vorliegt : Die Investitionskosten . "
Bakke hält die GE - Maschine für ein wichtiges Puzzlestück .
Sie sei zwar nicht die einzige Methode , Wasserstoff zu produzieren und die Umwandlung von Erdgas eine gute Überbrückung : " Doch wenn wir die Umweltbedenken aus der Welt schaffen wollen , müssen wir auf eine Elektrolyse setzen , die sich aus Windturbinen und Solaranlagen speist . "

U.S. house prices " likely would have to fall considerably " to return to a normal relationship with rents , says a study by one former and two current Federal Reserve economists .
The study , which does n't necessarily reflect the views of Fed policy makers , suggests prices would have to fall 15 % over five years , assuming rents rose 4 % a year .
House prices would have to fall further if the adjustment took place more quickly .

1 . You ’ll begin to see the world Differently – with a camera in your pocket or bag you ’ll find yourself looking for opportunities to use it and when you start looking at the world in that way you ’ll start to see if differently .
2 . You ’ll take more pictures – it sounds obvious – and it is – but the result of more pictures is that you ’ll improve your averages of taking a good one !
3 . You ’ll be more likely to get out of Auto mode – the more you use your camera and see your results the more you ’ll find yourself wanting to stretch yourself out of auto mode into using the full potential of your camera .
4 . You ’ll get to know your camera – the more you use your camera the more familiar you ’ll become with it and what it ’s capable of .
I find that after an intense week with my camera that changing settings becomes second nature and much faster .
5 . You ’ll miss less ‘ Kodak moments ’ – you do n’t realize just how many opportunities you miss to capture moments photographically until you start carrying your camera around .
While I ’m a big believer in not relying upon your photography to ‘ create ’ memories – I think that images are a wonderful way to help remember stories and celebrate life .
Images are good for the soul – do n’t miss the opportunity to create them in 2008 .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Alan Johnston , the BBC journalist held hostage in Gaza , was freed early on Wednesday after a late - night deal between the ruling Hamas Islamists and the al Qaeda - inspired clan group that kidnapped him in March .
“ It is just the most fantastic thing to be free .
It was an appalling experience , ” he told the British public broadcaster from the home of local Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his 114 - day ordeal at the hands of the shadowy Army of Islam .
Haniyeh , whose movement routed the forces of the secular , Western - backed Palestinian president last month to seize full control of the enclave , said the outcome “ confirms ( Hamas ) is serious in imposing security and stability and maintaining law and order in this very dear part of our homeland . ”
Khaled Meshaal , Hamas ’s overall leader in exile , hailed the success and told Reuters it contrasted with “ anarchy ” that prevailed when the Fatah faction of West Bank - based President Mahmoud Abbas was operating in the Gaza Strip .
Johnston , the only Western correspondent based full - time in the troubled Gaza Strip , said he sensed his captors felt new pressure once Hamas seized control in fighting three weeks ago .
Negotiators , who were backed up by Hamas fighters cordoning off the Gaza City stronghold of the kidnappers , said the final deal was clinched by a senior Muslim cleric issuing a fatwa , or religious edict , for Johnston ’s release .
No ransom was paid nor other conditions attached .
The group had previously demanded Britain and other states free prisoners .
“ I dreamt many times of being free and always woke up back in that room .
Now it really is over and it is indescribably good to be out , ” said Johnston , a Scot who turned 45 in captivity .
WORST WEEKS
Describing it as the worst 16 weeks of his life and “ like being buried alive ” with “ dangerous and unpredictable ” captors , he later told a news conference with Haniyeh : “ It ’s almost hard to believe that I ’m not going to wake up in that room . ”
He said he had twice fallen sick and was once chained for 24 hours but only in the last half hour did they “ hit me a bit . ”
Johnston said he was kept in a shuttered room for the last 3 months of his captivity and could not see the sun .
He feared for his life immediately after being seized on March 12 , as well as when he was filmed wearing an explosive vest by captors who warned Hamas forces not to try to free him .

British diplomats , whose government does not recognize Hamas authority in Gaza , arrived from Jerusalem and Johnston crossed the border into Israel shortly before 8 a.m. ( 0500 GMT ) .
Britain , Israel and other international powers recognize Abbas ’s new emergency government in the West Bank as the legitimate authority for the Palestinians .
But Hamas ’s Haniyeh refuses to accept his dismissal last month as prime minister .
Johnston , smiling and looking drawn but well , was embraced by BBC colleagues after he arrived by car at Haniyeh ’s home amid a scrum of well - wishers and security men .
After their joint news conference , Haniyeh draped Johnston in the Palestinian flag .

He later offer the reporter a traditional Arab breakfast .
Johnston , who had followed events by radio , thanked people round the world and colleagues for support during his ordeal .
The BBC said in a statement it was “ extremely relieved . ”
Johnston ’s family in Scotland said they were “ overjoyed . ”
Referring to Fatah , Meshaal said of Johnston ’s release : “ It showed the difference between the era in which a group used to encourage and commit security anarchy and chaos and the current situation in which Hamas is seeking to stabilize security . ”
The Palestinian ambassador to London , who represents the government Abbas set up last month after dismissing Haniyeh ’s administration , said Hamas wanted to “ capitalize ” on the deal .
But he said : “ The credit goes to the Palestinian people . ”
The 3ivx high performance MPEG - 4 audio / video codec ( MP4 ) for Microsoft Windows is vulnerable to stack overflow , with shellcode proof of concept published by SYS 49152 ( a C64 nostalgic like me , undoubtedly ) .
Surely affected versions are 4.5.1 , quite widespread , and the latest 5.0.1 .
The most likely exploitation scenario involves user downloading a movie clip in MP4 format from an untrusted source ( did you say p0rn ? ) and consuming it through a media player which relies on the 3ivx codec ( the PoC above exploits Media Player Classic , for instance ) .
Notice that the file name extension does n't need to be " .mp4 " , as mp4 streams can be wrapped inside container formats such as ASF or AVI .
Of course , if the vulnerable media player installed also its own browser plugin , you can be owned instantly just stumbling upon an untrusted web page , unless you already took proper countermeasures .
How to protect yourself
Open your Windows Control Panel .
Select Add or Remove Programs .
Locate the 3ivx D4 entry , select it and click the Remove button .
Optionally , if you could n't locate any 3ivx D4 item , check if you 've got 3ivx.dll and / or 3ivxVfWCode.dll in your % WinDir % \System32 \ folder ; if you can find these files , delete or rename them .
If you still need to play MP4 files and you find your system can't do it anymore , you may want to install the excellent open source VLC Media Player , which uses a different codec .
Slop ... er... happy surfing ;)
Today the movement shows signs of coming apart beneath its leaders .
It is not merely that none of the 2008 Republican front - runners come close to measuring up to President Bush in the eyes of the evangelical faithful , although it would be hard to find a cast of characters more ill fit for those shoes : a lapsed - Catholic big-city mayor ; a Massachusetts Mormon ; a church - skipping Hollywood character actor ; and a political renegade known for crossing swords with the Rev. Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell .
Nor is the problem simply that the Democratic presidential front - runners — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Senator Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards — sound like a bunch of tent - revival Bible thumpers compared with the Republicans .
The 2008 election is just the latest stress on a system of fault lines that go much deeper .
The phenomenon of theologically conservative Christians plunging into political activism on the right is , historically speaking , something of an anomaly .
Most evangelicals shrugged off abortion as a Catholic issue until after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision .
But in the wake of the ban on public - school prayer , the sexual revolution and the exodus to the suburbs that filled the new megachurches , protecting the unborn became the rallying cry of a new movement to uphold the traditional family .
Now another confluence of factors is threatening to tear the movement apart .
The extraordinary evangelical love affair with Bush has ended , for many , in heartbreak over the Iraq war and what they see as his meager domestic accomplishments .
That disappointment , in turn , has sharpened latent divisions within the evangelical world — over the evangelical alliance with the Republican Party , among approaches to ministry and theology , and between the generations .
The founding generation of leaders like Falwell and Dobson , who first guided evangelicals into Republican politics 30 years ago , is passing from the scene .
Falwell died in the spring .
Paul Weyrich , 65 , the indefatigable organizer who helped build Falwell ’s Moral Majority and much of the rest of the movement , is confined to a wheelchair after losing his legs because of complications from a fall .
Dobson , who is 71 and still vigorous , is already planning for a succession at Focus on the Family ; it is expected to tack toward the less political family advice that is its bread and butter .
The engineers of the momentous 1980s takeover that expunged political and theological moderates from the Southern Baptist Convention are retiring or dying off , too .
And in September , when I called a spokesman for the ailing Presbyterian televangelist D. James Kennedy , another pillar of the Christian conservative movement , I learned that Kennedy had “ gone home to the Lord ” at 2 a.m. that morning .
Meanwhile , a younger generation of evangelical pastors — including the widely emulated preachers Rick Warren and Bill Hybels — are pushing the movement and its theology in new directions .
There are many related ways to characterize the split : a push to better this world as well as save eternal souls ; a focus on the spiritual growth that follows conversion rather than the yes - or - no moment of salvation ; a renewed attention to Jesus ’ teachings about social justice as well as about personal or sexual morality .
However conceived , though , the result is a new interest in public policies that address problems of peace , health and poverty — problems , unlike abortion and same - sex marriage , where left and right compete to present the best answers .
The backlash on the right against Bush and the war has emboldened some previously circumspect evangelical leaders to criticize the leadership of the Christian conservative political movement .
“ The quickness to arms , the quickness to invade , I think that caused a kind of desertion of what has been known as the Christian right , ” Hybels , whose Willow Creek Association now includes 12,000 churches , told me over the summer .
“ People who might be called progressive evangelicals or centrist evangelicals are one stirring away from a real awakening . ”
The generational and theological shifts in the evangelical world are turning the next election into a credibility test for the conservative Christian establishment .
The current Republican front - runner in national polls , Rudolph W. Giuliani , could hardly be less like their kind of guy : twice divorced , thrice married , estranged from his children and church and a supporter of legalized abortion and gay rights .
Alarmed at the continued strength of his candidacy , Dobson and a group of about 50 evangelical Christians leaders agreed last month to back a third party if Giuliani becomes the Republican nominee .
But polls show that Giuliani is the most popular candidate among white evangelical voters .
He has the support , so far , of a plurality if not a majority of conservative Christians .
If Giuliani captures the nomination despite the threat of an evangelical revolt , it will be a long time before Republican strategists pay attention to the demands of conservative Christian leaders again .
And if the Democrats capitalize on the current demoralization to capture a larger share of evangelical votes , the credibility damage could be just as severe .
Pelosi : Republicans `like ' Iraq War Associated Press
Published : Thursday December 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lashed out at Republicans on Thursday , saying they want the Iraq war to drag on and are ignoring the public 's priorities .
" They like this war .
They want this war to continue , " Pelosi , D - Calif . , told reporters .
She expressed frustration over Republicans ' ability to force majority Democrats to yield ground on taxes , spending , energy , war spending and other matters .
" We thought that they shared the view of so many people in our country that we needed a new direction in Iraq , " Pelosi said at her weekly news conference in the Capitol .
" But the Republicans have made it very clear that this is not just George Bush 's war .
This is the war of the Republicans in Congress . "
Asked to clarify her remarks , Pelosi backed off a bit .
" I should n't say they like the war , " she said .
" They support the war , the course of action that the president is on . "
" And that was a revelation to me , " she said , " because I thought the American people 's voices were so - and still are - so strong in this regard . "
Pelosi , who opposed the U.S. - led invasion from the start , said the war was " a catastrophic mistake . "
Despite being forced to make concessions on multiple fronts , Pelosi said Democrats have been fiscally responsible and attuned to the public 's concerns .
As a result , she said , voters will reward Democrats in next year 's presidential and congressional elections .
Democrats " set a high water mark " on many bills , she said .
" Where we have to come to is a different place , " thanks to the " political reality of not having a president of the United States .
And nothing speaks more clearly to Democratic victories in the next election than when you see this is what is possible . "

BBC News , Sale , Morocco
A family living in a public toilet in Morocco have spent seven years requesting more hygienic accommodation .
The family 's troubles began when their daughter was kidnapped
Their pleas fell on deaf ears , and Aze Adine Ould Baja has had to endure the ignominy of having " toilets , Sidi Ahmed Hajji district " as the official address on his identity papers .
Desperate to do something about their plight , Mr Baja and his wife Khadija Makbout recently went to a local newspaper with their story .
" I was fed up with the situation and I was becoming more and more ill , " Mr Baja explained .
" There were lots of vermin in the toilet .
My little boy is only seven months old but he is also a Moroccan citizen and deserves better . "
But a few days later the local authorities moved in to block up the toilet 's entrance with cement and concrete .
Mr Baja , his wife and three children now find themselves barred from the only home they had .
Health fears
In a narrow street of the old medina in Sale , the city across the river from the capital , Rabat , Mr Baja explained how he fell into poverty and ended living in the public lavatory , where he was the attendant .
He worked at the toilet for 23 years , where he earned less than $ 1 a day .
" How can a married man feed his children on a dollar a day ? " he asked .
When my son went to school , the other children would tease him and call him ' the boy from the toilet '
Khadija Makbout
She was eventually found , but he could not afford to rent the place where he had been living and the family moved into the toilet as a temporary measure .
But with no help from the local government and no money to rent anywhere else they ended up staying .
" My children and I have suffered a lot , " Ms Makbout told the BBC .
" Rats and mice were eating and tearing our clothes and I was afraid that they would harm my baby boy .
I was sleeping near the drain .
" I asked the authority for a place where my children could live but they did nothing . "
Squashed
Mrs Makbout said the she hated seeing her children grow up in this situation .
" When my son went to school , the other children would tease him and call him ' the boy from the toilet ' .
This identity card shows ' toilets ' as an official address
At one stage the family were offered a place to live but it had no roof .
For the moment the family are squashed in with Ms Makbout 's mother .
They have been promised somewhere else by the authorities but so far nothing has happened .
Now destitute , without a job or home , Mr Baja despairs of his situation .
" My children are tired of getting hungry . "
" I have health problems and poor blood circulation , so I have to go to hospital about three times a year .
I could die at any time . "
All these troubles make him consider emigrating .
" When I feel myself dying of hunger and I can see that my children are dirty and suffering - I no longer want to stay in Morocco . "
" I think I may find a boat in Tangier and take my wife and children away .
" Maybe we will die in the middle of the sea .
Maybe it will take us to a place where it is easier to get something to eat .
" But we would find it hard to leave Morocco , because we are proud of it . "
Detained
While investigating the story a police officer came up to me and asked for my identity card .
He took it away and detained me briefly in the local police station .
I also tried to speak to a local government representative about the family 's situation , but no - one was available for an interview .
Although this family 's story is unusual , it is not altogether surprising .
Hundreds of thousands of Moroccans live in abject poverty in slums and shanty towns .
Some of those slums have produced the recent waves of suicide bombers .
It reflects the huge gap between rich and poor in Morocco : some people live in luxury , others live literally in a toilet .
Security in Ten Years
This is a conversation between myself and Marcus Ranum .
It will appear in Information Security Magazine this month .
Bruce Schneier : Predictions are easy and difficult .
Roy Amara of the Institute for the Future once said : “ We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run . ”
Moore ’s Law is easy :
In 10 years , computers will be 100 times more powerful .
My desktop will fit into my cell phone , we ’ll have gigabit wireless connectivity everywhere , and personal networks will connect our computing devices and the remote services we subscribe to .
Other aspects of the future are much more difficult to predict .
I do n’t think anyone can predict what the emergent properties of 100x computing power will bring : new uses for computing , new paradigms of communication .
A 100 x world will be different , in ways that will be surprising .
But throughout history and into the future , the one constant is human nature .
There has n’t been a new crime invented in millennia .
Fraud , theft , impersonation and counterfeiting are perennial problems that have been around since the beginning of society .
During the last 10 years , these crimes have migrated into cyberspace , and over the next 10 , they will migrate into whatever computing , communications and commerce platforms we ’re using .
The nature of the attacks will be different : the targets , tactics and results .
Security is both a trade - off and an arms race , a balance between attacker and defender , and changes in technology upset that balance .
Technology might make one particular tactic more effective , or one particular security technology cheaper and more ubiquitous .
Or a new emergent application might become a favored target .
I do n’t see anything by 2017 that will fundamentally alter this .
Do you ?
Marcus Ranum : I think you ’re right ; at a meta - level , the problems are going to stay the same .
What ’s shocking and disappointing to me is that our responses to those problems also remain the same , in spite of the obvious fact that they are n’t effective .
It ’s 2007 and we have n’t seemed to accept that :
You ca n’t turn shovelware into reliable software by patching it a whole lot .
You should n’t mix production systems with non-production systems .
You actually have to know what ’s going on in your networks .
If you run your computers with an open execution runtime model you ’ll always get viruses , spyware and Trojan horses .
You can pass laws about locking barn doors after horses have left , but it wo n’t put the horses back in the barn .
Security has to be designed in , as part of a system plan for reliability , rather than bolted on afterward .
The list could go on for several pages , but it would be too depressing .
It would be “ Marcus ’ list of obvious stuff that everybody knows but nobody accepts . ”
You missed one important aspect of the problem :
By 2017 , computers will be even more important to our lives , economies and infrastructure .
If you ’re right that crime remains a constant , and I ’m right that our responses to computer security remain ineffective , 2017 is going to be a lot less fun than 2007 was .
I ’ve been pretty dismissive of the concepts of cyberwar and cyberterror .
That dismissal was mostly motivated by my observation that the patchworked and kludgy nature of most computer systems acts as a form of defense in its own right , and that real - world attacks remain more cost - effective and practical for terror purposes .
I ’d like to officially modify my position somewhat : I believe it ’s increasingly likely that we ’ll suffer catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure systems by 2017 .
It probably wo n’t be terrorists that do it , though .
More likely , we ’ll suffer some kind of horrible outage because a critical system was connected to a non-critical system that was connected to the Internet so someone could get to MySpace — ­and that ancillary system gets a piece of malware .
Or it ’ll be some incomprehensibly complex software , layered with Band - Aids and patches , that topples over when some “ merely curious ” hacker pushes the wrong e-button .
We ’ve got some bad - looking trend lines ; all the indicators point toward a system that is more complex , less well - understood and more interdependent .
With infrastructure like that , who needs enemies ?
You ’re worried criminals will continue to penetrate into cyberspace , and I ’m worried complexity , poor design and mismanagement will be there to meet them .
Bruce Schneier : I think we ’ve already suffered that kind of critical systems failure .
The August 2003 blackout that covered much of northeastern United States and Canada­ — 50 million people­ — was caused by a software bug .
I do n’t disagree that things will continue to get worse .
Complexity is the worst enemy of security , and the Internet — and the computers and processes connected to it — ­is getting more complex all the time .
So things are getting worse , even though security technology is improving .
One could say those critical insecurities are another emergent property of the 100x world of 2017 .
Yes , IT systems will continue to become more critical to our infrastructure­ — banking , communications , utilities , defense , everything .
By 2017 , the interconnections will be so critical that it will probably be cost - effective — and low - risk — for a terrorist organization to attack over the Internet .
I also deride talk of cyberterror today , but I do n’t think I will in another 10 years .
While the trends of increased complexity and poor management do n’t look good , there is another trend that points to more security — but neither you nor I is going to like it .
That trend is IT as a service .
By 2017 , people and organizations wo n’t be buying computers and connectivity the way they are today .
The world will be dominated by telcos , large ISPs and systems integration companies , and computing will look a lot like a utility .
Companies will be selling services , not products : email services , application services , entertainment services .
We ’re starting to see this trend today , and it ’s going to take off in the next 10 years .
Where this affects security is that by 2017 , people and organizations wo n’t have a lot of control over their security .
Everything will be handled at the ISPs and in the backbone .
The free - wheeling days of general - use PCs will be largely over .
Think of the iPhone model :
You get what Apple decides to give you , and if you try to hack your phone , they can disable it remotely .
We techie geeks wo n’t like it , but it ’s the future .
The Internet is all about commerce , and commerce wo n’t survive any other way .
Marcus Ranum :
You ’re right about the shift toward services — it ’s the ultimate way to lock in customers .
If you can make it difficult for the customer to get his data back after you ’ve held it for a while , you can effectively prevent the customer from ever leaving .
And of course , customers will be told “ trust us , your data is secure , ” and they ’ll take that for an answer .
The back - end systems that will power the future of utility computing are going to be just as full of flaws as our current systems .
Utility computing will also completely fail to address the problem of transitive trust unless people start shifting to a more reliable endpoint computing platform .
That ’s the problem with where we ’re heading : the endpoints are not going to get any better .
People are attracted to appliances because they get around the headache of system administration ( which , in today ’s security environment , equates to “ endless patching hell ” ) , but underneath the slick surface of the appliance we ’ll have the same insecure nonsense we ’ve got with general - purpose desktops .
In fact , the development of appliances running general - purpose operating systems really does raise the possibility of a software monoculture .
By 2017 , do you think system engineering will progress to the point where we wo n’t see a vendor release a new product and instantly create an installed base of 1 million - plus users with root privileges ?
I do n’t , and that scares me .
So if you ’re saying the trend is to continue putting all our eggs in one basket and blithely trusting that basket , I agree .
Another trend I see getting worse is government IT know - how .
At the rate outsourcing has been brain - draining the federal workforce , by 2017 there wo n’t be a single government employee who knows how to do anything with a computer except run PowerPoint and Web surf .
Joking aside , the result is that the government ’s critical infrastructure will be almost entirely managed from the outside .
The strategic implications of such a shift have scared me for a long time ; it amounts to a loss of control over data , resources and communications .
Bruce Schneier :
You ’re right about the endpoints not getting any better .
I ’ve written again and again how measures like two - factor authentication are n’t going to make electronic banking any more secure .
The problem is if someone has stuck a Trojan on your computer , it does n’t matter how many ways you authenticate to the banking server ; the Trojan is going to perform illicit transactions after you authenticate .
It ’s the same with a lot of our secure protocols .
SSL , SSH , PGP and so on all assume the endpoints are secure , and the threat is in the communications system .
But we know the real risks are the endpoints .
And a misguided attempt to solve this is going to dominate computing by 2017 .
I mentioned software - as - a - service , which you point out is really a trick that allows businesses to lock up their customers for the long haul .
I pointed to the iPhone , whose draconian rules about who can write software for that platform accomplishes much the same thing .
We could also point to Microsoft ’s Trusted Computing , which is being sold as a security measure but is really another lock - in mechanism designed to keep users from switching to “ unauthorized ” software or OSes .
I ’m reminded of the post - 9/11 anti-terrorist hysteria — we ’ve confused security with control , and instead of building systems for real security , we ’re building systems of control .
Think of ID checks everywhere , the no-fly list , warrantless eavesdropping , broad surveillance , data mining , and all the systems to check up on scuba divers , private pilots , peace activists and other groups of people .
These give us negligible security , but put a whole lot of control in the government ’s hands .
Computing is heading in the same direction , although this time it is industry that wants control over its users .
They ’re going to sell it to us as a security system — they may even have convinced themselves it will improve security — but it ’s fundamentally a control system .
And in the long run , it ’s going to hurt security .
Imagine we ’re living in a world of Trustworthy Computing , where no software can run on your Windows box unless Microsoft approves it .
That brain drain you talk about wo n’t be a problem , because security wo n’t be in the hands of the user .
Microsoft will tout this as the end of malware , until some hacker figures out how to get his software approved .
That ’s the problem with any system that relies on control :
Once you figure out how to hack the control system , you ’re pretty much golden .
So instead of a zillion pesky worms , by 2017 we ’re going to see fewer but worse super worms that sail past our defenses .
By then , though , we ’ll be ready to start building real security .
As you pointed out , networks will be so embedded into our critical infrastructure — ­and there ’ll probably have been at least one real disaster by then — that we ’ll have no choice .
The question is how much we ’ll have to dismantle and build over to get it right .
Marcus Ranum : I agree regarding your gloomy view of the future .
It ’s ironic the counterculture “ hackers ” have enabled ( by providing an excuse ) today ’s run-patch - run - patch - reboot software environment and tomorrow ’s software Stalinism .
I do n’t think we ’re going to start building real security .
Because real security is not something you build — ­it ’s something you get when you leave out all the other garbage as part of your design process .
Purpose - designed and purpose - built software is more expensive to build , but cheaper to maintain .
The prevailing wisdom about software return on investment does n’t factor in patching and patch - related downtime , because if it did , the numbers would stink .
Meanwhile , I ’ve seen purpose - built Internet systems run for years without patching because they did n’t rely on bloated components .
I doubt industry will catch on .
The future will be captive data running on purpose - built back - end systems — and it wo n’t be a secure future , because turning your data over always decreases your security .
Few possess the understanding of complexity and good design principles necessary to build reliable or secure systems .
So , effectively , outsourcing — or other forms of making security someone else ’s problem — will continue to seem attractive .
That does n’t look like a very rosy future to me .
It ’s a shame , too , because getting this stuff correct is important .
You ’re right that there are going to be disasters in our future .
I think they ’re more likely to be accidents where the system crumbles under the weight of its own complexity , rather than hostile action .
Will we even be able to figure out what happened , when it happens ?
Folks , the captains have illuminated the “ Fasten your seat belts ” sign .
We predict bumpy conditions ahead .

Psychologist : Gitmo detainee to be released is ' broken into pieces ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

The first Guantanamo Bay detainee to be convicted by an American military tribunal will be released from prison on Saturday -- but harsh treatment in US custody leave him ill - prepared to readjust to normal life , a psychologist says .
Australian - born David Hicks , who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 , plead guilty earlier this year to charges of providing material support for al- Qaeda terrorists .
As part of his plea deal , Hicks was transferred to Australia to serve out the remainder of his sentence .
Appearing in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Monash University psychology professor James Ogloff said that Guantanamo had left a broken Hicks to fend for himself in the free world .
" In some very restrictive regimes , and Guantánamo Bay will fall into that category , the environments are actually designed to break people down , " said Ogloff .
" There 's no long term goal of rehabilitating people or having them return to the community .
So the issues that the individual faces is , in fact , being broken into pieces and having to really be put back together . "
During his time at Guantanamo , Hicks alleges that he was beaten , sedated and forced to take unidentified medication , among other abuses .
Although Ogloff had never personally assessed Hicks , he described conditions typical of prisoners kept for prolonged periods in solitary confinement .
" The become very anxious and nervous , " he said .
" The vast majority of people develop headaches , have problems sleeping , become angry and irritable , have emotional mood swings , high degrees of depression . "
The stigma of his conviction will also affect his rehabilitation , said the psychologist .
" The infamy now that Mr. Hicks feels , " said Ogloff , " will in fact exacerbate the problems he 's experienced and make it all the more difficult for him to return to any semblance of a normal life in the community . "
Australian Broadcasting Corporation security correspondent Leigh Sales said there were still unanswered questions about the depth of Hicks ' involvement with supporting terrorism .
" There 's a few question marks over what he was actually doing during that post September 11 period , " said Sales .
" But the basic facts are that David Hicks did spend time training with al - Qaeda and he was in Afghanistan with the Taliban after September 11 ... Was he a true believer ?
Was he someone that would have actually committed an act of terrorism ?
Or was he , as his lawyers and father claim , just a guy looking for adventure ? "

Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi ( Fortune , Empress of the World )
Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi is the first part of Carl Orff 's brilliant Carmina Burana - a work which sets poems written by disreputable 13th century monks and scholars to modern orchestral and choral music .
Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi means " Fortune , Empress of the World " , and is about fate .
It consists of two movements , " O Fortuna " and " Fortune Plango Vulnera " .
Both describe the horror of fate 's unfair meddling in human life , and its influence on the lowly and powerful alike .
Orff has written dramatic and insidious music to illustrate the themes .
I present below the text of the poems with an english translation , and intersperse my comments on the music .
1. O Fortuna
The piece begins with its most recognisable movement - the mighty " O Fortuna " .
This is known to couch potatoes around the world as the " Old Spice " music , as it memorably accompanied the old advert for the rancid aftershave .
The low instruments of the orchestra thump out a descending three note line .
After the first note has captured the audience 's attention , the brass and choir enter .
The " O " is a startling discord , and the " Fortuna " is similarly jarring .
The pattern is repeated for the " velut luna " .
Then the powerful bass note sounds again , and the choir and the rest of the orchestra enter one more .
This time , the 6 - part harmony is less jagged , but it is pitched much higher - and the final " - lis " is held out for several beats .
O Fortuna O Fortune , velut luna like the moon statu variabilis , you are changeable ,
The arrangement now changes .
The mood is still one of anguish .
As the text changes to consider the specifics of the writer 's views on fate , the music becomes more subtle , but remains eerie .
The time signature changes from the laborious 3/1 of the introductory lines to a jerky , unsettling 3/ 2 .
Each line of the text takes two bars of the score ; and pair of bars begins with a shadow of the shuddering bass notes from the introduction .
This lends structure , and emphasises the start of each line .
The choir is in unison and the woodwinds track them through the verse .
Each note of the choir 's part is deliberate and is accented heavily , which stresses each and every syllable , making each word crystal clear .
The other instruments dart around rapidly and quietly , lending an air of urgency .
A huge contrast and sudden contrast to the bombast that precedes the section .
semper crescis ever waxing aut decrescis ; and waning ; vita detestabilis hateful life nunc obdurat first oppresses et tunc curat and then soothes ludo mentis aciem , as fancy takes it ;
egestatem , poverty potestatem and power dissolvit ut glaciem .
it melts them like ice .
Now the choir moves into a simple discord , which shifts back into unison on the closing syllables of .
This marks the end of the first verse .
The second verse continues in the same vein as the first - the same notes and phrasing are used throughout .
Sors immanis Fate - monstrous et inanis , and empty , rota tu volubilis , you whirling wheel , status malus , you are malevolent , vana salus well - being is vain semper dissolubilis , and always fades to nothing , obumbrata shadowed et velata and veiled michi quoque niteris ; you plague me too ; nunc per ludum now through the game dorsum nudum I bring my bare back fero tui sceleris .
to your villainy .
The last verse of this movement is again loud , which comes as a shock after the quiet contemplation of the last two .
The sense of urgency instilled there breaks out into a kind of musical panic .
The arrangement has the same structure , but the soft bass note is again a great thump of bass instruments and drum at the start and end of each line .
The tenors and sopranos of the choir are now a full octave higher .
The darting counterpoint from earlier has lost its juddering hesitancy and gained harmonic complexity .
Sors salutis
Fate is against me et virtutis in health michi nunc contraria , and virtue , est affectus driven on et defectus and weighted down , semper in angaria .
always enslaved .
Hac in hora
So at this hour sine mora without delay corde pulsum tangite ; pluck the vibrating strings ; quod per sortem since Fate sternit fortem , strikes down the strong man ,
At this point , things are ratcheted up another notch .
An open cymbal now joins the thumping introduction to each line .
The choir 's octave interval s become a scrunchy harmony .
Everything grows louder still , moving from forte to fortissimo
Finally , the structure which has been observed for much of this movement breaks down completely .
The choir splits up for the " omnes " , the tenor and soprano parts soar away and the bass and alto parts maintain the rhythm .
All the words of this line are sung over 5 bars rather than the 2 or 4 used elsewhere .
At this point the choir come back together for a unison " - te " , which is held for a further 7 bars of fortississimo , maximum volume .
The darting counterpoint from before is now in the ascendant , and is revealed to be reminiscent of a spinning wheel .
The cymbal crashes that marked the start of each verse now speak of the mechanism driving this wheel of fate .
The final gathering chord is underlined by an extra pulse of energy from the choir , a drum - roll and a rattling triangle .
mecum omnes plangite !
everyone weep with me !
2. Fortune plango vulnera
The next movement deals directly with the fickle , cyclical nature of fate .
In three verses , it describes how the poet 's fortunes change , how he fell from his place in the world ; and his resentment of those currently favoured .
It ends with a warning that the wheel of fate will turn again , and today 's champions will face ruin soon enough
Each of the three verses is arranged identically , sung to the same tune with the same accompaniment .
The piano is prominent throughout the orchestration .
The first four lines of each verse are accompanied by simple , sustained octave chords from the orchestra .
The choir enters on the beat after this chord has been introduced at lines 1 and 3 .
The time signature is 4/2 , but the last bar of lines 2 and 4 are cut short , forming a 1 / 2 bar .
This is enough to make the rhythms of this section irregular , but they fit the natural rhythm of the words perfectly .
The tenors and basses sing the first four lines in unison , their voices rising to the start of lines 2 and 4 and falling to their ends .
The tune is influenced by chant , but runs along much more rapidly .
Fortune plango vulnera I bemoan the wounds of Fortune stillantibus ocellis with weeping eyes , quod sua michi munera for the gifts she made me subtrahit rebellis .
she perversely takes away .
The male voices continue for the next four lines , but the arrangement changes .
The rhythm is more regular , the choir singing equal - length notes for most of each line , and sustained notes at the end .
Staccato phrasing is used to ensure that the words can be heard clearly , even though this section is quieter - a sort of stage whisper .
The orchestra follows the choir part , with a jerky counterpoint playing through the gaps left by the staccato ; on the choirs ' sustained notes it plays a quick , low trill .
Verum est , quod legitur ,
It is written in truth , fronte capillata , that she has a fine head of hair , sed plerumque sequitur but , when it comes to seizing an opportunity Occasio calvata .
she is bald .
The last four lines of each verse are repeated , with the volume coming back up to a robust forte , and the sopranos and altos joining the male voices .
The tune and the choral harmony remain the same , but the orchestral part is busier , with the strings adding a layer of complexity .
After the end of each verse , the orchestra has a rapid 10 bar passage , wish repeatedly rises and falls like a wheel spinning out of control , each revolution marked by a cymbal crash , and the final by a thrilling run of violins and flutes .
In Fortune solio On Fortune 's throne sederam elatus , I used to sit raised up , prosperitatis vario crowned with flore coronatus ; the many - coloured flowers of prosperity ; quicquid enim florui though I may have flourished felix et beatus , happy and blessed , nunc a summo corrui now I fall from the peak gloria privatus .
deprived of glory .
Fortune rota volvitur :
The wheel of Fortune turns ; descendo minoratus ; I go down , demeaned ; alter in altum tollitur ; another is raised up ; nimis exaltatus far too high up rex sedet in vertice sits the king at the summit - caveat ruinam !
let him fear ruin !
nam sub axe legimus for under the axis is written Hecubam reginam .
Queen Hecuba .
The next part is Primo Vere , which deals with the arrival of spring - it 's not all doom and gloom !

When CDs containing the banking details of seven million Britons went missing late last year , Jeremy Clarkson insisted it was a storm in a teacup .
To prove no one would be able to access money by using the records , the outspoken broadcaster and columnist published his own bank details .
Now , however , the Top Gear host has ended up with egg on his face - after one entrepreneurial thief removed £ 500 from his account .
The fraudster set up a direct debit using Clarkson 's bank account details and paid the money to the British Diabetic Association , one of many organisations which do not require a signature to set up a direct debit .
Writing in his newspaper column , Clarkson , 47 , said : " Back in November , the Government lost two computer discs containing half the population 's bank details .
" Everyone worked themselves into a right old lather about the mistake but I argued we should all calm down because the details in question are to be found on every cheque we hand out every day to every Tom , Dick and cash and carry .
" To hammer the point home I even printed my own bank account number and sort code .
" And guess what ?
I opened my bank statement this morning to find out that someone has set up a direct debit which automatically takes £ 500 from my account .
" The bank cannot find out who did this because of the Data Protection Act and they cannot stop it from happening again .
" I was wrong and I have been punished for my mistake . "
Clarkson threw down the gauntlet in November after HM Revenue and Customs lost two data discs containing the personal details of 25 million Britons .
The information included the bank details of seven million claiming child benefit .
The discs went astray after they were posted from an office in Newcastle to London .
The Metropolitan Police had 32 detectives attempting to track them down , but to no avail .
At the time Clarkson wrote in his column : " I have never known such a palaver about nothing .
The fact is we happily hand over cheques to all sorts of unsavoury people all day long without a moment 's thought .
We have nothing to fear . "
To prove his point he printed his account number , sort code and the bank branch where his account was held .
He also gave instructions on how to find his address on the electoral roll and details about the car he drives .
After the scale of his blunder became apparent , a chastened Clarkson wrote : " Contrary to what I said at the time , we must go after the idiots who lost the discs and stick cocktail sticks in their eyes until they beg for mercy . "
Last week it emerged that more than 28,000 people have signed a petition on the Downing Street website calling for Clarkson to be made prime minister .
* Illustration : Brandon Kavulla * Australia is suffering through its worst dry spell in a millennium .
The outback has turned into a dust bowl , crops are dying off at fantastic rates , cities are rationing water , coral reefs are dying , and the agricultural base is evaporating .
But what really intrigues Glenn Albrecht — a philosopher by training — is how his fellow Australians are reacting .
They 're getting sad .
In interviews Albrecht conducted over the past few years , scores of Australians described their deep , wrenching sense of loss as they watch the landscape around them change .
Familiar plants do n't grow any more .
Gardens wo n't take .
Birds are gone .
" They no longer feel like they know the place they 've lived for decades , " he says .
Albrecht believes that this is a new type of sadness .
People are feeling displaced .
They 're suffering symptoms eerily similar to those of indigenous populations that are forcibly removed from their traditional homelands .
But nobody is being relocated ; they have n't moved anywhere .
It 's just that the familiar markers of their area , the physical and sensory signals that define home , are vanishing .
Their environment is moving away from them , and they miss it terribly .
Albrecht has given this syndrome an evocative name : solastalgia .
It 's a mashup of the roots solacium ( comfort ) and algia ( pain ) , which together aptly conjure the word nostalgia .
In essence , it 's pining for a lost environment .
" Solastalgia , " as he wrote in a scientific paper describing his theory , " is a form of homesickness one gets when one is still at home . ' "
It 's also a fascinating new way to think about the impact of global warming .
Everyone 's worrying about resource management and the spooky , unpredictable changes in the ecosystem .
We fret over which areas will get flooded as sea levels rise .
We estimate the odds of wars over clean water , and we tally up the species — polar bears , whales , wading birds — that 'll go extinct .
But we should also be concerned about the huge toll climate change will inflict on our mental health .
In the modern , industrialized West , many of us have forgotten how deeply we rely on the stability of nature for our psychic well - being .
In a world of cheap airfares , laptops , and the Internet , we proudly regard mobility as a sign of how advanced we are .
Hey , we 're nomadic hipster capitalists !
We love change .
Only losers get attached to their hometowns .
This is a neat mythos , but in truth it 's a pretty natural human urge to identify with a place and build one 's sense of self around its comforts and permanence .
I live in Manhattan , where the globe - hopping denizens tend to go berserk if their favorite coffee shop closes down .
How will they react in 20 or 30 years if the native trees can't handle the 5 - degree spike in average temperature ?
Or if weird new bugs infest the city in summer , fall shrinks to a single month , and snow becomes a distant memory ?
" We like to think that we 're cool , 21st - century people , but the basic sense of a connection to the land is still big , " Albrecht says .
" We have n't evolved that much .
" What 's more , Albrecht has noticed that the more quickly environmental change occurs , the more intense the solastalgia .
The mental - health effects can be powerful .
In the Australian outback , industrial activity — notably open - pit coal mining — has turned verdant areas into moonscapes seemingly overnight , and the suicide rate in the region has skyrocketed .
Or witness New Orleans , where a Harvard survey found that survivors of Hurricane Katrina reported suffering a " serious mental illness " at roughly double the rate of the city 's residents three years earlier .
Fully 6 percent have thought about suicide .
Trauma and personal loss obviously play a role in this , but the decimation of the city 's physical environment surely does as well .
Ironically , we may simply be rediscovering a syndrome that we thought was dead and buried .
Back in the 1940s , the military considered homesickness to be a serious and potentially fatal illness , because drafted soldiers who got shipped overseas would often become savagely depressed .
These days , Americans are rarely dislocated against their will , and the army is all - volunteer .
Few of us have the experience of being unmoored in the world .
But that may be changing rapidly .
In a world that 's quickly heating up and drying up , you can't go home again — even if you never leave .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A bill in Congress seeks to eliminate military slot machines overseas that take in $ 130 million a year , mostly from soldiers .
Aaron Walsh 's addiction to military slot machines ruined his Army career and led to his suicide .
The bill 's sponsor , Rep. Lincoln Davis , D - Tennessee , named the bill after Army Warrant Officer Aaron Walsh , a decorated Apache helicopter pilot who became addicted to gambling on military slot machines .
Walsh eventually was discharged from the Army .
He committed suicide after several failed attempts to break his addiction .
The Defense Department uses slot machine revenues to pay a small portion of its morale , welfare and recreation programs .
Davis said the money raised off the gambling of soldiers is not worth the risks .
" If American men and women are willing to serve our country overseas we should not be dependent on them to pay for recreational activities they deserve , " Davis said in a written statement .
" The risks are simply too high and too many to ask that of our soldiers . "
The bill 's introduction comes after Walsh 's story was featured in a CNN investigative report .
His widow , Carrie Walsh , described how her husband 's life spun out of control while the military refused to intervene .

" The military has this culture of taking care of their own , " Carrie Walsh told CNN .
" But it seems like when it comes to this , they just profited from his addiction and then threw him away . "

Father pleads for better mental health care
Carrie Walsh said that in 2005 her husband lost more than $ 20,000 in military slot machines .
He went AWOL , only to be found sitting in front of a video slot machine on a military post in Seoul .
He was forced to resign from the Army and spent time homeless on the streets of Las Vegas , Nevada .
In 2006 , Walsh returned to Maine and tried to reconnect with his wife and their two small children , but his gambling addiction continued .
On September 26 , 2006 , Walsh , 34 , went to Maine 's Baxter State Park and killed himself with a gunshot to the head .
The Army operates 3,000 slot machines on overseas posts , raising $ 130 million in revenue each year .
Other branches of the military operate their own gaming programs .
University of Illinois business professor John Kindt , who has studied gambling addictions and the military , agrees with Davis that the money raised is not worth the risk .
He says the military should find other ways to entertain troops .
" It should n't be about exploiting our service personnel and putting families and their children at risk , " he told CNN .
In a statement released by the Pentagon earlier this year , Undersecretary of Defense Leslye Arsht said gambling on bases and posts provides " a controlled alternative to unmonitored host - nation gambling venues and offers a higher payment percentage , making it more entertainment oriented than that found at typical casinos . "
The Warrant Officer Aaron Walsh Stop DOD - Sponsored Gambling
Act would prohibit the military from operating slot machines on military bases .
The legislation was introduced Wednesday afternoon .

1801 : The first asteroid is discovered by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi .
Piazzi , who christened it Ceres Ferdinandea ( later shortened to Ceres when King Ferdinand IV fell out of favor , as monarchs have a tendency to do ) , at first thought he ’d discovered a fixed star , but then detected it moving among the background of stars and decided it was a planet .
Playing it conservatively , the astronomer officially announced his discovery as a comet but confided his suspicions to another astronomer ( no tail was visible , for one thing ) .
Other observers eventually concluded that Piazzi ’s discovery was indeed a planet , albeit a small one .
What he actually discovered was the largest asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter .
In fact , Ceres alone accounts for roughly one - third of the entire mass of the main asteroid belt .
It has a diameter of approximately 600 miles and completes one revolution of the sun every 4.6 years .
In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union voted to restore the planet designation to Ceres , decreeing that it qualifies as a dwarf planet .
It does have some planet - like characteristics , including an interior that is separated into crust , mantle and core .

Grant Stranaghan 's strangly locks have caused problems
Grant Stranaghan , a GCSE student at Ballyclare High School , was suspended for three days last week for having collar - length hair .
The 15 - year - old 's father George claimed his son was now being kept in " solitary confinement " in a separate school room .
The school said its rules applied to all pupils equally with due regard to any mitigating circumstances .
Mr Stranaghan is expected to consult solicitors on Friday ahead of a meeting with school principal David Knox .
He told the BBC that the High Court hearing was due to take place in several weeks ' time .
" Grant is being kept in solitary confinement , he is completely separate in a different class , and has separate breaks and lunch - time with no contact with his friends , " said Mr Stranaghan .
In all walks of life there are rules to be obeyed and in our working lives , many of us have to conform to certain types and standards of behaviour and dress
Ballyclare High School
" We were not asked to be there when Grant was suspended .
" We are going all the way on this .
We are just standing up for our son and hopefully other kids will benefit from this . "
Year 11 pupil and rock music fan Grant said his long hair was a crucial part of his personal identity .
However , in a statement to the BBC , the school said that before any pupil joined the school , both the parents and prospective pupils were informed of the code of conduct , which included its uniform code .
" This has been our practice for many years .
It is one of the factors which parents must take into consideration before deciding to send their child to the school . "
It added : " In all walks of life there are rules to be obeyed and in our working lives , many of us have to conform to certain types and standards of behaviour and dress .
" We have been overwhelmed by the level of support we have received from other schools , parents , teachers , members of the public and most importantly from our pupils , the vast majority of whom are positive , co-operative and indeed proud of the school 's standards and many achievements . "
I 'm so sick of politicians bs , this pic is perfect for all of them .
The Handwriting on the Wall
I recently attended a talk at Stanford by Walter Bradford Ellis , a too - little - known activist and writer on the issue of global poverty and world hunger .
It ’s transcribed from a recording I made .
The sound quality was lousy , so apologies if I ’ve mangled some of the specifics .
Good evening .
This is the first time I ’ve spoken before a college audience , and therefore I would like to take advantage of your presence to ask you a few questions before I begin on my prepared speech .
Basically I want to know how morally committed the students at a typical ‘ good ’ school are , and while I know an audience of several hundred from one school is neither large enough nor diverse enough to give an especially accurate picture , still the results should provide a rough indication of where the real truth lies .
That ’s sort of an interesting juxtaposition of words .
‘ Truth lies ’ I mean .
Anyway , as I said , I ’m interested in knowing how morally committed you are .
I must say at the outset , I am pessimistic .
At any rate , primarily what I want to find out tonight is how important it is to you for you to act according to your own definition of right and wrong .
In other words I ’m not interested in knowing what sort of behavior you think is right or wrong but merely how committed you are to living up to whatever standards of right and wrong you possess .
I was trying to think a few minutes ago what questions I could ask you to find out this information , and it is very difficult to come up with anything satisfactory simply because individual standards of right and wrong vary so markedly .
I had to pick a situation which seems perhaps a little silly because it is so improbable , but that is because I wanted as pure a case as possible — one which is in no way connected with any existing world situation — so that your prejudices and preconceived notions about a particular situation will play no part in your answers .
My hypothetical circumstances are concerned with a person who murders innocent people , and I suspect that nearly every one of you will agree that that is wrong .
So please now imagine yourself to be in an ancient country which is ruled over by an evil king who has absolute power of life or death over all his subjects — including yourself .
Now this king is very bored , and so for his amusement he picks 10 of his subjects , men , women , and children , at random as well as an eleventh man who is separate from the rest .
Now the king gives the eleventh man a choice : he will either hang the 10 people picked at random and let the eleventh go free , or he will hang the eleventh man and let the other 10 go free .
And the eleventh man must decide which it is to be .
Now if death is bad , then on average 10 deaths must be 10 times as bad as one .
So hopefully nearly all of you will agree that the eleventh man should give up his life in order that the other 10 might live .
But that is not the question I am asking you .
I ’m asking whether you would in fact make that sacrifice if you were the eleventh man — if you really did have to decide whether you or they would die .
And you knew the king meant business because he did this every year and sometimes killed the 10 people and other times the eleventh depending wholly upon what the eleventh had decided .
Now I am about to ask you for a show of hands , but of course I realize that few of you know yourselves so well that you can be certain of the correctness of your answer — especially if your answer is yes .
So I will simply ask you to hold up your hand and answer yes if you are any more than 50 % certain that you would make that sacrifice .
Understand ?
All right , all yes answers , please raise your hands .
Let me see , that must be about a third of you .
That ’s more than I would have guessed .
Now let me ask only those who are reasonably certain — say 95 % certain — that they would make the sacrifice to please raise their hands .
Yes .
That ’s more like what I expected .
That ’s at most a tenth of you .
I have a feeling that most of that tenth of you are kidding yourselves , but perhaps human beings are n’t as selfish as I have always thought .
Now just two more quick questions .
Same situation except that the king says he will let his 10 hostages go free if you will go to prison for 20 years , otherwise he kills them .
That ’s an easier question to be sure of your answer about than the previous one , so this time answer yes only if you are quite certain — 95 % or better .
All right everybody hold up his hand if he is at least 95 % sure he would go to prison for 20 years in order to save 10 people ’s lives .
Well that looks like about three - quarters of you .
Again I think you have overly high opinions of yourselves , or maybe some of you are too embarrassed to tell the truth , but I sincerely hope you are correct in your self - assessments .
Just one question more now .
The king says he will let his people go if you will agree to give him all the money you have and all the money you will make in the future , except of course enough for you to feed and house yourself and take care of all the absolute necessities .
In other words he ’s asking you to be poor , but not so poor that it impairs your health in any way .
Again I ’m asking for at least 95 % certainty .
All in that category please hold up your hands .
Well that ’s nearly every one of you !
I ’m very pleased ; I hope you mean it .
Perhaps in fact you do this time .
After all , since you have the power to decide whether 10 people die or whether you give up your money , if you made the other decision you would be killing 10 people in order to make money for yourself , and surely that is murder .
I see some head - shaking — it looks as though a few of you disagree .
The king has said , kill these 10 people or I ’ll take your money .
If you kill them , that is murder .
Look at it another way .
If you are poor and kill 10 people in order to steal their money , that is surely murder .
But morally speaking , that situation is exactly the same as this one .
In both situations if the people die , you will be rich ; if they live , you will be poor , and it is within your power to decide which it is to be .
In either situation if you decide that they should die in order that you can be rich , you have put your happiness , or not actually even that , you have put material riches for yourself above 10 people ’s lives .
That is the moral error you have made and it is exactly the same for both cases .
One is as bad as the other and if one is murder so is the other .
Anyway , those are all the questions I wanted to ask you .
I did n’t mean to spend as much time on them as I did , but at least from my point of view it was well worth the time .
Thanks for your indulgence , and also for your soul - searching — I guess those were n’t easy questions to answer if you answered them honestly .
Just be happy it was a make - believe situation and none of you is likely ever to really be forced to make any of those rather unpleasant decisions .
And now I ’ll get on to what is supposed to be my topic : world hunger .
In 1650 the population of the world was 500 million ( 500M ) .
Within the next 50 years an absolute minimum of 500 M people will starve to death .
The UN reports that around 10 M people starve to death every year and the problem is only going to get worse as the population increases .
Perhaps that figure of 500 M is too large for you to grasp in abstract terms .
Let me translate it into something more concrete : if those 500 M people were all to join hands , then figuring at about 1,000 people per mile , they would form a line long enough to stretch to the moon and back — with enough left over to reach across the United States 6 times .
Or if you prefer keeping things more down to earth , they would reach 20 times around the world .
The US Army ’s M - 16 machine - gun fires 700 rounds per minute , or about 12 rounds per second .
If you drove a car past the line of people at a little over 40 miles per hour , you would pass 700 people every minute .
If you used poisoned bullets or some such deadly concoction , you might be able to kill 1 person with every shot as you drove past .
If you kept your finger on the trigger for 10 hours a day , 7 days a week , killing 1 person with every shot , it would take you 3 years and 4 months to kill them all .
It is a rather gruesome picture , and yet all these people — and probably many more — are absolutely doomed to die in the next 25 to 50 years .
And it wo n’t be the quick , easy death of a bullet , but the slow , pitiful , wasting death of starvation .
There is one bright spot in all this , however — the legions of the doomed will not really reach quite 20 times around the world .
Perhaps they ’ll really only reach 12 or 15 times around , for most of them are children and their arms are short .
Opposed to these ravaged peoples of the world are the gluttons of America .
You yourselves are good examples .
As future graduates of a good college , it is surely within the grasp of most of you to be making a salary , after taxes , of $ 50,000 or more within a few years .
How much money is that ?
Well , you could easily take care of all the true necessities of life for $ 20,000 , thus leaving you $ 30,000 for the luxuries .
In America , anyone can stay healthy spending five dollars a day for food .
It is not even hard to do .
If one really skimps , he can stay alive and well for a dollar — for I have done it .
If it can be done in America for a dollar a day , it can surely be done for that in the countries where people are starving .
Thus your $ 30,000 of luxury money could be providing 82 people with a dollar worth of food a day — people who otherwise might starve .
Since presumably if your $ 30,000 were donated to UNICEF , they would take care to pick out poorer than average people , I think it not unreasonable to state that $ 30,000 per year over a period of 40 years is enough to keep healthy 10 people who would otherwise starve to death — plus a good many more who would otherwise be malnourished .
So you see , I lied to you a little while ago when I said none of you would ever have to make any of those three unpleasant decisions .
You will never have to make the first or the second — the two hardest choices — but you are this moment confronted with the third : for the 10 who would otherwise starve are the 10 hostages , you are the eleventh man , and hunger is the king .
Thus if you decide to go on with the life you were probably planning to lead , you will be letting 10 people die rather than give up your flat - screen television and your cocktail parties .
And that is more than gluttony , it is murder .
Good evening .
Aaron again .
I ’d like to make a few remarks about the speech , but before I do I should admit something .
The speech was not given by Walter Bradford Ellis .
Instead , it was written by a too - little - known philosopher named Louis Pascal .
He published it in the 1980s under the same subterfuge in the journal Inquiry and it was reprinted in Peter Singer ’s collection Applied Ethics .
( I have modified it to bring the numbers up to date and shortened it a little to make it more blog - sized . )
He justifies the subterfuge as necessary to get readers to more seriously engage in the thought experiment .
I do think it would be wonderful to have this talk given in person , however .
If you are interested in pursuing this , please let me know .
If you do want to help needy people , you can donate to UNICEF or Oxfam .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Much has been written about web applications , particularly AJAX applications , that ‘ break ’ the web browser ’s back button .
There ’s more than one type of back button breakage but what is usually discussed in relation to AJAX is the ability ( or un-ability ) to use the back button to undo the application ’s last action .
I think the concern is misguided .
The back button is not an undo button .
The back and forward buttons are part of the model of the web as a repository of documents .
They allow a user to move back or forward in the chain of visited hypertext nodes , i.e. web pages .
The ‘ back as undo ’ argument is often supported by a usability study that shows mere mortal users depend on using the back button as an undo .
I think that ’s a little bit like using a study that shows automobile drivers speed up on a yellow light to argue for swapping the meanings of green and yellow traffic signals .
I do n’t think browser back button behavior is quite as important as road safety but I do think there is an impedance mismatch between the web browser as hypertext document platform and the web browser as application platform .
‘ Undo ’ is an application action .
The back button does n’t undo anything .
It loads a previous page .
Spackling over the difference is a bad idea .

The CIA and the Department of Justice have both announced they intend to investigate the CIA 's destruction in 2005 of al Qaeda interrogation tapes .
The White House says that it will not comment on the matter while the internal investigation is underway and has directed press secretary Dana Perino not to answer questions about it .
However , presidential candidate Joe Biden indicated on Sunday that this sort of self - examination would be unacceptable .
" Let me put it this way , " Biden told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos .
" Rhetorical question -- anything this Attorney Generals ' offices have done since this guy 's become president that you 're going to take on face value ?
Not me .
( Laughs )
Not me . "
Biden emphasized that current Attorney General Mukasey " is the same guy who could n't decide whether waterboarding was torture . "
Biden also stated that CIA Director Michael Hayden appears to be wrong in claiming that the destruction of the tapes was fully lawful , since both White House counsel Harriet Miers and the Justice Department told the CIA not to destroy them .
" Hayden is not to be the judge of whether or not his condoning the destroying of the tapes was lawful , " said Biden .
" It appears as though there may be an obstruction of justice charge here , tampering with evidence . "
" It really does call for a special counsel , " Biden continued .
" The easiest , straightest thing to do is just take it out of the political realm .
Appoint a special prosecutor , and let them decide , call it where it is . "
Senator Russ Feingold has written to the Attorney General , asking him to clarify his views on the CIA 's " alternative interrogation techniques " and to urge President Bush not to veto legislation which would outlaw them .
Biden believes that there might be enough votes in the Senate to override even a president veto .
" Our credibility internationally has been absolutely devastated , " he said , adding that " this administration is out of control . "
Biden referred as well to the new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , quoting Defense Secretary Gates as saying that US policy on Iran " has annoyed our friends and caused confusion for our allies . "
Biden 's summary of US foreign policy was that " this is a Nixon administration without the competence . "

BBC economics reporter , Cleveland , Ohio
Thousands of abandoned houses in Cleveland have been vandalized A wave of foreclosures and evictions is about to sweep the United States in the wake of the sub - prime mortgage lending crisis .
This could destabilise the US housing market and may also lead to further turmoil in financial institutions , who collectively own $ 1 trillion ( £ 480.6 bn ) worth of sub - prime debt .
Cleveland , Ohio , is an industrial city on the banks of Lake Erie in the US " rust belt " .
It is the sub - prime capital of the United States .
One in ten homes in the city is now vacant , and whole neighbourhoods have been blighted by foreclosed , vandalized and boarded - up homes .
Families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods
Michael J Calhoun
Center for Responsible Lending
Many of these homes are now owned by the banks and investment pools owning the mortgages , and the company making the most foreclosures in Cleveland is Deutsche Bank Trust , which acts on behalf of such investment pools .
Cleveland is facing a rising crime wave , and the cost of demolishing the vacant houses alone will cost the city $ 100 m of its tax base .
According to Jim Rokakis , the County Treasurer for Cleveland 's Cuyahoga County , " Wall Street strategies that made the cycle of no -money - down , no - questions - asked lending possible have sucked the life out of my city " .
THE SUB - PRIME CRISIS IN CLEVELAND Sub - prime lending Black areas Foreclosures ( repossessions ) Deutsche Bank properties
Sub - prime crisis growing Sub - prime lending is spreading across the United States , especially in the booming housing markets of Southern California , Florida , Washington , DC , and New York City .
One in five US mortgages now falls in this category .
As the credit crunch continues to bite " families all over the country continue to lose homes in record numbers , stripping families of their wealth and destroying entire neighbourhoods , " says Michael Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending , which tracks these issues .
Sub - prime mortgages carry a much higher risk of default by the borrower than other kinds of mortgage lending .
That is because most of them are " balloon " mortgages ( technically known as hybrid - adjustable rate mortgages , or ARMs ) , which offer the borrower a fixed - rate loan for two or three years , and then switch to a much higher adjustable rate after that .
HAVE YOUR SAY Everyone is going to feel this credit crunch to some extent
Turned Worm
Send us your comments
Many of them are set to switch in the next two years , leaving borrowers unable to afford the higher payments .
There have already been 1.7 million foreclosure proceedings in the US in the first eight months of 2007 , and up to 2 million families are expected to lose their homes over the next two years , according to estimates by the US Congress 's Joint Economic Committee .
Crisis origins
But why have so many people in the US taken out sub - prime mortgages ?
The sub - prime lending market started as a way of lending to people with poor credit history - as long as they had collateral like a house that could be used to guarantee the loan .
It was particularly prevalent in inner-city areas , especially among black and Hispanic borrowers .
Many of these mortgages were sold by unscrupulous and little regulated mortgage brokers , who received handsome commissions for selling expensive and unsuitable products .
Some customers were not told that their interest rates would go up sharply after two years ; others were promised they could refinance their home before higher rates took effect .
Others found that when they had difficulties paying , huge unexplained fees were added to their bills , putting them further in debt .
Marion 's story
One person hard hit is Marion Gardner , who lives in one of the worst affected sub - prime lending areas of Cleveland , known as Slavic Village .
Marion has spent 30 years raising a family in her home A single parent , she had worked hard to buy a house where she could raise her two children and escape from the misery of the inner-city housing projects .
Two years ago Marion fell ill , and found she could not manage the stairs in her house .
She decided to refinance her home , using some of the money to buy an apartment where she could more easily manage .
She gave her old house to her two sons , expecting they would contribute to paying for the property she had struggled so hard to obtain .
But the sons fell behind in their payments .
Marion went to her lender - Countrywide , the biggest sub - prime lender in the US - and offered to pay off all the arrears .
She said they accepted her offer , and began sending them $ 1,000 every month , using up her retirement savings .
But after six months she discovered that instead of clearing her arrears , her home was going to be foreclosed by Countrywide .
She still visits the house every day , trying to protect if from drug dealers and burglars , and leaves her dog in the backyard .
But she can see all along her street dozens of foreclosed properties that have been vandalised , boarded up , or gutted .
Now she has learned that a date has been set for the sheriff to come and evict her .
Deceptive practices ?
Mark Seifert , the director of the East Side Organising Project ( ESOP ) in Cleveland , which has played a leading role in helping people affected by the sub - prime crisis , says Marion 's story is typical .
SUB - PRIME CRISIS SERIES
Special reports on why bad US home loans are affecting us all Friday : US housing crash Monday : Financial meltdown
Viewers hit by sub - prime crisis speak out Have Your Say :
What should we do about the crisis ?
He says lenders engaged in deceptive practices and clients found it difficult to get any information at all when they got into arrears .
Mr Seifert says that ESOP - using protest tactics - has managed to get a few mortgage companies to sign a deal agreeing a uniform set of criteria to decide whether someone 's mortgage qualifies for renegotiation rather than foreclosure .
But he says they have been unable to reach such an agreement with Countrywide , the nation 's largest sub - prime lender - although its boss has promised to meet them .
Spreading to the suburbs
The crisis has spread beyond the inner city to the suburbs of Cleveland .
Last month over 200 people turned up at a church meeting to seek ESOP 's help in avoiding foreclosure .
Worried homeowners meet to " Save the American Dream " Some , such as Ron Todd , who lives in a suburb just south of the city , are in danger of losing their home after being made redundant by Northwest Airlines , a big local employer .
Others are worried that their neighbourhoods - and the property values of their own houses - will be ruined by the foreclosures all around them .
According to Claudia Coulton , co-director of the Centre for Urban Poverty at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , over 10,000 families - one in eight of all owner occupiers in Cleveland - will face eviction this year - and the number is expected to rise .
She says the crisis is threatening to " overwhelm the government agencies and community organisations that address the problem " .
Nationwide problem Cleveland 's situation is not unique .
All around the country , aid agencies report a " tidal wave " of foreclosure cases , says Sarah Gerecke , director of New York City 's Neighborhood Housing Services .
PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES
Ninja Loans : no income , no job , no assets 2/28 : Mortgages that change from a fixed to a much higher adjustable rate after first two years Prepayment penalties :
High fees for trying to change terms of mortgage
She now employs six people full - time to provide mortgage debt counselling , up from one just two years ago , and could use another 12 .
Her concern is that many recently regenerated neighbourhoods in New York will soon be blighted by crisis again .
Some people argue that the sub - prime lending crisis has been caused by irresponsible borrowers who lied about their income to cash in on the housing boom .
Ms Gerecke disagrees .
She says few of her clients would knowingly put their home at risk .
Many sub - prime borrowers report that mortgage brokers misrepresented the kind of mortgage they were being offered , their annual income , and even the value of their home .
Working together ?
President George W Bush 's administration wants to solve the foreclosure crisis by getting lenders and borrowers to renegotiate the terms of loans .
There is a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works
Robert Steel
US Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance
Read the full interview
It is pledging more money for advice services , and has been urging key lenders to take a more sympathetic approach .
Robert Steel , the US Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance , told the BBC that the government 's role was " to ensure that lenders and servicers are being flexible with regard to working with borrowers " .
He added that no policy could eliminate foreclosures altogether because there was " a natural level of foreclosures that goes on in an economy in good times and bad ... it 's part of the nature of how our economy works . "
But according to Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody's , only 1 % of sub - prime mortgages have been renegotiated rather than foreclosed so far .
Ms Gerecke says a piecemeal approach involving millions of individual renegotiations will not work .
Each case takes hours of negotiations , and the mortgage companies ' loan loss departments are overwhelmed by the crisis .
A way out ?
The only way out , says Ms Gerecke , would be national loan terms agreed for the whole industry .
One such plan has been proposed by Sheila Bair , head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , one of the key banking regulators .
She told the BBC that sub - prime interest rates should not be reset if the borrower has kept up all payments and is not in arrears .
But such a deal is proving extremely difficult to reach , given that thousands of investors around the world own a share of these sub - prime mortgages .
Meanwhile Marion still sits in her Cleveland home every day , trying to stop it being vandalised even though she knows it is merely a matter of time before she will be evicted .
" I am just really working for the banks now , protecting their property from damage , " she says .

At one time , the Charlotte - Mecklenburg School District in North Carolina was a model of court - ordered integration .
Today , nearly a decade after a court struck down its racial - balancing busing program , the school district is moving in the opposite direction .
About half of its elementary schools have 10 percent or fewer white students or 10 percent or fewer African - American students .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version overstated the number of segregated schools . ]
" Charlotte is rapidly resegregating , " says Carol Sawyer , a parent and member of the Charlotte - Mecklenburg Schools Equity Committee .
It 's a trend that is occurring around the country and is even more pronounced than expected in the wake of court cases dismantling both mandated and voluntary integration programs , a new report says .
The most segregated schools , according to the report , which documents desegregation trends , are in big cities of the Northeast and Midwest .
The South and West – and rural areas and small towns generally – offer minority students a bit more diversity .
Suburbs of large cities , meanwhile , are becoming the new frontier : areas to which many minorities are moving .
These places still have a chance to remain diverse communities but are showing signs of replicating the segregation patterns of the cities themselves .
" It 's getting to the point of almost absolute segregation in the worst of the segregated cities – within one or two percentage points of what the Old South used to be like , " says Gary Orfield , codirector of the Civil Rights Project and one of the study 's authors .
" The biggest metro areas are the epicenters of segregation .
It 's getting worse for both blacks and Latinos , and nothing is being done about it . "
About one - sixth of black students and one - ninth of Latino students attend what Mr. Orfield calls " apartheid schools , " at least 99 percent minority .
In big cities , black and Latino students are nearly twice as likely to attend such schools .
Some two - thirds of black and Latino students in big cities attend schools with less than 10 percent white students ; in rural areas , about one - seventh of black and Latino students do .
Although the South was the region that originally integrated the most successfully , it 's beginning to resegregate , as in the Charlotte - Mecklenburg district .
While resegregation has been taking place for some time , Orfield says the latest numbers are worrisome both for the degree to which they show the trend is occurring and in light of the US Supreme Court 's most recent decision on the issue last June , which struck down several voluntary integration programs and made it more difficult for districts that want to work at desegregating schools to do so .
" If you [ as a district ] are going to ask your lawyer what 's the easiest thing to do , it 's to just stop trying to do anything , " Orfield explains .
" That 's a recipe for real segregation . "
Not everyone feels that way .
Some groups applauded the Supreme Court 's decision last summer as another step toward taking race out of school admission policies and allowing parents to send their kids to the schools most convenient for them .
If schools start reflecting neighborhood makeup – which often means nearly all - white or all - minority – that does n't have to matter , they say .
" Segregation means people are being deliberately assigned to schools based on skin color , " says Roger Clegg , president of the Center for Equal Opportunity in Falls Church , Va .
" If it simply reflects neighborhoods , then it 's not segregation . "
Mr. Clegg questions some of the resegregation research , noting that the percentage of white students in schools is often going down simply because they 're a decreasing portion of the population .
He also quibbles with the notion that an all - black , all - Hispanic , or all - white school is necessarily a bad thing .
" I do n't think that the education that you get hinges on the color of the person sitting next to you in the classroom , " Clegg says .
" What educators should focus on is improving schools . "
That sounds great in theory , say some experts , but the fact is that segregated schools tend to be highly correlated with such things as school performance and the ability to attract teachers .
" Once you separate kids spacially from more privileged kids , they tend to not get the same things , " says Amy Stuart Wells , an education professor at Columbia University 's Teachers College in New York .
" And we need to start thinking about how a school that 's racially isolated can be preparing students for this global society we live in . "
Still , many of the programs that worked to achieve integration – such as busing – have been highly unpopular over the years .
And in big cities , real integration is often virtually impossible :
Many cities have largely minority populations , and the districts do n't extend to the suburbs .
Suburbs , though , offer potential .
The Civil Rights Project report noted that big-city suburbs educate 7.9 million white students along with 2.1 million blacks and 2.9 million Latinos .
" This is the new frontier for thinking about how to make diverse schools work , " says Professor Wells .
But so far , the data for suburbs are not encouraging , showing emerging segregation .
Some integration advocates say this shows a need for more diversity training for teachers and students and for policies that encourage integrated housing , not just schools .
" Each affects the other , " says Erica Frankenberg , the co-author on the Civil Rights Project study .
" Unless we think about this jointly , we 're probably not going to be able to create stable racial integrated neighborhoods and schools . "

Computer programmer Clinton Curtis testified at the December 13th , 2004 Congressional hearing in Columbus , Ohio naming Republican Congressman Tom Feeney as the person who hired him to prepare vote - rigging software .
The programmer claims that he designed and built a " vote rigging " software program at the behest of then Florida Congressman , now U.S. Congressman , Republican Tom Feeney of Florida 's 24th Congressional District .
Clint Curtis , 46 , claims that he built the software for Feeney in 2000 while working at a sofware design and engineering company in Oviedo , Florida ( Feeney 's home district ) .
Curtis , in his affidavit , says that as technical advisor and programmer at Yang Enterprises , Inc. ( YEI ) he was present at company meetings where Feeney was present " on at least a dozen occasions " .
Feeney , who had run in 1994 as Jeb Bush 's running - mate in his initial unsuccessful bid for Florida Governor , was serving as both corporate counsel and registered lobbyist for YEI during the period that Curtis worked at the company .
Feeney was also concurrently serving as a Florida state congressman while performing those services for YEI .
Feeney would eventually become Speaker of the Florida House before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 .
He is now a member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee .
At an October 2000 meeting with Feeney , according to the affidavit and BRAD BLOG interviews with Curtis over the past three days , Feeney inquired whether the company could build a " vote fraud software prototype " .
At least three YEI employees are said to have been present at that meeting ; Curtis , company owner , Mrs. Li Woan Yang , and her executive secretary , Mike Cohen .
Two other YEI employees may have come in and out at different points of the meeting according to Curtis .
Curtis says that Feeney " was very specific in the design and specifications required for this program . "
" He detailed , in his own words , that ; ( a ) the program needed to be touch - screen capable ( b ) the user should be able to trigger the program without any additional equipment ( c ) the programming to accomplish this needed to stay hidden even if the source code was inspected . "
Though there was no problem with the first two requirements , Curtis explained to the Congressman that it would be " virtually impossible to hide such code written to change the voting results if anyone is able to review the uncompiled source code "
Nonetheless , he was asked at the meeting by Mrs.
Yang to build the prototype anyway .
Curtis , " a life - long Republican " at the time , claims that it was his initial belief that Feeney 's interest was in trying to stop Democrats from using " such a program to steal an election " .
Curtis had assumed that Feeney , " wanted to be able to detect and prevent that if it occurred . "
Upon delivery of the software design and documentation on CD to Mrs.
Yang , Curtis again explained to her that it would be impossible to hide routines created to manipulate the vote if anybody would be able to inspect the precompiled source code .
Mrs .
Yang then told him , " You do n’t understand , in order to get the contract we have to hide the manipulation in the source code .
This program is needed to control the vote in South Florida . "
Mrs. Yang then took the CD containing the software from Curtis , reportedly for later delivery to Feeney .
In other meetings with Feeny prior to the 2000 elections , it became clear to Curtis that Feeney had plans to suppress the vote in strong Democratic precincts .
In the affidavit , Curtis claims that in those meetings Feeney had " bragged that he had already implemented ' exclusion lists ' to reduce the ' black vote ' . "
Feeney also mentioned that " proper placement of police patrols could further reduce the black vote by as much as 25 % . "
Curtis says that he submitted his resignation to YEI effective December 2000 , but stayed on until they had found someone to replace him in February of 2001 .
He eventually became employed by the Florida Dept. of Transportation ( FDOT ) after leaving YEI .

Troubling indeed , but does anyone honestly believe that the Democrats in Congress would n’t vote en masse for a treaty committing us to Iraq for the next 100 years ?
Please .
All Bush has to do is say “ Osama ! ” and the Democrats will cave like , well , Democrats .
Do n’t threaten what you ’re not willing to follow through on .
President Bush ’s plan to forge a long - term agreement with the Iraqi government that could commit the US military to defending Iraq ’s security would be the first time such a sweeping mutual defense compact has been enacted without congressional approval , according to legal specialists .
After World War II , for example – when the United States gave security commitments to Japan , South Korea , the Philippines , Australia , New Zealand , and NATO members – Presidents Truman and Eisenhower designated the agreements as treaties requiring Senate ratification .
In 1985 , when President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the US military would defend the Marshall Islands and Micronesia if they were attacked , the compacts were put to a vote by both chambers of Congress .
By contrast , Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al - Maliki have already agreed that a coming compact will include the United States providing “ security assurances and commitments ” to Iraq to deter any foreign invasion or internal terrorism by “ outlaw groups . ”
But a top White House official has also said that Bush does not intend to submit the deal to Congress …..
But the “ long - term relationship of cooperation and friendship ” outlined in November goes far beyond an ordinary status - of - forces agreement .
It would include promises of debt forgiveness , economic and technical aid , facilitating “ especially American investments ” in Iraq – and the security commitments , according to Bush and Maliki ’s joint declaration last November … .
However , [ General Douglas Lute , Bush ’s deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan ] may have offered a clue to the administration ’s legal arguments during the November press conference when he noted that “ We have about a hundred agreements similar to the one envisioned for the US and Iraq already in place , and the vast majority of those are below the level of a treaty . ”
Johndroe , the White House spokesman , also mentioned the existence of such agreements in a Globe interview this week .
Legal specialists , however , say that the numerous pacts that were completed without congressional consent are not similar to the agreement Bush and Maliki outlined in November .
A five - year - old boy was taken into custody and thoroughly searched at Sea - Tac because his name is similar to a possible terrorist alias .

They also had to frisk her again to make sure the little Dillinger had n't passed anything dangerous weapons or materials to his mother when she hugged him . "

Here 's another reason to eat broccoli :
It may help your heart .
University of Connecticut researchers report that news after studying broccoli and heart health in rats .
The scientists brewed a broccoli extract and fed it to rats for a month in addition to regular rat chow .
For comparison , they fed other rats water instead of the broccoli extract in addition to their regular diet .
After feeding the rats broccoli extract or extra water for 30 days , the scientists tested the rats ' hearts .
Some of those tests deprived the heart of oxygen , similar to a heart attack .
The rats that had eaten the broccoli extract had three heart advantages over the other rats :
Better blood - pumping ability
Less heart damage during oxygen deprivation
Higher levels of heart - health chemicals during oxygen deprivation
Broccoli's key nutrients include selenium and sulforaphane , which may also curb cancer , note graduate student Subhendu Mukherjee and Dipak Das , PhD .
Their findings appear in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
The ‘ Continuity of Government ’ Proposal — A Dangerous and Unnecessary Threat to Representative Rule
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
The COGC Proposal
The  Continuity of Government Commission ( COGC ) , spearheaded by the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute , recently issued proposals for the operation of Congress following a catastrophic terrorist attack .
Specifically , COGC advocates a constitutional amendment calling for the appointment of individuals to the House of Representatives to fill the seats of dead or incapacitated members , a first in American history .
An examination of the proposal reveals that it is both unnecessary and dangerous .
Note that COGC is self - commissioned ,  its members being neither elected nor appointed by any government body .
The biographies of the commissioners demonstrate that COGC is made up mostly of professional lobbyists .
Of course COGC is well - intentioned , but the nation should know exactly who is trying to substitute their wisdom for that of James Madison , Alexander Hamilton , and other framers of the Constitution .
I think most Americans would prefer that proposals to amend the Constitution come from elected lawmakers or grassroots efforts , not from think tanks and lobbyists .
One reading the COGC proposal cannot help but sense the familiar Washington conceit at work , a conceit that sees America as totally dependent on the workings of Capitol Hill .
It is simply unthinkable to many in Washington that the American people might survive a period in which Congress did not pass any new laws .
But the truth is that the federal state is not America .
The American people have always been remarkably resilient in the face of emergencies , and individual states are far more equipped to deal with emergencies and fill congressional vacancies than COGC imagines .
COGC is Unnecessary
Every generation seems to labor under the delusion that it lives in the most dangerous and turbulent time in human history .
COGC certainly proves this point .
Its proposal provides doomsday scenarios designed to make us believe that the threat of modern terrorism poses a much greater risk to our government institutions than ever existed in the past .
Yet is Congress really more vulnerable than it was at the height of the Cold War , when a single Soviet missile could have destroyed Washington ?
Surely Congress faced greater danger in 1814 , when the British army actually invaded Washington , routed the city , and burned down the White House !
Somehow the republic survived those much more perilous times without a constitutional amendment calling for the emergency appointment of Representatives .
The scenarios offered by the commission , while theoretically possible , are highly unlikely to disable Congress .
Remember , a majority of members assemble together in one place only rarely ; even during votes most members are not on the floor together at the same time .
Inauguration ceremonies and State of the Union addresses often bring together a majority of members in the same place , but simple precautions could be taken to keep a sufficient number away from such events .
Even a direct terrorist attack on the Pentagon failed to disrupt the operation of the Department of Defense .
The COGC proposal exaggerates the likelihood that a terrorist strike on Washington would incapacitate the House of Representatives , and exaggeration is a bad reason to amend the Constitution .
Existing Constitutional Provisions Are Adequate
It is important to understand that the Constitution already provides the framework for Congress to function after a catastrophic event .
Article I section 2 grants the governors of the various states authority to hold special elections to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives .
Article I section 4 gives Congress the authority to designate the time , manner , and place of such special elections if states should fail to act expeditiously following a national emergency .
As Hamilton explains in Federalist 59 , the time , place , and manner clause was specifically designed to address the kind of extraordinary circumstances imagined by COGC .
Hamilton characterized authority over federal elections as shared between the states and Congress , with neither being able to control the process entirely .
COGC posits that states could not hold special elections quickly enough after a terrorist act to guarantee the functioning of Congress .
But even COGC reports that the average length of House vacancies , following the death of a member until the swearing in of a successor after a special election , is only 126 days .
Certainly this period could be shortened given the urgency created by a terrorist attack .
We should not amend the Constitution simply to avoid having a reduced congressional body for a month or two .
In fact , Congress often goes months without passing significant legislation , and takes long breaks in August and December .
If anything , legislation passed in the aftermath of a terrorist event is likely to be based on emotion , not reason .
The terrible Patriot Act , passed only one month after September 11th by a credulous Congress , is evidence of this .
Also , advances in technology can be used to reduce the risk of a disruption in congressional continuity following an emergency .
Members already carry Blackberry devices to maintain communications even if cut off from their offices .
Similar technology can be used to allow remote electronic voting by members .
Congress should focus on contingency plans that utilize technology , not a constitutional amendment .
States have a wide variety of electronic and telephonic technology at their disposal to speed up the process of special elections .
Consider that popular television shows hold votes that poll millions of Americans in a single night !
Yet COGC ignores alternatives to standard voting and incorrectly assumes that states will be in disarray and unable to hold elections for months .
COGC Is Dangerous because the House Must Be Elected
At its heart , the COGC proposal is fundamentally at odds with the right of the people always to elect their members of the House of Representatives .
The House must be elected .
Even temporary  appointees would be unacceptable , because the laws passed would be permanent .
The problems with appointment of representatives are obvious .
COGC calls for a general constitutional amendment that gives Congress wide power to make rules for filling vacancies in the event that a substantial number of members are killed or incapacitated .
Such an amendment would be unavoidably vague , open to broad interpretation and abuse .
In defining terms like vacancy ,  substantial ,  and incapacitated ,  Congress or the courts would be setting a dangerous precedent for a more elastic constitutional framework .
Members of Congress simply cannot appoint their colleagues ; the conflict of interest is glaring .
Alternate proposals allowing state governors to appoint representatives from a list of successors nominated by members are no better .
The House of Representatives represents the people , not the states .
Single states often exhibit wide variations in political makeup even among voters of the same party .
Appointment by governors , even though the successors represent the dead member ’s party choice , could change the ideological composition of Congress contrary to the will of the people .
Furthermore , voters choose an individual candidate , not a panel .
They should not be required to consider the qualifications of a candidate ’s potential successors .
COGC focuses on government legitimacy , arguing that a House of Representatives with only a handful of surviving members would not be seen as legitimate by the public .
In fact the opposite is true : appointed representatives  will never be seen as legitimate and in fact would not be legitimate .
Without exception , every member of the House of Representatives has been elected by voters in the member ’s district .
Madison states in Federalist 52 that  The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government .
The very legitimacy of the House of Representatives is based on its constitutional status as the most directly accountable federal body .
The House passes numerous laws , often by voice vote , with very few members present .
The legitimacy of those laws is not called into question .
Even a
House made up of only five elected members would have more legitimacy , as the living continuation of the only elected entity in government , than a House composed of five surviving members and 430 appointees .
Furthermore , even a decimated House membership would have to pass legislation with the concurrence of the Senate , which could be restored to full strength immediately by state governors .
Consider a scenario COGC forgot to mention .
Imagine a terrorist strike kills a majority of members of the House of Representatives .
200 members survive , and 235 are appointed by state governors on a temporary basis . 
This new body considers a bill that drastically increases taxes to pay for emergency measures , while suspending civil liberties and imposing martial law .
The bill passes , with 195 elected members opposed and all 235 appointed members in favor .
Only 5 elected members support the measure .
Would the electorate consider this legislation legitimate ?
Hardly .
Yet this is the type of outcome we must expect under the COGC proposal .
Conclusion
To quote Professor Charles Rice , a distinguished Professor Emeritus at Notre Dame Law School :  When it is not necessary to amend the Constitution , it is necessary not to amend the Constitution . 
We must not allow the understandable fears and passions engendered by the events of September 11th to compel a rushed and grievous injury to our system of government .
The Constitution is our best ally in times of relative crisis ; it is precisely during such times we should hold to it most dearly .
Rather than amending the Constitution , Congress should be meeting to discuss how to preserve our existing institutions — including an elected House — in the event of a terrorist attack .
The Constitution already provides us with the framework , while technology gives states the ability organize elections quickly .
The COGC proposal not only makes a mountain out of a molehill , but also acutely threatens the delicate balance of federal power established in the Constitution .

The Best of Ron Paul
By Evan Ackerman
Being a big fan of toasters of all sorts , I think it ’s about time that a toaster came along that utilizes , you guessed it , big fans to toast bread faster than ever before .
Designed by Oliver Newberry , a graduate of Central St Martins College in London , the Turbo Toaster was created specifically to address the problem of beans getting cold while toast is getting warm .
Apparently , this is a serious issue in England …
Serious enough that Heinz actually hopes to have this thing on sale within a year .
The working prototype uses ducted fans to blow hot air over the surface of the toast from both sides , reducing toasting time from the average of 141 seconds to a mere 50 seconds .
According to various unreliable sources , the titanium fans spin at 10,000 RPM and the heating elements use “ nylon - based laser technology . ”
I do n’t know what that is , exactly , but I still want it in my toaster .
Along with two huge engines .

If the numbers here are a representative sample of the recount of the machine counted votes , this is amazing .
One would expect 1 - 2 % of the totals to not match up - not 90 % !!!

There 's something very odd in Manchester Ward 5 : Clinton

255 217 Kucinich
23 20 Obama
404 365 Richardson
46 39 These candidates lost a total of 1411 - 1260 = 151 votes in the recount .
None of the other candidates gained more than a few votes .
So ... where did the remaining ~ 151 votes go ?
Also Bedford shows 184 votes for Richardson in the official tally , and " - " votes for him in the recount .
This is odd , considering that they appear to have recounted the Bedford votes for all the other major candidates .

Hi ,
I am re-sending because I do n't recall for sure what I already sent and this is important .
Ca n't get through to Bev. Bev can't make Kucinich do 100 % count .
Just know that I did a student t test with a 72 degrees of freedom that demonstrates the machine set of data has promoted Clinton over Obama with a probability error of less than a tenth of a percent .
Do the 100 % count for democrats and you will prove votes were taken from Obama by the machines .
Do n't lose focus that one extra vote in each precinct would throw a close election to the other candidate .
There were 46 extra votes for the Manchester precinct ( 12 machines ) alone .
There are over 200 wards ( 257 units ? ) .
More of the recount must be completed to prove vote flipping , but my student t analysis with a sample size 37 showed the effect for machine counts over hand counts exists and this has a probability of 99.9 percent .
.
Mark Crispin
Miller says the same idea here :
http://www.opednews.com/...what_to_expect_from_.htm &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Sunday 's work :
The New Hampshire presidential primary is a watershed for the Election Integrity community , Pre-election polling is often fairly accurate .
Exit polling is very accurate .
Worldwide , exit polling is accurate to a tenth of one percent of elections everywhere except the United States .
An aggregate of pollsters gave Obama 38.3 % of the vote and Clinton 30.0 % . over the period of January 5 - 6 .
See Table 1 . Zogby gave Obama 42 % and Clinton 29 % on January 7 , 2008 .
In case you missed it , exit polling for the Tuesday , January 8 , 2008 presidential primary in New Hampshire reported on TV projected 42 % of the vote for Obama and 29 % to Clinton as late in the day as 4 pm .
By 10 pm or so , the AP network was the first to project Clinton the winner with 39 % of the vote and Obama second with 36 % of the vote .
In other words , the exit poles appear to have been wrong .
There are other possible scenarios .
Lets wait for the facts to come in .
Both A Democrat and a Republican candidate have called for recounts by the Friday , January 11 deadline .
New Hampshire specifies a hand recount of the ballots which will begin on Monday , January 16 .
The costs will be based on recount costs including State Highway patrol transport of the ballots from clerk 's offices to the recount location .
It is true that about half of the wards ( precincts ) , representing about 20 % of the ballots , were hand counted initially and the remainder , or about 80 % of the ballots , were counted by the Diebold Accuvote machine which is of an optical scan design .
My analysis of the Secretary of State 's posting of election results follows .
A student t analysis was conducted to compare two samples to test whether hand count results differed from machine count results by chance alone .
If the resulting probability of the test is small , then one can assume that the difference is not due to chance alone .
For my study I chose the ratio of Clinton to Obama votes as the parameter to measure .
If the ratio is greater than one , then a Clinton win is favored and if the ratio is less than one , Obama is favored .
For the first sample ( hand counts ) 37 wards were posted to be compared to a sample of 37 wards which were machine counted .
The results appear as figure 3 .
The mean of the hand count was 0.882 ( favoring Obama ) and had a standard deviation of 0.254 .
The mean of the machine count was 1.15 ( favoring Clinton ) and had a standard deviation of 0.387 .
The probability result was 0.0012 that the student t test was in error .
Clearly the difference between the hand count sample and the machine count sample was not due to chance alone .
The reason for the difference remains to be satisfactorily explained .

Thursday 's work :
ere are early results for the hand recount of the New Hampshire Presidential Election The 2008 New Hampshire Presidential Election contains an unexplained story .
Early media projections predicted an Obama win ( 42 % ) over Clinton ( 29 % ) .
As late as 4 pm media were reporting that the election race was reflected by the pole projections .
The truth is that media paid for exit pole data which was available only to the press and academic insitutions .
While election projections are usually a good indicator of outcome , exit poles are accurate to within a tenth of a percent .
That is , everywhere in the world , excpt the United Sttes .
It is now known that exit poles actually showed a very close race between Clinton and Obama all day .
Both a Democrat ( Kucinich ) and a Republican ( Albert Howard ) requestd recounts .
The hand recount of all ballots cast has been undertaken in Concord , New Hampshire state capitol , in the Archival building .
State police will bring ballots from local Clerks ' offices .
The projected cost of the recount has been set at 24 cents per ballot , but cost overage will be billed back to the requestors .
Six teams operate in parallel and the procedure is video taped .
Just like in the movie " Hacking Democracy . "
Manchester is a 12 - ward unit comprised of 12 Diebold optical scanners .
Statewide , the scanners count about 80 % of the ballots and the remainder are hand counted .
All of the machines used in the State are of the same Accuvote version and are serviced by a single Company ( LHS ) .
Data is collected by phone calls for the Secretary of State 's office and hand tabulated into a spread sheet .
Not all the data collected in the first day is shown here : nor is all the data recounted for the two candidates reported here .
Some data for the 5th and 7th wards has not yet been recounted .
Turn to the attached table .
Column C shows the reported count for Clinton followed by recount Column E .
One expects the numbers to match exactly , but they differ by 46 votes .
Clearly the Accuvote machine performs this task poorly .
Column G shows the reported count for Obama followed by recount column I .
Again one expects the numbers to match exactly , but they differ by 4 ballots .
This is not an acceptable performance level for counting ballots in any elecion .
And this is only the first peak at incomplete data on day one of the recount .
The electronic voting machines appear to be inadequate for the job but any assessment should be whthheld until the completion of the recount .
The ward level ( precinct ) hand count of ballots is necessary to assure transpareny when electronic machines are used to count ballots .

you guys are going overboard .
from today 's union leader :
The widest variations so far were in Manchester 's Ward 5 .
Vote counters there mistakenly transposed write - in votes for vice president as votes for presidential candidate .
As a result , all major candidates lost votes .
Kucinich lost three in the ward and has a total of 20 votes there .
Hillary Clinton lost 64 with a new total of 619 ; John Edwards lost 38 and has 217 votes ; Barack Obama lost 39 and has 365 , and Bill Richardson lost seven , leaving him 39 .
so , it was n't machine error but tabulation error on the part of the ward 5 poll checkers who on election night added the votes of the vp choices to the presidential choices .
i really think you should tone it down a notch and wait until everything is recounted ... and then say something .
otherwise , you are just getting everyone into a tizzy , wrongly , i might add .

New Hampshire is a small state with great pride and tradition that it goes first in the primaries .
This gives it an enormous amount of power in culling out candidates ... unjustly ?
If they can't do a better job than this , then they do n't deserve to go first .
Maybe it 's time to start thinking about how to apportion the 2012 primaries .
Let the states compete with each other to provide the most open , secure , fair , registration and voting .
Those who get it right , and on time , get to go first , or be in a lottery to go first .

Sorry Phil , but you argument fails .
First , your claim that " nearly every machine " count is different is bogus .
IF you actually look at the totals , it is the other way around .
The majority of the counts are the same .
Second , your argument is based on two false assumptions .
1 ) You have seem to forgotten that ballots that " spoiled " by VOTER ERROR have been added back into the totals .
That alone will change a number of votes .
2 ) You have ignored the fact that hand counts also have a margin of error .
As an Accountant , who has been a part of conducting several store inventories , I have seen first hand how several groups of counters can come back with several different totals for the same item .
As the number of items go up , the more likely they will the numbers will not agree .
Further , there is NO SUCH THING as a prefect election .
It will NEVER happen .
The best that we can hope for is a paper trail that we can double check .
In this case , the process is working just as it should .
There was a vote WITH PAPER BALLOTS , there were questions on why was the vote so different from the exit polls .
The hand count shows the same winner as did the machine count .
No " vote swapping " , no " hacking " of the counting machines to change the outcome of the election .

♣ Truth Realm is pleased to bring you this message from the Ron Paul 2008 Campaign .
The army of support for Dr. Paul continues to grow day by day .
Even as Washington led his troops through a difficult winter in Valley Forge , Dr. Ron Paul is now leading us toward new Hope for America .
Will you take these words to heart ?
January 30 , 2008
Every movement in history has faced some time of testing , some experience that either forges it into something strong and unified , or forces it to fade away into the history books as another failed experiment .
Dr. Paul has written to you that we are heading straight for Super Tuesday .
Our opponents are free to beat up on each other and wear themselves down while we gather our supporters and prepare to storm the convention with delegates .
Last night , over 60,000 people stood up and asked for an end to the runaway violation of our liberties .
But contrary to the impression you may be getting from the mainstream media , no national delegates have yet been won in Florida .
Those delegates will only be awarded between February 6 and April 30 at delegate selection caucuses , and many of those delegates will be supporters of Dr. Paul .
Ron Paul is the only candidate not to give up on any state in the Republican race , and just as we competed strongly in overlooked states like Nevada and Louisiana , so too will we compete in Maine , Minnesota , and other states that the so - called “ top- tier ” candidates are content to ignore .
Now , as the focus shifts to Super Tuesday , Rudy 's campaign is crushed , Huckabee is losing momentum by the day , and McCain and Romney are fighting over who is the most liberal .
We 've been here before .
In 1776 , despite a courageous effort at holding onto the city , George Washington ceded New York and quickly retreated to New Jersey .
1777 brought the British recapture of Fort Ticonderoga , as well as American defeats at Brandywine and Germantown .
And then , during the winter of 1777 - 1778 , Washington and his army faced perhaps their most humiliating moment , forced to endure a harsh Pennsylvania winter with limited supplies at Valley Forge .
The American revolutionaries dealt with their defeats , focused on their goals , and emerged from Valley Forge as a force that would defeat the most powerful nation on earth .
Our momentum is building .
Each one of us , from Dr. Paul himself down to the grassroots supporter who donates the last $ 5 he or she can give , is focused on the goal .
Early in the struggle for American independence , George Washington wrote : “ Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages . ”
Even then , Washington realized that a fierce struggle for self - government can only be won with a spirit of determination equal to the challenge .
Today , in the midst of our new revolution , let 's consider Washington 's words once again .
The task before us is enormous .
The foes of liberty are deeply entrenched , and they will not relinquish their power without a struggle .
But fighting in our favor is the unconquerable human spirit , the innate desire to be free .
We must embrace this inner strength , dig in our heels , and persevere , just as Washington and his rag - tag colonials , the first American grassroots patriots , did before us .
And if we must pass through a Valley Forge or two along the way to victory , let those times of testing temper the steel of our determination .
If Ron Paul is to continue his fight for liberty to the Republican Convention , we need your help in two critical ways :

Basswood body .
Maple neck .
Two humbuckers and one single - coil .
Do n’t settle for less .
With Ibanez less bucks does n’t mean less looks or less tone .
Ibanez GRX guitars have the humbuckers you need for heavy rhythms and riffs ; and exciting finishes worthy of a pro axe .
To make sure none of the great tone gets lost in the sauce , GRX 6 - string models feature the FAT - 10 tremolo .
Basswood is a comparatively lightweight wood , which makes it very comfortable for extended playing .
With a good balance of highs and lows , basswood is right in between alder and mahogany in sound character .
Rosewood offers a strong , bright sound and an attractive appearance with a long grain .
Feature :
This had an alright amount of accessories .
It came with a cable , manual , spring , and a bar .
The bars really good but the cable broke within a day .
The pickups on this guitar is very nice .
This guitar is made out of basswood so its sort of light .
Its thing and get to play solos .
The twin humbuckers with the single in the middle is a nice touch .
gives it a really rocky sound nice shark tooth inlays and awesome white binding .
Considerably nice trem .
The tremolo sometimes have problem .
Quality :
It was great right out of the box there were no missing or broken parts no blemishes .
This guitar is strong , dropped it 2 times heavily on concrete and it still sounds and looks great and it still sounds great .
But turning the tone knob all the way is almost like an off button .
3 piece basswood .
Solid Body .
A brilliant finish .
Jumbo frets , they do n’t tend to bend much .
The tremolo system , this guitar is put together well and mine does not have any blemishes or loose parts .
Surprising of the quality despite this thing being made in Indonesia .
As with any guitar , if it is taken care of , it will last .
Sound :
The sound is sweet and crisp EVEN though the amp was junk .
The two humbuckers makes the guitar sound great , but with the single coil pickup in the middle makes the guitar really sound at its best .
Good sound in various switch positions , from clear to distort .
Ease of Use :
It ’s a little hard .
The fret board is n’t easy to move your fingers on and it untunes itself for some odd reason , and the bridge sucks ( the whammy bar also messes it up the tuning ) besides that , its very good for beginners and those in the middle of the intermediate stage .
5 options on the pick up switches .
You can get a lot of combination using the HSH combination .
It can handle rhythm & lead sections very easily .
The plug it in to a good amp , and it will stand right up and even pass most in the same price range .
Value :
It ’s definitely worth more than it ’s price .
This guitar is well worth the money .
A good quality guitar for the money .
You have to trust , this guitar is better than a RG270 series .
Check latest price .
Desirability :
This guitar looks and plays and sounds amazing .
The amazing color , and the style are all amazing .
the Candy Apple Red and with the shark tooth inlays , this is a sharp looking guitar as an extra to play .
Overall :
If you have confidence for Ibanez , this is a good choice for you to get a RG with an affordable price , this guitar is pretty lovely .
This is guitar for beginners and it can be improved .

The guests at an event in the Chilean capital of Santiago , marking the release of a book about Hashomer Hatzair , included none other than the Iranian ambassador to the South American nation , Kambiz Jalali .
The Chilean Foreign Ministry , in cooperation with the Chilean Jewish community , sent out invitations to the event to diplomats in the capital , including apparently the Embassy of Iran .

We are forbidden from speaking with Israeli diplomats . "
The Israeli attaché responded , saying he would respect the Iranian 's wishes but that as diplomats they are supposed to communicate with each other in order to encourage understanding between their two sides .

Baghdad --
A majority of Iraq 's parliament has signed a proposed bill that would require a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq and freeze current troop levels , a sign of a growing division between Iraqi legislators and the prime minister that mirrors the widening gulf between the Bush administration and its critics in Congress .
The draft bill would create a timeline for a gradual departure , much like what some Democrats in the United States have demanded , and require the Iraqi government to secure parliament 's approval before any further extensions of the U.N. mandate for foreign troops in Iraq , which expires at the end of 2007 .
" We have n't asked for the immediate withdrawal of multinational forces , we asked that we should build our security forces and make them qualified and at that point there would be a withdrawal , " said Baha al - Araji , a parliamentarian allied with the anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , whose supporters drafted the bill .
" But no one can accept the occupation of his country . "
In both Iraq and the United States , there is deepening frustration among lawmakers and the public over President Bush 's troop buildup , a policy that has yet to prevent widespread killing in Iraq .
At the same time , Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki are dispatching their emissaries in an urgent transatlantic gambit to shore up support .
Iraq 's national security adviser , Mowaffak al - Rubaie , was in Washington this week to ask Democratic members of Congress to have patience with the " surge , " and to not abandon Iraq at such a precarious time .
On Wednesday , Vice President Dick Cheney landed in Baghdad to press the government to act quickly on a host of divisive political issues the Bush administration deems necessary for long - term stability .
On his second day in Iraq , Cheney spoke to U.S. soldiers at a base near Tikrit about the difficulties they face .
" We are here , above all , because the terrorists who have declared war on America and other free nations have made Iraq the central front in that war , " he said , according to a transcript of his remarks .
" The United States , also , has made a decision :
As the prime target of a global war against terror , we will stay on the offensive .
We will not sit back and wait to be hit again . "
But as in the United States , Iraq 's lawmakers are moving further away from the views of the government , particularly on the issue of American presence in Iraq .
The draft bill is being championed by a 30 - member bloc loyal to al - Sadr , but it has also gained support from some other Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish legislators .
So far , at least 138 lawmakers have signed the proposed legislation , the slimmest possible majority in the 275 - member parliament , according to Araji .
Nassr al - Rubae , another al - Sadr loyalist , told the Associated Press that the draft bill had 144 signatures .
Several legislators , including those loyal to al - Maliki , doubted the effort would succeed at a time when Iraqi troops still rely heavily on U.S. firepower .
The most prominent political parties in Iraq , such as al - Maliki's Dawa party ; the Shiite group known as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ; the Iraqi Islamic Party , a leading Sunni group ; and prominent Kurdish factions appear to not support setting specific dates for withdrawal .
And even if such dates were established , it is unclear whether that would compel the United States to obey them .
Ali al - Adeeb , a Dawa lawmaker and an aide to al - Maliki , said any timetable for American withdrawal should be accompanied by a timetable for training and equipping the Iraqi security forces .
" Pressures are increasing here in Iraq and also in the states for the withdrawal of the multinational forces ... and it seems that keeping these forces here indefinitely wo n't solve the problems in Iraq , " he said .
" But it should happen gradually so that Iraqi forces can handle the security tasks . "
There was also some disagreement over the terms of proposed timetable legislation .
Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman told the Associated Press he agreed to back the measure on the condition it include an accompanying timeline for the buildup of Iraqi forces , but this was not included in the draft , which he called a " deception . "
Hassan al - Shimmari , a Shiite who leads the Fadhila party in parliament , also signed the petition and had similar concerns .
" At the time being we can all see that it 's not possible for the American troops to leave , and that withdrawing right now would lead to a disaster in Iraq , because the Iraqi security forces are still very weak , and they are still controlled by their sectarian and factional loyalties , " Shimmari said .
The violence driven by such sectarian rifts continued on Thursday , as the insurgent group known as the Islamic State of Iraq , a coalition that includes al Qaeda in Iraq , posted an Internet video that purports to show the killing of nine Iraqi police and army officers .
The one - minute video shows the uniformed and blindfolded men kneeling in a row on a patch of dirt as a black - masked gunmen shoots them rapidly in the head one after another , saying " God is great " with each execution .
The insurgents apparently demanded the release of prisoners before shooting the men , according to an earlier internet video .
The gruesome scene is similar to the apparent execution of 20 Iraqi soldiers and police on April 19 , which the Islamic State of Iraq also claimed was their work .
On Thursday the U.S. military said one Marine had been killed Tuesday during fighting in Anbar province in western Iraq .
Two other U.S. soldiers died Thursday from gunshot wounds , one in Baghdad , and the other in Diwaniya , south of the capital .
Refactoring Paralysis
I think that the likelihood that a task will be carried out under pressure has to do with how immediately beneficial the results of the task are ( long - term goals vanish in the immediate firefighting activities ) and how easy it is to carry out the tasks ( low - hanging fruit are first ) .
Most teams are under pressure most of the time these days , and have enough trouble on their minds without extra tasks that are future - looking and hard to perform .
BTW : When an organization complains about " lack of discipline " , it is my experience that it 's universally because they have placed unreasonable time constraints on the development team .
When the team scrambles to get work done and cut corners in order to hopefully hit * some * of the dates , they will make mistakes .
Some are in code , some are in process , some are in personal relationships .
When the pressure is severe , people start to crack and crumble .
The discipline issue is a way that managers blame the developers for trying to comply with the unrealistic dates and procedures that the managers made for them .
" You tie huge burdens to men 's backs but you do not lift a finger to help them " is a pretty good description .
But that 's for another rant .
I want my IDE to make it easy to do the right things .
I like Eclipse becuase it makes unit testing and refactoring very easy , and these are things that need to be easy .
People need fewer reasons to abandon testing and refactoring when they 're in a crunch .
I like dynamic languages because they make it easier for me to get that first step " make it work " done , and then make it easy to reflect on the code I 've written .
Refactoring tools for Python ( Bicycle Repair Man ) help even more because they make some refactorings easy enough .
The libraries are easier to understand typically , and the live command line environment lets me experiment and figure out what the libraries really do .
These are the kinds of help that people under pressure really need .
Some IDEs spend most of their function points trying to compensate for the crappy qualities of a bad language , but there are reasons to love an IDE .
One advantage of working in a more normal text editing environment * for a while * is that you can separate the quality of the IDE from the quality of the language .
This is good because then you realize how great an IDE it is , and you realize how bad a language .
I think that a lot of it is just the sense of being in an unfamiliar environment .
When I change editors and operating systems and languages , I can be paralyzed .
Add a few libraries and enterprise tools , and I 'm like a deer in the headlights .
That whole biological urge to flee or freeze kicks in , the stress piles up .
It 's deep and profound that stress and fear .
But even with appropriate tools , if enough other variables are new or different you will have the same feeling .
Maybe for weeks , maybe for months , maybe for years .
It 's areas like this that old school unix sorts that tend to really learn their editors ( usually vi and ( x ) emacs ) well , as also espoused by the Pragmatic Programmers , which used to make up a large percentage of the Ruby community -- less so now that Ruby has shot up in popularity , do n't seem to have as much of a problem .
The lack of " total control of text " that most IDE editors have often turns off folks like this .
I see it a lot when teaching , where I see a category of programmer that uses the only the " most intuitive features of notepad " in their IDE editor and relies on various menus and pull downs for all other text .
THey 're stymied that they can't code ruby as comfortably as when they see me demo , and are dazzled by how quick the code changes shape w/o any menu usage .
The combination of : quick touch typing , attacking things in small pieces , very strong adherence to TDD , and being .
quite good control of my editor of choice , and freqeunt but small refactoring seems to keep things in balance for me .
I would probably be more agressive in refactoring with tools , but the refactorings you mentioned are not so difficult with good editor control .
This sort of ties into the questions I asked in another post ( where I feel refactoring was the only part not answered by Bob ) .
How do you even make a refactoring tool for Ruby , without static typing ?
Consider the simple example of Rename Method .
How would the tool know what method calls to change , since it cannot know if a call refers to this method or a similarly named method in another class .
Or , for that matter , if the method you are renaming was supposed to mirror the interface of another class .
Same problem for more complex refactorings .
But I guess there is a good answer to all of this , since it works for Smalltalk .
On the subject of IDEs , I feel that a good IDE should primarily give you tools to process your code , rather than building abstractions on top of you code .
Of course , abstractions are not evil in themselves ; I still prefer visual GUI building to the extremely tedious work of stringing components together in code .
Source control is your friend . ;-)
> big do - it - all - for - you IDEs are most useful for poor developers
I fully agree , I am no big fan of wizard - driven push - button IDEs that spit tons of ugly code in your face and gives a false sense of control to developers who ignore what is going on " behind the scene " .
But refactoring features are very conceptually different from that .
In fact the poor developers you mention almost never refactor .
now I just need to rename , flip to the header , flip to the cpp , compile , fix the breaks , compile again , probablly break again cause it gave up early the first time , run the tests
though with tools like incredibuild it takes some of the pain out of it , but ruby ?
pffft , thats easy to refactor
As for big IDEs ?
I dunno , I 'm really liking vs2005 with resharper installed .
There 's another factor here too which I 'll address in I was able to break through the fear and start refactoring .
And , so far , it really has n't been very difficult .
I 've been able to keep my tests passing without any horrible hicoughs .
But , WOW , the backpressure in my own head was astounding .
I still catch myself staring at the code ; refusing to act .
It 's almost a fugue state ; a mild catatonia .
I know what I want to do to the code , but I stare at it instead because I fear I 'll break something .
There 's another factor here too which I 'll address in MakingMessesInRuby
What about your tests ?
Do n't get me wrong ..
I 'm a huge fan of refactoring tools in Java and C# .
I 'm just not convinced they are needed as much for Ruby .
They would be useful ... but not , imo , at the cost of a large , bloated , overbearing IDE .
Now I 'll really be controversial ... big do - it - all - for - you IDEs are most useful for poor developers ( which explains why there 's such a big market for such IDEs ) .
In my experience , they get in the way as much or more than they help .
Sure , some better tools support would help with Ruby ... but it 's not as important as some people think .
And it was n't that long ago that I was one of those people .
It 'll still be developing Ruby in a big , heavy IDE .
It 's overkill .
Dave , I do not think it is a question of the " IDE controlling / managing / hiding the complexity of the language being used " but a question of fluidity .
With a proper tool , your programming experience becomes fluid in the sense that it flows almost directly from your brain to your application : your intention gets reified in a matter of a click or ( better ) a keyboard shortcut .
Often , tools ( or lack of proper tools ) , stand in your way : they break your flow of ideas by forcing you to figure out the n-step needed to concretize a particular intention .
And all this is extremely critical when refactoring , which is probably the programming practice that requires the most fluidity ( and / hence is the heck of a fun ) .
I find myself refactoring in Ruby as fluidly using TextMate
I used RadRails
Working in Ruby is fundamentally different at a philosophical level .
As is Smalltalk .. but that 's different again .
I used to think that too .
I 'm not sure anymore .
How much of the value of powerful IDEs has to do with controlling / managing / hiding the complexity of the language being used ?
I 've come to think that that 's a lot of it .
I find myself refactoring in Ruby as fluidly using TextMate [ ? ] as I did with Eclipse or IDEA in Java .. moreso maybe because it 's faster ... there 's no wizards .. you just do it .
I used RadRails [ ? ] for a while .. it has some nice features but after a while I foudn that it just got in the way .
It 's big , and slow ... not very condusive to working fluidly .
And also it totally does n't fit well into an OS X environment .
Working in Ruby is fundamentally different at a philosophical level .
As is Smalltalk .. but that 's different again .
I 've been working on on the Harry Potter problem in Ruby .
I have a version that works , and now I 'd like to refactor it .
I 'm using Text Mate as my " ide " .
I find myself in a state of paralysis .
There I things I 'd like to change , but I know the cost will be high , so I think and think about them instead of acting .
This is not how I work in Java with IntelliJ .
With IntelliJ I do my thinkingacting !
I change variable names ; I extract methods ; I create and destroy base classes ; in short I refactor madly .
But in Ruby , without a good refactoring tool , I sit and stare at the code .
I know what I have to do .
I just have to break through the fear and start refactoring ; and I will .
But I was amazed at howthe fear of changing code is when you do n't have the appropriate tools .
Jetbrains , or someone , youhave to make a refactoring tool for Ruby!!!!commentForm -r
Creationism is not taught as a subject in schools
Head of science at London 's Institute of Education Professor Michael Reiss says some teachers , fearful of entering the debate , avoid the subject totally .
This could leave pupils with gaps in their scientific knowledge , he says .
Prof Reiss says the rise of creationism is partly down to the large increase in Muslim pupils in UK schools .
The days have long gone when science teachers could ignore creationism when teaching about origins
Professor Reiss
He said : " The number of Muslim students has grown considerably in the last 10 to 20 years and a higher proportion of Muslim families do not accept evolutionary theory compared with Christian families .
" That 's one reason why it 's more of an issue in schools . "
Prof Reiss estimates that one in 10 people in the UK now believes in literal interpretations of religious creation stories - whether they are based on the Bible or the Koran .
Many more teachers he met at scientific meetings were telling him they encountered more pupils with creationist views , he said .
" The days have long gone when science teachers could ignore creationism when teaching about origins . "
Instead , teachers should tackle the issue head - on , whilst trying not to alienate students , he argues in a new book .
' Not equally valid '
" By not dismissing their beliefs , we can ensure that these students learn what evolutionary theory really says - and give everyone the understanding to respect the views of others , " he added .
His book ;
Teaching about Scientific Origins : Taking Account of Creationism , gives science teachers advice on how to deal with the " dilemma " .
Further discussion of creationism should occur in religious education as it is a belief system , not one based on science
Hilary Leevers
Campaign for Science and Engineering
He supports new government guidelines which say creationism should not be discussed in science classes unless it is raised by pupils .
But Prof Reiss argues that there is an educational value in comparing creationist ideas with scientific theories like Darwin 's theory of evolution because they demonstrate how science , unlike religious beliefs , can be tested .
The scientist , who is also a Church of England priest , adds that any teaching should not give the impression that creationism and the theory of evolution are equally valid scientifically .
Dr Hilary Leevers , of the Campaign for Science and Engineering , said science teachers would be teaching evolution not creationism and so should not need a book to tell them how to " delicately handle controversy between a scientific theory and a belief " .
" The author suggests that science teachers cannot ignore creationism when teaching origins , but the opposite is true , " she said .
Teachers could discuss how creationism differed from scientific theory if a student brought up the subject , but any further discussion should occur in religious education lessons , she said .
A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokesman said it had recently published guidelines to teachers on the issue .
" Creationism and intelligent design are not scientific theories nor testable as scientific fact - and have no place in the science curriculum .
" But we advise science teachers that when questions about creationism come up in lessons , it provides an opportunity to explain or explore what makes a scientific theory . "
Claim :
In the process of attempting to get rid of a gopher , a trio of school custodians blew up their shack .
Though all three janitors were carried out on stretchers , the gopher returned to the wild unscathed .
TRUE
Origins : Just when you think every fantastic story is fabricated , you run into
one like this .
On 3 April 1995 , someone ( probably one of the kids ) brought a very much alive and healthy gopher to the janitor and two maintenance men at Carroll Fowler Elementary School in Ceres , California .
The three guys decided to kill the gopher and took it into a small room where janitorial supplies are stored .
They tried to off the critter by spraying it with a cleaning solvent used to remove gum from floors .
( The solvent works by freezing the gum , thereby making it easy to scrape up . )
Three cans were used on the condemned , but to no avail .
The product did n’t seem to faze the gopher one bit .
It is speculated that one of the men
then attempted to light a cigarette in this tiny enclosed space .
This is plausible because smoking on school grounds is forbidden — this supply room is where any of the maintenance people would go to sneak a puff .
As well , the janitor — the one most badly injured — was a smoker ; his
being at the center of the blast and his neck wounds are consistent with this hypothesis .
As any sensible person would expect , there was one heck of
an explosion , and all three men were injured .
Sixteen kids were also hurt ( mostly scraped knees and solvent inhalation — nothing all that serious ) .
The explosion took place at 8:10 in the morning , and classes at that school start at 8:25 — given the number of kids milling around at that time , it ’s a wonder more of them were n’t hurt .
In the aftermath of the explosion , the sprayed - down gopher was discovered unharmed and clinging to a wall .
He was released back into the wild .
Of the three men , one was released from hospital that day , one was sent home a couple of days later , and the janitor ( Carl ) spent some time in the Burn Center in Stockton .

Lieberman makes his campaign pitch for McCain
Given his recent endorsement event in New Hampshire , Joe Lieberman was bound to send out a fundraising letter on John McCain ’s behalf one of these days .
The donation pitch hit email boxes yesterday , with a message that ’s worth considering in more detail .
I know that it is unusual for someone who is not a Republican to endorse a Republican candidate for President .
And if this were an ordinary time and an ordinary election , I probably would not have done so .
But this is no ordinary time ….
I ’d like to thank Lieberman for identifying himself as “ someone who is not a Republican , ” instead of using “ Democrat . ”
I still find it annoying when news outlets put a “ D ” after his name .
In this critical election , no one should let party lines be a barrier to choosing the person we believe is best qualified to lead our nation forward .
The problems that confront us are too great … .
Yes , we are confronted with quite a list of “ problems , ” are n’t we ?
Of course , as Matt Yglesias noted , “ [ L ] eft unmentioned here is that a huge proportion of the great ‘ problems that confront us ’ are the direct results of the Bush / McCain / Lieberman effort to replace traditional internationalism with the daft ‘ rogue state rollback ’ that McCain campaigned on during the 2000 primary .
There was at least a point in time when George W. Bush seemed to recognize the folly of this , but it ’s always been McCain ’s passion . ”
I have worked closely with John for many years on many issues .
I have seen John , time and again , rise above the negativism and smallness of our politics to get things done for this country we love so much .
Really ?
Would that include the times he ridicules the children of his political enemies and the frequent F - bombs he drops on his colleagues who dare to disagree with him ?
When others were silent , and it was thought politically unpopular , John had the courage and common sense to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq and to call for more troops and a new strategy there .
Lieberman has been hitting this note repeatedly of late .
In his endorsement speech for McCain nearly two weeks ago , Lieberman said the exact same thing , literally word for word .
He can keep repeating it , but it ’s still wrong .
Far from “ sounding the alarm , ” as Lieberman insisted today , McCain was doing the opposite .
“ It ’s clear that the end is very much in sight . ” [ ABC , 4/9/03 ]
“ This is a mission accomplished .
They know how much influence Saddam Hussein had on the Iraqi people , how much more difficult it made to get their cooperation . ”
[ This Week , ABC , 12/14/03 ]
“ I ’m confident we ’re on the right course . ” [ ABC News , 3/7/04 ]
“ I do think that progress is being made in a lot of Iraq .
Overall , I think a year from now , we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course .
If I thought we were n’t making progress , I ’d be despondent . ”
[ The Hill , 12/8/05 ]
OK , so Lieberman ’s wrong about reality .
The more politically salient question is whether any of this is having the desired effect .
Lieberman ’s endorsement was intended to drive independents to McCain .
Is that happening ?
Apparently not .
According to a Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll released last week , Lieberman ’s endorsement makes only 15 % of independents more likely to vote for McCain , yet it persuades 25 % of Republicans .
But the polls only tell part of the story .
It ’s not Lieberman the maverick or moderate who helps McCain the most ; it ’s Lieberman the moralist .
In other words , McCain ’s Republican support is bolstered by Lieberman ’s endorsement .
And what does this tell us about Lieberman ?
Natalie Portman , neuroscientist
Every once in a while , you run across celebrity profiles that attempt to demonstrate that not all celebrities are as dumb as fenceposts .
You ’ll read about the fact that , for example , Brad Pitt is deeply engaged by architecture , or that David Duchovny almost finished his literature PhD , or that Christy Turlington studied Eastern philosophy at NYU .
But I think I ’ve just stumbled upon the single most impressive bit of celebuscholarship yet : “ Frontal Lobe Activation during Object Permanence : Data from Near - Infrared Spectroscopy ” .
In this paper — published in a 2001 issue of the journal NeuroImage — a group of scientists conducted a pioneering bit of brain - scanning .
They took a bunch of infants and used near - infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) to try and probe their mental activity during “ object permanence ” tests .
Object permanence is , of course , our ability to know that an object still exists even after it ’s been hidden from sight .
Theorists have argued for years about precisely when an infant develops this ability .
The advent of brain - scanning techniques in the 90s offered tantalizing glimpses into mental activity ; but it was always hard to scan the brains of infants because most brain - scanning takes place in MRI tubes — and it ’s impossible to get an infant to hold its head still inside a tube while subjecting it to funky little mental tasks .
( Actually , it ’s pretty much impossible to get an infant into a tube without it totally freaking out , let alone holding its head still . )
So the group of scientists in NeuroImage decided to try NIRS instead .
NIRS is very cool new technology : Basically , you put a bunch of near - infrared lights up against your head and shine them directly down into the skull .
The light penetrates a few millimeters , much the way that if you hold a flashlight flat against your hand you can see the light penetrating your skin .
Since your frontal cortex is quite close to the surface of the skull , the near - infrared light actually hits it and bounces off .
It ’s possible to scan the reflected light and infer how much blood activity — and thus mental activity — is taking place inside the frontal cortex , on a millisecond - by - millisecond basis .
But here ’s the thing :
Since all you ’re doing is strapping a bunch of little lights to somebody ’s skull , it would be — the NeuroImage team theorized — possible to finally peer into the brains of small infants .
And sure enough , it worked !
They produced the first functional images of infant brains , cracking open a glimpse at the emergence of “ object permance ” in a baby ’s brain .
As they concluded in their paper :
NIRS is a harmless , noninvasive technique that uses no ionizing radiation or contrast agents , does not require the subject to be lying quietly in a scanner , and makes no noise .
Therefore , NIRS is particularly well suited to repeated use in neuroimaging studies of infants and children .
Who was on this crack team of scientists ?
It was led by Jerome Kagan — a Harvard professor who is a pioneer in infant developmental psychology — but it also included Thomas Gaudette , Kathryn A. Walz , David A. Boas … and the Harvard grad student Natalie Hershlag .
Natalie Hershlag , of course , is better known as Natalie Portman .
I have to say , that ’s pretty awesome .
An Academy - Award - nominated actress who is also a brain scientist .

Pelosi : Bush ' has a tin ear ' on war Posted by Rick Pearson at 9 am CDT While the White House and Democratic congressional leaders try to reach a compromise on supplemental Iraq War funding , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has shown no signs of slowing her attacks on President Bush .
Appearing in Chicago Friday at Rep. Jan Schakowsky 's " Ultimate Women 's Power Lunch , " a fundraiser hosted by the North Shore Democratic congresswoman at the Chicago Hilton and Towers , Pelosi called the war “ the biggest ethical issue facing our country . ”
Pelosi questioned whether it was ethical to send troops into war “ under a false pretense without a strategy for success , ” without proper equipment and training and without “ demanding accountability from the Iraqi government while we dishonored our commitment to our veterans here at home . ”
“ In the elections , when the American people were calling for a new direction , the one place where they called for it in the clearest possible way was in the war in Iraq , ” Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) told an audience estimated at about 2,000 people .
“ They wanted the war to wind down , ” Pelosi said .
“ Instead , the president has escalated it .
He has a tin ear in terms of listening to the people and a blind eye as to what is going on in Iraq . ”
Earlier , Pelosi defended Democrats from GOP criticism that their now - vetoed Iraq supplemental contained a U.S. troop withdrawal timetable that amounted to a script for insurgents or Al Qaeda to take over the country , creating new opportunities for terrorism .
“ We ’ll fight terrorism , ” she said .
“ There is absolutely no question about the Democrats commitment to fighting terrorism . ”
Of warnings from the White House and Republicans that Al Qaeda is actively working in Iraq and threatening the country ’s stability , Pelosi said that Al Qaeda was n’t present before the U.S. invasion .
She said Al Qaeda represents “ a small percentage of the insurgents and militias and those who are fighting there . ”
“ The Iraqis will take care of Al Qaeda and we will fight terrorism wherever it exists , ” Pelosi said .
“ But that does n’t mean we have to have our troops dying in a civil war that is not making our country safer . ”
Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , who attended the event , said the president ’s veto of the spending bill means the process is “ back to the drawing board and there are three drawing boards ” - the House , the Senate and separate negotiations between the White House and congressional leadership .
Durbin said that while “ profound disagreements ” exist , he believes there is “ a constructive and positive attitude ” toward trying to reach a compromise by the end of the month .
But Durbin also noted that congressional efforts to “ deauthorize ” the war , such as those discussed by presidential contender and U.S. Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) would be fruitless .
“ I ’m not sure deauthorizing the war would end it , ” Durbin said .
“ This president as commander in chief is likely to continue this war even if Congress sends him a deauthorizing bill .
I ca n’t imagine he would ever sign it . ”

" can anyone on her tell me this : WHEN DID CONGRESS DECARE WAR ON
IRAQ .....???????????? "
- Posted by forthepeopl1 at 07:33 AM : Apr 23 , 2007
It did n't .
It passed an authorization to use force .
The Spanish - American War began with a Congressional authorization to use
force , followed shortly by a formal Declaration of War .
They are not the
same thing , no matter what Joe Biden says about it .
Any thinking person knows that a Congressional authorization to use force
should only cover a very short term , emergency use of force .
A few weeks
at
most .
When it drags on into months , at that point both common sense and the
Constitution require that either a formal Declaration of War be made by
Congress , or the military action be terminated .
The First Gulf
War lasted half a year and was a violation of this
principle .
The Balkans action was also a violation , but at least that was over in
four
months , with no American combat deaths .
JFK , LBJ and Nixon in Vietnam were egregious examples .
If Bush were to be impeached and convicted over this fiasco ( and it
could n't
happen to a nicer guy ) , future Presidents would act in a more sober and
restrained manner .
And the Founding Fathers would approve of that .
please mr secretary general of the united nations ,
PLEASE HELP US , STOP THIS DICTATOR FROM KILLING ANY MORE INNECANT IRAQIES AND AMERICANS FOR HIS PLEASURE .. PLEASE HELP
As A American CURRENTY SERVING IN YOUR ARMED SERVICES ONLY ABOUT 135000 OF US WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND OUR PRESIDENT TO PLEASE STOP MURDERING US , PLEASE SIR STOP MURDERING YOUR OWN TROOPS AND AMERICANS , PLEASE STOP ..
LISTEN TO ME : AS COMMANDER AND CHIEF I ORDER YOU TO STOP YOUR CRYING AND GET BACK TO FIGHTING , AND IF YOU DONT FIGHT , THAN I WILL COURT MARSHALL YOU .
SO GET BACK IN THERE AND DIE FOR ME AND CHENEY , ROVE , RICE , RUMSFELD ..WE HAVEN'T MADE ENOUGH MONEY YET .
EXTRA EXTRA - COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
REFUSSES TO FUND HIS TROOPS ...
EXTRA EXTRA - WE THE PEOPLE FIND THE COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND PRESIDENT GUILTY AS CHARGE FOR DARRALECTION OF DUTY .
TO PROTECT OUR TROOPS IN A TIME OF WAR .
BY VETOING THE BILL THAT CONGRESS APPROVE FOR YOU AS COMMANDER AND CHIEF OF OUR ARMED FORCES KNOWENLY AND PURPOSLY TURN DOWN THE FUNDS THAT ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR TROOPS ..YOU ARE HEREBY ARRESTED AND WILL BE TRIED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .....
AMERICA DISMISSES ANYTHING AND ALL THAT IS SAID FROM ANYONE IN THE WHITEHOUSE ....
AND ALL THAT SUPPORT THIS CRIMMENALS IN THE WHITEHOUSE ARE AS GUILTY AS BUSH IS , CHENY , ROVE , RICE , RUMSFELD THAT STILL HAS A OFFICE AT THE PENTAGON !!!!!

This Pres. Bush remindes us of Nero , Roman Times .
Destroying our reputation , stripping us of our dignity , and robbing us of our pride .
GWB motto is Burn Baby Burn !
Posted by : Richard | May 5 , 2007 11:29:22 AM
Nancy is right .
Bush does have a tin ear to the American people .
Bush thinks he can hide behind the " protecting the troops " theme , but he in fact started a war without adequate plans or preparation for the impacts to America or the troops .
Bush is the elephant in America 's living room .
Bush 's war is a failure and America has paid enough to cover for his failure .
The American people are just waiting for the democratic system to correct Bush 's failure .

How long is this nonsense going on .
All of the
young adults that are dieing are really still
babies .
They think it is an honor to go to war .
This is a conflict that will never be won .
We
always have to stick our nose into everything and
now all the countries hate us .
Bush will go down in history as one of the worst
presidents & instead of bringing our kids home and apologizing to the American people he will keep being stubborn and risk more lives .
Posted by : Marge Ferretto | May 5 , 2007 11:33:10 AM
And could n't Bush have just attached a signing statement stating would ignore those parts he did n't agree with ?
He has often done it before .
If they were legal this would have been legal .
If this one is not legal then neither are all the others .
Was the temptation for political posturing to great to issue the statement and get his money , knowing there would be many opportunities to change things , there always is .
Posted by : Dan Thompson | May 5 , 2007 11:34:29 AM
Better a tin ear than an empty head .
Pelosi and her ilk are fools .
Will the dems bring everyone home immediately in January '09 if they win ?
Not hardly .
Why ?
Because for all the bluster , they know we can't just walk away and leave a vacuum ready made for those who would murder anyone whose religion differs from theirs .

Pelosi summed up the Iraq situation accurately where you noted : " Pelosi questioned whether it was ethical to send troops into war under a false pretense without a strategy for success , without proper equipment and training , and without demanding accountability from the Iraqi government . "
Bush has demonstrated the acumen of a school bully and provided a hotbed for terrorists , without regard for wasting billions of dollars .
Also he is responsible for doing away
with the man who maintained stability in Iraq the only way possible .

I blame everyone who voted in favor of going into Iraq .
Bush , Hilary , Cheney , Pelosi and Carey ... they 're all a bunch of idiots .
Their is no single pereson to point towards .
What makes me a Republican is that the GOP does n't change policies to get votes from the vocal minority or the gay community , they stick to their guns and do what they truly believe is correct .
Dems chase votes for power more now than ever before ...
I think JFK and FDR would roll over in their graves if they saw what became of their party .

Deauthorize ?
Misunderestimated ?
This failed president has given rise to a whole new vocabulary .
Extraordinary renditions is just kidnap .
Advanced interrogation techniques is just torture .
Verbalizing new utterances cannot mask what Bush is .
He is a liar .
Gonzales is a liar .
An attorney general who clearly stated he had nothing do do with attorney removals ... he's just a common liar .
And here is the troubling thing ; he is presently hiding behind a sensationalist agenda in pursuing the internet predator " generation " , ( if you truly believe their " 50,000 of 'em on - line every moment " mularky ) .
There are so few predators out there ... and lets be sensible about this , that police departments across the nation are using beauty pageant girls to do their bidding , wasting BILLIONS of dollars in your tax dollar resources contacting these guys , pretending to be 13 year old bait , grooming them for weeks , months , and in some cases years , and then trot out this as an example that is representative of their true progress .
And Gonzales loves these stories , because it fills a spot on the evening news ... that is not filled by HIM .
In actuality , it 's far easier for him to be at a photo - op of a group of " saved by the feds " school children and their moms , than showing his useless as * up at ANY hearing where he has to answer any question truthfully .

Think about it :
If someone invades this country , I would fight to the end to destroy the aggressors .
That is what some Iraqi 's are doing .
As much as I hate to see our US servicemen getting killed , which are the lucky ones , and thousands of others getting mamed for life , I do n't blame anyone for defending their country .
The people of Iraq were probably better off under the rule of Saddam .
He would not let the people fight amongst themselves as are they are today .
The Iraq Parliment is in this mode now .
No one can agree to the future with their own beliefs on their own religions .
We need the Iraq Parliment to get off their duffs and set some kind of agenda for our military to exit Iraq .

Terrorism takes many forms .
The President talks about terrorists in Iraq and that country ’s stability while here in the U.S. , the media , our scientists , and many members of congress and the senate have been ‘ terrorized ’ into silence , submission and compromise .
The people of the United States have voted -- that is our voice .
If we are so certain that we want to show the rest of the world that democracy is the best route , then compromise is not an option at this point .
When the person in the President ’s position does not listen to the majority vote of the people then we are no longer operating in a democracy .

President Bush is living proof that we need an Amendment to the Constitution which will not allow recovering alcoholics to run for office .
The damage he has sustained to his brain is obvious , since he cannot speak in complete sentences .
Alcoholics Anonymous should use him as a Poster Child to teach kids about the dangers of alcoholism .

That is where Nancy 's tin ear and blind eyes are .
Oddly enough , they , the enemy , think you whiny weenie liberals with your beliefs in nothing represent thought here in the USA .
So when they have knocked off all those of us who are traditional American in thought , they will come for you and you will whine again as they kill you , wondering where your defender Geoge W. Bush is .

the dems have always wanted to cut and run this is not a secert .
but the american people are blind to the danger that " WILL COME " to this country if the insurgents get a strong hold in iraq the twin towers will be only a drop in the pond so to speak to what i feel will happen , then you will hear the american people scream " you should have done more overseas to have stopped this before it ever happened . "
People wake up this is not the era of " Leave it to Beaver " , you have racials that want nothing more in this life than to see Americans dead and dismembered on their tv's .
the dems and 46 % of americans are in a fanasty world where the little butterflys come to them and make them think life is a bed of rose that have no thorns ......... WAKE THE HELL UP PEOPLE ... this are times when people will kill you for your brief in any other god than theirs .
give the troops what the need to outright win this then come home ... STAY THE COURSE !

To all you extremists ( yes democrats )
You say your speaking for the American public ...... Where is the proof ?
I for one would love to see a Special Federal Voring system .
When matters such as the war at at the leve it is today and everyone is pointing fingers saying this and that and everyone is an idiot or stupid or a liar .. we can have a vote by ALL US CITIZENS including ALL OF OUR MILITARY and let US THE AMERICANS decide ... do we stay or do we pull out .
That would SHUT EVERYONE up as We The People would have the FINAL SAY SO !
My Son is on his 2nd tour and says the media here is full of BS and guess what he is a registered Democrat but believes we are doing the right thing it it would be disasterious for us to pull out .
But see theres my opinion and his ... hense all the bikering .
Lets Vote and thats that !
One thing that should change in this country ... let the people ACTUALLY decide !
Thats my point !

" The GOP does n't change it 's policies " ???
You are full of it Tom .
Since when did the Republicans support BIG government ?
That is what they have given us , the biggest in US history .
Since when has Republicans been for fiscal irresponcibility ?
They spend like drunken sailors , no Democrat governement has ever spent like this before .
But the oil companies have never had such profits before in their history , so in that respect , the corporate welfare still goes on , and I guess that is the aspect of the party you love so much .
How about some proper national security ?
Lock down the ports ?
No .
Defend the border ?
No. Secure chemical / nuclear plants ?
No .
All of that was promised by Kerry , but was rejected in the last election .
Go figure .

American 's stand up for your rights , we do not live in a dictatorship .
George Bush created a
war based on lies and deceit .
It is now time for the people to take back their government and the sooner the better .
This used to be a country of great manufacturing pride , where the great majority of our product was manufactured by americans .
The workers shared in this manufacturing of product by receiving a living wage .
Remember when our kids grew up with a parent at home to take care of them , because Dad made enough money to take care of the families needs .
We need to send more of the crooked politicians to jail until they learn that being a crook is not limited to a those who steal out of poverty or ignorance .

Sprint Calls Dorm
My brother ( who is also my roomate ) has always had a unique way of dealing with telephone salespeople .... He talks to them .
and talks and talks and talks ..... It is always very interesting to hear .
One night about mid-night I decided I wanted to hear him do it again , but I was n't aware of any tele - marketers that were planning to call ( especially that late ) , so I decided to play a joke on him and create the call myself .
On Sprint 's web page they have a Call Back feature .
You enter your telephone number and within a few seconds your phone rings .
When you pick it up it says , " Thank you for using Sprint , " you hear one or two rings , and an operator asks how they can help you .
I had them call the room and stepped out in the hall .
Michael figured it must of been me , so he did n't wait long enough to talk to the operator .
However we did get an idea .
Why did we have to use our own number in the call back feature ?
It suddenly occured to us that this could the means of a very interesting prank .
We tried telling it to call Dave down the hall .
As it was calling , we went and stood outside his room .
Since both Dave and the operator thought the other person had placed the call it was pretty funny .
Dave had just gotten a new Sprint Phone card , so he thought they were calling about that .
The operator thought Dave was calling with a question about the phone card .
When they finally realized that they really did n't want to talk to each other , Dave told the operator to have a good evening and they hung up .
( Dave is very polite . )
The joke on Dave turned out good , so we went back to the room and called the number across the hall from Dave .
That conversation did n't last very long , but the guy came out of his room and told Dave about the weird call he had just received from Sprint .
We called Dave 's room again , but as soon as he picked up with the first operator we reset the Call Back page and entered his number again .
He was talking with the operator saying that this was the second call he had received that night when he got a call on the second line .
He asked the operator to hang on and switched over only to find yet another Sprint operator on the phone .
We heard him yell across the hall , " Sprint is calling me while they 're already on the phone with me ! "
We then called all the people at Dave 's end of the hall who were up .
Most of them had heard the commotion so they knew they were n't the only one to get the call .
Finally about 5 of them decided that a guy named Bryan must be down in the computer lab doing what we were actually doing from our room .
All 5 of them took off down the stairs to find Bryan .
As they were going downstairs we had Sprint call the front desk of our dorm .
Bryan was no where to be found , but they stopped to talk to the desk attendent who said , " The strangest thing just happened ...... "
It was several months before we actually took credit for the prank .
